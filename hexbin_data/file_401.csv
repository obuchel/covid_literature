3263,Review and Meta-Analyses of TAAR1 Expression in the Immune System and Cancers,2018-06-26,"Since its discovery in 2001, the major focus of TAAR1 research has been on its role in monoaminergic regulation, drug-induced reward and psychiatric conditions. More recently, TAAR1 expression and functionality in immune system regulation and immune cell activation has become a topic of emerging interest. Here, we review the immunologically-relevant TAAR1 literature and incorporate open-source expression and cancer survival data meta-analyses. We provide strong evidence for TAAR1 expression in the immune system and cancers revealed through NCBI GEO datamining and discuss its regulation in a spectrum of immune cell types as well as in numerous cancers. We discuss connections and logical directions for further study of TAAR1 in immunological function, and its potential role as a mediator or modulator of immune dysregulation, immunological effects of psychostimulant drugs of abuse, and cancer progression.","Fleischer, Lisa M.; Somaiya, Rachana D.; Miller, Gregory M.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6029583/,401

STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study of newborns undergoing positive-pressure ventilation, we calculated coherence between continuous mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy hemoglobin difference (HbD). Significant HbD–MAP coherence indicated cerebral pressure passivity. CBV changes were measured as the spectral power of total hemoglobin (S(HbT)) at the ventilator frequency. A regression model tested whether S(HbT) predicts cerebral pressure passivity and/or death/brain injury, controlling for birth gestational age and other factors. RESULTS: We studied 68 subjects with prematurity (n = 19), congenital heart disease (n = 11), and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (n = 38). S(HbT), sedative use, and pCO(2) were positively associated, and circulating hemoglobin negatively associated, with cerebral pressure passivity (p < 0.001), which was positively associated with brain injury (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In sick newborns, ventilator-related CBV fluctuations may predispose to cerebral pressure passivity, which may predispose to an adverse neonatal outcome.","Govindan, Vedavalli; Govindan, Rathinaswamy; Massaro, An N.; Al-Shargabi, Tareq; Andescavage, Nickie N.; Vezina, Gilbert; Murnick, Jonathan; Wang, Yunfei; Metzler, Marina; Cristante, Caitlin; Swisher, Christopher; Reich, Daniel; Plessis, Adre du",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224055/,401
11763,Addendum to: Risk Stratification and Personal Protective Equipment Use in Pediatric Endoscopy During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Single-center Protocol,2020-04-22,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are over-represented in major disease pathways and have attracted significant interest in understanding if and how they may be targeted using small molecules for therapeutic purposes. While most existing studies have focused on extending the traditional structure-centric drug design strategies and emphasized exploring pre-existing structure features of IDPs for specific binding, several examples have also emerged to suggest that small molecules could achieve specificity in binding IDPs and affect their function through dynamic and transient interactions. These dynamic interactions can modulate the disordered conformational ensemble and often lead to modest compaction to shield functionally important interaction sites. Much work remains to be done on further elucidation of the molecular basis of the dynamic small molecule–IDP interaction and determining how it can be exploited for targeting IDPs in practice. These efforts will rely critically on an integrated experimental and computational framework for disordered protein ensemble characterization. In particular, exciting advances have been made in recent years in enhanced sampling techniques, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU)-computing, and protein force field optimization, which have now allowed rigorous physics-based atomistic simulations to generate reliable structure ensembles for nontrivial IDPs of modest sizes. Such de novo atomistic simulations will play crucial roles in exploring the exciting opportunity of targeting IDPs through dynamic interactions.","Chen, Jianlin; Liu, Xiaorong; Chen, Jianhan",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7277182/,401
12121,Effects of Transcutaneous Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation on Swallowing Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020-03-21,"Well-defined linear and multi-arm star polymer structures were used as the templates for in situ synthesis and stabilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). This approach led to hybrid nanomaterials with high stability and antibacterial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. The ecologically friendly so called “green” synthesis of nanomaterials was performed through AgNPs preparation in the aqueous solutions of star and linear poly(N,N′-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)s (PDMAEMAs); the process was followed with time. The size, shape, and zeta potential of the obtained hybrids were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the antibacterial activity of PDMAEMA hybrid nanomaterial against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated and assessed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biocidal concentration (MBC). Completely quaternized with ethyl bromide, star and linear PDMAEMAs were used in comparative biological tests. The modification of the polymers with in situ-formed AgNPs increased the antibacterial properties against all studied strains of bacteria by several times in comparison to non-modified polymers and quaternized polymers. These results yield novel nanohybrid materials that can be useful for applications in medicine and biology.","Teper, Paulina; Sotirova, Anna; Mitova, Violeta; Oleszko-Torbus, Natalia; Utrata-Wesołek, Alicja; Koseva, Neli; Kowalczuk, Agnieszka; Mendrek, Barbara",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372353/,401

In Tunisia, the epidemiological status of hepatits A virus is currently unknown. However, over the past years higher numbers of symptomatic hepatitis A virus infection in school attendants and several outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health, especially from regions with the lowest socio-economic levels in the country. The aim of this study was to investigate the current seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus antibodies in central-west Tunisia and assess the impact of hepatitis A virus vaccination on hepatitis A epidemiology. METHODS: Serum samples from 1379 individuals, aged 5–75 years, were screened for hepatitis A virus antibodies. Adjusted seroprevalence, incidence and force of infection parameters were estimated by a linear age structured SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. A vaccine model was then constructed to assess the impact on hepatitis A virus epidemiology of 3 scenarios of vaccination strategies: one dose at 12-months of age, one dose at 6-years and one dose at 12-months and another at 6-years of age during 6 years. RESULTS: A rapid increase in anti-hepatitis A virus seroprevalence was noted during infancy and adolescence: 47% of subjects under 10-years-old are infected; the prevalence increases to 77% at 15-years and reaches 97% in subjects aged 30-years. The force of infection is highest between 10 and 30-years of age and the incidence declines with increasing age. The vaccine model showed that the 3-scenarios lead to a significant reduction of the fraction of susceptibles. The two doses scenario gives the best results. Single-dose vaccination at 6-years of age provides more rapid decrease of disease burden in school-aged children, as compared to single-dose vaccination at 12-months, but keeps with a non-negligible fraction of susceptibles among children < 6-years. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the epidemiological switch from high to intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A virus in Tunisia and provides models that may help undertake best decisions in terms of vaccinations strategies.","Ayouni, Kaouther; Naffeti, Bechir; Ben Aribi, Walid; Bettaieb, Jihène; Hammami, Walid; Ben Salah, Afif; Ammar, Hamadi; Ben Miled, Slimane; Triki, Henda",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477833/,401
13063,Systematic review of modifiable risk factors shows little evidential support for most current practices in Cryptosporidium management in bovine calves,2020-09-30,"INTRODUCTION: About 30% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome become ventilator dependent, of whom roughly 75% develop pneumonia. This trial aimed at assessing the impact of early mechanical ventilation (EMV) on pneumonia occurrence in GBS patients. We hypothesize that EMV will reduce the incidence of pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial performed on two parallel groups. 50 intensive care unit adults admitted for Guillain-Barré syndrome and at risk for acute respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to early mechanical ventilation via face-mask or endotracheal intubation owing to the presence or absence of impaired swallowing (experimental arm), or to conventional care (control arm). The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia up to intensive care unit discharge (or 90 days, pending of which occurred first). FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients were randomized in each group. There was no significant difference between groups for the incidence of pneumonia (10/25 (40%) vs 9/25 (36%), P = 1). There was no significant difference between groups for the time to onset of pneumonia (P = 0.50, Gray test). During follow-up, there were 16/25 (64%) mechanically ventilated patients in the control group, and 25/25 (100%) in the experimental arm (P < 000·1). The time on ventilator was non-significantly shorter in the experimental arm (14 [7; 29] versus 21.5 [17.3; 35.5], P = 0.10). There were no significant differences between groups for length of hospital stay, neurological scores, the proportion of patients who needed tracheostomy, in-hospital death, or any serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study including adults with Guillain-Barré syndrome at high risk of respiratory failure, we did not observe a prevention of pneumonia with early mechanical ventilation.

14314,Clinicians’ Perceptions of the Appropriateness of Neurocritical Care for Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): A Qualitative Study,2020-12-02,"Mammarenaviruses are a diverse genus of emerging viruses that include several causative agents of severe viral hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality in humans. Although these viruses share many similarities, important differences with regard to pathogenicity, type of immune response, and molecular mechanisms during virus infection are different between and within New World and Old World viral infections. Viruses rely exclusively on the host cellular machinery to translate their genome, and therefore to replicate and propagate. miRNAs are the crucial factor in diverse biological processes such as antiviral defense, oncogenesis, and cell development. The viral infection can exert a profound impact on the cellular miRNA expression profile, and numerous RNA viruses have been reported to interact directly with cellular miRNAs and/or to use these miRNAs to augment their replication potential. Our present study indicates that mammarenavirus infection induces metabolic reprogramming of host cells, probably manipulating cellular microRNAs. A number of metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, d-Glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and pools of several amino acids were impacted by the predicted miRNAs that would no longer regulate these pathways. A deeper understanding of mechanisms by which mammarenaviruses handle these signaling pathways is critical for understanding the virus/host interactions and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, through the inhibition of specific pathologic metabolic pathways.","Fernandes, Jorlan; Miranda, Renan Lyra; de Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio; Guterres, Alexandro",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709035/,401
17358,"Homelessness, unstable housing, and risk of HIV and hepatitis C virus acquisition among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2021-03-26,"An update on the African swine fever (ASF) situation in the 10 affected Member States (MS) in the EU and in two neighbouring countries from the 1 September 2019 until the 31 August 2020 is provided. The dynamics of the proportions of PCR‐ and ELISA‐positive samples since the first ASF detection in the country were provided and seasonal patterns were investigated. The impact of the ASF epidemic on the annual numbers of hunted wild boar in each affected MS was investigated. To evaluate differences in the extent of spread of ASF in the wild boar populations, the number of notifications that could be classified as secondary cases to a single source was calculated for each affected MS and compared for the earliest and latest year of the epidemic in the country. To evaluate possible risk factors for the occurrence of ASFV in wild boar or domestic pigs, a literature review was performed. Risk factors for the occurrence of ASF in wild boar in Romanian hunting grounds in 2019 were identified with a generalised linear model. The probability to find at least one PCR‐confirmed ASF case in wild boar in a hunting ground in Romania was driven by environmental factors, wild boar abundance and the density of backyard pigs in the hunting ground area, while hunting‐related variables were not retained in the final model. Finally, measures implemented in white zones (ASF‐free zones that are geographically adjacent to an area where ASF is present in wild boar) to prevent further spread of ASF were analysed with a spatially, explicit stochastic individual‐based model. To be effective, the wild boar population in the white zone would need to be drastically reduced before ASF arrives at the zone and it must be wide enough. To achieve the necessary pre‐emptive culling targets of wild boar in the white zone, at the start of the establishment, the white zone should be placed sufficiently far from the affected area, considering the speed of the natural spread of the disease. This spread is faster in denser wild boar populations. After a focal ASF introduction, the white zone is always close to the infection hence pre‐emptive culling measures in the white zone must be completed in short term, i.e. in a few months.","Desmecht, Daniel; Gerbier, Guillaume; Gortázar Schmidt, Christian; Grigaliuniene, Vilija; Helyes, Georgina; Kantere, Maria; Korytarova, Daniela; Linden, Annick; Miteva, Aleksandra; Neghirla, Ioana; Olsevskis, Edvins; Ostojic, Sasa; Petit, Tom; Staubach, Christoph; Thulke, Hans‐Hermann; Viltrop, Arvo; Richard, Wallo; Wozniakowski, Grzegorz; Cortiñas, José Abrahantes; Broglia, Alessandro; Dhollander, Sofie; Lima, Eliana; Papanikolaou, Alexandra; Van der Stede, Yves; Ståhl, Karl",EFSA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100952/,401
17416,Handgrip strength—a risk indicator for future fractures in the general population: findings from a prospective study and meta-analysis of 19 prospective cohort studies,2020-08-19,"Fast diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax, a collapsed or dropped lung, is crucial to avoid fatalities. Pneumothorax is typically detected on a chest X-ray image through visual inspection by experienced radiologists. However, the detection rate is quite low due to the complexity of visual inspection for small lung collapses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automated detection systems to assist radiologists. Although deep learning classifiers generally deliver high accuracy levels in many applications, they may not be useful in clinical practice due to the lack of high-quality and representative labeled image sets. Alternatively, searching in the archive of past cases to find matching images may serve as a “virtual second opinion” through accessing the metadata of matched evidently diagnosed cases. To use image search as a triaging or diagnosis assistant, we must first tag all chest X-ray images with expressive identifiers, i.e., deep features. Then, given a query chest X-ray image, the majority vote among the top k retrieved images can provide a more explainable output. In this study, we searched in a repository with more than 550,000 chest X-ray images. We developed the Autoencoding Thorax Net (short AutoThorax -Net) for image search in chest radiographs. Experimental results show that image search based on AutoThorax -Net features can achieve high identification performance providing a path towards real-world deployment. We achieved 92% AUC accuracy for a semi-automated search in 194,608 images (pneumothorax and normal) and 82% AUC accuracy for fully automated search in 551,383 images (normal, pneumothorax and many other chest diseases).","Sze-To, Antonio; Riasatian, Abtin; Tizhoosh, H.

17496,Is Hospital Nurse Staffing Legislation in the Public’s Interest?: An Observational Study in New York State,2021-02-25,"The automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease plays an important role in human health, especially in its early stage. Because it is a neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer's disease seems to have a long incubation period. Therefore, it is essential to analyze Alzheimer's symptoms at different stages. In this paper, the classification is done with several methods of machine learning consisting of K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), linear discrimination analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF). Moreover, novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is presented to diagnose Alzheimer's severity. The relationship between Alzheimer's patients' functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) images and their scores on the MMSE is investigated to achieve the aim. The feature extraction is performed based on the robust multitask feature learning algorithm. The severity is also calculated based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score, including low, mild, moderate, and severe categories. Results show that the accuracy of the KNN, SVM, DT, LDA, RF, and presented CNN method is 77.5%, 85.8%, 91.7%, 79.5%, 85.1%, and 96.7%, respectively. Moreover, for the presented CNN architecture, the sensitivity of low, mild, moderate, and severe status of Alzheimer patients is 98.1%, 95.2%,89.0%, and 87.5%, respectively. Based on the findings, the presented CNN architecture classifier outperforms other methods and can diagnose the severity and stages of Alzheimer's disease with maximum accuracy.","Amini, Morteza; Pedram, MirMohsen; Moradi, AliReza; Ouchani, Mahshad",Comput Math Methods Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8100410/,401

METHODS: The m(6)A modification subclasses (m(6)AMS) were identified by unsupervised cluster analysis and three clusters were determined by consensus clustering algorithm in a discovering cohort. Testing and real-world validation cohorts were used to identify predictive responses for immune checkpoint therapies (ICTs) of m(6)AMS. RESULTS: Prognostic implications landscape of m(6)A regulators in cancers and its differential expression levels in ccRCC patients were identified. Based on discovering cohort, ccRCC were automatically divided into three m(6)AMS, and cluster 3 showed significant worse survival than cluster 1/2. Importantly, it was found that the immune checkpoint molecules expression was significantly elevated in cluster 3. Besides, m(6)A score(Low) group (cluster 1&2) have significantly elevated TIDE score compared with m(6)A score(High) group (cluster 3). There was conspicuous tertiary lymphoid tissue, aggressive phenotype, elevated glycolysis, expression of PD-L1, abundance of CD8(+) T cells, CD4(+) FOXP3(+) Treg cells and TCRn immune cells infiltration in the high m(6)A score group. Interestingly, there are significantly increased patients with clinical benefit in m(6)A score(High) group in 368 patients receiving ICTs from testing IMvigor210 (n = 292) and validation FUSCC (n = 55) cohorts.

Data sources: A literature search of Pubmed was performed till May 2020 using the following key terms: opicapone, Ongentys, and BIA 9-1067. Review articles, clinical trials, and drug monographs were reviewed. Study selection and data extraction: Relevant English-language monographs and studies conducted in humans were considered. Data synthesis: Opicapone was FDA approved for the treatment of end-of-motor motor fluctuation in adults with Parkinson’s disease in April 2020 based on two published randomized clinical trials that were 14 to 15 weeks in duration called BIPARK I and BIPARK II. Based on the clinical trials, 50 mg of opicapone once daily was shown to be noninferior to entacapone and reduced the mean off time by about 50 min when compared to placebo. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events were dyskinesia, falls, insomnia, and elevated blood creatine phosphokinase levels. Relevance to patient care and clinical practice: Opicapone overcomes the limitations associated with other COMT inhibitors since it is dosed once daily, well tolerated, and has not been associated with the risk of hepatic failure. When switching from entacapone to opicapone a reduction in “off” time of −39.3 min was also seen. Conclusions: Opicapone is a once daily 3rd generation COMT inhibitor that has the potential to benefit patients with Parkinson’s disease who are experiencing end-of-motor fluctuations.","Greenwood, Jessica; Pham, Huy; Rey, Jose",Clin Park Relat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299985/,401

However, relatively little is known about whether transparency through public reporting significantly influences hospital efficiency despite its emerging expectations for providing value-based care. This study aims to identify the dynamics that transparency brought to the healthcare market regarding hospital technical efficiency, taking the role of competition into account. We compare the two public reporting schemes, All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) and Hospital Compare. Employing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a cross-sectional time-series Tobit regression analysis, we found that APCD is negatively associated with hospital technical efficiency, while hospitals facing less competition responded significantly to increasingly transparent information by enhancing their efficiency relative to hospitals in more competitive markets. We recommend that policymakers take market mechanisms into consideration jointly with the introduction of public reporting schemes in order to produce the best outcomes in healthcare.","Han, Ahreum; Lee, Keon-Hyung",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391365/,401

Cardiac arrest and ALI were associated risk factors for mortality at 6 months after discharge. Although ALI is not significantly associated with VA-ECMO in-hospital mortality, it is a risk factor for mortality at 6 months after discharge, and medical personnel should therefore strive to reduce and avoid ALI.","Li, Xiang; Chen, Guang; Zhang, Sheng; Zheng, Xinting; Zhao, Wenjun; Hong, Dun",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423565/,401
21433,Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Greek Version of the “Full Outline of Unresponsiveness Score”: A Prospective Observational Clinimetric Study in Neurosurgical Patients,2021-09-23,"INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a leading zoonotic disease worldwide with more than 1 million cases in the general population per year. With leptospirosis being an emerging infectious disease and as the world’s environment changes with more floods and environmental disasters, the burden of leptospirosis is expected to increase. The objectives of the systematic review were to explore how leptospirosis affects pregnancy, its burden in this population, its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes and the evidence base surrounding treatment options. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished literature using automated and manual methods to screen nine electronic databases since inception, with no language restriction. Two reviewers independently screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Due to significant heterogeneity and paucity of data, we were unable to carry out a meta-analysis, but we conducted a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the case reports and case series to examine the patient and disease characteristics, diagnostic methods, differential diagnoses, antibiotic treatments, and outcomes of leptospirosis in pregnancy. The protocol for this review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO: CRD42020151501. RESULTS: We identified 419 records, of which we included eight observational studies, 21 case reports, three case series and identified four relevant ongoing studies. Overall the studies were with moderate bias and of ‘fair’ quality. We estimated the incidence of leptospirosis in pregnancy to be 1.3 per 10,000 in women presenting with fever or with jaundice, but this is likely to be higher in endemic areas. Adverse fetal outcomes were found to be more common in pregnant patients who presented in the second trimester compared with patients who presented in the third trimester. There is overlap between how leptospirosis presents in pregnancy and in the general population. There is also overlap between the signs, symptoms and biochemical disturbances associated with leptospirosis in pregnancy and the presentation of pregnancy associated conditions, such as Pre-Eclampsia (PET), Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP Syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets). In 94% of identified cases with available data, there was an indicator in the patient history regarding exposure that could have helped include leptospirosis in the clinician’s differential diagnosis. We also identified a range of suitable antibiotic therapies for treating leptospirosis in pregnancy, most commonly used were penicillins. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review of leptospirosis in pregnancy and it clearly shows the need to improve early diagnosis and treatment by asking early, treating early, and reporting well. Ask early—broaden differential diagnoses and ask early for potential leptospirosis exposures and risk factors. Treat early—increase index of suspicion in pregnant patients with fever in endemic areas and combine with rapid field diagnosis and early treatment. Report well—need for more good quality epidemiological studies on leptospirosis in pregnancy and better quality reporting of cases in literature.","Selvarajah, Sujitha; Ran, Shaolu; Roberts, Nia Wyn; Nair, Manisha",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462732/,401
21757,The Use of Botulinum Toxin A as an Adjunctive Therapy in the Management of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2021-09-10,"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease of the white matter central nervous system occurring in immunocompromised patients particularly those with T cell deficiency such as in HIV, haematological and solid organ malignancies and those taking immunomodulatory medications. PML is caused by JC virus however in rare cases BK virus has been isolated in the cerebral spinal fluid of patients presenting with PML. In this case we describe a 49 year old man who presented to the emergency department with a 2 week history of progressive right sided weakness and dysarthria. His background history included HIV diagnosed in 2005, he had not engaged with care in the past 2 years and had not been taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Other past medical history included untreated hepatitis C. His CD4 count was 90 (11%) cells/mm(3) on admission and his HIV viral load VL) was 141,000 copies/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) showed a hypointense lesion on T1, hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR without diffusion restriction and without mass effect. A lumbar puncture was performed which confirmed JC virus was positive (PCR <50 copies/ml) and also revealed BK virus was positive (PCR 46,511 copies/ml). The patient was commenced on tenofovir alafenamide fumarate/emtricitabine/darunavir/cobicistat in combination with dolutegravir 50mg twice daily. On day 40 post commencement of ART the patient was readmitted with worsening of his right arm weakness and dysarthria. A repeat MRI was performed which showed the hyperdense lesion on T2 and FLAIR appeared slightly larger with some slight enhancement with gadolinium contrast but no other features suggesting PML immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The CD4 count had increased to 141(17%) and HIV VL had decreased to 85 copies/ml. A clinical diagnosis of PML IRIS was made and the patient was commenced on prednisolone 30mg BD which lead to an initial improvement in symptoms. Interestingly in this case, both JC virus and BK virus were detected in the CSF of this patient with the level of JC virus being too low to quantify. BK virus was not detectable on peripheral serum sampling suggesting that BK virus is replicating in the CNS independent of other body sites. There have been 5 case reports in the literature of BK virus as the cause of PML. Testing for BK virus should be considered in patients presenting with signs and symptoms of PML and encephalitis particularly when no other cause is found.","O'Kelly, Brendan; Keane, Amy; Devitt, Emma; Lockhart, Andrew; O'Rourke, Deirdre; Lyons, Fiona",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8474382/,401
26454,Pulmonology,2016-11-16,"Microorganisms produce a variety of different polymers such as polyamides, polysaccharides, and polyesters. The polyesters, the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), are the most extensively studied polymers in regard to their use in display technology. The material properties of bacterial PHAs in combination with their biocompatibility and biodegradability make them attractive substrates for use in display technology applications. By translationally fusing bioactive molecules to a gene encoding a PHA-binding domain, the appropriate functionalization for a given application can be achieved such that the need for chemical immobilization is circumvented. By separately extracting and processing the biopolymer, using it to coat a surface, and then treating this surface with the fusion proteins, surface functionalization for immunodiagnostic microarray or tissue engineering applications can be accomplished. Conversely, by expressing the fusion protein directly in the PHA-producing organisms, one-step production of functionalized beads can be achieved. Such beads have been demonstrated in diverse applications, including fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, microarrays, diagnostic skin test for tuberculosis, vaccines, protein purification, and affinity bioseparation.","Rehm, Fabian B.

In response, governments are adopting emergency economic measures to provide households with some safety net. We provide an overview of the policies that could form a comprehensive social protection strategy in low-income and middle-income countries, with examples of specific policies that have been adopted. Our core argument is that these countries can cast an emergency safety net with extensive coverage if they use a broader patchwork of solutions than higher-income countries. These strategies could include expanding their social insurance system, building on existing social assistance programmes, and involving local governments and non-state institutions to identify and assist vulnerable groups who are otherwise harder to reach.","Gerard, François; Imbert, Clément; Orkin, Kate",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499734/,401
39977,Diagnostic value of abdominal sonography in confirmed COVID-19 intensive care patients,2020-09-29,"BACKGROUND: Prophylactic strategies are urgently needed for prevention of severe inflammatory responses to respiratory viral infections. Bacterial-host interactions may modify the immune response to viral infections. METHODS: We examined the contribution of Intranasal administration of two different Bifidobacterium longum strains or its isolated cell wall in controlling viral induced inflammation using a murine model of influenza infection. We monitored mortality and morbidity over a 10-day period and viral load, differential broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid inflammatory cell counts, Lung tissue histology, BAL and serum cytokines, markers of vascular damage and cell death were quantified. FINDINGS: Intranasal administration of Bifidobacterium longum35624® or its isolated cell wall prior to virus inoculation significantly reduced viral load within the lungs and significantly improved survival. Reduced viral load was associated with reduced lung injury as suggested by cell death and vascular leakage markers, a shift from neutrophil to macrophage recruitment, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (including IL-6), reduced type 1 and 2 interferon levels, but increased levels of interferon-λ and surfactant protein D. These protective effects were maintained when the bifidobacterial cell wall preparation was administered 24 h after viral inoculation. The protective effects were also observed for the Bifidobacterium longumPB-VIR™ strain. INTERPRETATION: Exposure to these bifidobacterial strains protect against the inflammatory sequelae and damage associated with uncontrolled viral replication within the lung.

In TTF opening, Device Support Specialist (DSS) should explain how to use it for the patient and family. However no DSS does always stay in our Yamaguchi prefecture, and DSS has to come to our hospital across other prefectures. On the other hand, COVID-19 infection is still spreading and it is sometimes tough to move from a big city to countryside. Here, we would present the first experience of TTF opening with online DSS support. A case report: A 68 years old man had right hemiparesis. MRI showed multiple lesions in the left hemisphere, and biopsy showed glioblastoma. After 1 month from chemo and radiotherapy, TTF was introduced. DSS from Tokyo explained how to use TTF via PC camera with TV monitor. A skilled neurosurgeon and special nurse also helped them in front of him. His head and the attached array were well checked from DSS with PC camera moving around him. Everything was smooth and he started TTF. Conclusion: Online medicine should be absolutely spreading.

This sensor combines a hybrid fluidic-optronic CMOS (holed retina) that is able to record a specific irradiance pattern scattered by an illuminated particle (scattering signature), while enabling the circulation of particles toward the sensing area. The holed retina is optically coupled with a monolithic, millimeter-sized, refracto-reflective optical system. The latter notably performs an optical pre-processing of signatures, with a very wide field of view of scattering angles. This improves the sensitivity of the sensors, and simplifies image processing. We report the precise design methodology for such a sensor, as well as its fabrication and characterization using calibrated polystyrene beads. Finally, we discuss its ability to characterize particles and its potential for further miniaturization and integration.","Jobert, Gabriel; Barritault, Pierre; Fournier, Maryse; Monpeurt, Cyrielle; Boutami, Salim; Jamois, Cécile; Bernasconi, Pietro; Lovera, Andrea; Braga, Daniele; Seassal, Christian",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8124938/,401

The correlations between entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students, IEE in colleges, IPE, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy are analyzed with the Spearman correlation and linear regression. The hierarchical regression analysis is used to analyze the intermediary role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy in IEE, IPE in colleges, and entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students. The results show that the entrepreneurial psychological quality of college students is significantly different in gender, family location, and grade level (p < 0.05); the main channels of IPE and daily IPE have significant positive effects on the positive entrepreneurship psychological quality (p < 0.05), and have extremely significant positive effects on the entrepreneurial self-efficacy (p < 0.001); innovation and entrepreneurship course, innovation and entrepreneurship practices, innovation and entrepreneurship environment, and total score of IEE have significant positive correlations with positive entrepreneurship psychological quality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of college students (p < 0.05); and the intermediary effect of entrepreneurial self-efficacy accounts for 33.49% on the IPE and entrepreneurial psychological quality, and 41.85% on IEE and entrepreneurial psychological quality.

53215,470 Could Covid-19 Change the Way We Do Clinics for The Better? A Comparison of Remote Versus Outpatient Clinic Follow-Up for Surgical Patients: A Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials,2021-05-04,"Case: A 57 year old man with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue with complete response to chemoradiation was found unresponsive with a reading of “low” by a POC glucometer. He was treated with an IV dextrose bolus but had recurrent hypoglycemia requiring a continuous dextrose infusion. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, acute hepatitis (elevated liver enzymes), and acute kidney injury (elevated serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Other labs: elevated TSH 8.44 uIU/mL, normal AM cortisol 16.4 ug/dl. A 5.1 cm mass was discovered in the left lung with bilateral nodules, biopsi revealed SCC of unclear origin (either lung or metastatic disease from prior tongue cancer). He was malnourished from prior cancer related dysphagia and nutritional supplements were added. Despite this and improvement in liver and kidney function, he had persistent hypoglycemia. He became hypoglycemic within 4-hrs while performing a 72-hr fast with labs: serum glucose 45 mg/dL, insulin &lt 2 uU/mL, c-peptide &lt 0.1 ng/mL, proinsulin &lt 4 pmol/L, beta hydroxybutyrate 0.17 mmol/L, IGF1 &lt 16 ng/mL (ref: 50 - 317), IGF2 147 ng/mL (ref: 267-616), negative hypoglycemia panel and insulin antibody. This was consistent with a paraneoplastic hypoglycemia known as non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). To discontinue the dextrose infusion, he was started on prednisone 20 mg daily titrated up to 60 mg daily, intermittent tube feeds and palliative chemotherapy. With this, hypoglycemia improved, and the dextrose infusion was discontinued. Unfortunately, he had ischemic bowel perforation leading to cardiac arrest and death. Discussion: Our patient had NICTH as suggested by the 72-hr fast (non-insulin mediated hypoglycemia, IGF2/IG1 ratio &gt 10) and the presence of a tumor. It is mediated by tumor-produced IGF-2 causing increased glucose utilization, decreased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and ketogenesis. Curiously, IGF-2 may not be elevated if the tumor produces a partially processed “big IGF-2” for which there is no commercial assay. Instead, an IGF2/IGF1 ratio close to or more 10 is indicative of NICTH. Mesenchymal and hepatic tumors are the most common cause of this rare entity with an incidence of one per million people years. A literature search showed very few reports of SCC-mediated-NICTH, with one case of esophageal SCC. Our patients’ primary tumor was undetermined (lung vs tongue) - but in either case this could be a novel association. A multidisciplinary approach is required centered around the tumor (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation). High dose prednisone 30 to 60 mg daily can be used in the interim as it decreases IGF-2 but is not always successful. Recombinant hGH and glucagon are alternatives or can be combined with steroids. In summary IGF2/IGF1 ratio should be calculated, palliative tumor directed therapy should be initiated with prednisone and supplemental nutrition as adjuncts.","Murati, Jonila; Reddy, Niyoti; Knapp, Philip E; Alexanian, Sara",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135269/,401

Fasting consists of the catabolism of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to maintain blood glucose levels in a normal range. The action mechanisms of fasting were firstly understood in minor organisms and later in humans. Nutritional interventions of caloric restriction could attenuate age-associated epigenetic alterations and could have a protective effect against cellular alterations, promoting longevity and health span. While most fasting studies point out the weight and fat mass decreases, it is important to define specific guidelines for fasting and non-fasting days to enhance adherence, minimize the dropout rates of the interventions, and maximize body composition improvement. Although the panorama of evidence on fasting and caloric restriction is wide, there is a lack of a safe fasting protocol to guide physicians in its prescription. The main goal is to identify a how to use guide, a major posology of fasting, inserted within a huge dietetic personalized strategy leading to an optimal and healthy nutritional status.","Attinà, Alda; Leggeri, Claudia; Paroni, Rita; Pivari, Francesca; Dei Cas, Michele; Mingione, Alessandra; Dri, Maria; Marchetti, Marco; Di Renzo, Laura",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151159/,401

Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death after severe trauma. Traumatic hemorrhagic shock (THS) is a complex phenomenon associating an absolute hypovolemia secondary to a sudden and significant extravascular blood loss, tissue injury, and, eventually, hypoxemia. These phenomena are responsible of secondary injuries such as coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, microcirculation failure, inflammation, and immune activation. Collectively, these dysfunctions lead to secondary organ failures and multi-organ failure (MOF). The development of MOF after severe trauma is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, where immunological dysfunction plays a central role. Damage-associated molecular patterns induce an early and exaggerated activation of innate immunity and a suppression of adaptive immunity. Severe complications are associated with a prolonged and dysregulated immune–inflammatory state. The current challenge in the management of THS patients is preventing organ injury, which currently has no etiological treatment available. Modulating the immune response is a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing the complications of THS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells found in a large number of adult tissues and used in clinical practice as therapeutic agents for immunomodulation and tissue repair. There is growing evidence that their efficiency is mainly attributed to the secretion of a wide range of bioactive molecules and extracellular vesicles (EVs). Indeed, different experimental studies revealed that MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) could modulate local and systemic deleterious immune response. Therefore, these new cell-free therapeutic products, easily stored and available immediately, represent a tremendous opportunity in the emergency context of shock. In this review, the pathophysiological environment of THS and, in particular, the crosstalk between the immune system and organ function are described. The potential therapeutic benefits of MSCs or their EVs in treating THS are discussed based on the current knowledge. Understanding the key mechanisms of immune deregulation leading to organ damage is a crucial element in order to optimize the preparation of EVs and potentiate their therapeutic effect.","Valade, Guillaume; Libert, Nicolas; Martinaud, Christophe; Vicaut, Eric; Banzet, Sébastien; Peltzer, Juliette",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511792/,401

However, there is a paucity of published research on community pharmacy-based activities in antimicrobial stewardship, and views and perceptions of the community pharmacy team on their role in antimicrobial stewardship. Objective To explore views and experiences of community pharmacy teams across Scotland on antimicrobial stewardship, activities related to European Antibiotic Awareness Day, and a self-help guide to treating infection. Setting Community pharmacy, Scotland. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of community pharmacy team members over a six week period between November and December in 2016. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and data analysed thematically using the framework approach. Main outcome measure Views and perceptions of antimicrobial stewardship and European Antibiotic Awareness Day activities and role of the pharmacy team. Results Twenty-seven participants were interviewed-20 pharmacists, five pharmacy graduates completing their pre-registration year, and members of the pharmacy support team including two pharmacy technicians and one medicines counter assistant. They were working mainly in urban areas and across five regions of Scotland. Most were aware of antimicrobial stewardship but some were not familiar with the term. Participants identified roles for the community pharmacy team in antimicrobial stewardship including the importance of the pharmacy as a first port of call for self-care advice. Some participants, including pharmacists, showed lack of awareness of European Antibiotic Awareness Day; those who were aware thought it may not have the desired impact on educating the public. Most participants, irrespective of role within the team, were not familiar with the self-help guide but they perceived this as a useful resource for the pharmacy team. Conclusion The participants recognised and identified roles for the community pharmacist within antimicrobial stewardship.

It is critical to establish their long-term imaging efficacy, as well as biodistribution. This work shows that 500 nm Fe-SiO2 nanoshells can be imaged by color Doppler ultrasound over the course of 10 days in Py8119 tumor bearing mice. The 500 nm nonbiodegradable SiO2 and biodegradable Fe-SiO2 nanoshells were functionalized with diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) ligand and radiolabeled with (111)In(3+) for biodistribution studies in nu/nu mice. The majority of radioactivity was detected in the liver and kidneys following intravenous (IV) administration of nanoshells to healthy animals. By contrast, after nanoshells were injected intratumorally, most of the radioactivity remained at the injection site; however, some nanoshells escaped into circulation and were distributed similarly as those given intravenously. For intratumoral delivery of nanoshells and IV delivery to healthy animals, little difference was seen between the biodistribution of SiO2 and biodegradable Fe-SiO2 nanoshells. However, when nanoshells were administered IV to tumor bearing mice, a significant increase was observed in liver accumulation of SiO2 nanoshells relative to biodegradable Fe-SiO2 nanoshells. Both SiO2 and Fe-SiO2 nanoshells accumulate passively in proportion to tumor mass, during intravenous delivery of nanoshells. This is the first report of the biodistribution following intratumoral injection of any biodegradable silica particle, as well as the first report demonstrating the utility of DTPA-(111)In labeling for studying silica nanoparticle biodistributions.","Liberman, Alexander; Wu, Zhe; Barback, Christopher V; Viveros, Robert; Blair, Sarah L; Ellies, Lesley G; Vera, David R; Mattrey, Robert F; Kummel, Andrew C; Trogler, William C",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/nn402507d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23802554/,401
62218,"Exploring autonomic regulation in children with ADHD with and without comorbid anxiety disorder through three systematic levels of cardiac vagal control analysis: Rest, reactivity, and recovery.",2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power. METHODS A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions. RESULTS Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249. CONCLUSIONS A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.","Chaisinanunkul, Napasri; Adeoye, Opeolu; Lewis, Roger J; Grotta, James C; Broderick, Joseph; Jovin, Tudor G; Nogueira, Raul G; Elm, Jordan J; Graves, Todd; Berry, Scott; Lees, Kennedy R; Barreto, Andrew D; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.008547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26138130/,401

Ferrets ( Mustela putorius furo) serve as valuable animal models for human diseases such as cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary diseases, and may be a useful model of other diseases including pancreatitis. We developed and analytically validated a competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for measurement of TLI in ferret serum by determination of analytical sensitivity, assay linearity, accuracy of spiking recovery, precision, and reproducibility. Analytical sensitivity of the assay was 0.55 μg/L. Observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio for dilutional parallelism was 90.2-127.9% (mean: 108.1 ± 11.9%). The O/E ratio for spiking recovery was 94.5-113.0% (mean: 103.9 ± 7.2%). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 2.7-5.7% and 3.5-8.2%, respectively. The reference interval (RI) for serum TLI derived from 31 healthy ferrets was 28-115 μg/L; the 90% confidence interval for the lower and upper limits of the RI were 10.0-32.1 μg/L and 103-126 μg/L, respectively. This TLI RIA is analytically sensitive, sufficiently linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for the measurement of TLI in ferret serum samples.","Bridges, Cory S; Miller, Pamela S; Lidbury, Jonathan A; Suchodolski, Jan S; Yi, Yaling; Engelhardt, John F; Steiner, Jörg M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638718774387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29717637/,401
62947,Neurological symptoms in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and their association with in-hospital mortality.,2021-05-26,"OBJECTIVE We aimed to present a review of renal changes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify original articles regarding clinical, laboratory, and anatomopathological kidney changes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 published until May 7, 2020. The search was carried out across PubMed, Scopus, and Embase using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""kidney injury"" and ""kidney disease"". Fifteen studies presented clinical and laboratory renal changes in patients with COVID-19, and three addressed anatomopathological changes. DISCUSSION Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a relevant finding in patients with COVID-19. There were also significant changes in laboratory tests that indicated kidney injury, such as increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, and hematuria. The presence of laboratory abnormalities and AKI were significant in severely ill patients. There was a considerable prevalence of AKI among groups of patients who died of COVID-19. Histopathological analysis of the kidney tissue of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus may directly affect the kidneys. CONCLUSION Although COVID-19 affects mainly the lungs, it can also impact the kidneys. Increased serum creatinine and BUN, hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI were frequent findings in patients with severe COVID-19 and were related to an increased mortality rate. Further studies focusing on renal changes and their implications for the clinical condition of patients infected with the novel coronavirus are needed.","Nogueira, Samuel Átila Rodrigues; Oliveira, Samuel Ciríaco Silva de; Carvalho, Ana Flávia Moreira de; Neves, Julia Moreira Cavalcante; Silva, Leila Silveira Vieira da; Silva Junior, Geraldo Bezerra da; Nobre, Maria Elizabeth Pereira",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.s2.112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965368/,401
63373,"The Hip Fracture Surgery in Elderly Patients (HIPELD) study: protocol for a randomized, multicenter controlled trial evaluating the effect of xenon on postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.",2012,"AIM Our study aimed at filling the fundamental knowledge gap on the characteristics of regional brain oxygen saturation (rSO2) levels in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients with or without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) upon arrival at the hospital for estimating the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and neurological prognostication in these patients. METHODS We enrolled 1921 OHCA patients from the Japan - Prediction of Neurological Outcomes in Patients Post-cardiac Arrest Registry and measured their rSO2 immediately upon arrival at the hospital by near-infrared spectroscopy using two independent forehead probes (right and left). We also assessed the percentage of patients with a good neurological outcome (defined as cerebral performance categories 1 or 2) 90 days post cardiac arrest. RESULTS After 90 days, 79 (4%) patients had good neurological outcomes and a median lower rSO2 level of 15% (15-20%). Compared to patients without ROSC upon arrival at the hospital, those with ROSC had significantly higher rSO2 levels (56% [39-65%] vs. 15% [15-17%], respectively; P<0.01), and significantly correlated right- and left-sided regional brain oxygen saturation levels (R=0.94 vs. 0.66, respectively). In both groups, the percentage of patients with a good 90-day neurological outcome increased significantly in proportion to their rSO2 levels upon arrival at the hospital (P<0.01). CONCLUSION Our data indicate that measuring rSO2 levels might be effective for both monitoring the quality of resuscitation and neurological prognostication in patients with OHCA.","Nishiyama, Kei; Ito, Noritoshi; Orita, Tomohiko; Hayashida, Kei; Arimoto, Hideki; Abe, Mitsuru; Unoki, Takashi; Endo, Tomoyuki; Murai, Akira; Ishikura, Ken; Yamada, Noriaki; Mizobuchi, Masahiro; Anan, Hideaki; Watanabe, Tomorou; Yasuda, Hideto; Homma, Yosuke; Shiga, Kazuhiro; Tokura, Michiaki; Tsujimura, Yuka; Hatanaka, Tetsuo; Nagao, Ken",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215479/,401

The prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases in patients with COVID19 is high and this dreadful combination dictates poor prognosis along with the higher risk of intensive care mortality. In the setting of chronic heart failure, SARS-CoV-2 can be responsible for myocardial injury and acute decompensation through various mechanisms. Given the clinical and epidemiological complexity of COVID-19, patiens with heart failure may require particular care since the viral infection has been identified, considering an adequate re-evaluation of medical therapy and a careful monitoring during ventilation.","Sisti, Nicolò; Valente, Serafina; Mandoli, Giulia Elena; Santoro, Ciro; Sciaccaluga, Carlotta; Franchi, Federico; Cameli, Paolo; Mondillo, Sergio; Cameli, Matteo",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732260/,401

These vertebrates, combined, comprise about 15,225 species; only about 899 (5.8%) of them have been surveyed for coccidia and 1,946 apicomplexan valid species names or other forms are recorded in the literature. Based on these compilations and other factors, I extrapolated that there yet may be an additional 31,381 new apicomplexans still to be discovered in just these 12 vertebrate groups. Extending the concept to all of the other extant vertebrates on Earth; i.e. lizards (6,300 spp.), rodents plus 12 minor orders of mammals (3,180 spp.), birds (10,000 spp.), and fishes (33,000 spp.) and, conservatively assuming only two unique apicomplexan species per each vertebrate host species, I extrapolate and extend my prediction that we may eventually find 135,000 new apicomplexans that still need discovery and to be described in and from those vertebrates that have not yet been examined for them! Even doubling that number is a significant underestimation in my opinion.","Duszynski, Donald W",Folia parasitologica,https://doi.org/10.14411/fp.2021.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527909/,401

Monte Carlo calculations were performed to gauge the ability to deliver low-dose radiation to the thoracic mid-plane using an orthovoltage machine. In addition, the potential harm of a single dose of 0.75 Gy (whole-lung irradiation) was assessed based on the recommendations of the BEIR-VII committee of the U.S. National Research Council. Based on the results of this work, it was determined that an orthovoltage machine (minimum 300 kVp) can be used to deliver 0.75 Gy dose to the lungs while respecting cutaneous tolerance. Using data from the BEIR-VII Committee, it is evident that the apparent benefits of such radiation treatment for patients suffering from severe manifestations of the COVID-19 infectious syndrome outweigh the potential loss of life due to radiation-induced malignancy. Although the vaccination against COVID-19 has become a reality, the spread and mortality in severely ill patients remain unacceptably high. The risk of outbreaks in the future is unknown. We suggest herein that low-dose radiotherapy at the bedside should be rigorously considered as a therapeutic option since it appears to be feasible and safe in the short and long term.","Soyfer, Viacheslav; Socol, Yehoshua; Bragilovski, Dimitri; Corn, Benjamin W",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-20-00261.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725726/,401

We searched six databases using predetermined search terms which highlighted the broad areas of inertial sensors, gait, and osteoarthritis. Two authors independently conducted title and abstract reviews, followed by two authors independently completing full-text screenings. Study quality was also assessed by two independent raters and data were extracted by one reviewer in areas such as study design, osteoarthritis sample, protocols, and inertial sensor outcomes. A total of 72 articles were included, which studied the gait of 2159 adults with osteoarthritis (OA) using inertial sensors. The most common location of OA studied was the knee (n = 46), followed by the hip (n = 22), and the ankle (n = 7). The back (n = 41) and the shank (n = 40) were the most common placements for inertial sensors. The three most prevalent biomechanical outcomes studied were: mean spatiotemporal parameters (n = 45), segment or joint angles (n = 33), and linear acceleration magnitudes (n = 22). Our findings demonstrate exceptional growth in this field in the last 5 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed patients who underwent thermal ablation for malignant lung tumors after pneumonectomy between 1999 and 2009. Patient demographics, complications, procedural success, and oncologic outcomes were recorded. Technique effectiveness was evaluated at imaging 4-6 weeks after ablation. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate overall survival. A cumulative incidence and competing risk method was used to account for progression-free tumors at the time of patient death. RESULTS Of 619 lung ablations, 17 were performed to treat 13 tumors (nine primary and four metastatic) in 12 patients with a single lung. The median tumor size was 2 cm (range, 1.2-4 cm). Technical success was documented in all 17 cases. Technical effectiveness was documented in 10 of 12 patients. Local tumor progression occurred in five lesions within a median of 12 months (range, 10-22 months) after ablation and was treated with repeat ablation in four lesions. Complications included six (35%) of 17 pneumothoraces requiring thoracostomy. Deaths occurred within 2-12 days after three (19%) of 16 ablation sessions. The median time to primary local tumor progression was 18 months (95% CI, 12 months through not reached), and the median time to assisted (after repeat ablation) local tumor progression was 33 months (95% CI, not reached). Median overall survival was 21 months (95% CI, 18-53 months). After excluding the two early deaths complicating the initial ablation procedure, median overall survival was 37 months. CONCLUSION Thermal ablation can offer local tumor control after pneumonectomy, despite a relatively high postprocedure clinical risk.","Sofocleous, Constantinos T; May, Benjamin; Petre, Elena N; Gonen, Mithat; Thornton, Raymond H; Alago, William; Rizk, Nabil P; Dupuy, Damian E; Solomon, Stephen B",AJR.

In our study, we reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on a community hospital serving an urban region, comparing the sociodemographic distribution of ICU admissions before and during the pandemic. We executed a time-sensitive analysis to see if COVID-19 ICU admissions reflect the regional sociodemographic populations and ICU admission trends before the pandemic. Sociodemographic variables included sex, race, ethnicity, and age of adult patients (ages 18 years and older) admitted to the hospital's medical and cardiac ICUs, which were converted to COVID-19 ICUs. The time period selected was 18 months, which was then dichotomized into pre-COVID-19 admissions (December 1, 2018 to March 13, 2020) and COVID-19 ICU admissions (March 14 to May 31, 2020). Variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon tests when appropriate. During the 18-month period, 1,861 patients were admitted to the aforementioned ICUs. The mean age of the patients was 62.75 (SD 15.57), with the majority of these patients being male (52.23%), White (64.43%), and non-Hispanic/Latinx (95.75%). Differences were found in racial and ethnic distribution comparing pre-COVID-19 admissions to COVID-19 admissions. Compared with pre-COVID-19 ICU admissions, we found an increase in African American versus White admissions (P = .01) and an increase in Hispanic/Latinx versus non-Hispanic/Latinx admissions (P < .01), during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first 3 months of admissions to COVID-19 ICUs, the number of admissions among Hispanic/Latinx and African American patients increased while the number of admissions among non-Hispanic/Latinx and White patient decreased, compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. These findings support development of strategies to enhance allocation of resources to bolster novel, equitable strategies to mitigate the incidence of COVID-19 in urban populations.","Galiatsatos, Panagis; Page, Kathleen R; Chatterjee, Souvik; Maygers, Joyce; Sarker, Sauradeep; Jones, Vanya; Tolson, Tina; Hill-Briggs, Felicia; Chen, Edward S; Golden, Sherita H",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2021.0049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944605/,401

Besides traditional risk factors, it is unknown whether the health deficit burden is related to the appearance of cardiovascular disease. In order to answer this question, the same multidimensional FI looking at 45-health deficits was serially calculated per participant at 4 time periods (0-16, 19-44, 45-54 and 60-64 years) using data from the 1946 Medical Research Council (MRC) British National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD)-the world's longest running longitudinal birth cohort with continuous follow-up. From these the mean and total FI for the life-course, and the step change in deficit accumulation from one time period to another was derived. Echocardiographic data at 60-64 years provided: ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular mass indexed to body surface area (LVmassi, BSA), myocardial contraction fraction indexed to BSA (MCFi) and E/e'. Generalized linear models assessed the association between FIs and echocardiographic parameters after adjustment for relevant covariates. 1375 participants were included. For each single new deficit accumulated at any one of the 4 time periods, LVmassi increased by 0.91-1.44% (p < 0.013), while MCFi decreased by 0.6-1.02% (p < 0.05). A unit increase in FI at age 45-54 and 60-64, decreased EF by 11-12% (p < 0.013). A single health deficit step change occurring between 60 and 64 years and one of the earlier time periods, translated into higher odds (2.1-78.5, p < 0.020) of elevated LV filling pressure. Thus, the accumulation of health deficits at any time period of the life-course associates with a maladaptive cardiac phenotype in older age, dominated by myocardial hypertrophy and poorer function.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Moon, James C; Hardy, Rebecca; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Hughes, Alun D; Captur, Gabriella",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85435-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737563/,401

As a result of increasing social pressure, doctors are at high risk for diseases such as ""sudden death"" and ""overwork death"". It is essential that the physical and mental health of medical staff be assessed and long-term mechanisms be introduced to care for medical staff. This study sought to investigate the health status, work pressure, and occupational environments of medical staff at level A tertiary public hospitals in Shanghai to provide a basis for exploring the establishment of long-term mechanisms for the exquisite and precise care of medical staff. METHODS A questionnaire was administered to employees at 10 level A tertiary public hospitals in Shanghai using a random sampling method; 50 medical staff were surveyed at each hospital. A descriptive analysis of the data was conducted using R language. RESULTS A total of 478 questionnaires were collected; thus, the recovery rate was 95.6%. The analysis revealed that 61% of the medical staff surveyed believed that their health was ""good,"" and 57% believed that they were under high pressure. Over 50% of medical staff were moderately satisfied with their practice environment and salary; however, staff's satisfaction evaluations were affected by their academic qualifications (degrees), work positions, and other factors. Reasonable salary is the primary motivating and demotivating factor. CONCLUSIONS The party organization can play a leading role in contacting and serving employees.

However, barriers to involvement exist. OBJECTIVES We aimed to increase days between PPC consult and death for patients with refractory cancer from a baseline median of 13.5 days to ≥30 days between March 2019 and March 2020. METHODS Outcome measure was days from PPC consult to death; process measure was days from diagnosis to PPC consult. The project team surveyed oncologists to identify barriers. Plan-do-study-act cycles included establishing target diagnoses, offering education, standardizing documentation, and sending reminders. RESULTS The 24-month baseline period included 30 patients who died and 25 newly diagnosed patients. The yearlong intervention period included six patients who died and 16 newly diagnosed patients. Interventions improved outcome and process measures. Targeted patients receiving PPC ≥30 days prior to death increased from 43% to 100%; median days from consult to death increased from 13.5 to 159.5. Targeted patients receiving PPC within 30 days of diagnosis increased from 28% to 63%; median days from diagnosis to consult decreased from 221.5 to 14. Of those without PPC consult ≤ 30 days after diagnosis, 17% had template documentation of the rationale. CONCLUSION Interventions utilized met the global aim, outcome, and process measures. Use of QI methodology empowered providers to involve PPC. Poor template use was a barrier to identifying further drivers.

71518,Corrigendum.,2015,"Purpose Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents with a spectrum of disease severity, the most serious cases requiring intensive care. Echocardiography is a front-line tool in evaluating cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 in the intensive care unit (ICU); we analyzed transthoracic echocardiograms obtained from this patient population with state-of-the-art ultrasound technology. Methods All patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission on whom a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained were included in the study. Focused transthoracic protocols were performed by experienced sonographers. Echocardiographic variables, including speckle-tracking echocardiography, were collected and analyzed. Clinical information was obtained from the electronic medical record. Patients were followed until discharge. Results Of 52 total patients (mean age: 59.9 ± 11.6 years), 59.6% were male and 15 (29%) had known prior cardiac disease. Cardiac complications identified on echocardiography were prevalent, occurring in 55.7% of patients. Patients with known prior cardiac disease were more likely to have new or worsening left ventricular dysfunction. Right ventricular dysfunction was the most common abnormality (assessed qualitatively in 18 cases and with advanced echocardiographic methods in 34 cases). Known prior cardiac disease, right ventricular enlargement, and pulmonary hypertension were significantly associated with morbidity and mortality. Conclusions Patients requiring intensive care for COVID-19 face significant morbidity and mortality, and cardiac complications occur in the majority of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Those with known prior cardiac disease fare worse, and other echocardiographic findings (right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension) are also associated with worse outcomes. State-of-the-art echocardiography performed by experienced sonographers can be critical to identifying cardiac complications and guiding ICU strategy.","Jain, Renuka; Salinas, Pedro D; Kroboth, Stacie; Kaminski, Abigail; Roemer, Sarah; Perez Moreno, Ana Cristina; Khandheria, Bijoy K",Journal of patient-centered research and reviews,https://doi.org/10.17294/2330-0698.1791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511256/,401
71782,"Effects of alteplase on survival after ischaemic stroke (IST-3): 3 year follow-up of a randomised, controlled, open-label trial.",2016,"Cryptosporidium and Giardia are two of the most common enteric pathogens of domestic and wild animals and humans. However, little is known on the prevalence, clinical manifestations and economic and zoonotic significance of these infections in horses. This study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence, excretion patterns and risk factors related to the faecal shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in horses and the zoonotic potential of species/genotypes isolated. The survey was performed on 120 foals and 30 broodmares reared in five Italian farms. Foals were divided in four homogeneous groups of 30 animals each (age classes: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, >8 weeks). Three sequential faecal samples were collected from each animal and analysed by three techniques: direct fluorescent antibody test (DFA), faecal flotation (FF) and stained faecal smears (SFS). The DFA results showed a prevalence of 8% for Cryptosporidium and of 13.33% for Giardia; the prevalence values obtained by FF and SFS were lower and in poor agreement with DFA results. Giardia and Cryptosporidium infections were more common in foals (23.33% and 26.66% respectively) and higher excretions were observed in the youngest foals. Distribution of Cryptosporidium prevalence was statistically related to farms (P < 0.01), age of animals (P < 0.01), but was unrelated to the presence of diarrhoea. In the case of Giardia, the prevalence was only related to age (P < 0.01). Pattern sheddings were related to intestinal diseases and horse age (P < 0.01). Risk factors for shedding included residence farms and age older than 8 weeks for both parasites. All DFA-positive faecal samples were submitted to DNA extraction and PCR to determine Giardia and Cryptosporidium species/genotypes. Sequence analysis of the COWP gene of Cryptosporidium and of the SSU-rRNA gene of Giardia revealed that they were identical to each other and identified Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia duodenalis assemblage E. The potential role of infected horses in zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium was supported by the findings of this study.","Veronesi, F; Passamonti, F; Cacciò, S; Diaferia, M; Piergili Fioretti, D",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2009.01261.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19912609/,401

72651,ACP Journal Club: adding neurovascular thrombectomy to IV t-PA reduced disability in acute ischemic stroke.,2015,"BACKGROUND There has been increasing concern and scrutiny in the use of mesh for certain pelvic organ prolapse procedures. However, mesh erosion was often associated with sites of suture fixation of the mesh to the rectum or vagina. Thus, in response to this finding, we replaced our suture material with absorbable monofilament suture. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of mesh-related complications after laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy, according to the type of suture used in fixation of mesh. DESIGN This was retrospective cohort study. SETTINGS This study was performed at a high-volume, tertiary care center. It was conducted using a prospective database including patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy over a 7-year period. PATIENTS A total of 495 cases were included; 296 (60%) laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexies were performed using a nonabsorbable suture compared with 199 (40%) with an absorbable suture in a case-matched analysis. In addition, 151 cases of laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy with nonabsorbable were matched based on age, sex, and time of follow-up, with an equal number of patients using absorbable monofilament suture. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Primary outcome was symptomatic mesh erosion after rectopexy. Secondary outcomes included other mesh-related complications and/or reoperations. RESULTS The erosion rate was 2% (6/495) in the nonabsorbable suture group, including 4 erosions into the rectum and 2 into the vagina. There was no erosion in the group with absorbable suture. This difference was maintained after matching: after a median follow-up of 6 (12) months, there was no erosion in the absorbable suture group versus 3.3% erosion (n = 5) in the nonabsorbable suture group (p = 0.03). LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS Mesh-related complications are reduced using absorbable sutures compared with nonabsorbable sutures when performing laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy with synthetic mesh without an increase in rectopexy failures.

73114,Comparative repeatability of pancreatic lipase assays in the commercial and in-house laboratory environments.,2020-04-06,"BACKGROUND Patient education is an essential part of management of complex, disabling neurological disorders. Mobile web-based educational materials provide a novel and potentially valuable means to communicate clinical information that can aid in both medical management and rehabilitation. AIMS We, therefore, evaluated an educational tablet-based intervention in three patient cohorts regarding the following topics: Parkinson's disease (PD) medications, dystonia and botulinum toxin treatment. METHODS A total of 50 subjects with PD, 32 with dystonia and 61 receiving botulinum toxin treatment for movement disorders or sialorrhoea were enrolled. Participants in each cohort completed a specific educational module at the time of their regularly scheduled clinic visit, comprising slides, in addition to pre- and post-module quizzes and a satisfaction survey. Additionally, participants in the dystonia and botulinum toxin modules were given a follow-up test at their 3- or 6-month clinical treatment visit. RESULTS There were 143 participants with 50 completing the PD module, 32 completing the dystonia module and 61 completing the botulinum toxin module. All three groups demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge of module content between their pre- and post-module test scores (PD: p=.0001, dystonia: p<.0001 and botulinum toxin: p=.008), and those who took the dystonia module maintained significant improvement at either a 3- or 6-month follow up compared to pre-module (p <.0001). CONCLUSIONS Tablet-based teaching modules are an effective means of communicating key concepts to patients. This study supports their use for improving patient understanding that can support lifelong approaches to managing disabling, neurological conditions.Implication for RehabilitationTablet-based modules are relatively easy to use for enhancing education during clinic visits and can possibly help reduce and maintain disability with chronic conditions like Parkinson's disease and dystonia.Improvements in post-test scores suggested that patient participants were able to retain information from the tablets about their complex and challenging conditions and treatments.Adding patients who are fluent in another language would have made this study more generalizable and future studies exploring educational interventions are warranted to help better tailor interventions to patients with chronic neurologic illnesses to help understand the complex aspects of their medical and rehabilitation therapy.The effect of cognitive changes in neurological conditions and understanding of educational information needs to be further tested.This positive result is especially meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person access to both medical and rehabilitative care has been curtailed.","Hellmers, Natalie; Barkan, Samantha; Auerbach, Gabrielle; Hanineva, Aneliya; Popa, Paul; Sarva, Harini; Henchcliffe, Claire",Disability and rehabilitation.

74238,Efficacy of Miniscrew-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion (MARPE) in late adolescents and adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND The goal of this study was to investigate the association of tracheostomy timing with outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in a national population. METHODS Poor-grade aneurysmal SAH patients were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2002-2011). Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze predictors of tracheostomy timing and multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of timing of intervention with mortality, complications, and discharge to institutional care. Covariates included patient demographics, comorbidities, severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage (measured using the NIS-SAH severity scale), hospital characteristics, and other complications and length of stay. RESULTS The median time to tracheostomy among 1380 poor-grade SAH admissions was 11 (interquartile range: 7-15) days after intubation. The mean number of days from intubation to tracheostomy in SAH patients at the hospital (p < 0.001) was the strongest predictor of tracheostomy timing for a patient, while comorbidities and SAH severity were not significant predictors. Mortality, neurologic complications, and discharge disposition did not differ significantly by tracheostomy time. However, later tracheostomy (when evaluated continuously) was associated with greater odds of pulmonary complications (p = 0.004), venous thromboembolism (p = 0.04), and pneumonia (p = 0.02), as well as a longer hospitalization (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis only found these associations between tracheostomy timing and medical complications in patients with moderately poor grade (NIS-SAH severity scale 7-9), while there were no significant differences by timing of intervention in very poor-grade patients (NIS-SAH severity scale > 9). CONCLUSIONS In this analysis of a large, national data set, variation in hospital practices was the strongest predictor of tracheostomy timing for an individual. In patients with moderately poor grade, later tracheostomy was independently associated with pulmonary complications, venous thromboembolism, pneumonia, and a longer hospitalization, but not with mortality, neurological complications, or discharge disposition. However, tracheostomy timing was not significantly associated with outcomes in very poor-grade patients.","Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Rudy, Robert F; Gormley, William B; Frerichs, Kai U; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali; Du, Rose",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-018-0619-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30298335/,401

This study aimed to examine the safety and feasibility of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic hysterectomy (tVNOTEH) for nonprolapsed uteri in the management of benign gynecological diseases. METHODS Records were reviewed for the 147 consecutive tVNOTEH procedures between April 2011 and October 2013. Age, body mass index, number of vaginal delivery, and specimen weight were used to select comparable patient who had undergone laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH). RESULTS A total of 512 patients were recruited in this study (147 tVNOTEHs and 365 LAVHs, respectively). These patients were stratified into six subgroups according to the uterine weight and type of hysterectomy. There was no incidence of switching to abdominal laparatomy. Length of operation, estimated blood loss (EBL), requirement of blood transfusion, and length of postoperative stay were significantly greater in the LAVH group than in the tVNOTEH group but total hospital charges were higher in the tVNOTEH group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in overall incidence of operative complications between the two groups but more complications in LAVH for uterine weight more than 500 g (4.3 vs. 0 %, p < 0.001); this likely reflects higher hospital charges in this subgroup. Significant linear correlations of uterine weight with operating time and EBL existed in both groups. CONCLUSION tVNOTEH can be safely performed for large and nonprolapsed uterus. Besides, as uterine weight increased, the operative efficiency of tVNOTEH increases compared with LAVH.","Wang, Chin-Jung; Huang, Hui-Yu; Huang, Chen-Ying; Su, Hsuan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3639-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270610/,401

One month earlier the patient had symptoms with headache, fever, dry cough, vomiting and diarrhoea and reduced sense of taste and smell. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 and the symptoms were mainly resolved within three weeks. On admission the patient was disorientated with aphasia. Brain imaging revealed a haemorrhagic infarction in the left temporal lobe due to thrombosis of the left transverse sinus and low-molecular weight heparin was instituted.

Current biomarkers are suboptimal in detecting DILI and predicting its outcome. This study aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the research trends on DILI biomarkers using bibliometric analysis. All relevant publications were extracted from the Web of Science database. An online analysis platform of literature metrology, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder, and CiteSpace software were used to analyze the publication trends. CitNetExplorer was used to construct direct citation networks and VOSviewer was used to analyze the keywords and research hotspots. We found a total of 485 publications related to DILI biomarkers published from 1991 to 2020. Toxicological Sciences had been the most popular journal in this field over the past 30 years. The USA maintained a top position worldwide and provided a pivotal influence, followed by China. Among all the institutions, the University of Liverpool was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. Moreover, Professors Paul B. Watkins and Tsuyoshi Yokoi made great achievements in topic area. We analyzed the citation networks and keywords, therefore identified five and six research hotspot clusters, respectively. We considered the publication information regarding different countries/regions, organizations, authors, journals, et al. by summarizing the literature on DILI biomarkers over the past 30 years. Notably, the subject of DILI biomarkers is an active area of research. In addition, the investigation and discovery of novel promising biomarkers such as microRNAs, keratin18, and bile acids will be future developing hotspots.","Cao, Mingnan; Wang, Li; Zhang, Lin; Duan, Jingli",Science progress,https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211000535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749405/,401

MATERIALS AND METHODS The peer-reviewed literature was searched across seven databases and identified abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers. A thematic synthesis methodology was used to code and synthesise the results from the included studies. RESULTS In total, 7233 abstracts were identified; 31 articles were selected for inclusion, representing 26 physical rehabilitation interventions. The methodological quality of studies was moderate (Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research mean ± standard deviation = 14.39 ± 3.61). The four main themes developed were: (1) Benefits of physical rehabilitation, (2) Challenges of physical rehabilitation, (3) Need for support, and (4) Issue of control. CONCLUSIONS This qualitative thematic synthesis provides key insights into the experiences of individuals with spinal cord injuries who received physical rehabilitation. Recommendations for practice, based on the findings, include creating a diverse, encouraging, and educational physical rehabilitation experience with supportive staff who focus on communication and person-centred care. Implications for Rehabilitation Physical rehabilitation provides psychological as well as physical benefits to people with spinal cord injuries, including motivation, hope, improved self-confidence, and acceptance. Challenges identified during physical rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries, such as comparisons, negative emotions, recovery expectations, and slow progress, should be addressed by healthcare professionals to ensure person-centred care. People with spinal cord injuries identified a need for support from health care professionals, family, and friends, as well other people with spinal cord injuries. There is an issue of control in physical rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries, which can result in a fight with oneself or with healthcare professionals to regain the control that has been lost.","Unger, Janelle; Singh, Hardeep; Mansfield, Avril; Hitzig, Sander L; Lenton, Erica; Musselman, Kristin E",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1425745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29334811/,401
76487,Deworming in non-pregnant adolescent girls and adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"The global emergence of novel pathogenic viruses presents an important challenge for research, as high biosafety levels are required to process samples. While inactivation of infectious agents facilitates the use of less stringent safety conditions, its effect on other biological entities of interest present in the sample is generally unknown. Here, we analyzed the effect of five inactivation methods (heat, ethanol, formaldehyde, psoralen, and TRIzol) on microbiome composition and diversity in samples collected from four different body sites (gut, nasal, oral, and skin) and compared them against untreated samples from the same tissues. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and estimated abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa present in all samples. Nasal and skin samples were the most affected by inactivation, with ethanol and TRIzol inducing the largest changes in composition, and heat, formaldehyde, TRIzol, and psoralen inducing the largest changes in diversity. Oral and stool microbiomes were more robust to inactivation, with no significant changes in diversity and only moderate changes in composition. Firmicutes was the taxonomic group least affected by inactivation, while Bacteroidetes had a notable enrichment in nasal samples and moderate enrichment in fecal and oral samples. Actinobacteria were more notably depleted in fecal and skin samples, and Proteobacteria exhibited a more variable behavior depending on sample type and inactivation method. Overall, our results demonstrate that inactivation methods can alter the microbiome in a tissue-specific manner and that careful consideration should be given to the choice of method based on the sample type under study. IMPORTANCE Understanding how viral infections impact and are modulated by the microbiome is an important problem in basic research but is also of high clinical relevance under the current pandemic. To facilitate the study of interactions between microbial communities and pathogenic viruses under safe conditions, the infectious agent is generally inactivated prior to processing samples. The effect of this inactivation process in the microbiome is, however, unknown. Further, it is unclear whether biases introduced by inactivation methods are dependent on the sample type under study. Estimating the magnitude and nature of the changes induced by different methods in samples collected from various body sites thus provides important information for current and future studies that require inactivation of pathogenic agents.","Boix-Amorós, Alba; Piras, Enrica; Bu, Kevin; Wallach, David; Stapylton, Matthew; Fernández-Sesma, Ana; Malaspina, Dolores; Clemente, Jose C",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00674-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609165/,401

Publications with unreported COI tend to be more favorable to industry. Since 2014 industry payments to United States (US) physicians are publicly reported in the Open Payments Database (OPD). Several studies show high levels of unreported COI in medical literature; however, there is no research examining COI reporting at surgical conferences. We hypothesized that compliance with the COI disclosure requirement would be high at the 2018 SAGES meeting. However, we expected to find significant discrepancy between speaker-reported and OPD-reported COI. A secondary aim was to characterize the amount, source, and variation in industry payments to invited speakers. METHODS We reviewed all available presentations from SAGES 2018 as recorded and publicly available on YouTube™ for the presence of COI disclosure and the disclosed industry relationships. For US physicians we searched the OPD and recorded all industry payments > $500. We compared the self-disclosed COI for each speaker with OPD records. Presentation topics were divided into ten groups to determine which topics received the most funding. RESULTS Of the 526 invited presentations, 479 (91%) videos were available. Disclosures were reported by 414 presenters (86.4%). There were 420 unique presenters of which 315 were listed in the OPD. Speaker-reported disclosures were fully concordant with the OPD in 38.3% (121/315) of cases with 39% (123/315) under-reporting disclosures. Of presenters listed in OPD, the median payment was $992 ($0-$374,502) with a total of $6,389,097 paid in 2017. SAGES speakers failed to disclose $2,049,535 worth of industry payments with an average undisclosed payment of $16,662.88 (± $40,733.19). The largest financial contributor was Intuitive Surgical with $1,981,169 paid. Among topics, robotics and hernia received the most funding with $2,593,925 (40.6%) and $2,591,671 (40.5%) paid, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Overall compliance with SAGES disclosure rules is high. There remains a discrepancy between speaker- and industry-reported disclosures, including a number of undisclosed payments, some of which are substantial. Adjustments to disclosure rules to include the relative amount of compensation may be warranted.","Lois, Alex W; Ehlers, Anne P; Minneman, Jennifer; Oh, Jin Sol; Khandelwal, Saurabh; Wright, Andrew S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07037-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388810/,401
78925,Efficacy of forced-air warming for preventing perioperative hypothermia and related complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery: A randomized controlled trial.,2018,"-1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) in viruses is often stimulated by a pseudoknot downstream from the slippery sequence. At the PRF junction of HIV-1, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Barmah Forest virus (BFV), Fort Morgan virus (FMV), and Equine arteritis virus (EAV), we identified potential double pseudoknots in either a tandem mode or embedded mode. In viruses with tandem pseudoknots (5'PK & 3'PK), the slippery sequence is encompassed in the 5'PK. The ribosome needs to unwind the 5'PK to get to the slippery sequence. In HIV-1, the 3'PK and several alternative structures are mutually exclusive. Disruption of the tandem pseudoknots may enable one of the alternative structures to form as the effective frameshift stimulator. In TGEV/BFV/FMV, the 3'PK is a conventional frameshift stimulator. In all cases, the tandem pseudoknots may slow down the ribosome before it reaches the conventional PRF signals. In EAV, a compact pseudoknot is embedded within loop2 of the otherwise conventional frameshift-stimulating pseudoknot. All double pseudoknots have the potential to stack their stems coaxially. We built structural models of the HIV-1 and EAV double pseudoknots to show that both the tandem and embedded modes are feasible and reasonable. We hypothesize that the fundamental reason for the viruses to utilize coaxially stacked double pseudoknots is to increase the overall stability of the frameshift regulating structure, and avoid an ultra-stable single pseudoknot which may become a ribosomal roadblock. Our results significantly expand the repertoire of RNA structures and dynamics that may potentially involve in -1 PRF regulation.","Wang, Guan; Yang, Yang; Huang, Xiaolan; Du, Zhihua",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2014.956149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25204560/,401

Few studies have compared direct and associated costs after LDP versus ODP. The purpose of the current study was to compare perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing LDP and ODP and to assess whether LDP was a cost-effective procedure compared with the traditional ODP. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of 52 distal pancreatic resections that were performed during a 10-year period was performed. RESULTS Patients included in the analysis were 16 in the LDP group and 29 in the ODP. Tumors operated laparoscopically were smaller than those removed at open operation, but the length of pancreatic resection was similar. The mean operating time for LDP was longer than ODP (204 ± 31 vs. 160 ± 35; P < 0.0001), whereas blood loss was higher in the open group (365 ± 215 vs. 160 ± 185, P < 0.0001). Morbidity (25 vs. 41; P = 0.373) and pancreatic fistula (18 vs. 20%; P = 0.6) rates were similar after LDP and ODP, as was 30-day mortality (0 vs. 2%; P = 0.565). LDP had a shorter mean length of hospital stay than ODP (6.4 (2.3) vs. 8.8 (1.7) days; P < 0.0001). Operative cost for LDP was higher than ODP (2889 vs. 1989; P < 0.0001). The entire cost of the associated hospital stay was higher in the ODP group (8955 vs. 6714; P < 0.043). The total cost was comparable in LDP and ODP groups (9603 vs. 10944; P = 0.204). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for left-sided lesions can be performed safely and effectively in selected patients, with reduced hospital stay and operative blood loss. Major complications, including pancreatic leak, were not reduced, whereas total cost was comparable between LDP and ODP. A selective use of LDP seems to be an effective and cost-efficient alternative to ODP.","Limongelli, Paolo; Belli, Andrea; Russo, Gianluca; Cioffi, Luigi; D'Agostino, Alberto; Fantini, Corrado; Belli, Giulio",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2141-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258300/,401

Radionuclide molecular imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated prostate cancer might identify patients for HER2-targeted therapy. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) targeting proteins with high potential as tracers for radionuclide imaging. The goal of this study was to develop an optimal Affibody-based tracer for visualization of HER2 expression in prostate cancer. METHODS A synthetic variant of the anti-HER2 Z(HER2:342) Affibody molecule, Z(HER2:S1), was N-terminally conjugated with the chelators DOTA, NOTA and NODAGA. The conjugated proteins were biophysically characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor analysis. After labelling with (111)In, the biodistribution was assessed in normal mice and the two most promising conjugates were further evaluated for tumour targeting in mice bearing DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts. RESULTS The HER2-binding equilibrium dissociation constants were 130, 140 and 90 pM for DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1), respectively. A comparative study of (111)In-labelled DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) in normal mice demonstrated a substantial influence of the chelators on the biodistribution properties of the conjugates. (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) had the most rapid clearance from blood and healthy tissues. (111)In-NOTA-Z(HER2:S1) showed high hepatic uptake and was excluded from further evaluation. (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2:S1) and (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) demonstrated specific uptake in DU-145 prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. The tumour uptake of (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1), 5.6 ± 0.4%ID/g, was significantly lower than the uptake of (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2:S1), 7.4 ± 0.5%ID/g, presumably because of lower bioavailability due to more rapid clearance. (111)In-NODAGA-Z(HER2:S1) provided higher tumour-to-blood ratio, but somewhat lower tumour-to-liver, tumour-to-spleen and tumour-to-bone ratios. CONCLUSION Since distant prostate cancer metastases are situated in bone or bone marrow, the higher tumour-to-bone ratio is the most important. This renders (111)In-DOTA-Z(HER2:S1) a preferable agent for imaging of HER2 expression in disseminated prostate cancer.","Malmberg, Jennie; Perols, Anna; Varasteh, Zohreh; Altai, Mohamed; Braun, Alexis; Sandström, Mattias; Garske, Ulrike; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Orlova, Anna; Karlström, Amelie Eriksson",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-011-1992-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22322933/,401

METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single referral regional center (Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel). Prevalence of the diagnosis of EP, treatment modality and associated complications during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the state of Israel (March 10 to May 12, 2020) was compared to patients receiving the same diagnosis during the parallel timeframe in the previous year (2019). RESULTS Overall there were 29 and 43 cases of EP during the COVID-19 and pre COVID-19 epoch, respectively. COVID-19 period patients presented to the emergency room with significantly higher β-hCG level; median of 1364 vs 633 IU, P = 0.001. The rate of ruptured EP was; 20.7% vs 4.3% P = 0.031, and surgical approach; 55.2% vs. 27.9%, P = 0.001. Significantly higher median volume of blood loss; median volume 852 vs 300 ml, P = 0.042 were observed in patients during the COVID-19 epoch CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to delayed presentation of patients with EP, and the requirement of subsequent emergency surgical management and excessive blood loss. Special attention should be given to the decline in routine medical care during the pandemic.","Barg, Moshe; Rotem, Reut; Mor, Pnina; Rottenstreich, Misgav; Fayez, Khatib; Grisaru-Granovsky, Sorina; Armon, Shunit",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599285/,401

However, occasional samples show a falsely low or negative FCoV antibody test. We tested the hypothesis that such results are due to virus in the sample binding antibody and rendering it unavailable to antigen in the test. Thirteen effusions, one plasma and three undefined samples from cats with FIP, which gave unexpectedly low FCoV antibody titres, were examined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Increasing amounts of virus correlated with lower signals in indirect immunoflourescent, enzyme-linked immunosorbent asssay and rapid immunomigration antibody tests. However, five samples were negative by RT-PCR, so the presence of virus alone may not explain all cases of false-negative FCoV antibody tests, although it is a possible explanation in 71% of discordant samples. We conclude that falsely low or negative FCoV antibody tests can occur in samples rich in virus.","Meli, Marina L; Burr, Paul; Decaro, Nicola; Graham, Elizabeth; Jarrett, Oswald; Lutz, Hans; McDonald, Michael; Addie, Diane D",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x12467995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220869/,401
84008,Silence in the Noise: Journey With Hearing Loss Across 2 Worlds.,2021-04-08,"OBJECTIVE Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. Although state-wide stay-at-home orders in the United States received a large degree of media and political attention, relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the impacts of such orders social distancing behaviors. METHOD This study used daily GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. RESULTS From early March to early April, people in counties with state-level stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than counties without state-level stay-at-home orders; 3.1% more people stayed within 1 mile of home and 1.6% fewer vehicle miles were driven per day. From early April to early May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than counties in states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place; 1.2% fewer people remained within 1 mile of home and 6.2% more vehicle miles were driven per day. The magnitude of changes associated with state-level stay-at-home orders were many times smaller than the total changes in movement across all counties over the same periods. CONCLUSIONS Stay-at-home orders were associated with greater social distancing, but accounted for only part of this behavioral change. Research on behavior change would be useful to determine additional interventions that could support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bourassa, Kyle J",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395214/,401
84203,Opioid Dependence vs Addiction: A Distinction Without a Difference?,2012,"INTRODUCTION Leishmania major (L. major) is a cutaneous leishmaniasis causative agent. So far, chemotherapy has not been totally effective for treatment of the disease. The immunomodulation and tissue repairing capability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ease of isolation, detection and in-vitro culture, have encouraged the biologists to use MSCs for cell therapy in different infections such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS 6-8 week BALB/c mice were infected with L. major and divided into four groups and treated with MSCs, Glucantime, Glucantime + MSCs and PBS. The regression of the lesions, potency of macrophages for phagocytosis, proliferation of immune cells against Leishmania soluble antigen, reduction of spleen parasite burden and healing of the lesions were evaluated on days 10, 20 and 30 of treatment. RESULT The results indicated that the mice intralesionally injected with MSCs showed a significant regression in the lesions produced by L. major by day 30. Proliferation of the splenocytes stimulated with SLA (Soluble Leishmania Antigen) in-vitro in MSC treated mice on day 20 was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The potency of phagocytosis in macrophages of the mice treated with MSCs was significantly higher by day 30 and healing of the lesions in this group of mice showed more progress in histopathological examinations. Spleen parasite burden showed significant reduction in the mice treated with Glucantime + MSCs by day 30. CONCLUSION The results showed that using MSCs in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major is a promising approach for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","Navard, Sahar Hamoon; Rezvan, Hossein; Feiz Haddad, Mohammad Hossein; Ali, S A; Nourian, Alireza; Eslaminejad, Mohamadreza Baghaban; Behmanesh, Mohammad Amin",Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977079/,401
85251,Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Treatment on Orthostatic Hypotension : A Systematic Review and Individual Participant-based Meta-analysis.,2020-09-10,"The field of viral genomics and bioinformatics is experiencing a strong resurgence due to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology, which enables the rapid and cost-effective sequencing and subsequent assembly of large numbers of viral genomes. In addition, the unprecedented power of HTS technologies has enabled the analysis of intra-host viral diversity and quasispecies dynamics in relation to important biological questions on viral transmission, vaccine resistance and host jumping. HTS also enables the rapid identification of both known and potentially new viruses from field and clinical samples, thus adding new tools to the fields of viral discovery and metagenomics. Bioinformatics has been central to the rise of HTS applications because new algorithms and software tools are continually needed to process and analyse the large, complex datasets generated in this rapidly evolving area. In this paper, the authors give a brief overview of the main bioinformatics tools available for viral genomic research, with a particular emphasis on HTS technologies and their main applications. They summarise the major steps in various HTS analyses, starting with quality control of raw reads and encompassing activities ranging from consensus and de novo genome assembly to variant calling and metagenomics, as well as RNA sequencing.","Orton, R J; Gu, Q; Hughes, J; Maabar, M; Modha, S; Vattipally, S B; Wilkie, G S; Davison, A J",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.35.1.2432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27217183/,401
85369,Low-frequency ventilation during cardiopulmonary bypass for lung protection: A randomized controlled trial.,2019,"BACKGROUND Intracranial blister aneurysms are rare lesions that are notoriously more difficult to treat than typical saccular aneurysms. High complication rates associated with surgery have sparked considerable interest in endovascular techniques, though not well-studied, to treat blister aneurysms. OBJECTIVE To evaluate our experience using various endovascular approaches to treat blister aneurysms. METHODS All consecutive blister aneurysms treated using an endovascular approach by the study authors over a 3-year period were retrospectively analyzed. A literature review was also performed. RESULTS Nine patients with blister aneurysms underwent 11 endovascular interventions. In various combinations, stents were used in 8/11, coils in 5/11, and Onyx in 3/11 procedures. At mean angiographic follow-up of 200 days, 8/9 aneurysms were completely occluded by endovascular means alone requiring no further treatment and 1/9 aneurysms required surgical bypass/trapping after one failed surgical and two failed endovascular treatments. At mean clinical follow-up of 416 days, modified Rankin Scale scores were improved in six patients, stable in two, and worsened in one patient. One complication occurred in 11 procedures (9%), resulting in a permanent neurologic deficit. No unintended endovascular parent vessel sacrifice, intraprocedural aneurysmal ruptures, antiplatelet-related complications, post-treatment aneurysmal re-ruptures, or deaths occurred. CONCLUSION This series highlights both the spectrum and limitations of endovascular techniques currently used to treat blister aneurysms, including a novel application of stent-assisted Onyx embolization. Long-term follow-up and experience in larger studies are required to better define the role of endovascular therapy in the management of these difficult lesions.","Ashour, Ramsey; Dodson, Stephen; Aziz-Sultan, M Ali",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25378640/,401

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 15 April and 14 May 2020, a multicentre cross-sectional survey was performed to study depression, anxiety and resilience in a sample of Spanish pregnant women during the lockdown set up by the Government in response to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We designed an anonymous online self-administered questionnaire (https://bit.ly/34RRpq1) that included the Spanish validated versions of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Connor-Davidson Resilience 10-items Scale (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS A total of 514 pregnant women completed the survey. 72.8% had been confined < 40 days and 27.2% between 41 and 60 days. 182 (35.4%) participants scored over 10, with 21.3% scoring over 13 (75th Percentile) in depressive symptoms rates. We found high trait and anxiety scores, with 223 (43.4%) and 227 (44.2%) pregnant women scoring over the trait and state mean scores. Neither depression, anxiety or resilience levels showed any significant correlation with the length of confinement. We found low CD-RISC-10 scores. CONCLUSIONS We found a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms during the quarantine, although we did not find an increased prevalence of psychological distress according to length of home confinement. Resilience correlated negatively with depression and anxiety.","Lubián López, Daniel María; Butrón Hinojo, Carmen Aisha; Arjona Bernal, Jose Eduardo; Fasero Laiz, María; Alcolea Santiago, José; Guerra Vilches, Virginia; Casaus Fernández, Marta; Bueno Moral, Ana; Olvera Perdigones, Antonio; Rodríguez Rodríguez, Begoña; Cuevas Palomino, Andrés; Presa Lorite, Jesús; Coronado Martín, Pluvio; Sánchez-Prieto, Manuel; Sánchez-Borrego, Rafael; González-Mesa, Ernesto",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482x.2021.1896491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730970/,401

However, this practice is common in clinical settings. This observational study aimed to compare (1) the clinical profiles of patients receiving and not receiving bridging therapy, (2) overall group outcomes, and (3) outcomes according to the type of anticoagulant prescribed. Methods- We analyzed data of patients from the prospective RAF and RAF-NOACs studies. The primary outcome was defined as the composite of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, symptomatic cerebral bleeding, and major extracerebral bleeding observed at 90 days after the acute stroke. Results- Of 1810 patients who initiated oral anticoagulant therapy, 371 (20%) underwent bridging therapy with full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin. Older age and the presence of leukoaraiosis were inversely correlated with the use of bridging therapy. Forty-two bridged patients (11.3%) reached the combined outcome versus 72 (5.0%) of the nonbridged patients ( P=0.0001). At multivariable analysis, bridging therapy was associated with the composite end point (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.7; P<0.0001), as well as ischemic (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9; P=0.005) and hemorrhagic (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9; P=0.01) end points separately. Conclusions- Our findings suggest that patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin have a higher risk of early ischemic recurrence and hemorrhagic transformation compared with nonbridged patients.","Altavilla, Riccardo; Caso, Valeria; Bandini, Fabio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Yaghi, Shadi; Furie, Karen L; Tadi, Prasanna; Becattini, Cecilia; Zedde, Marialuisa; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Lees, Kennedy R; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; Acciarresi, Monica; D'Amore, Cataldo; Giulia Mosconi, Maria; Anna Cimini, Ludovica; Fusaro, Jessica; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Cappellari, Manuel; Putaala, Jukka; Tomppo, Liisa; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Marcheselli, Simona; Pezzini, Alessandro; Poli, Loris; Padovani, Alessandro; Masotti, Luca; Vannucchi, Vieri; Sohn, Sung-Il; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Acampa, Maurizio; Martini, Giuseppe; Ntaios, George; Athanasakis, George; Makaritsis, Konstantinos; Karagkiozi, Efstathia; Vadikolias, Konstantinos; Liantinioti, Chrysoula; Chondrogianni, Maria; Mumoli, Nicola; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Corea, Francesco; Ageno, Walter; Bellesini, Marta; Silvestrelli, Giorgio; Ciccone, Alfonso; Lanari, Alessia; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Mancuso, Michelangelo; Maccarrone, Miriam; Ulivi, Leonardo; Orlandi, Giovanni; Giannini, Nicola; Gialdini, Gino; Tassinari, Tiziana; De Lodovici, Maria Luisa; Bono, Giorgio; Rueckert, Christina; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Toni, Danilo; Letteri, Federica; Giuntini, Martina; Maria Lotti, Enrico; Flomin, Yuriy; Pieroni, Alessio; Kargiotis, Odysseas; Karapanayiotides, Theodore; Monaco, Serena; Maimone Baronello, Mario; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Chiti, Alberto; Giorli, Elisa; Del Sette, Massimo; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Michel, Patrik; Vanacker, Peter; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Barlinn, Jessica; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Gourbali, Vanessa; Paciaroni, Maurizio",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.022856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31221054/,401

The majority of patients are managed with conservative interventions. However, for those patients with severe or refractory incontinence, surgical treatment might be required. Over the past 20 years, numerous developments have been made in the surgical therapies available to treat such patients. These surgical therapies can be classified as techniques of neuromodulation, neosphincter creation (muscle or artificial) and injection therapy. Techniques of neuromodulation, particularly sacral nerve stimulation, have transformed the management of these patients with a minimally invasive procedure that offers good results and low morbidity. By contrast, neosphincter procedures are characterized by being more invasive and associated with considerable morbidity, although some patients will experience substantial improvements in their continence. Injection of bulking agents into the anal canal can improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with mild-to-moderate incontinence, and the use of autologous myoblasts might be a future therapy. Further research and development is required not only in terms of the devices and procedures, but also to identify which patients are likely to benefit most from such interventions.","Mitchell, Peter J; Sagar, Peter M",Nature reviews.

88525,Nitric Oxide Added to the Sweep Gas of the Oxygenator during Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Infants: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND A common neurological complication of critical illness is delirium, defined as an acute change in level of consciousness, with impaired attention and disorganized thinking. Patients with delirium have increased risk of long-term cognitive dysfunction and mortality. The cause is unknown, which limits our ability to design therapeutic interventions. In patients undergoing surgery, low regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2), as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), is associated with postoperative neurological dysfunction (eg delirium and long-term cognitive impairment). However, the relationship between NIRS-derived rSO2 and neurological outcomes in critically ill patients is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the utilization of NIRS-derived rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating theater. We aimed to examine the relationship between rSO2 and neurological outcomes as well as to report rSO2 values in this population. METHODS The following databases were searched from inception to August 14, 2017: Ovid MedLine, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. RESULTS Of 1410 articles identified by the search strategy, 8 were ultimately selected for final review. Most (7 of 8) were published since 2014. These studies included a total of 213 patients primarily with shock or respiratory failure. A variety of devices were used to measure rSO2, including INVOS and FORESIGHT. The duration of recording varied from 5 minutes to 72 hours. Four of the 8 studies reported on neurological outcomes. In all 4 studies, rSO2 was lower in critically ill patients who were delirious compared to controls, but this was only statistically significant in 2 of the studies. The heterogeneity in devices and duration of recording precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS There is limited literature describing rSO2 in critically ill patients outside the operating room. Although there may be a slight signal of an association between low rSO2 and delirium, more study is needed to explore this relationship.","Bendahan, Nathaniel; Neal, Oliver; Ross-White, Amanda; Muscedere, John; Boyd, J Gordon",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066618807399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30376764/,401
89047,The trend of cutaneous lesions during COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from a meta-analysis and systematic review.,2020-09-16,"Use of chemicals, most often classified for intrinsic hazards, is rather common among dentists. To date, no data have been recorded in the European Union (EU) on dentists' awareness regarding the safe use of chemicals. In the EU regulatory framework, two Regulations with wide applications, namely Regulations (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH) and 1272/2008 (CLP), have been introduced to protect human health and the environment and clearly communicate hazards posed by chemicals to workers and consumers. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of comprehension of hazard communication of chemicals among Greek dentists. For this, a closed-ended, anonymous and validated questionnaire was initially distributed to a total of 300 Greek dentists, both professionals and university students, over a period of 4 months. The collected data from 240 final responders were subjected to statistical analysis (frequencies, percentages, chi-square (χ2) and significance (p < 0.05)). The vast majority (90%) of the interviewed dentists are not aware of the CLP. Main sources of information regarding chemical hazard and safe use was the supplier through direct communication (90%), while some dentists also consulted the product labels (39%) and the material safety data sheets (54%). Regarding hazard communication, the perceived information from the pictograms is confusing to the vast majority of the dentists (86%), especially for systemic hazards (carcinogenicity and/or reproductive toxicity). In addition, 88% of the professional dentists have not noticed any changes in the labelling of chemical products, which also shows the low input of labels to hazard communication. On the other hand, 90% of the responders always utilize personal protective equipment (PPE), although it is not clear whether this PPE is adequate. In conclusion, rising awareness campaigns are needed, in collaboration with universities and dental care professional associations, to inform dentists about the safe use of chemicals not only to ensure protection of their own health but also to contribute to environmental sustainability.","Koulaouzidou, Elisabeth A; Tsitsimpikou, Christina; Nikolaidis, Alexandros K; Karanasiou, Christina; Foufa, Eleni; Tsarouhas, Konstantinos",Toxicology and industrial health,https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233720933062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787741/,401
89186,Indian scenario of IgA nephropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-01,"Purpose This study assessed and described potential clinical practice changes secondary to COVID-19 that emerged as an early response to the pandemic for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) engaged in voice, alaryngeal, and swallowing activities that may increase the risk of virus transmission. Method SLPs from the United States and Canada (n = 665) who were engaged in clinical activities that might elevate the risk of COVID-19 exposure completed an online survey regarding their clinical practices. Topics assessed included potential clinical service modifications, COVID-19 testing and health, and potential financial impacts in the early time period of the pandemic. Results The percentage of SLPs completing the most endoscopic procedures prepandemic (≥ 10/week) was reduced from 39% of respondents to 3% due to the pandemic. Those who completed the most tracheoesophageal puncture voice prosthesis changes (≥ 5/week) reported a reduction in frequency from 24% to 6%. Twenty-five percent of SLPs reported that they were tested for COVID-19, and 6% reported a positive result. Descriptive statistics suggest that COVID-19 testing rates of SLPs, the percentage of SLPs experiencing a financial impact, and the percentage who were furloughed varied across SLP work setting. Conclusions These findings provide the first data characterizing the impact on COVID-19 on clinical practice for SLPs engaged in procedures such as endoscopy and laryngectomy care. The results indicate that, as frontline workers, SLPs were directly impacted in their practice patterns, personal health, safety, and financial security, and that these reported impacts occurred differently across SLP work settings.","Kearney, Ann; Searl, Jeff; Erickson-DiRenzo, Elizabeth; Doyle, Philip C",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2021_ajslp-20-00325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161739/,401

The aim of this study is to ascertain ALS improves survival for trauma in prehospital settings when compared to BLS. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for published controlled trials (CTs), and observational studies that were published until Aug 2017. The population of interest were adults (>18 years old) trauma patients who were transported by ground transportation and required resuscitation in prehospital settings. We compared outcomes between the ALS and BLS groups. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes were neurological outcome and time spent on scene. Results: We identified 2,502 studies from various databases and 10 studies were included in the analysis (two CTs, and eight observational studies). The outcomes were not statistically significant between the ALS and BLS groups (pooled OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.36 for mortality, pooled OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.42 for good neurological outcomes, pooled mean difference -0.96; 95% CI-6.64 to 4.72 for on-scene time) in CTs. In observational studies, ALS prolonged on-scene time and increased mortality (pooled OR 1.56; 95% CI: 1.31 to 1.86 for mortality, and pooled mean difference, 1.26; 95% CI: 0.07 to 2.45 for on-scene time). Conclusions: In prehospital settings, the present study showed no advantages of ALS on the outcomes in patients with trauma compared to BLS.","Kondo, Yutaka; Fukuda, Tatsuma; Uchimido, Ryo; Kashiura, Masahiro; Kato, Soichiro; Sekiguchi, Hiroshi; Zamami, Yoshito; Hifumi, Toru; Hayashida, Kei",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.660367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842515/,401

Thus, a variety of methods are used to determine fatigue. The aim of this study was to use a principal component analysis (PCA) on a multifactorial data-set based on kinematic measurements to determine fatigue. Twenty participants (strength training experienced, 60% male) executed 3 sets of 3 exercises with 50 (12 repetitions), 75 (12 repetitions) and 100%-12 RM (RM). Data were collected with a 3D accelerometer and analysed by a newly developed algorithm to evaluate parameters for each repetition. A PCA with six variables was carried out on the results. A fatigue factor was computed based on the loadings on the first component. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis was calculated to test for differences between the intensity levels. All six input variables had high loadings on the first component. The ANOVA showed a significant difference between intensities (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a difference between 100% and the lower intensities (p < 0.05) and no difference between 50 and 75%-12RM. Based on these results, it is possible to distinguish between fatigued and non-fatigued sets of strength training.","Brown, Niklas; Bichler, Sebastian; Fiedler, Meike; Alt, Wilfried",Sports biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14763141.2016.1159321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27111008/,401

A recently developed field-deployable clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) detection assay with lateral flow strips shows promise for point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, the limit of detection of paper strip-based assays (10-100 copies/μL) is much lower than that of fluorescence-based detection methods. In this study, we developed an easy-readout and sensitive enhanced (ERASE) strip to visualize the results of CRISPR detection and improve the sensitivity to 1 copy/μL with an unambiguous easy-read result. Using 649 clinical samples from blind specimens collected from patients in China, we validated our ERASE assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with 90.67% positive predictive agreement and 99.21% negative predictive agreement.

The central features of the approach are the ability to select SNPs at will for detection, and the absence of need to PCR amplify the target. A surprisingly long probe length (39-49 nt) was needed for allelic discrimination. Reconstitution experiments demonstrate linearity of ASE over a broad range. Using this approach, we have discovered at least two novel imprinted genes, NLRP2, which encodes a member of the inflammasome, and OSBPL1A, which encodes a presumed oxysterol-binding protein, were both preferentially expressed from the maternal allele. In contrast, ERAP2, which encodes an aminopeptidase, did not show preferential parent-of-origin expression, but rather, cis-acting nonimprinted differential allelic control. The approach is scalable to the whole genome and can be used for discovery of functional epigenetic modifications in patient samples.","Bjornsson, Hans T; Albert, Thomas J; Ladd-Acosta, Christine M; Green, Roland D; Rongione, Michael A; Middle, Christina M; Irizarry, Rafael A; Broman, Karl W; Feinberg, Andrew P",Genome research,https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.073254.107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18369178/,401
91877,"Incidence, Characteristics, and Outcomes of Ventilator-Associated Events during the COVID-19 Pandemic.",2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND The process of harvesting and performing microsurgical anastomosis in a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap for breast reconstruction can be a lengthy procedure, which could affect outcomes and patient safety. We hypothesize that the implementation of a high volume center, preoperative planning, and the adaptation of key intraoperative components will optimize the efficiency of perforator flap surgery for breast reconstruction. METHODS A retrospective review of 68 consecutive patients who underwent 104 DIEP flaps for immediate or delayed breast reconstruction was performed. Standardized preoperative planning, including computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging angiogram, operating room setup, and operative technique, was followed. The times of flap harvest, internal mammary vessel harvest, microsurgical anastomosis, flap inset, wound closure, and total length of procedure were reviewed as well as patient outcomes. RESULTS The average length of surgery for a unilateral DIEP was 3 hours and 21 minutes and for a bilateral DIEP was 5 hours and 46 minutes. In bilateral DIEP flaps, a significantly longer operative time was noted in immediate (363 ± 14 minutes) compared to delayed (296 ± 17 minutes) (P < 0.05) reconstruction and between procedures performed by 1 surgeon (400 ± 29 minutes) versus 2 surgeons (326 ± 11 minutes) (P < 0.05). Interestingly, no significant difference in operative time was seen in DIEP flaps performed on patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 30 (193 ± 7.6, 352 ± 17 minutes) versus a BMI greater than 30 (213 ± 11, 333 ± 14 minutes) in both unilateral and bilateral procedures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Efficiency is optimized by preoperative planning with computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging angiogram, a dedicated operating room team, including 2 microsurgeons and a systematic approach for surgery. The BMI may not significantly affect the duration of surgery.","Canizares, Orlando; Mayo, James; Soto, Eliana; Allen, Robert J; Sadeghi, Alireza",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000000559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101983/,401

METHODS Data from 12,328 adults who responded to the cross-sectional survey conducted in 33 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean by Pan American Health Organization were used. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the effect of the sociodemographic characteristics, quarantine practices, and anxiety symptoms on the increase in frequency of HED among the 2019 drinkers. RESULTS 65 % of drinkers in 2019 self-reported HED during the COVID-19 pandemic with 13.8 % of the drinkers reporting an increase in HED compared to a 33.38 % decrease in HED. Multivariable analysis indicated that male gender (aOR 1.29, 95 %CI 1.13; 1.49), higher income (aOR 1.64, 95 %CI 1.35; 1.99) and higher level of quarantine practices (aOR 1.10, 95 %CI 1.04; 1.16) were positively associated with increased frequency of HED; unemployment (aOR 0.78, 95 %CI 0.64; 0.96), student status (aOR 0.53, 95 %CI 0.43; 0.64) and living with children (aOR 0.91, 95 %CI 0.84; 0.99) were negatively associated with increased frequency of HED.

Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, the degree to which it improves occupational outcomes has received little attention. We investigated change in job status and presenteeism (i.e., the inability to focus on and accomplish work) over the course of CBT. We assessed employment status, presenteeism, depressive symptoms, cognitive style, and CBT skills at intake and posttreatment in a sample of 126 participants enrolled in a 16-week course of CBT for depression. Employment status significantly improved from pre to posttreatment, with 11 of the 27 patients (41%) seeking to improve their employment status achieving this goal. Among the 59 consistently employed patients, presenteeism decreased significantly over the course of treatment (dz = 1.13). We also found, even after controlling for changes in symptoms, reductions in negative cognitive style (but not changes in CBT skills) were associated with reductions in presenteeism. Our findings suggest CBT patients experience positive changes in occupational outcomes, both in finding work and being more focused and productive at work. Changes in negative cognitive styles appeared to partly explain this latter change. We encourage future work examining CBT's impact on occupational outcomes.","Ezawa, Iony D; Bartels, Graham C; Strunk, Daniel R",Cognitive behaviour therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1875039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33544040/,401

The vinaceous Amazon parrot (Amazona vinacea) is extinct in several areas, and a project to release confiscated individuals to their former range is currently underway. The objective of this study was to evaluate and improve the selection and treatment of individual release candidates by detecting possible pathogen carriers using samples taken before and during release. As part of prerelease health protocols, samples were obtained from 29 parrots on three different occasions while in captivity and once after their release. Samples were screened for paramyxovirus type 1, avian influenza, poxvirus, coronavirus, psittacine herpesvirus 1, Chlamydia psittaci , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Salmonella spp., and endoparasites. The majority of samples returned negative results, with the exception of two individuals that tested positive for C. psittaci in the first sampling and for Ascaridia spp. in the second pooled sampling. Treatments for C. psittaci and endoparasites were administered prior to release, and negative results were obtained in subsequent exams. The number of positive results for E. coli (non-EPEC) decreased during the rehabilitation period. Adequate quarantine procedures and health examinations greatly minimize disease risks. The protocols employed in this study resulted in acceptable health status in accordance with current environmental legislation in Brazil. Additionally, protocols allowed informed decisions to release candidates, minimized risks, and favored the selection of healthy individuals, thereby contributing to the recovery of this species. It is important to determine appropriate minimum health-screening protocols when advanced diagnostics may not be available or high costs make the tests prohibitive in countries where confiscations occur. We hypothesize that a minimum panel of tests of pooled samples can serve as an alternative approach that minimizes costs and overall workload and supports projects intended to restore and promote flagship species and hamper their illegal trade.","Saidenberg, André B S; Zuniga, Eveline; Melville, Priscilla A; Salaberry, Sandra; Benites, Nilson R",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2013-0152.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26667526/,401

A Systematic Review.,2020,"This special issue explores the use of learning profiles for analysing the dynamics of low learning in low- and middle-income countries and informing priorities to address the learning crisis. The 12 papers in the special issue draw on learning data from more than 50 countries and 6 million individuals, with implications for education policy and practice. Taken together, they point to a need to steepen learning trajectories by prioritizing early mastery of foundational skills for all children. The papers show that addressing the learning crisis will not be achieved through more school grade attainment alone, nor through within-country equality across groups (such as girls and boys or rich and poor). Positive examples show that programs focused on foundational learning both improved average learning and reduced inequality. Addressing the learning crisis will require a focus on systems improvement, using foundational learning as a case in point for making the needed systems improvements to steepen learning throughout children's time in school. Learning profiles can provide a guide for education actors aiming to improve learning outcomes.","Crouch, Luis; Kaffenberger, Michelle; Savage, Laura",International journal of educational development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2021.102477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602726/,401

OBJECTIVES To identify factors that influence the severity of HRV illnesses. METHODS HRV species and types were determined in 1,445 nasal lavages that were prospectively collected from 209 infants participating in a birth cohort who had at least one HRV infection. Questionnaires were used during each illness to identify moderate to severe illnesses (MSI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Altogether, 670 HRV infections were identified, and 519 of them were solitary infections (only one HRV type). These 519 viruses belonged to 93 different types of three species: 49 A, 9 B, and 35 C types. HRV-A (odds ratio, 8.2) and HRV-C (odds ratio, 7.6) were more likely to cause MSI compared with HRV-B. In addition, HRV infections were 5- to 10-fold more likely to cause MSI in the winter months (P < 0.0001) compared with summer, in contrast to peak seasonal prevalence in spring and fall. When significant differences in host susceptibility to MSI (P = 0.004) were considered, strain-specific rates of HRV MSI ranged from less than 1% to more than 20%. CONCLUSIONS Factors related to HRV species and type, season, and host susceptibility determine the risk of more severe HRV illness in infancy. These findings suggest that anti-HRV strategies should focus on HRV-A and -C species and identify the need for additional studies to determine mechanisms for seasonal increases of HRV severity, independent of viral prevalence, in cold weather months.","Lee, Wai-Ming; Lemanske, Robert F; Evans, Michael D; Vang, Fue; Pappas, Tressa; Gangnon, Ronald; Jackson, Daniel J; Gern, James E",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.201202-0330oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923659/,401

Given considerable evidence of disparities in health and healthcare delivery in African American communities, some regard keeping a race term in GFR equations as a practice that differentially influences access to care and kidney transplantation. Others assert that race captures important GFR determinants and its removal from the calculation may perpetuate other disparities. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and American Society of Nephrology (ASN) established a task force in 2020 to reassess the inclusion of race in the estimation of GFR in the United States and its implications for diagnosis and subsequent management of patients with, or at risk for, kidney diseases. This interim report details the process, initial assessment of evidence, and values defined regarding the use of race to estimate GFR. We organized activities in phases: (1) clarify the problem and examine evidence, (2) evaluate different approaches to address use of race in GFR estimation, and (3) make recommendations. In phase one, we constructed statements about the evidence and defined values regarding equity and disparities; race and racism; GFR measurement, estimation, and equation performance; laboratory standardization; and patient perspectives. We also identified several approaches to estimate GFR and a set of attributes to evaluate these approaches. Building on evidence and values, the attributes of alternative approaches to estimate GFR will be evaluated in the next phases and recommendations will be made.","Delgado, Cynthia; Baweja, Mukta; Burrows, Nilka Ríos; Crews, Deidra C; Eneanya, Nwamaka D; Gadegbeku, Crystal A; Inker, Lesley A; Mendu, Mallika L; Miller, W Greg; Moxey-Mims, Marva M; Roberts, Glenda V; St Peter, Wendy L; Warfield, Curtis; Powe, Neil R",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2021010039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837122/,401

Throughout this long history, technology has improved and the needs of users have evolved, so Great Lakes ice cover datasets have been upgraded several times in both spatial and temporal resolutions. In order to make those long-term data consistent and accessible, we reprocessed the Great Lakes ice cover database to generate daily gridded data (1.8 km resolution) using a re-project method with Nearest Neighbor Search for spatial interpolation, and linear interpolation with categorization for temporal interpolation. This report elucidates data history, generation procedures, and file structure in order to improve access and usability of Great Lakes ice cover data.","Yang, Ting-Yi; Kessler, James; Mason, Lacey; Chu, Philip Y; Wang, Jia",Scientific data,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00603-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764683/,401
96472,"During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Opioid Overdose Deaths Revert to Previous Record Levels in Ohio.",2021-06-24,"In late December 2019, a new coronavirus (CoV) called the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which had not been detected in humans before, caused a worldwide pandemic. Owing to the highly infectious nature of this virus, it spread rapidly from person to person despite the warnings of the World Health Organization and all the measures taken by the governments. Although it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to infect the elderly, all age groups are susceptible to this virus, including newborns. CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms seem to be less severe in children than in adults, but similar to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, in the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases and the risk of serious diseases increase as age increases. The treatment of COVID-19 is still challenging, especially in children, and the virus continues to cause death worldwide. The safest and most controlled way to effectively and sustainably prevent COVID-19 in a society is to have an effective and safe vaccine and to successfully vaccinate the majority of the population. It is possible that vaccines with safety and efficacy that have been proven in phase III trials will be effective in handling COVID-19.","Aygün, Deniz; Önal, Pınar; Apaydın, Gözde; Çokuğraş, Haluk",Turkish archives of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkarchpediatr.2020.20255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013223/,401

Tie-over bolsters have been used traditionally, however, they can be uncomfortable for patients and preclude grafting large areas in one definitive operation. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used as an alternative to bolster dressings and may afford additional wound healing benefits. In our center, NPWT has become the dressing of choice for securing STSGs. While the RECELL® system is being used in conjunction with STSGs, it is currently unknown whether autologous skin cell suspensions (ASCS) can be used with NPWT. This report is a retrospective chart review of 9 patients treated in this manner. All wounds were almost completely re-epithelialized within 14 days, and their healing was as expected. Wound healing trajectories are shown. There were no significant complications in these patients.

Polysaccharide is an important component of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. but has not been studied. Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. is used to treat porcine epidemic diarrhea. But it is not known whether Pogostemon cablin polysaccharides (PCPs) has the antiviral activities against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). AIM OF THE STUDY The purpose of present study is to investigate the structural characterization and the anti-PEDV activities of PCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS PCPs were prepared by water extraction and alcohol precipitation method and purified with DEAE-52 cellulose column and Sephadex G-100 column. Then, the structural characterization of the polysaccharides including the infrared spectrum, molecular weight and monosaccharide composition were analyzed. Afterwards, the antiviral effect of PCPs against PEDV on IPEC-J2 cells was studied by MTT method and real-time PCR method. Additionally, the effects of PCPs on PEDV adsorption, penetration and replication were analyzed by real-time PCR method. Furthermore, we also investigate whether the anti-oxidative effects of PCPs were important to the anti-PEDV activities. RESULTS Four polysaccharides were obtained and named as PCP1.1 (31.3 kDa), PCP1.2 (3.5 kDa), PCP2.1 (9.1 kDa) and PCP2.2 (8.3 kDa). PCP1.1, PCP1.2 and PCP2.1 were composed of fucose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid; and PCP2.2 was composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid. All PCPs showed anti-PEDV activities. PCP1.1 and PCP1.2 inhibited PEDV replication, while PCP2.1 and PCP2.2 inhibited PEDV penetration and replication. All PCPs showed anti-oxidative effects, which were important to the anti-PEDV activities. CONCLUSIONS The treatment effect of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. on porcine epidemic diarrhea might be related to the anti-PEDV effect of PCPs. Furthermore, the anti-oxidative effects of PCPs play important roles in their antiviral activities against PEDV.","Chen, Yun; Luo, Qiyuan; Li, Shanman; Li, Chengheng; Liao, Suya; Yang, Xin; Zhou, Ruigang; Zhu, Yongjian; Teng, Ling; Chen, Huricha; Yang, Yuhui",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32450234/,401

The cytoprotective agent amifostine protected rats from long-term nephrotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)-octreotate. This study describes the direct effect of amifostine on kidney and tumor uptake of (111)In-DOTA,Tyr(3)-octreotate. METHODS In vivo biodistribution studies were performed using CA20948 tumor-bearing rats, with or without amifostine coadministration, via several routes. In vitro uptake was studied in somatostatin receptor-expressing CA20948 and megalin or cubilin receptor-expressing BN-16 cells, in the absence or presence of amifostine or its active metabolite WR-1065. RESULTS Coadministration of amifostine decreased renal uptake of radiolabeled octreotate in vivo, whereas tumor uptake was not affected. In agreement, amifostine and WR-1065 coincubation reduced uptake in BN-16 but not in CA20948 cells. CONCLUSION Amifostine may provide renal protection during PRRT using somatostatin analogs, both by mitigation of radiation damage and the currently observed reduction of absorbed kidney radiation dose.","Melis, Marleen; Valkema, Roelf; Krenning, Eric P; de Jong, Marion","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.111.098665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496587/,401

99434,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2021,"AIM The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan proposed a regulation of overtime work as a reform in work style. However, the regulation may deteriorate the quality of medical services due to the reduction in training time. Thus, the study aimed to reveal perceptions in terms of generation gaps in views on self-training and overtime work, among members of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG). METHODS A web-based, self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among members of the JSOG. In total, 1256 respondents were included in the analysis. Data were collected on age, sex, experience as a medical doctor, location of workplace, work style, the type of main workplace, and number of full-time doctors in the main workplace. The study examined the attitudes of the respondents toward overtime work and self-training. The respondents were categorized based on experience as a medical doctor. RESULTS According to years of experience, 112 (8.9%), 226 (18.0%), 383 (30.5%), 535 (42.6%) doctors have been working for ≤5, 6-10, 11-19, and ≥ 20 years, respectively. Although 54.5% of doctors with ≤5 years of experience expected the regulation on working hours to improve the quality of medical services, those with ≥20 years of experience expressed potential deterioration. After adjusting for covariates, more years of experience were significantly related with the expectation of deterioration in the quality of medical services.

OBJECTIVES Our objective was to develop clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures and accompanying photoguides to aid in the assessment of AA-related eyebrow, eyelash and nail signs/symptoms. METHODS Iterative rounds of qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with US expert dermatologists and North American patients with AA. Patients with eyebrow, eyelash and nail involvement were purposefully sampled. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed. RESULTS Dermatologists (n = 10) described eyebrow and eyelash loss as concerning for affected patients and, along with nail appearance, as deserving assessment. Dermatologist data informed the development of single item, 4-point Likert-type ClinRO and PRO measures of current eyebrow loss, eyelash loss and nail appearance and a PRO measure of eye irritation. Patients (n = 45, age 15-72 years) confirmed the importance and relevance of these signs/symptoms. Interim revision resulted in measures that were understood by and relevant to patients. Dermatologists (n = 5) and patients (n = 10, age 21-54 years) participated in the development of the eyebrow, eyelash and nail photoguides and confirmed that they included photos that appropriately represented different severity levels and were helpful to derive and standardize ratings across raters.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of PulseRider for treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysm. METHOD We performed a systematic literature search on articles that evaluate the efficacy and safety of PulseRider-assisted coiling of the wide-necked aneurysm from several electronic databases. The primary endpoint was adequate occlusion, defined as Raymond-Roy Class I + Raymond-Roy Class II upon immediate angiography and at six-month follow-up. RESULTS There were a total of 157 subjects from six studies. The rate of adequate occlusion on immediate angiography was 90% (95% CI, 85%-94%) and 91% (95% CI, 85%-96%) at six-month follow-up. Of these, Raymond-Roy Class I can be observed in 48% (95% CI, 41%-56%) of aneurysms immediately after coiling, and 64% (95% CI, 55%-72%) of aneurysms on six-month follow-up. Raymond-Roy Class II was found in 30% (95% CI, 23%-37%) of aneurysms immediately after coiling, and 25% (17-33) after six-month follow-up. Complications occur in 5% (95% CI, 1%-8%) of the patients. There were three intraoperative aneurysm rupture, three thrombus formation, three procedure-related posterior cerebral artery strokes, one vessel dissection, and one delayed device thrombosis. There was no procedure/device-related death.

101564,The complement lectin pathway after cardiac arrest.,2018,"Sedentary behavior is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, independent of physical activity. The biological mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unknown. We hypothesized that obese subjects with sedentary desk jobs, when assigned a sit-stand desk, will reduce daily sedentary time, and show improvement in arterial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), an early indicator of CVD. Overweight and obese subjects without known CVD were recruited at our institution and given an adjustable sit-stand desk at work. Activities were quantified with an accelerometer for 7 days at baseline and during the intervention. FMD of the brachial and superficial femoral arteries, fasting lipids, insulin and glucose labs, and anthropometrics were measured at baseline, and 12 and 24 weeks. Repeated one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare measurements over time. Fifteen participants were enrolled (93% female, mean age 40 ± 5 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 33 ± 5). Mean daily sedentary time at work decreased by 90 minutes from baseline (385 ± 49 minutes) to 12 weeks (297 ± 80 minutes, p = 0.002) and 24 weeks (295 ± 127 minutes, p = 0.015). Femoral FMD increased from baseline (4.9 ± 1.7%) to 12 weeks (6.4 ± 2.3%, p = 0.043) and further to 24 weeks (8.1 ± 3.2%, p = 0.009). Significant improvement in fasting triglycerides and insulin resistance occurred. There was no change in brachial FMD, exercise activity, step counts, weight, or BMI. A significant reduction in sedentary time during working hours was identified with utilization of a sit-stand desk and sustained over 24 weeks. Improvements in FMD, triglycerides, and insulin resistance provide insight into mechanisms of adverse health risks associated with sedentary behavior.","Bodker, Ariel; Visotcky, Alexis; Gutterman, David; Widlansky, Michael E; Kulinski, Jacquelyn",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x211001934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813968/,401

The awareness of COVID‑19 clinical manifestations can improve the early detection of mild cases, possibly reducing further transmission to colleagues and patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was carried out in March-May 2020, involving medical school physicians in a teaching hospital in northern Italy, with a working population of 881 medical doctors. Data collection was performed using a structured form investigating clinical and epidemiological information. RESULTS One hundred sixty-two medical doctors contacted the Occupational Health Service reporting acute respiratory symptoms or close contact exposure to a confirmed COVID‑19 case. Among the confirmed COVID‑19 cases, most were male doctors during residency, and 85% presented a mild clinical picture. Fever (70.3%) and cough (51.4%) represented the most prevalent symptoms of COVID‑19. As revealed by the univariate analysis, the prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity increased with age (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, p = 0.012), working in a COVID‑19 ward (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.09-10.21, p = 0.031), presenting alteration or loss of smell/taste (OR = 10.00, 95%CI: 2.80-35.69, p < 0.001) and myalgia (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.00-10.26, p = 0.046), while being a resident (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.80, p = 0.030) was associated with reduced odds of being infected, compared to staff physicians. Age and loss of smell/taste were the only factors independently associated with RT-PCR positivity. CONCLUSIONS The majority of COVID‑19 cases showed a mild clinical syndrome, ranging from absence or paucity of symptoms to common cold or influenza-like symptoms.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible effects of paracetamol on cerebral oxygenation and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). Infants with gestational age < 32 weeks with hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) were prospectively studied by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) after the first dose of paracetamol (15 mg/kg) or ibuprofen (10 mg/kg). Cerebral regional oxygenation (rSO2C) and fractional oxygen extraction ratio (FOEC) were recorded 30 min before (T0) and 60 ± 20 min (T1), 180 ± 30 min (T2), and 360 ± 30 min (T3) after the beginning of drug infusion. Moreover, mean flow velocity (Vmean) and resistance index (RI = PSV-DV/PSV) measured with Doppler ultrasound in pericallosal artery were recorded at the same times. Significant changes in rSO2C and FOEC were not found during the study period within and between the groups. Similarly, Vmean did not vary in infants treated with paracetamol or ibuprofen, while RI decreased in the ibuprofen group. CONCLUSION The treatment of hsPDA with paracetamol does not affect cerebral oxygenation in very preterm infants; there were no differences in cerebral oxygenation in infants treated with paracetamol or ibuprofen, although in the ibuprofen group, the possible closure progression of PDA was associated to changes of RI. What is Known: • Paracetamol has similar success rates to indomethacin and ibuprofen in closing PDA with a better safety profile since previous studies did not report adverse effects. What is New: • Paracetamol does not affect cerebral oxygenation and perfusion in very preterm infants with PDA and this confirms its good safety profile.","Dani, Carlo; Poggi, Chiara; Cianchi, Ilaria; Corsini, Iuri; Vangi, Venturella; Pratesi, Simone",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-018-3086-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29372379/,401

Research on T cell immunology in the Ursidae family, especially structural immunology, is still lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular complex pMHC-I, which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex (pAime-128), including the unique pockets in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the pAime-128 to others in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. The interaction between MHC-I and β2m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional (3D) structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family. This article is protected by copyright.

Potential causative factors include anatomic abnormalities such as enlargement of the gastric pouch and gastrojejunostomy (GJ). This report describes endoscopic findings for patients referred for investigation of weight regain and presents the outcomes of revisional therapy for patients with abnormal anatomy. METHODS To evaluate gastric pouch and stoma size, RYGB patients referred for weight regain underwent upper endoscopy. A GJ was defined as enlarged if it had a diameter greater than 2 cm in any dimension, and a pouch was defined as enlarged if its length exceeded 6 cm long or its width exceeded 5 cm. Patients with abnormal anatomy who subsequently underwent revisional procedures were arbitrarily categorized into three groups based on the interval from RYGB to endoscopic evaluation: less than 5 years (group 1), 5 to 10 years (group 2), longer than 10 years (group 3). The percentage of regained weight lost (%RWL) after revision was compared between the groups. RESULTS In this study, 205 RYGB patients (176 women with a mean age of 47 ± 10 years and a current body mass index [BMI] of 43.4 ± 8.4 kg/m(2)) were evaluated. The mean time from primary RYGB was 6.9 ± 3.7 years, and the increase in BMI from its nadir was 9.78 ± 5.80 kg/m(2). Abnormal endoscopic findings (n = 146, 71.2%) included large GJ (n = 86, 58.9%), large pouch (n = 42, 28.8%), or both (n = 18, 12.3%). Of the 205 patients, 51 (24.9%) underwent a revisional surgical or endoluminal procedure. At a mean follow-up assessment 13 months after revision, group 1 (n = 12) had a mean %RWL of 103% ± 89.3%, and 62% of these patients lost all their regained weight. The mean %RWL was 45% ± 12.6% in group 2 (n = 30) and 40% ± 13.6% in group 3 (n = 9). CONCLUSION Endoscopy is a valuable tool for evaluating weight regain after bariatric surgery that can identify abnormal post-RYGB anatomy in a majority of patients. Revisional procedures to restore normal RYGB anatomy appear to be most successful if performed within 5 years after the primary procedure.","Yimcharoen, Panot; Heneghan, Helen M; Singh, Manish; Brethauer, Stacy; Schauer, Philip; Rogula, Tomasz; Kroh, Matthew; Chand, Bipan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1723-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21533520/,401

This single-dose, randomized, crossover study aimed to compare the safety and bioavailability of a new formulation of Gamma Delta Tocotrienol (GDT) in comparison with the existing Tocotrienol-rich Fraction (TRF) in terms of gamma and delta isomers in healthy volunteers. Subjects were given either two 300 mg GDT (450 mg γ-T3 and 150 mg δ-T3) capsules or four 200 mg TRF (451.2 mg γ-T3 &102.72 mg δ-T3) capsules and blood samples were taken at several time points over 24 hours. Plasma tocotrienol concentrations were determined using HPLC method. The 90% CI for gamma and delta tocotrienols for the ratio of log-transformation of GDT/TRF for Cmax and AUC0-∞ (values were anti-logged and expressed as a percentage) were beyond the bioequivalence limits (106.21-195.46, 154.11-195.93 and 52.35-99.66, 74.82-89.44 respectively). The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for Tmax did not show any significant difference between GDT and TRF for both isomers (p > 0.05). No adverse events were reported during the entire period of study. GDT was found not bioequivalent to TRF, in terms of AUC and Cmax. Gamma tocotrienol in GDT showed superior bioavailability whilst delta tocotrienol showed less bioavailability compared to TRF.","Meganathan, Puvaneswari; Jabir, Rafid Salim; Fuang, Ho Gwo; Bhoo-Pathy, Nirmala; Choudhury, Roma Basu; Taib, Nur Aishah; Nesaretnam, Kalanithi; Chik, Zamri",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323969/,401
104142,Beyond the mask: a multidisciplinary reflection on palliating patients with COVID-19 receiving continuous positive airway pressure ventilation.,2020-10-02,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the reference accuracy of articles from a random sample of issues from 1999, 2009, and 2019 of Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport (RQES). Methods: Up to two issues each of RQES published in 1999, 2009, and 2019 were randomly sampled, and references for articles were verified for accuracy. A total of 1,341 references from 50 articles were verified: 1999 (439 references), 2009 (396 references), and 2019 (506 references). Results: The overall error rate was 40% across the three years (i.e., number of references with at least one error divided by the total number of references and multiplied by 100). Chi-square analyses indicated no significant differences between years for the overall error rate (p > .05): 44% (1999), 38% (2009), and 39% (2019). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to author(s) names (p > .05). Chi-square analyses indicated significant differences between years for at least one reference with an error related to the article title. Conclusions: In the author's opinion, an overall error rate of 40% across the three years for RQES is simply too high. Ultimately, it is authors' responsibility to ensure reference accuracy. However, given the unacceptable error rates across fields of study, journals, and publication years, it may be prudent to explore supplemental options to increase reference accuracy in peer-reviewed articles. Reference accuracy is an important issue for authors, editorial offices of journals, and the scientific community.","Logan, Samuel W",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2020.1853019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411576/,401

This is an area of critical and intensive care medicine where there are limited (if any) robust data to guide the development of best practice and where local custom appears to exert a strong influence on patterns of care. We examine aspects of sedation for NIV where the current lack of structure may be contributing to missed opportunities to improve standards of care and examine the existing sedative armamentarium. No single sedative agent is currently available that fulfils the criteria for an ideal agent but we offer some observations on the relative merits of different agents as they relate to considerations such as effects on respiratory drive and timing, and airways patency. The significance of agitation and delirium and the affective aspect(s) of dyspnoea are also considered. We outline an agenda for placing the use of sedation in NIV on a more systematic footing, including clearly expressed criteria and conditions for terminating NIV and structural and organizational conditions for prospective multicentre trials.","Longrois, Dan; Conti, Giorgio; Mantz, Jean; Faltlhauser, Andreas; Aantaa, Riku; Tonner, Peter",Multidisciplinary respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-6958-9-56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25699177/,401
105833,Expert position statements: comparison of recommendations for the care of adults and youth with elevated lipoprotein(a).,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND Albumin is commonly used as a carrier platform for drugs to extend their circulatory half-lives and influence their uptake into tissues that have altered permeability to the plasma protein. The albumin-binding domain (ABD) protein, which binds in vivo to serum albumin with high affinity, has proven to be a versatile scaffold for engineering biopharmaceuticals with a range of binding capabilities. In this study, the ABD protein equipped with a mal-DOTA chelator (denoted ABY-028) was radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga). This novel radiotracer was then used together with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to examine variations in the uptake of the ABD-albumin conjugate with variations in endothelial permeability. RESULTS ABY-028, produced by peptide synthesis in excellent purity and stored at - 20 °C, was stable for 24 months (end of study). [68Ga]ABY-028 could be obtained with labeling yields of > 80% and approximately 95% radiochemical purity. [68Ga]ABY-028 distributed in vivo with the plasma pool, with highest radioactivity in the heart ventricles and major vessels of the body, a gradual transport over time from the circulatory system into tissues and elimination via the kidneys. Early [68Ga]ABY-028 uptake differed in xenografts with different vascular properties: mean standard uptake values (SUVmean) were initially 5 times larger in FaDu than in A431 xenografts, but the difference decreased to 3 after 1 h. Cutaneously administered, vasoactive nitroglycerin increased radioactivity in the A431 xenografts. Heterogeneity in the levels and rates of increases of radioactivity uptake was observed in sub-regions of individual MMTV-PyMT mammary tumors and in FaDu xenografts. Higher uptake early after tracer administration could be observed in lower metabolic regions. Fluctuations in the increased permeability for the tracer across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) direct after experimentally induced stroke were monitored by PET and the increased uptake was confirmed by ex vivo phosphorimaging. CONCLUSIONS [68Ga]ABY-028 is a promising new tracer for visualization of changes in albumin uptake due to disease- and pharmacologically altered vascular permeability and their potential effects on the passive uptake of targeting therapeutics based on the ABD protein technology.","Jussing, Emma; Lu, Li; Grafström, Jonas; Tegnebratt, Tetyana; Arnberg, Fabian; Rosik, Helena Wållberg; Wennborg, Anders; Holmin, Staffan; Feldwisch, Joachim; Stone-Elander, Sharon",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-020-00694-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960353/,401

Methods: Proper face-covering use was documented for all patients entering thirteen different outpatient ophthalmology clinics in Western Pennsylvania in July 2020. Gender and age of all patients were collected. Patients who were not wearing or improperly wearing a face covering were provided one with instructions on proper use. Results: Over 5 days, 43 of 2286 patients (2%) that entered one of the participating clinics were observed not or incorrectly wearing face coverings. The average age of patients who were not correctly wearing a face covering was significantly higher. There was no association between gender and face-covering use. Conclusion: As case counts continue to rise, effective use of face coverings in healthcare settings remains essential. The high percentage of adherence presented in this report is reassuring. However, the elderly, a high-risk population, may require additional, targeted educational measures to increase face-covering adherence.","Parikh, Ankur; Kondapalli, Srinivas",Ophthalmic epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09286586.2020.1866022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369522/,401

Gating is disrupted both in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives, suggesting that gating deficit may represent a biomarker associated with a genetic liability to the disorder. To assess the strength of the evidence for the etiopathogenetic links between genetic variation, gating efficiency, and schizophrenia, we carried out a systematic review of human genetic association studies of sensory gating (suppression of the P50 component of the auditory event-related brain potential) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response). Sixty-three full-text articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. In total, 117 genetic variants were reported to be associated with gating functions: 33 variants for sensory gating, 80 variants for sensorimotor gating, and four variants for both sensory and sensorimotor gating. However, only five of these associations (four for prepulse inhibition-CHRNA3 rs1317286, COMT rs4680, HTR2A rs6311, and TCF4 rs9960767, and one for P50 suppression-CHRNA7 rs67158670) were consistently replicated in independent samples. Although these variants and genes were all implicated in schizophrenia in research studies, only two polymorphisms (HTR2A rs6311 and TCF4 rs9960767) were also reported to be associated with schizophrenia at a meta-analytic or genome-wide level of evidence. Thus, although gating is widely considered as an important endophenotype of schizophrenia, these findings demonstrate that evidence for a common genetic etiology of impaired gating functions and schizophrenia is yet unsatisfactory, warranting further studies in this field.","Rovný, Rastislav; Besterciová, Dominika; Riečanský, Igor",Frontiers in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.550225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324248/,401

Many viruses down-regulate the innate immune responses in order to enhance their virulence. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae is the causative agent of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans with high mortality. Knowledge regarding the innate immune response against CCHFV is most limited. Interestingly, in this study it is shown that replicating CCHFV delays substantially the IFN response, possibly by interfering with the activation pathway of IRF-3. In addition, it is demonstrated that CCHFV replication is almost insensitive to subsequent treatment with interferon-alpha. Once the virus is replicating, virus replication is more or less insensitive to the antiviral effects induced by the interferon. By using an interferon bioassay, it is shown that infected cells secrete interferon relatively late after infection, that is, 48 hr post-infection. In summary, the results suggest the presence of a virulence factor encoded by CCHFV that delays the host defence in order to allow rapid viral spread in the host.","Andersson, Ida; Karlberg, Helen; Mousavi-Jazi, Mehrdad; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Weber, Friedemann; Mirazimi, Ali",Journal of medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.21222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18551619/,401

Failure to achieve a drug response is referred to as clopidogrel resistance. Similarly, a higher activation of platelets during clopidogrel therapy-high on-treatment platelet reactivity-is equivalent to a reduced effectiveness of a therapy. Clopidogrel resistance is considered to be a common and multifactorial phenomenon that significantly limits the efficacy of antiplatelet agents. The aim of the current study is to review the latest literature data to identify the prevalance and predictors of clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity among stroke subjects and to establish the potential impact on clinical outcomes and prognosis. Clinical databases were searched by two independent researchers to select relevant papers on the topic, including all types of articles. Several important predictors contributing to clopidogrel resistance were identified, including genetic polymorphisms, the concomitant use of other drugs, or vascular risk factors, in particular nonsmoking and diabetes. Clopidogrel high on-treatment platelet reactivity has a negative impact on the clinical course of stroke, worsens the early- and long-term prognoses, and increases the risk of recurrent vascular events. Platelet function testing should be considered in selected stroke individuals, especially those predisposed to clopidogrel resistance, for whom an improvement in the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is essential. This particular group may become the greatest beneficiaries of the modification of existing therapy based on platelet function monitoring.","Wiśniewski, Adam; Filipska, Karolina",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899176/,401

In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. RESULTS After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P<0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and <0.001, respectively).

Interestingly, NLRX1 exists in somewhat of an exile from its NLR counterparts with unique features that mediate atypical functions compared to traditional NLRs. Aside from a mitochondrial targeting sequence, the N-terminal region is yet to be characterised. Mitochondrially located, NLRX1 sits within a subgroup of regulatory NLRs responsible for negatively regulating cellular inflammatory signalling. As well as modulating pathogen response, emerging evidence is implicating NLRX1 as a central homeostatic gatekeeper between mitochondrial biology and immunological response. More recently, NLRX1 has been implicated in a wide range of disease, both pathogen-driven and otherwise. Emerging links of NLRX1 in cancer biology, autoimmunity and other inflammatory conditions are raising the potential of targeting NLRX1 therapeutically, with recent studies in inflammatory bowel disease showing great promise. Within this review we address the unique features of NLRX1, its roles in innate immune signalling and its involvement in a range of inflammatory, metabolic and oncology disease indications with a focus on areas that could benefit from therapeutic targeting of NLRX1.","Pickering, Robert J; Booty, Lee M",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314068/,401

Residual samples from Clinic B antigen tests were frozen and later tested on the RP EZ for definitive pathogen identification. Patient data and prescription records were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS A total of 430 patients had RP EZ tests performed, and at least 1 organism was detected in 70.4% of patients. The most common organisms identified were human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. Appropriate treatment occurred for 93.6% of patients when the RP EZ was performed (Clinic A) versus 87.9% of patients who had only antigen tests performed (Clinic B, P = 0.0445). Utilization of RP EZ testing also significantly reduced appointment duration time (48.0 versus 54.9 minutes, P = 0.0009). Three false-positive influenza B results were identified by antigen testing. CONCLUSIONS A point-of-care PCR panel improved patient care by providing an accurate diagnosis and shortened appointment duration.","Beal, Stacy G; Posa, Molly; Gaffar, Maira; Reppucci, Jennifer; Mack, Jasmine A; Gurka, Matthew J; Rand, Kenneth; Houck, Herbert; Kelly, Maria N",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31929382/,401
112924,Closed reduction of distal radius fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Child maltreatment is a worldwide problem, with lifelong consequences for the survivors. The focus is shifting from Child Maltreatment Protection to Child Maltreatment Prevention. The objective of this descriptive study was to assess readiness for child maltreatment among stakeholders before implementation of large-scale prevention programs in Qatar. METHODS The study involved structured interviews with 45 representatives of various stakeholders in sectors of national and local entities of Qatar. A survey was conducted among these stakeholders, to explore their perception and level of awareness of child maltreatment in Qatar. All of them responded, with a response rate of 100%. A multidimensional tool, developed by WHO and collaborators from several middle and low-income countries, was used to assess ten dimensions of readiness. RESULTS Child maltreatment prevention readiness in Qatar is low with a total score of 37.8 on a scale of 0-100. The respondents scored high (≥ 5) in knowledge of child maltreatment (5.3), legislation, mandates and policies (6.8) and informal social resources (non-institutional) (5.6). Participants, however, scored low (≤ 5) in their knowledge about current program implementation and evaluation (1.1), human and technical resources (1.7), institutional resources and links (2.3), material resources (2.8), scientific data on child maltreatment prevention (3.1), attitude towards child maltreatment prevention (4.3) and will to address the problem (4.8). CONCLUSION Child maltreatment prevention readiness in Qatar is low and requires improvement in some of the areas. It highlighted the need for capacity building among organizations across Qatar for a large scale CMP program to be successfully implemented.","Alansari, Khalid; Al Hammadi, Zamzam Saleh; Jilani, Nadeem; Vaux, Heather; Shadaksharaiah, Jyothi H; Al-Eissa, Majid A; Saleheen, Hassan N; Almuneef, Maha",Child abuse & neglect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004212/,401

Six electronic databases were searched. Revman and GRADE were used to assess confidence in pooled effects. Included interventions (N = 1533 participants in total) focused on lifestyle counselling (n = 4 studies), psychology (n = 4 studies), or exercise (n = 10 studies); comparator groups were less intensive usual care. Intensive MDT interventions increased post-operative weight loss (SMD: -0.94; 95% CI: -1.27 to -0.61) if delivered post-operatively. Preoperative and post-operative intensive interventions improved symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, diastolic blood pressure, and resting heart rate but not lipids or glycaemic measures. Whilst usual MDT care is important preoperatively, this review conditionally recommends intensive MDT interventions for enhanced post-operative weight loss if delivered in the post-operative period, led by any health professional, based on moderate evidence. This review also conditionally recommends preoperative and/or post-operative lifestyle, nutrition, or psychology counselling and/or physical activity for improved mental and physical health. Further randomized controlled trials are required, which aim to specifically evaluate the best use of MDT resources.","Marshall, Skye; Mackay, Hannah; Matthews, Charlene; Maimone, Isabella R; Isenring, Elizabeth",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196906/,401

METHOD The review was performed for ASQ- and ASQ:SE-related studies in children from birth to 5 years. From nine databases and 1689 references (published from 1988-2018), 127 articles were included and categorized using Covidence online software. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklists were used before data synthesis. RESULTS US studies primarily use the ASQ/ASQ:SE to detect delays in general and at-risk populations in medical settings, which increases early detection, clinician-referral, and intervention rates. Scandinavian studies commonly use the ASQ/ASQ:SE to monitor developmental-behavioural differences in intervention/exposure-based cohorts. Pre-visit screening yields completion/return rates of 83% to more than 90% and fosters same-day interpretation. When referrals are indicated, systemwide care coordination or colocation with a developmental-behavioural specialist is beneficial. INTERPRETATION Practical implementation lessons are reviewed. Research opportunities include investigating and measuring the ASQ/ASQ:SE's 'overall' sections.

The host polymer is responsible to load/unload siRNA, while the guest polymer is responsible to shield the vehicles from nonspecific cellular uptake, to prolong their circulation time, and to target tumor cells. A series of precisely controlled molecular architectures through a simple assembly process allow for a rapid optimization of siRNA delivery vehicles in vitro and in vivo for therapeutic siRNA-Bcl2 delivery and tumor therapy, indicating the platform is a powerful screening tool for targeted gene delivery vehicles.","Wen, Yuting; Bai, Hongzhen; Zhu, Jingling; Song, Xia; Tang, Guping; Li, Jun",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc2148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832695/,401

It is composed of liquorice extract powder, opioid powder, star anise oil, camphor, and sodium benzoate. The complexity of herbal materials brings a huge challenge in producing compound preparations with stable and uniform quality consistency. OBJECTIVE To establish a new intelligent model for predicting the quality of CLT. METHODS The HPLC fingerprints of raw materials including liquorice extract powder, powdered opium, star anise oil, and sodium benzoate were tested and merged to generate the intelligent mergence fingerprints, whose correlation with the raw materials and the CLT samples was studied. The consistency of the intelligently merged fingerprints with the standard fingerprints was observed by using the systematic quantitative fingerprint method in order to calculate quality evaluation results. RESULTS The intelligent mergence fingerprints covered all the main fingerprint peaks of four raw materials and had a good correlation with the CLT sample fingerprint. There were no significant quality differences either among the six intelligent mergence models obtained by combining different batches of raw materials or between the reference fingerprint of the intelligent mergence connection fingerprints (RFPIMFC ) and the theoretical standard preparation (RFPS ). CONCLUSION The computer-aided model of intelligent mergence fingerprints could be used to predict the quality of herbal compound preparations based on raw materials. In this way, preproduction quality prediction can be realised in order to avoid low-quality medicinal materials and improve the quality consistency among different batches.","Hou, Zhifei; Sun, Guoxiang",Phytochemical analysis : PCA,https://doi.org/10.1002/pca.3053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955089/,401

Escherichia coli is one of the organisms of choice for the production of recombinant antibodies. Variable antibody genes have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of a pair of cysteines. However, the high-level expression of an antibody is an inherent problem to the process of disulfide bond formation, ultimately leading to mispairing of cysteines which can cause misfolding and aggregation as inclusion bodies (IBs). This study demonstrated that fragment antibodies are either secreted to the periplasm as soluble proteins or expressed in the cytoplasm as insoluble inclusion bodies when expressed using engineered bacterial host strains with optimal culture conditions. It was observed that moderate-solubilization and an in vitro matrix that associated refolding strategies with redox pairing more correctly folded, structured, and yielded functionally active antibody fragments than the one achieved by a direct dilution method in the absence of a redox pair. However, natural antibodies have canonical and non-canonical disulfide bonds that need a more elaborate refolding process in the presence of optimal concentrations of chaotropic denaturants and redox agents to obtain correctly folded disulfide bonds and high yield antibodies that retain biological activity.","Ban, Bhupal; Sharma, Maya; Shetty, Jagathpala",Antibodies,https://doi.org/10.3390/antib9030039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764309/,401
121827,In the Limelight: June 2021.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVES Persons who are homeless have significant health challenges and barriers accessing care. Secure messaging supports communication between patients and their providers through a web-based portal, but the acceptability of this technology among patients with high prevalence of substance use disorders (SUDs) is unknown. We examined secure messaging use among veterans with experiences of homelessness (VEHs), and determined factors associated with messaging use. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of responses to a national survey of VEHs, administered by mail from March to October 2018 (response rate = 40.2%). One item assessed secure messaging use and satisfaction. We used multivariable logistic regressions to model secure messaging use, controlling for sociodemographics, medical conditions, housing indicators, and mental health and SUD diagnoses. RESULTS Of 5072 VEHs, 21% had ever used secure messaging and 87% of the subsample found messaging to be useful. Secure messaging was more commonly used by VEHs who were female, had some college education, those with ≥3 chronic medical conditions, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (all P < 0.001). Messaging was much less common for VEHs ages 55 to 64 or older, non-Latino Blacks, those receiving homeless-tailored primary care, and those with SUDs (all P < 0.001). VEHs with opioid use disorder were even less likely than those with other SUDs to use secure messaging (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS Persons with homeless experiences might require assistance to engage with secure messaging technology. As health systems limit in-person care during a national pandemic, alternative solutions may be needed to facilitate health communications and prevent care disruptions for patients experiencing homelessness and SUDs.","Jones, Audrey L; Gelberg, Lillian; deRussy, Aerin J; Varley, Allyson L; Riggs, Kevin R; Gordon, Adam J; Kertesz, Stefan G",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323688/,401

We sought to evaluate the community agreement regarding indications for flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS A portfolio of 35 difficult aneurysm cases was sent to 40 clinicians with varying backgrounds and experience. Responders were asked whether they considered flow diversion a treatment option, whether other options were possible, whether recruitment in a randomized trial would be considered, and to select their final choice. Agreement was studied by using κ statistics. RESULTS Decisions for flow diversion were more frequent (n = 300, 39%) than decisions to coil (n = 163, 21.2%), to observe (n = 121, 15.7%), to occlude the parent vessel (n = 102, 13.2%), or to clip (n = 66, 8.6%). Sidewall aneurysm morphology was associated with flow diversion as the final choice (P = .001). Interjudge agreement was fair at best (κ <0.3) for all cases and all judges, despite high certainty levels (range, 7.2-8.9 ± 2.0 on a 0-10 scale). Agreement was no better within specialties or with more experience. All patients were judged to have other treatment options. Judges were willing to offer trial participation in 417 of 741 (56.3%) scenarios, more frequently when the aneurysm was sidewall (P = .001) or in the anterior circulation (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Individuals did not agree regarding the indications for flow diversion.

METHODS The accuracy of freehand single-pass needle insertions into abdominal phantoms was compared with insertions facilitated with the use of a robotic assistance platform (n = 20 each). Post-procedural CTs were analysed for needle placement error. Percutaneous RFA was simulated by sequentially placing five 17-gauge needle introducers into 5-cm diameter masses (n = 5) embedded within an abdominal phantom. Simulated ablations were planned based on pre-procedural CT, before multi-probe placement was executed freehand. Multi-probe placement was then performed on the same 5-cm mass using the ablation planning software and robotic assistance. Post-procedural CTs were analysed to determine the percentage of untreated residual target. RESULTS Mean needle tip-to-target errors were reduced with use of the IR assistance platform (both P < 0.0001). Reduced percentage residual tumour was observed with treatment planning (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION Improved needle accuracy and optimised probe geometry are observed during simulated CT-guided biopsy and percutaneous ablation with use of a robotic IR assistance platform. This technology may be useful for clinical CT-guided biopsy and RFA, when accuracy may have an impact on outcome.

METHODS The prospective observational multicentre study carried out from 1 March till 30 June 2020 included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy (HFNO). RESULTS Seventy-four patients, 46 males and 28 females, median age 67.5 (Q1-Q3: 56-75) years, were included. Sixty-four patients (86.5%) had comorbidity. Sixty-six patients (89.2%) were mechanically ventilated, four of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. Eight patients (10.8%) were treated with non-invasive ventilation and HFNO only. The median of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 22.5 days. Eighteen patients (24.3%) needed continuous renal replacement therapy. Thirty patients (40.5%) died. Age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital death, and chronic kidney disease showed trend towards statistical significance for poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient number of intensive care beds, organ support equipment and well-trained staff is a decisive factor in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. The study focused on the needs of intensive care in the COVID-19 patients. Advanced age and acute kidney injury were identified as independent predictors for in-hospital mortality. When compared to clinical course and ICU management of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia caused by other pathogens, we observed prolonged need for ventilatory support, high rate of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and significant mortality in studied population.","Džupová, Olga; Moravec, Michal; Bartoš, Hynek; Brestovanský, Peter; Tencer, Tomáš; Hyánek, Tomáš; Beroušek, Jan; Krupková, Zdeňka; Mošna, František; Vymazal, Tomáš; Beneš, Jiří",Central European journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.21101/cejph.a6672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33831279/,401

METHODS A retrospective multicenter cohort study conducted between 18 January and 20 March 2020 including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in three Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination and investigations, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures and status epilepticus. RESULTS We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n=25) or/and stroke (n=10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurological conditions. Non-critical events were seen in less than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in nine. Findings from lumbar puncture in three with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

125525,Factors Influencing the Relationship Between the Functional Movement Screen and Injury Risk in Sporting Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND Although obesity is a well-known risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, evidence is sparse about the effects of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of adverse perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. The current study aims to assess the effect of interpregnancy weight change on the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension, preterm birth, or delivering a large- or small-for-gestational age neonate. METHODS Pubmed, Ovid Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and the Cochrane library were systematically searched up until July 24th, 2019. Interpregnancy weight change was defined as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight of an index pregnancy and a consecutive pregnancy. Inclusion criteria included full text original articles reporting quantitative data about interpregnancy weight change in multiparous women with any time interval between consecutive births and the risk of any perinatal complication of interest. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios and a reference group of - 1 to + 1 BMI unit change between pregnancies were harmonised by meta-analysis. RESULTS Twenty-three cohort studies identified a total of 671,906 women with two or more consecutive pregnancies. Seven of these studies were included in the meta-analysis (280,672 women). Interpregnancy weight gain was consistently associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy induced hypertension and large-for-gestational age births. In contrast, interpregnancy weight loss was associated with a lower risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate. The effect magnitude (relative risk) of interpregnancy weight gain on pregnancy induced hypertension or delivering a large-for-gestational age neonate was greater among women with a normal BMI in the index pregnancy compared to women with a starting BMI ≥25 kg/m2. CONCLUSION These findings confirm that interpregnancy weight change impacts the risk of developing perinatal complications in a subsequent pregnancy. This provides evidence in support of guidelines encouraging women to achieve post-partum weight loss, as their risk of perinatal complications might be minimised if they return to their pre-pregnancy weight before conceiving again.

Although the structure of GP64 in a postfusion conformation has been solved, its prefusion structure and the mechanism of how the protein refolds to execute fusion are unknown. In postfusion structure, GP64 is composed of five domains (domain I-V). Domain IV (374-407 aa) contains two loops (loop 1 and loop 2) that form a hydrophobic pocket at the membrane-distal end of the molecule. To determine the roles of domain IV, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to substitute each of the residues and the contacts within domain IV and evaluate their contributions to GP64-mediated membrane fusion and virus infection. In many cases, substitution of a single amino acid has no significant impact on GP64. However, substitution of R392 or disrupting the contact N381-N385, N384-Y388, N385-W393, or K389-W393 resulted in poor cell surface expression and fusion loss of the modified GP64, whereas substitution of E390 or G391, or disrupting the contact N381-K389, N381-Q401, or N381-I403 reduced the cell surface level of the constructs and the ability of GP64 to mediate fusion pore expansion. In contrast, substitution of N407 or disrupting the contact D404-S406 appears to restrict fusion pore expansion without affecting expression. Combined with the identification of these constructs remaining stable prefusion conformation or dramatically less efficient transition from a prefusion to postfusion state under acidic conditions, we proposed that domain IV is necessary for refolding of GP64 during membrane fusion.Importance Baculoviruses GP64 is grouped with rhabdoviruses G, herpesviruses gB, and thogotoviruses glycoproteins as class III viral fusion proteins. In their postfusion structures, these proteins contain five domains (domain I-V). Distinguished from domain IV of rhabdoviruses G and herpesviruses gB that composed of β-sheets, domain IV of GP64 is a loop region and the same domain in thogotovirues glycorproteins has not been solved. In addition, domain IV is proximal to domain I (fusion domain) in prefusion structures of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gB but resides at the domain I-distal end of the molecule in a postfusion conformation. In this study, we identified that the highly conserved residues and the contacts within domain IV of AcMNPV GP64 are necessary for low-pH triggered conformational change and fusion pore expansion. Our results highlight the roles of domain IV of class III viral fusion proteins in refolding during membrane fusion.","Yu, Qianlong; Bai, Lisha; Ji, Ning; Yue, Xiaorong; Jiang, Yuanyuan; Li, Zhaofei",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01105-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699096/,401
126335,Salpingectomy Compared With Tubal Ligation at Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,2018,"Corticosteroid resistance causes significant morbidity in asthma, and drug repurposing may identify timely and cost-effective adjunctive treatments for corticosteroid resistance. In 95 subjects from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and 19 subjects from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP), corticosteroid response was measured by the change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). In each cohort, differential gene expression analysis was performed comparing poor (resistant) responders, defined as those with zero to negative change in FEV1, to good responders, followed by Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis to identify inversely associated (i.e., negatively connected) drugs that reversed the gene expression profile of poor responders to resemble that of good responders. Mean connectivity scores weighted by sample size were calculated. The top five drug compound candidates underwent in vitro validation in NF-κB-based luciferase reporter A549 cells stimulated by IL-1β ± dexamethasone. In CAMP and SARP, 134 and 178 respective genes were differentially expressed in poor responders. CMap analysis identified 46 compounds in common across both cohorts with connectivity scores < -50. γ-linolenic acid, ampicillin, exemestane, brinzolamide, and INCA-6 were selected for functional validation. γ-linolenic acid, brinzolamide, and INCA-6 significantly reduced IL-1β induced luciferase activity and potentiated the anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone in A549/NF-κB-luc reporter cells. These results demonstrate how existing drugs, including γ-linolenic acid, brinzolamide, and INCA-6, may be repurposed to improve corticosteroid response in asthmatics.","Wang, Alberta L; Panganiban, Ronald; Qiu, Weiliang; Kho, Alvin T; Chupp, Geoffrey; Meyers, Deborah A; Bleecker, Eugene R; Weiss, Scott T; Lu, Quan; Tantisira, Kelan G",Journal of personalized medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11030175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802355/,401

127358,Prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND We undertook a randomized controlled trial to ascertain if single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) was more beneficial for reducing postoperative pain than traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (TLC). Moreover, the influencing factors of SILC were analyzed. METHODS A total of 552 patients with symptomatic gallstones or polyps were allocated randomly to undergo SILC (n = 138) or TLC (n = 414). Data on postoperative pain score, operative time, complications, procedure conversion, and hospital costs were collected. After a 6-month follow-up, all data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS Among SILC group, 4 (2.9%) cases required conversion to TLC. Mean operative time of SILC was significantly longer than that of TLC (58.97 ± 21.56 vs. 43.38 ± 19.02 min, P < 0.001). The two groups showed no significant differences in analgesic dose, duration of hospital stay, or cost. Median pain scores were similar between the two groups 7 days after surgery, but SILC-treated patients had a significantly lower median pain score 6 h after surgery (10-point scale: 3 [2, 4] vs. 4 [3, 5], P = 0.009). Importantly, subgroup analyses of operative time for SILC showed that a longer operative time was associated with greater prevalence of pain score >5 (≥100 min: 5/7 patients vs. <40 min, 3/16 patients, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS The primary benefit of SILC appears to be slightly less pain immediately after surgery. Surgeon training seems to be important because the shorter operative time for SILC may elicit less pain immediately after surgery.","Guo, Wei; Liu, Yang; Han, Wei; Liu, Jun; Jin, Lan; Li, Jian-She; Zhang, Zhong-Tao",Chinese medical journal,https://doi.org/10.4103/0366-6999.171422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26668145/,401

127511,Independent and combined effects of hypertension and diabetes on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study of Huoshen Mountain Hospital and Guanggu Fangcang Shelter Hospital.,2020-12-25,"AIMS Natriuretic peptides are extensively studied biomarkers for atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). Their role in the pathogenesis of both diseases is not entirely understood and previous studies several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NPPA-NPPB locus associated with natriuretic peptides have been identified. We investigated the causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and AF as well as HF using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND RESULTS N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (N = 6669), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (N = 6674), and mid-regional pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (N = 6813) were measured in the FINRISK 1997 cohort. N = 30 common SNPs related to NT-proBNP, BNP, and MR-proANP were selected from studies. We performed six Mendelian randomizations for all three natriuretic peptide biomarkers and for both outcomes, AF and HF, separately. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on multiple SNPs were used as genetic instrumental variable in Mendelian randomizations. Polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with the three natriuretic peptides. Polygenic risk scores were not significantly associated with incident AF nor HF. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant confounding percentages, but no association with PRS. A causal relation except for small causal betas is unlikely. CONCLUSION In our Mendelian randomization approach, we confirmed an association between common genetic variation at the NPPA-NPPB locus and natriuretic peptides. A strong causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and incidence of AF as well as HF at the community-level was ruled out. Therapeutic approaches targeting natriuretic peptides will therefore very likely work through indirect mechanisms.","Geelhoed, Bastiaan; Börschel, Christin S; Niiranen, Teemu; Palosaari, Tarja; Havulinna, Aki S; Fouodo, Césaire J K; Scheinhardt, Markus O; Blankenberg, Stefan; Jousilahti, Pekka; Kuulasmaa, Kari; Zeller, Tanja; Salomaa, Veikko; Schnabel, Renate B","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830215/,401

METHODS 202 severe asthmatics were studied after 12-120 months of step-5 treatment associated to anti-IgE therapy. Following treatments, reversibility tests, after inhaling 400 mcg of Salbutamol, were performed. FEV1 >12% or ≤12% changes differentiated RAO+ from RAO- subjects. Blood eosinophil (BE) counts after treatment were considered. RESULTS Pre-/post-treatment bronchodilator FEV1 % and ACT were lower (61%[50-71], 74.4%[62.5-83.7] and 20[18-22]), whereas BE were higher (380 cells/µL [170-590]) in RAO+ compared to RAO- subjects (77%[64-88], p=0.0001, 81.8%[66.1-94.3], p=0.0001, 21[18-23], p=0.045 and 230 cells/µL [80-360], p=0.003). A negative relationship between SABA-induced FEV1 % changes and pre-bronchodilator FEV1 % (β= -0.551%;p=0.0001) and ACT (β= -0.059;p=0.038) was found. Conversely, post-treatment BE levels were positively related (β=145.565 cells/µL;p=0.003) to FEV1 >12% increases. A rising trend of pre-/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in time was observed in RAO- subjects with BE<300 cells/µL. Conversely, we highlighted significant declining tendencies of pre/post-bronchodilator FEV1 % in RAO+ patients with BE>300 cells/µL reaching lower values after more than 36 months of step-5 treatment (59.6%[39.9-72.1] vs 74[66.5-89.2] of RAO+ individuals with BE<300 cells/µL [p=0.026] and 81.6%[66.1-91.8] of RAO-subjects with BE>300 cells/µL [p=0.009]). CONCLUSION Persistent SABA-induced FEV1 >12%, especially when associated to BE>300 cells/mL, may be a marker of accelerated lung function decline in severe asthmatics despite maximal step-5 treatment. The highest bronchodilation associated to the lowest BE levels should be the main goal of asthma treatment to prevent such decline.","Sposato, Bruno; Scalese, Marco; Ricci, Alberto; Rogliani, Paola; Paggiaro, Pierluigi",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400385/,401

The triangle provides a composite view in three domains of antidepressive activity, side effects, and quality of life. METHOD Within the pharmacopsychometric triangle, the short six-item subscales of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D(17)) and of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C(30)), referred to as HAM-D(6) and IDS-C(6), were focussed on pure antidepressive effect. Side-effects (tolerable vs. intolerable) and quality of life were measured using patient-administered questionnaires. A modified intention to treat sample was used. RESULTS Within the pharmacopsychometric triangle, bupropion-SR (sustained release) was superior to buspirone when augmented to the current citalopram treatment. Thus, in the domain of pure antidepressive effect, bupropion-SR was superior (P = 0.05) on the HAM-D(6), IDS-C(6), and IDS-C(30), but not on the HAM-D(17). In the domain of side effects, the total scores on the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE) were reduced significantly more by bupropion-SR than by buspirone (P = 0.03). In the domain of quality of life, the total scores on the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLES-Q) showed a trend (P = 0.10) from baseline to endpoint of a superiority for bupropion-SR compared with buspirone. CONCLUSION In all domains of the pharmacopsychometric triangle, bupropion-SR was superior to buspirone as augmentation therapy in depressed outpatients not responding to citalopram.","Bech, P; Fava, M; Trivedi, M H; Wisniewski, S R; Rush, A J",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2011.01791.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22077211/,401

We undertook a systematic review of randomised controlled trials aiming to improve dietary intake of complementary foods during infancy (0-24 months). PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycInfo were searched for trials focussed on obesity prevention conducted between January 2000 and August 2019 where dietary intake was an outcome. Two reviewers screened studies and extracted data from selected articles. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2 tools. The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/6srg7/). Seventeen articles from 12 trials were selected for data extraction. Statistically significant group differences in outcomes were observed in 36 of 165 (21.8%) of dietary variables examined. Measurement and analysis of outcomes varied between studies. Overall risk of bias was rated as high, primarily due to missing outcome data. Improving dietary intake at this age appears challenging based on a relatively limited number of studies. Future research could consider dietary pattern analyses, which may provide more meaningful outcomes for this age group.

Submissions consisted of either white or brown broilers. Submitted chickens appeared depressed with ruffled feathers. At necropsy, moderate to severely enlarged and pale kidneys were observed, with gross lesions indicative of dehydration. Microscopically, renal tubules were degenerated and distended with necrotic debris and tubular casts. The kidney parenchyma contained mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates and interstitial edema. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was isolated and identified by reverse transcription quantitative PCR from kidney tissue pools and tracheal swab pools from both cases. Partial sequencing of the S1 hypervariable region was most similar to a local California variant, CA1737. The outbreak lasted roughly 1 wk in both flocks, with 2% total mortality in the brown broilers and 20% total mortality in the white broilers. Final proof of the IBV strains causing nephropathy will require fulfillment of Koch postulates. IBV associated with nephropathy has been sporadically reported in California chicken flocks and represents a significant pathogen due to its potential for inducing high flock mortality. The incidence of IBV associated with a nephropathy diagnosis in chicken necropsy submissions to the CAHFS system-wide from 1998 to 2019 is also reviewed.","Blakey, Julia; Crossley, Beate; Da Silva, Ana; Rejmanek, Daniel; Jerry, Carmen; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; Stoute, Simone",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.4.482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347556/,401

It arises from the host response to infection. Currently, diagnosis relies on nonspecific physiological criteria and culture-based pathogen detection. This results in diagnostic uncertainty, therapeutic delays, the mis- and overuse of antibiotics, and the failure to identify patients who might benefit from immunomodulatory therapies. There is a need for new sepsis biomarkers that can aid in therapeutic decision making and add information about screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of the response to therapy. The host response involves hundreds of mediators and single molecules, many of which have been proposed as biomarkers. It is, however, unlikely that one single biomarker is able to satisfy all the needs and expectations for sepsis research and management. Among biomarkers that are measurable by assays approved for clinical use, procalcitonin (PCT) has shown some usefulness as an infection marker and for antibiotic stewardship. Other possible new approaches consist of molecular strategies to improve pathogen detection and molecular diagnostics and prognostics based on transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolic profiling. Novel approaches to sepsis promise to transform sepsis from a physiologic syndrome into a group of distinct biochemical disorders and help in the development of better diagnostic tools and effective adjunctive sepsis therapies.","Reinhart, Konrad; Bauer, Michael; Riedemann, Niels C; Hartog, Christiane S",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00016-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23034322/,401

A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. METHODS We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. RESULTS Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk. LIMITATIONS The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Yimiao; Jiang, Zhendong; Guo, Suihuai; Wu, Ping; Lu, Qingdong; Xu, Yingying; Liu, Lin; Su, Sizhen; Shi, Le; Que, Jianyu; Sun, Yan; Sun, Yankun; Deng, Jiahui; Meng, Shiqiu; Yan, Wei; Yuan, Kai; Sun, Siwei; Yang, Li; Ran, Maosheng; Kosten, Thomas R; Strang, John; Lu, Yu; Huang, Guofu; Lu, Lin; Bao, Yanping; Shi, Jie",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740639/,401

We evaluated the accuracy of newly developed semiautomatic cerebral aneurysm measurement software, NeuroVision, and explored the value of volume embolization ratio in the prediction of re-treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared software-derived volume measurements of 4 silicone aneurysm models with those calculated with an approximation formula and ground truth values (validation study). We used NeuroVision to retrospectively evaluate outcomes of 100 unruptured aneurysms (97 patients) treated with embolization (clinical study). Aneurysm size (height, width, and neck), volume, and volume embolization ratios were calculated for 3 groups (stable, recanalization, and re-treatment) and were compared. RESULTS This validation study illustrated higher accuracy of NeuroVision in computing aneurysm volume compared with an approximation formula: percentage absolute errors were 4.50% ± 3.18% and 23.07% ± 17.60%, with maximal percentage absolute errors of 8.99% and 45.63%, respectively. Of 100 unruptured aneurysms, 20 recanalized and 12 were re-treated. Average volume embolization ratios of stable and re-treated aneurysms were 24.88% ± 5.91% and 20.50% ± 4.06%, respectively (P ≤ .01). The optimal volume embolization ratio cutoff point for re-treatment was < 19.15%, at which the Youden index was 0.50 (sensitivity, 58.33%; specificity, 87.50%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.74). CONCLUSIONS The NeuroVision software provided accurate aneurysm volume measurements and may be a useful standardized tool to measure aneurysm size and volume, especially for multicenter clinical studies. Volume embolization ratio may be a valuable predictor of aneurysm occlusion changes.","Takao, H; Ishibashi, T; Saguchi, T; Arakawa, H; Ebara, M; Irie, K; Murayama, Y",AJNR.

133048,Predictors of 1-year mortality in adult lung transplant recipients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND Many rectal cancer patients experience tumor downstaging and some are found to achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Previous data suggest that there is an association between the time interval from nCRT completion to surgery and tumor response rates, including pCR. However, these studies have been primarily from single institutions with small sample sizes. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between a longer interval after nCRT and pCR in a nationally representative cohort of rectal cancer patients. STUDY DESIGN Clinical stage II to III rectal cancer patients undergoing nCRT with a documented surgical resection were selected from the 2006 to 2011 National Cancer Data Base. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the nCRT-surgery interval time (<6 weeks, 6 to 8 weeks, >8 weeks) and the odds of pCR. The relationship between nCRT-surgery interval, surgical morbidity, and tumor downstaging was also examined. RESULTS Overall, 17,255 patients met the inclusion criteria. An nCRT-surgery interval time >8 weeks was associated with higher odds of pCR (odds ratio [OR] 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.25) and tumor downstaging (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25). The longer time delay was also associated with lower odds of 30-day readmission (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.92). CONCLUSIONS An nCRT-surgery interval time >8 weeks results in increased odds of pCR, with no evidence of associated increased surgical complications compared with an interval of 6 to 8 weeks. These data support implementation of a lengthened interval after nCRT to optimize the chances of pCR and perhaps add to the possibility of ultimate organ preservation (nonoperative management).","Probst, Christian P; Becerra, Adan Z; Aquina, Christopher T; Tejani, Mohamedtaki A; Wexner, Steven D; Garcia-Aguilar, Julio; Remzi, Feza H; Dietz, David W; Monson, John R T; Fleming, Fergal J",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2015.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26206642/,401

From its origins in traditional laparoscopy, followed rapidly by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, minimally invasive surgery in human medicine has evolved through a number of different platforms that now include single-port approach devices, robotic surgery as well as natural orifice transluminal endosurgery. Whilst some of these remain beyond the reach of veterinary medicine for now, largely because of technical challenges and the prohibitive costs of some single-use disposable components, veterinary minimally invasive surgery is advancing rapidly allowing our small animal patients to benefit from some of the many documented advantages that a minimally invasive approach affords the patient.","Mayhew, P D",The Journal of small animal practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24372087/,401

A prospective randomized controlled study.,2018,"Background and Aims Reduced inhalational anaesthetic requirement in end-stage liver disease during living donor orthotopic liver transplantation (LD-OLT) is due to increased endogenous opioids. This study evaluated the changes in bi-spectral index (BIS) monitored end-tidal desflurane (ETDes) requirements during 'dissection', 'anhepatic', and 'neohepatic' phases of LD-OLT. Methods This prospective, cohort study included 40 adults undergoing LD-OLT under general anaesthesia (GA). All patients received BIS-guided desflurane GA. ETDes requirements in three phases of LD-OLT (primary objective); relationship between inhalational anaesthetic requirements and severity of liver disease; and effect of changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and body temperature on ETDes concentration for all three phases were also evaluated. Results ETDes during the 'dissection' phase (2.92 ± 0.65%) was > 'anhepatic' (2.68 ± 0.85%, P = 0.049) and 'neohepatic' phases (2.58 ± 0.71%, P = 0.005). Patients with model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score < 20 returned significantly greater ETDes than those with MELD score ≥20 during the 'dissection' (MELD <20: 3.11 ± 0.49%; MELD ≥20: 2.58 ± 0.77%, P = 0.01) and 'anhepatic'(MELD <20: 2.96 ± 0.76%; MELD ≥20: 2.17 ± 0.79%, P = 0.003) phases. A positive correlation was observed between ETDes(r = 0.584, P = 0.001) and temperature in the 'dissection' phase only. Conclusion In patients undergoing LD-OLT, BIS monitoring guidance of depth of desflurane GA suggests lower desflurane requirements during 'anhepatic' and the 'neohepatic' phase of surgery. Also, the desflurane requirement is greater in patients with lesser severity of liver disease.","Kumar, Gyanendra; Sethi, Nitin; Pant, Deepanjali; Sood, Jayashree; Singh, Amarjeet; Pandey, Shashank; Dutta, Amitabh",Indian journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.4103/ija.ija_693_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988538/,401

At first, this defect was closed primarily. To prevent perineal hernias, the use of a biological mesh to restore the pelvic floor has been increasing. The aim of this study, was to evaluate the outcome of the use of a biological mesh after ELAPE, APE or PE with/without SR. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on patients who had ELAPE, APE or PE with/without SR with a biological mesh (Permacol™) for pelvic reconstruction in rectal cancer in our center between January 2012 and April 2015. The endpoints were the incidence of perineal herniation and wound healing complications. RESULTS Data of 35 consecutive patients [22 men, 13 women; mean age 62 years (range 31-77 years)] were reviewed. Median follow-up was 24 months (range 0.4-64 months). Perineal hernia was reported in 3 patients (8.6%), and was asymptomatic in 2 of them. The perineal wound healed within 3 months in 37.1% (n = 13), within 6 months in 51.4% (n = 18) and within 1 year in 62.9% (n = 22). In 17.1% (n = 6), the wound healed after 1 year. It was not possible to confirm perineal wound healing in the remaining 7 patients (20.0%) due to death or loss to follow-up. Wound dehiscence was reported in 18 patients (51.4%), 9 of whom needed vacuum-assisted closure therapy, surgical closure or a flap reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS Closure of the perineal wound after (EL)APE with a biological mesh is associated with a low incidence of perineal hernia. Wound healing complications in this high-risk group of patients are comparable to those reported in the literature.","Dijkstra, E A; Kahmann, N L E; Hemmer, P H J; Havenga, K; van Etten, B",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02248-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32514996/,401

METHODS Twenty-three participants took part in this trial with crossover design and performed two experimental sessions in a random order: Body-weight resistance exercise session (BWR) and a control session without exercise. BWR was composed of four exercises: inverted row, squat, , and sit-ups. The participants performed 3 sets of 30 s, in which they were instructed to perform as much repetitions as possible and as fast as possible. After each session, BP and glycemia were measured continuously for 60 min. RESULTS Systolic BP decreased after BWR when compared with control at post 45': -7 (95%CI:-11 to -2) mmHg, p = .003 and post60': -7 (95%CI:-12 to -3) mmHg, p = .003. Diastolic BP decreased after BWR when compared with control at post 15': -6 (95%CI:-9 to -3) mmHg, p < .001; post 30': -6 (95%CI:-9 to -2) mmHg, p = .001; post45': -5 (95%CI:-9 to -2) mmHg, p = .005; and post60': -6 (95%CI: -8 to -3) mmHg, p < .001. No significant difference was found in glycemia between BWR and control sessions. CONCLUSION BWR acutely reduces BP in middle-aged adults with hypertension without effects on usual glycemia responses. This alternative form of resistance training could facilitate access, adherence, and reduce health costs related to exercise programs.","Ferrari, Rodrigo; Cadore, Eduardo Lusa; Périco, Bibiana; Kothe, Gabriela Bartholomay",Clinical and experimental hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2020.1806293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32779534/,401

The roles of CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TCPs are conserved in control of the morphology and size of leaves, petal development, trichome formation and plant flowering. The tight regulation of CIN-like TCP activity at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels are central for plant developmental plasticity in response to the ever-changing environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize recent progresses with regard to the function and regulation of CIN-like TCPs. CIN-like TCPs are regulated by abiotic and biotic cues including light, temperature and pathogens. They are also finely controlled by microRNA319 (miRNA319), chromatin remodeling complexes and auxin homeostasis. The protein degradation plays critical roles in tightly controlling the activity of CIN-like TCPs as well.","Lan, Jingqiu; Qin, Genji",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599902/,401

METHODS This single-site study recruited 18 of 20 study referrals with aortic stenosis undergoing first lifetime SAVR. Subjects completed a home-based type II sleep study. Delirium was assessed postoperative days 1-5. Exact logistic regression was used to determine whether sleep efficiency or apnea/hypopnea index predicts delirium. RESULTS Of 18 study participants, 15 successfully completed a home sleep study (mean age: 71.7 +/- 8.1 years old; 10 male subjects). Five subjects (33.3%) developed delirium. Preliminary analyses found that greater sleep efficiency was associated with a large reduction in delirium odds but was not statistically significant (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.06, 1.03, p = 0.057). The point estimate of the relationship between apnea/hypopnea index and delirium was not similarly sizeable (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 0.35, 3.37, p = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that home type II sleep studies before SAVR are feasible, and they support adequately powered studies investigating type II home sleep studies as a predictor of postoperative delirium and other important postsurgical outcomes.","Oldham, Mark A; Pigeon, Wilfred R; Chapman, Benjamin; Yurcheshen, Michael; Knight, Peter A; Lee, Hochang Benjamin",General hospital psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2021.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932735/,401

They caused a large number of casualties and a wider psychological crisis, which might cause severe consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide. AIMS To reveal the law of formation of public psychological crisis in public health emergencies, and draw lessons from it. To provide ideas for effectively deal with these psychological crisis problems and fundamentally curbing the occurrence of public health emergencies. METHOD Through the method of literature research, 'public health incidents', 'psychological crisis', 'mental health', 'psychological intervention', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'MERS', 'EVD', and 'COVID-19' were used to search literatures in the databases such as PubMed, Springer, and Sciencedirect, and the literatures were summarized, sorted, and studied. RESULTS (1) The public health emergencies caused a universal psychological crisis. The main manifestations were depression, compulsion, despair, etc. The people involved mainly include patients, suspected isolated patients, medical staff, and the general public in the epidemic situation. (2) People's psychological state often experienced stress stage, shock stage, acceptance, and reorganization. Only some susceptible individuals couldn't complete effective psychological reconstruction, resulting in serious psychological disorders. Individual susceptibility is related to genetic factors, adversity, and traumatic stimuli experienced in early life. CONCLUSION To reduce these psychological crisis problems, we should establish and improve the psychological crisis intervention or rescue system of public health emergencies, it was still necessary to live in harmony with nature, get rid of the inappropriate habit of preying on wild animals, in order to prevent the cross-species transmission of the virus between wild animals and humans, and to fundamentally avoid the occurrence of major infectious diseases.","Wang, Zhifeng; Wang, Dongmei",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211002222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722089/,401
141681,Multicomponent Cardiac Rehabilitation and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Stable Angina: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2021-08-01,"In hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection antiviral T cells express the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). Their recruitment to the liver is an important step in the immune response. A 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene leads to reduced expression and total loss of CCR5 in CCR5-n32 heterozygous and homozygous subjects, respectively. However, the role of this mutation for antiviral immunity remains unclear. Here, we analysed proliferation, IFN-gamma and IL-4 secretion (ELISpot) induced by the HCV antigens core, NS3, NS4, and NS5a in 21 anti-HCV-positive haemophiliac patients in relationship to their CCR5 genotypes (CCR5 wildtype n = 10, CCR5-n32 heterozygous n = 5 and CCR5-n32 homozygous n = 6). Furthermore, T cell migration in response to the CCR5 ligands CCL3, -4 and -5 was studied. Overall IFN-gamma responses to HCV proteins were only slightly greater in CCR5 wild-type patients than in CCR5-n32 carriers (0.6 versus 0.24 SFC/10(4) PBMC; p = 0.043). This difference was consistently seen with all tested HCV antigens. In contrast, neither T cell migration, nor PBMC proliferation, nor IL-4 production differed between CCR5 genotypes. Interruption of the CCR5 signalling pathway due to CCR5-n32 may potentially result in subtle reduction of HCV specific IFN-gamma responses in anti-HCV-positive haemophiliac patients.","Ahlenstiel, Golo; Woitas, Rainer P; Iwan, Agathe; Nattermann, Jacob; Feldmann, Georg; Rockstroh, Jurgen K; Oldenburg, Johannes; Kupfer, Bernd; Sauerbruch, Tilman; Spengler, Ulrich",Immunological investigations,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820130802307294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19172482/,401
141693,Consensus on predictors of clinical deterioration in emergency departments: a Delphi process study.,2020-09-17,"Robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) systems present many advantages to the surgeon and patient over open and standard laparoscopic surgery. However, haptic feedback, which is crucial for the success of many surgical procedures, is still an open challenge in RAMIS. Understanding the way that haptic feedback affects performance and learning can be useful in the development of haptic feedback algorithms and teleoperation control systems. In this study, we examined the performance and learning of inexperienced participants under different haptic feedback conditions in a task of surgical needle driving via a soft homogeneous deformable object-an artificial tissue. We designed an experimental setup to characterize their movement trajectories and the forces that they applied on the artificial tissue. Participants first performed the task in an open condition, with a standard surgical needle holder, followed by teleoperation in one of three feedback conditions: (1) no haptic feedback, (2) haptic feedback based on position exchange, and (3) haptic feedback based on direct recording from a force sensor, and then again with the open needle holder. To quantify the effect of different force feedback conditions on the quality of needle driving, we developed novel metrics that assess the kinematics of needle driving and the tissue interaction forces, and we combined our novel metrics with classical metrics. We analyzed the final teleoperated performance in each condition, the improvement during teleoperation, and the aftereffect of teleoperation on the performance when using the open needle driver. We found that there is no significant difference in the final performance and in the aftereffect between the 3 conditions. Only the two conditions with force feedback presented statistically significant improvement during teleoperation in several of the metrics, but when we compared directly between the improvements in the three different feedback conditions none of the effects reached statistical significance. We discuss possible explanations for the relative similarity in performance. We conclude that we developed several new metrics for the quality of surgical needle driving, but even with these detailed metrics, the advantage of state of the art force feedback methods to tasks that require interaction with homogeneous soft tissue is questionable.","Bahar, Lidor; Sharon, Yarden; Nisky, Ilana",Frontiers in neurorobotics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbot.2019.00108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32038218/,401
141966,Spread and adoption of enhanced recovery from elective surgery in the English National Health Service.,2015,"BACKGROUND Although transitional care interventions can improve health among patients hospitalized with acute conditions, few interventions use patient quality of life (QOL) as the primary outcome. Existing interventions use a variety of intervention components, are not effective for patients of all races and ethnicities, do not address age-related patient needs, and do not incorporate the needs of families. The purpose of this study was to systematically review characteristics of transitional care intervention studies that aimed to improve QOL for younger adult patients of all race and ethnicities who were hospitalized with acute conditions. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of empirical literature available in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO by November 19, 2019 to identify studies of hospital to home care transitions with QOL as the primary outcome. Data extraction on study design and intervention components was limited to studies of patients aged 18-64. RESULTS Nineteen articles comprising 17 studies met inclusion criteria. There were a total of 3,122 patients across all studies (range: 28-536). Populations of focus included cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, breast cancer, and kidney disease. Seven QOL instruments were identified. All interventions were multi-component with a total of 31 different strategies used. Most interventions were facilitated by a registered nurse. Seven studies discussed intervention facilitator training and eight discussed intervention materials utilized. No studies specified cultural tailoring of interventions or analyzed findings by racial/ethnic subgroup. CONCLUSIONS Future research is needed to determine which intervention components, either in isolation or in combination, are effective in improving QOL. Future studies should also elaborate on the background and training of intervention facilitators and on materials utilized and may also consider incorporating differences in culture, race and ethnicity into all phases of the research process in an effort to address and reduce any health disparities.","Oyesanya, Tolu O; Loflin, Callan; Byom, Lindsey; Harris, Gabrielle; Daly, Kaitlyn; Rink, Lesley; Bettger, Janet Prvu",Health and quality of life outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01672-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33514371/,401

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

On February 11, 2019, the Internal Committee on Taxonomy of Virus (ICTV) announced the name of the novel virus as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One of the proteins present on its membrane i.e. the Spike protein is responsible for the attachment of the virus to the host. It spreads through the salivary droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The best way to slow down the disease is by protecting self by washing hands and using the disinfectant. Most of the infected people experience mild to moderate breathing issues. Serious illness might develop in people with underlying cardiovascular problems, diabetes and other immuno-compromised diseases. To date, there is no effective medicine available in the market which is effective in COVID-19. However, healthcare professionals are using ritonavir, flavipiravir, lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. Along with the medicines, some countries are using convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells for treatment. Till date, it has claimed millions of death worldwide. In this detailed review, we have discussed the structure of SARS-CoV-2, essential proteins, its lifecycle, transmission, symptoms, pathology, clinical features, diagnosis, prevention, treatment and epidemiology of the disease.","Rehman, Heena; Ahmad, Md Iftekhar",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1080/13813455.2020.1797105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730095/,401

144201,Brief intervention of low carbohydrate dietary advice: clinic results and a review of the literature.,2021-07-23,"BACKGROUND Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) have an influence on metabolism. However, changes in metabolism after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are not clearly known. This study investigated the change in IGFBP3 levels in obesity after bariatric surgery. METHODS We evaluated 36 patients with obesity (14 males, aged 31.36 ± 7.06 years and 22 females, aged 32.55 ± 11.40 years) at baseline and 3 months after SG. Changes in their IGF1, IGFBP3, and IGF1/IGFBP3 ratios and glucose-lipid metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters were measured. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure their IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels. RESULTS (1) IGFBP3 levels were negatively associated with waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (r = - 0.482, P = 0.043; r = - 0.503, P = 0.033); total IGF1 levels were negatively associated with body mass index and WC (r = - 0.569, P = 0.014; r = - 0.470, P = 0.048); and free IGF1 levels were negatively related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level independent of age (r = - 0.544, P = 0.020). Free IGF1 levels were negatively associated with uric acid, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and TNF-α levels (r = - 0.646, P = 0.032; r = - 0.667, P = 0.025; r = - 0.641, P = 0.033; r = - 0.733, P = 0.010) and positively associated with superoxide dismutase activity (r = 0.635, P = 0.036) in females; this relation was not significant in males (all P > 0.05). Total IGF1 was also negatively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) level in females (r = - 0.671, P = 0.024). (2) IGFBP3 level significantly decreased at 3 months after bariatric surgery in females (P < 0.001) but not in males (P = 0.815). Total IGF1 level significantly decreased after bariatric surgery (P = 0.048); the change was also significant in females (P = 0.014) but not in males (P = 0.626). Free IGF1 level after bariatric surgery was not statistically different between males (P = 0.605) and females (P = 0.628). (3) In females, the change in IGFBP3 level was associated with a change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and free fatty acid levels (r = 0.607, P = 0.003; r = 0.546, P = 0.016), and a change in total IGF1 level was associated with a change in CRP level (r = 0.664, P = 0.009). CONCLUSION IGF1 level was related to chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress in obesity, especially in females. IGFBP3 and IGF1 levels decreased in obesity after SG, especially in females. Changes in IGF/IGFBP3 levels were associated with a change in the inflammatory state after surgery.","Wang, Xingchun; Sun, Hang; Ma, BingWei; Gao, JingYang; Yin, Jiajing; Qu, Shen",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04473-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410151/,401

LTLA involves the dissection of splenic suspensory ligaments, which replicates their congenital absence or weakening, present in cases of wandering spleen (WS). WS is a rare condition in which the spleen migrates from the left upper quadrant to a more caudal location in the abdomen. A unique case of WS after LTLA was described by Corcione et al. In this prospective study, we investigated the possibility of WS as a consequence of LTLA. METHODS Twenty-four patients, 8 men and 16 women, who underwent LTLA with the dissection of splenoparietal and splenorenal ligaments were selected. RESULTS Clinical and ultrasonographic follow-up showed no evidence of postoperative WS. CONCLUSIONS In the literature, WS is not commonly reported as a postoperative complication of LTLA. In effect, especially in the case of small adrenal masses, the spleen's repositioning in its seat is autonomous. However, the alarming possibility of WS should not be ignored, especially in the case of extensive dissection of the left colic flexure. It would be useful for other authors to signal this complication, so that different approaches and consequent results may be compared.","Piccoli, Micaela; De Luca, Giuseppe Massimiliano; Pasculli, Alessandro; Angelini, Marta; Guicciardi, Lorenzo; Mullineris, Barbara; Marchi, Domenico; Melotti, Gianluigi",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392630/,401

The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly-linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology-encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co-aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse non-viral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.","Neva, Tania; Gordillo, Ana I Carbajo; Benito, Juan M; Lana, Hugo; Marcelo, Gema; Mellet, Carmen Ortiz; de Ilarduya, Conchita Tros; Mendicuti, Francisco; Garcia Fernandez, Jose M",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202002951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710799/,401

146630,Second Decline in Admissions With Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND When certain complications arise during the second stage of labour, assisted vaginal delivery (AVD), a vaginal birth with forceps or vacuum extractor, can effectively improve outcomes by ending prolonged labour or by ensuring rapid birth in response to maternal or fetal compromise. In recent decades, the use of AVD has decreased in many settings in favour of caesarean section (CS). This review aimed to improve understanding of experiences, barriers and facilitators for AVD use. METHODS Systematic searches of eight databases using predefined search terms to identify studies reporting views and experiences of maternity service users, their partners, health care providers, policymakers, and funders in relation to AVD. Relevant studies were assessed for methodological quality. Qualitative findings were synthesised using a meta-ethnographic approach. Confidence in review findings was assessed using GRADE CERQual. Findings from quantitative studies were synthesised narratively and assessed using an adaptation of CERQual. Qualitative and quantitative review findings were triangulated using a convergence coding matrix. RESULTS Forty-two studies (published 1985-2019) were included: six qualitative, one mixed-method and 35 quantitative. Thirty-five were from high-income countries, and seven from LMIC settings. Confidence in the findings was moderate or low. Spontaneous vaginal birth was most likely to be associated with positive short and long-term outcomes, and emergency CS least likely. Views and experiences of AVD tended to fall somewhere between these two extremes. Where indicated, AVD can be an effective, acceptable alternative to caesarean section. There was agreement or partial agreement across qualitative studies and surveys that the experience of AVD is impacted by the unexpected nature of events and, particularly in high-income settings, unmet expectations. Positive relationships, good communication, involvement in decision-making, and (believing in) the reason for intervention were important mediators of birth experience. Professional attitudes and skills (development) were simultaneously barriers and facilitators of AVD in quantitative studies. CONCLUSIONS Information, positive interaction and communication with providers and respectful care are facilitators for acceptance of AVD. Barriers include lack of training and skills for decision-making and use of instruments.","Crossland, Nicola; Kingdon, Carol; Balaam, Marie-Clare; Betrán, Ana Pilar; Downe, Soo",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-00915-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487226/,401

147802,Attempting to Separate Placebo Effects from Exercise in Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2021-08-27,"INTRODUCTION Seasonal influenza, although often presented as a mild, self-limiting disease, is frequently accompanied by complications that lead to the development of a severe clinical presentation and a fatal outcome. The most common are respiratory complications, with secondary bacterial pneumonia being the leading cause. AIM The aim of this study is to determine the impact of pneumonia on the severity of the clinical presentation and outcome in patients with seasonal influenza. MATERIALS AND METHODS This research is comparatively group-based and has been conducted at the University Clinic for Infectious Diseases and Febrile Conditions during a three-year period. The analysis consists of 122 adult patients with clinically and laboratory-confirmed influenza. Based on the severity of the clinical picture, the patients are divided into two groups, severe (n=87) and mild (n=35) forms of the disease. The study included demographic, general data, clinical symptoms, and signs as well as complications. RESULTS Of 122 patients with seasonal influenza, complications were registered among 108(88.52%), with a significantly more frequent emergence among the group with severe influenza 93.1% vs 77.14% (p=0.012). Pneumonia was the most common 98(80.33%) and had a significant effect on disease severity (p=0.002). Complications from the types of ABI 8(6.56%), ARDS 7(5.74%), sepsis 5(4.1%), DIC 4 (3.28%) and otitis 2(1.64%) were reported only in the group with severe influenza. Acute meningoencephalitis was registered among 5(4.1%), gastroenterocolitis among 3(2.46%), and hepatic damage among 14(11.47%) of patients. CONCLUSION Pneumonia as the most common complication among patients with seasonal influenza significantly impacts the clinical course and outcome of the illness.","Cvetanovska, Marija; Milenovic, Zvonko; Grozdanovski, Krsto; Demiri, Ilir; Spasovska, Katerina; Cvetanovski, Vlatko",Prilozi,https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2020-0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011704/,401
147877,Data quality ofGlasgow Coma Scale and Systolic Blood Pressure in scientific studies involvingphysician-staffed emergency medical services: systematic review.,2020-04-09,"RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing should be routine and robust but is often a bottleneck for biologists because of different and complex analysis programs and reliance on specialized bioinformatics skills. We have developed the '3D RNA-seq' App, an R shiny App and web-based pipeline for the comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data from any organism. It represents an easy-to-use, flexible and powerful tool for analysis of both gene and transcript-level gene expression to identify differential gene/transcript expression, differential alternative splicing and differential transcript usage (3D) as well as isoform switching from RNA-seq data. 3D RNA-seq integrates state-of-the-art differential expression analysis tools and adopts best practice for RNA-seq analysis. The program is designed to be run by biologists with minimal bioinformatics experience (or by bioinformaticians) allowing lab scientists to analyse their RNA-seq data. It achieves this by operating through a user-friendly graphical interface which automates the data flow through the programs in the pipeline. The comprehensive analysis performed by 3D RNA-seq is extremely rapid and accurate, can handle complex experimental designs, allows user setting of statistical parameters, visualizes the results through graphics and tables, and generates publication quality figures such as heat-maps, expression profiles and GO enrichment plots. The utility of 3D RNA-seq is illustrated by analysis of data from a time-series of cold-treated Arabidopsis plants and from dexamethasone-treated male and female mouse cortex and hypothalamus data identifying dexamethasone-induced sex- and brain region-specific differential gene expression and alternative splicing.","Guo, Wenbin; Tzioutziou, Nikoleta A; Stephen, Gordon; Milne, Iain; Calixto, Cristiane Pg; Waugh, Robbie; Brown, John W S; Zhang, Runxuan",RNA biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2020.1858253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345702/,401

148913,"β-Thalassemia Major and Coronavirus-19, Mortality and Morbidity: a Systematic Review Study.",2020-12-14,"One of the challenges in speech perception is that listeners must deal with considerable segmental and suprasegmental variability in the acoustic signal due to differences between talkers. Most previous studies have focused on how listeners deal with segmental variability. In this EEG experiment, we investigated whether listeners track talker-specific usage of suprasegmental cues to lexical stress to recognize spoken words correctly. In a three-day training phase, Dutch participants learned to map non-word minimal stress pairs onto different object referents (e.g., USklot meant ""lamp""; usKLOT meant ""train""). These non-words were produced by two male talkers. Critically, each talker used only one suprasegmental cue to signal stress (e.g., Talker A used only F0 and Talker B only intensity). We expected participants to learn which talker used which cue to signal stress. In the test phase, participants indicated whether spoken sentences including these non-words were correct (""The word for lamp is…""). We found that participants were slower to indicate that a stimulus was correct if the non-word was produced with the unexpected cue (e.g., Talker A using intensity). That is, if in training Talker A used F0 to signal stress, participants experienced a mismatch between predicted and perceived phonological word-forms if, at test, Talker A unexpectedly used intensity to cue stress. In contrast, the N200 amplitude, an event-related potential related to phonological prediction, was not modulated by the cue mismatch. Theoretical implications of these contrasting results are discussed. The behavioral findings illustrate talker-specific prediction of prosodic cues, picked up through perceptual learning during training.","Severijnen, Giulio G A; Rutger Bosker, Hans; Piai, Vitória; McQueen, James M",Brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2021.147605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34363790/,401

There is no effective intervention for the severe patients, and their prognosis is poor. It is worth noting that in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put equal emphasis on both Chinese and Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the whole process. It is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, information was collected from 444 severe COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a hospital designated to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. We collected traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for patients with severe COVID-19, referred to Chinese Pharmacopoeia to standardize the names of traditional Chinese medicine, and extract the property, flavor and channel tropism of traditional Chinese medicines to analyze the rules of the prescriptions. IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 software was used to conduct correlation analysis of traditional Chinese medicine. Effective traditional Chinese medicines against COVID-19 was identified by the TCMATCOV platform. In the end, 1 532 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the high-frequency drugs are Poria, Astragali Radix, Pogostemonis Herba, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ephedrae Herba, Cinna-momi Ramulus. Most of the drugs have the following functions: resolving dampness, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma. The core combinations are Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Astragali Radix-Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Pogostemonis Herba, Amomi Fructus-Astragali Radix. The majority of the medicines are with cold and warm properties, and the proportions are 41.03% and 38.46%, respectively. The medicinal flavors are mainly concentrated in sweet and bitter, and the proportions are 34.71% and 30.58%, respectively. The meridian of the drug is more into the lung, stomach and spleen, with lung accounting for 22.87%. From the analysis of high-frequency drugs to the core combinations, one can see that the main treatment principle for severe COVID-19 is to remove internal and external dampness, protect the spleen and stomach, remove evil energy, and support righteousness. TCMATCOV platform was used to calculate the network disturbances of the high-frequency drugs. It was found that the traditional Chinese medicine with a high disturbance score accounted for a high proportion of the classic anti-COVID-19 prescriptions used by clinicians. Among them, the drugs with top scores are Ephedrae Herba, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Eupatorii Herba, Platycodonis Radix, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Astragali Radix, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pogostemonis Herba, Scutellariae Radix. After a further exploration of the action targets, it was showed that disease-specific factor TNF was the target of the above ten drugs, and traditional Chinese medicine can exert anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects.","Wang, Chuan; Ming, Hao; Jia, Wen; Su, Wen; Zhan, Li-Rui; Luo, Dan; Yang, Jia-Yao",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200427.501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726005/,401
149704,Harms and Benefits of Subcutaneous Hydration in Older Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2020-12-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are typically caused by multifactorial events including mutations in a large number of genes. Epigenetic-derived modifications in the cells are normal but can be amended by aging, lifestyle, and exposure to toxic substances. Major epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling as well as the noncoding RNAs. These pivotal players are involved in the epigenetic-induced modifications observed during CVDs. Nevertheless, despite impressive efforts capitalized in epigenetic research in the last 50 years, clinical applications are still not satisfactory. RECENT FINDINGS Briefly, we present some of the recent steps forward in the epigenetic studies of CVDs. There is an increased appreciation for the contribution of epigenetic alterations in the development of CVDs. Now, we have novel epigenetic biomarkers and therapeutic trials with the use of statins, metformin, and some compounds affecting epigenetic pathways including a BET inhibitor apabetalone. The new knowledge of epigenetic regulation is also discussed in the light of precision medicine of CVDs. SUMMARY Epigenetic studies of CVDs have the promise to yield both mechanistic insights as well as adjunct treatments (repurposed drugs and apabetalone). The overall concept of precision medicine is not widely recognized in routine medical practice and the so-called reductionist approach remains the most used way to treat CVD patients.","Napoli, Claudio; Coscioni, Enrico; de Nigris, Filomena; Donatelli, Francesco",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605616/,401

Variation in data acquisition, analysis, and reporting exists and impacts on diagnosis and management. AIMS AND METHODS This study examined variation in esophageal manometry methodology between institutions to establish the status in current practice. A structured survey was distributed through international NGM societies using an Internet-based platform. Questions explored infrastructure, technology, analysis, and reporting. KEY RESULTS Responses were received from 91 centers from 29 countries. Eighteen (20%) centers used ""conventional"" manometry, 75 (82%) high-resolution manometry, and 53 (58%) HR impedance manometry. All centers documented motility for single water swallows. The Chicago Classification was applied by 65 (71.4%) centers. In contrast, analysis of EGJ morphology varied widely. Adjunctive testing was often applied: multiple rapid swallows (77%), rapid drink challenge (77%), single solid swallows (63%), and a standard test meal (18%). Of 86 (94.5%) units that offered pH impedance (pH-Z) studies, approximately half (53.5%) performed tests on acid-suppressant medication in patients with a high pretest probability (eg, erosive esophagitis). Most (75.6%) centers manually reviewed every reflux event. Others examined pH-Z data only prior to symptoms. To assess symptom association with reflux events, 73.6% centers analyzed each symptom separately, whereas 29.7% centers pooled symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES There is marked variation in the data acquisition, analysis, and reporting of esophageal manometry studies. Further efforts to improve quality and uniformity in testing and reporting are required. This survey provides information upon which best-practice guidelines can be developed.","Sweis, R; Heinrich, H; Fox, M",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28948708/,401

153411,Comparison of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Adults During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak and Over the Same Time Period for the Preceding 3 Years.,2020-12-17,"PURPOSE Although diabetes care guidelines recommend paying attention to oral health, the effect on daily practice has been limited, and patients with diabetes have yet to benefit. We investigated whether implementation of an oral care protocol for general practitioners (GPs [family physicians]) can improve patient-centered outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Twenty-four GP offices were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group (12 offices each). In the experimental group, GPs and nurse practitioners implemented an oral care protocol. No extra attention was given to oral health in the control group. The primary outcome parameter was oral health-related quality of life (QoL) assessed with the 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile at baseline and 1 year later. Other outcomes were self-reported oral health complaints and general health-related QoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey). RESULTS Of 764 patients with type 2 diabetes, 543 (71.1%) completed the 1-year follow-up. More patients reported improved oral health-related QoL in the experimental group (35.2%) compared to the control group (25.9%) (P = .046; P adj = .049). In a secondary post hoc analysis including GP offices with ≥60% patient follow-up (n = 18), improvement was 38.3% and 24.9%, respectively (P and P adj = .011).

153685,Efficacy and effectiveness of psychological interventions on co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-12-23,"OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of survival, stroke, atrial fibrillation, structural valve deterioration, and length of hospital stay after surgical replacement of an aortic valve (SAVR) with a bioprosthetic valve in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PubMed (non-Medline records only), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane CENTRAL from 2002 to June 2016. STUDY SELECTION Eligible observational studies followed patients after SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve for at least two years. METHODS Reviewers, independently and in duplicate, evaluated study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for patient important outcomes. We used the GRADE system to quantify absolute effects and quality of evidence. Published survival curves provided data for survival and freedom from structural valve deterioration, and random effect models provided the framework for estimates of pooled incidence rates of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS In patients undergoing SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve, median survival was 16 years in those aged 65 or less, 12 years in those aged 65 to 75, seven years in those aged 75 to 85, and six years in those aged more than 85. The incidence rate of stroke was 0.25 per 100 patient years (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.54) and atrial fibrillation 2.90 per 100 patient years (1.78 to 4.79). Post-SAVR, freedom from structural valve deterioration was 94.0% at 10 years, 81.7% at 15 years, and 52% at 20 years, and mean length of hospital stay was 12 days (95% confidence interval 9 to 15). CONCLUSION Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing SAVR with a bioprosthetic valve can expect only slightly lower survival than those without aortic stenosis, and a low incidence of stroke and, up to 10 years, of structural valve deterioration. The rate of deterioration increases rapidly after 10 years, and particularly after 15 years.","Foroutan, Farid; Guyatt, Gordon H; O'Brien, Kathleen; Bain, Eva; Stein, Madeleine; Bhagra, Sai; Sit, Daegan; Kamran, Rakhshan; Chang, Yaping; Devji, Tahira; Mir, Hassan; Manja, Veena; Schofield, Toni; Siemieniuk, Reed A; Agoritsas, Thomas; Bagur, Rodrigo; Otto, Catherine M; Vandvik, Per O",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.i5065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27683072/,401
154046,The effect of ischemic preconditioning on redox status during liver resections--randomized controlled trial.,2011,"PURPOSE The aim of the current study was to directly investigate whether active gas suction reduces intraperitoneal residual carbon dioxide and to analyze the effect of active gas suction on postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS This prospective, randomized clinical study included patients between 19 and 65 years of age with gallbladder disease who were eligible for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were allocated into either the natural evacuation group (NE group) or the active suction group (AS group). In the AS group, active suction was applied by inserting the laparoscopic suction irrigation device through a 5-mm trocar for 60 seconds at the end of surgery. A chest X-ray was taken at postoperative Day 1, and the residual intraabdominal gas volume was measured. Perioperative data including pain score and analgesic requirement were collected. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were allocated to the NE group, and 36 were allocated to the AS group. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic data and operative findings. However, a significant difference was observed in the residual intraperitoneal gas volume, with 15.9±6.8 mL in the NE group and 6.7±4.0 mL in the AS group (P<.001). Significant differences were also observed in the pain scores measured 6 hours after surgery, on postoperative Day 1, and on postoperative Day 2. CONCLUSIONS Active gas suction is a very simple procedure that is safe and feasible. Performing this procedure significantly decreases the residual intraperitoneal gas volume and postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.","Lee, Jun Suh; Kim, Eun Young; Lee, Soo Ho; Han, Jae Hyun; Park, Sung Kyun; Na, Gun Hyung; You, Young Kyoung; Kim, Dong Goo; Hong, Tae Ho",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

154321,Nutrition interventions implemented in hospital to lower risk of sarcopenia in older adults: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials.,2020-02-01,"INTRODUCTION Hearing loss is a major public health concern, affecting over 11 million people in the UK. While hearing aids are the most common clinical intervention for hearing loss, the majority of people that would benefit from using hearing aids do not take them up. Recent technological advances have led to a rapid increase of alternative listening devices to conventional hearing aids. These include hearing aids that can be customised using a smartphone, smartphone-based 'hearing aid' apps, personal sound amplification products and wireless hearing products. However, no systematic review has been published evaluating whether alternative listening devices are an effective management strategy for people with hearing loss. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The objective of this systematic review is to assess whether alternative listening devices are an effective intervention for adults with hearing loss. Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Retrospective or prospective studies, randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, and before-after comparison studies will be eligible for inclusion. We will include studies with adult participants (≥18 years) with a mild or moderate hearing loss. The intervention should be an alternative listening device to a conventional hearing aid (comparison). Studies will be restricted to outcomes associated with the consequences of hearing loss. We will search relevant databases to identify published, completed but unpublished and ongoing trials. The overall quality of included evidence will be evaluated using the GRADE system, and meta-analysis performed if appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical issues are foreseen. The findings will be reported at national and international conferences, primarily audiology, and ear, nose and throat, and in a peer-reviewed journal using the PRISMA guidelines.

154496,Management of Critically Ill Adults With COVID-19.,2020-03-26,"The lack of complete information on the immune response dynamics to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the use of mainly molecular tests such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to diagnose Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). Although remarkable progress has been made in developing effective RT-PCR kits, the lack of specific equipment required to perform this technique in all clinical laboratories limits its widespread use. In the case of COVID-19, these tests can be used for the triage of symptomatic patients, for testing the contacts of confirmed cases, and also for the analysis and monitoring of the situation. Along with molecular tests involving reverse transcription PCR, various laboratory tests can identify the specific anti-viral antibodies or viral antigens. This review seeks to describe the targets and diagnostic methods available or currently in development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), serologic immunoassays (SIA) and the protein microarray method (PMM). Knowing the specific targets and the sensitivity of each assay used for COVID-19 diagnosis can lead to more efficient detection of infected patients and it can provide better management of the pandemic status.","Bostan, Marinela; Ataman, Marius; Bostan, Ioana Stefania; Bleotu, Coralia",Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1080/15321819.2020.1862866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539260/,401

Factors related to resources and technological and organizational capabilities are also considered. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB), results confirm that firms involved in CE have a higher probability to generate green jobs. Reusing, redesign and reducing practices are positively related to the number of green jobs. When we consider separately different CE actions, energy efficiency and minimising waste have a positive relationship with the number of green jobs, while recycling practices are not relevant. Reusing materials and redesign are both positively associated with the probability to have green employment and with the number of green jobs. Concerning firm resources and capabilities, larger firms have a higher probability to be in the group of firms with green jobs. As well, firms' technological capabilities, openness to external sources of knowledge and green products and services specialization are crucial not only for the probability but also for having a greater number of green jobs.","Moreno-Mondéjar, Lourdes; Triguero, Ángela; Cuerva, María C",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351301/,401

This process has many benefits to offer, with a successful application often associated with increased renewable energy potential, outweighing constraints associated with the variability of food waste and its handling requirements prior to co-digestion. With both regulations and water infrastructures designed and constructed on the basis of linear views and sectorial requirements and conditions and technologies from the past in many parts of the world, in the UK, sewage sludge and food waste digestion operations are also under very different regulatory and management regimes. With sustainability requiring that we do not address single issues in isolation, but through a systems approach that delivers integrated solutions, co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge could become such a solution. If carefully applied, co-digestion can deliver beneficial synergies for the water industry and authorities responsible for food waste management. The collaboration of all relevant stakeholders and regulators to support changes to current regulatory frameworks to enable this, is proposed as the way forward, particularly as their complexity has been identified as the major hurdle to the implementation of co-digestion in the UK.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Ohandja, Dieudonné-Guy; Voulvoulis, Nikolaos",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.07.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22940124/,401
155878,Global patterns of mortality in international migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"CONTEXT Pioneering empirical studies show that people bereaved due to COVID-19 experience elevated prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptom levels, which relate to functional impairment. However, studies focused on Western samples and multivariate analyses of relations between potential risk factors and mental health in this population are lacking. OBJECTIVES To assess the mental health of Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19. To elucidate the associations of demographic and loss-related characteristics with mental health after COVID-19 bereavement. METHODS Four hundred twenty-two Chinese adults (56% male; Mean age: 32.73 years) recently bereaved due to COVID-19 completed an online survey. Demographic and loss-related characteristics and prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were assessed. RESULTS Clinically relevant prolonged grief (49%, n=207), posttraumatic stress (22%, n=92), depressive (70%; n=294), and anxiety symptoms (65%; n=272) were reported by a substantial group of participants. In four multiple regressions predicting each mental health indicator, Fs(15,406) = 5.08-7.74, ps < 0.001, loss-characteristics (i.e., a shorter time since loss, βs= -.12-.11, loss of a first-degree relative, βs= .18-.37) and subjective loss experiences (i.e., feeling traumatized by the loss, βs= .13-.18, or a close and/or conflictual relation with the deceased, βs= .12-.23) related most consistently to mental health problems. CONCLUSION Many Chinese adults bereaved due to COVID-19 experience severe mental health problems. The recent loss of first-degree relatives, feeling traumatized by the loss, and having a close and/or conflictual relationship with the deceased may elevate risk for these mental health problems, which could require indicated psychological treatment.","Tang, Suqin; Yu, Yi; Chen, Qianxin; Fan, Meilong; Eisma, Maarten C",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.02.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662513/,401

METHODS One hundred and ninety-two female patients scheduled to undergo general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for thyroidectomy were enrolled in this prospective study. Participants were randomly allocated to receive intravenous medication; placebo (Group C, n = 45), ketorolac 30 mg immediately before intubation (Group Kpre, n = 47), ketorolac 30 mg at the end of surgery (Group Kpost, n = 45) and dexamethasone 10 mg (Group D, n = 43). The incidence and severity of POST and hoarseness were evaluated at 1, 6 and 24 hours after surgery. RESULTS Incidences and severities of POST at rest and during swallowing in first 6 hours after extubation were comparable among 4 groups. At 24 hours postextubation, the incidence (P = 0.002, 95% CI of proportion differences; 0.05-0.39) and severity (P = 0.008) of POST during swallowing were significantly lower in group D than in group C. Kpre and Kpost groups did not show a greater reduction in POST than group C, despite lower rescue analgesic requirement at 1 hour after extubation in group Kpre (P = 0.006; 95% CI of proportion differences; 0.07-0.38). No intergroup differences were observed in incidences of hoarseness or adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous administration of dexamethasone 10 mg, but not ketorolac, before induction of anesthesia reduces the incidence and severity of POST during swallowing at 24 hours after thyroidectomy.","Yang, Chunwoo; Jung, Sung Mee; Bae, Yu Kyung; Park, Sang-Jin",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.4097/kjae.2017.70.1.64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28184269/,401
156138,Predictive value of indicators for identifying child maltreatment and intimate partner violence in coded electronic health records: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-08-11,"Introduction Unilateral neglect is a debilitating condition that can occur after stroke and can affect a variety of domains and modalities, including proprioception. Proprioception is a sensorimotor process essential to motor function and is thus important to consider in unilateral neglect. To date, there has not been a comprehensive review of studies examining the various aspects of proprioceptive impairment in unilateral neglect after stroke. This review aimed to determine if people with unilateral neglect have more severe proprioceptive impairments than those without unilateral neglect after stroke. Methods The MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to September 2019 using an a priori search strategy. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts, and extracted data from the included full texts. A third reviewer resolved disagreements at each step. Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS Quality Assessment tool. Results A total of 191 abstracts were identified, with 56 eligible for full-text screening. A total of 18 studies were included in the review and provided evidence that people with unilateral neglect have more severe proprioceptive impairment than people without unilateral neglect. This impairment is present in multiple subtypes of unilateral neglect and aspects of proprioception. Most studies had a moderate risk of bias. Conclusion People with unilateral neglect after stroke are more likely to have impaired processing of multiple types of proprioceptive information than those without unilateral neglect. However, the available evidence is limited by the large heterogeneity of assessment tools used to identify unilateral neglect and proprioception. Unilateral neglect and proprioception were rarely assessed comprehensively.PROSPERO Registration: CRD42018086070.","Fisher, Georgia; Quel de Oliveira, Camila; Verhagen, Arianne; Gandevia, Simon; Kennedy, David",SAGE open medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050312120951073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32913649/,401
156274,No difference in union and recurrence rate between iliac crest autograft versus allograft following medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy: a randomized controlled trial.,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND As ≥30% of displaced pediatric forearm fractures demonstrate loss of reduction (LOR) following closed reduction (CR); radiographic follow-up is advocated at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks for detection of redisplacement. We hypothesized that there is minimal change in fracture alignment 2 weeks after CR, and consequently, that radiographs at 4 weeks add cost but little value to clinical care. METHODS A total of 184 patients enrolled in a prospective study of pediatric forearm fractures including both distal and diaphyseal injuries were evaluated. All were treated with CR, casting, and radiographic evaluation at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postinjury. Primary endpoint was radiographic LOR. Secondary endpoint was need for any intervention. A modified number-needed to treat analysis estimated the utility of the week 4 x-ray in predicting intervention. Relative value unit (RVU) costing, time-derived activity-based costing (TDABC), and billing totals were used for cost analysis. RESULTS Seventy patients (38%) demonstrated radiographic LOR. Independent predictors of LOR were initial radius displacement >75% (OR=5.40; CI, 2.23-12.60), concomitant ulna fracture (OR=1.71; CI, 1.15-2.54), and dominant arm involvement (OR=2.87; CI, 1.40-5.87). Eighty percent of all LORs occurred within the first 2 weeks. There was no statistically significant change in radiographic alignment after week 2. Of 40 total interventions, all were performed within the first 2 weeks of follow-up. The 4-week x-ray did not influence decision to intervene, and at most, 1 in every 40 patients would require an intervention after week 2. Elimination of the 4-week x-ray would result in a savings of 4.8% (RVU method) to 11.9% (TDABC method) in the overall cost of nonoperative fracture care. CONCLUSIONS There is minimal change in fracture alignment 2 weeks following CR of pediatric forearm fractures, and all interventions are based on early radiographic follow-up. The week 4 x-ray adds little value to clinical decision making, and its elimination would result in savings up to 11.9% of the overall cost of nonoperative fracture care.

Assessing the impact of agronomic management practices on seed yield, grain quality and soil fertility is a critical step in understanding nutrient use efficiency. RESULT The comprehensive evaluation index had good fitness to that of single attribute, indicating that the comprehensive evaluation index was superior and reliable. Applying controlled release urea (rice in wheat and oilseed rape field: 150 kg N ha-1 , the other crops: 120 kg N ha-1 ) plus common urea (30 kg N ha-1 ) incorporated with straw from the previous season across the growing season for cereal and oilseed crop showed a slight improvement in seed productivity and N use efficiency among three cropping systems in the traditional evaluation method. Compared with the local farm practice (applying common urea of 150 kg N ha-1 ), applying the practices in combination based on the outcome of the comprehensive evaluation index method decreased the seed yield by -1.27~29.8%, but improved quality and soil fertility for paddy-upland cropping system, respectively. CONCLUSION Properly managing N application by applying partial and full controlled release urea with or without straw incorporation for a specific crop system has the potential to be a better compromise among yield, grain quality and soil fertility in southern China.

Firstly, the device architecture, mainly consists of a polymer hair post, a silicon micro signal transducer and a glass substrate, is described, the theoretical simplified model is established and the mechanical sensitivity to air flow is deducted. Then, the structure simulations based on Ansys software are implemented to preliminarily verify the feasibility of the proposed sensor conception and optimize the structure parameters simultaneously. Subsequently, a closed-loop control scheme based on digital phase-locked loop and an amplitude demodulation algorithm of oscillatory flow velocity based on the least mean square method are proposed to transform and extract the air flow signal, and then verify it by circuit simulations based on SIMULINK. Finally, the fabricated prototype is illustrated and comprehensively tested. The tested prototype possesses an x-axis scale factor of 1.56 Hz/(m/s)2 and a y-axis scale factor of 1.81 Hz/(m/s)2 for the steady air flow and an x-axis detection threshold of 43.27 mm/s and a y-axis detection threshold of 41.85 mm/s for the oscillatory air flow.","Liang, Zhuoyue; Guo, Xin; Yang, Bo; Zhang, Ting",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796667/,401

Understanding environmental factors affecting the attachment and the early stages of the biofilm development will help develop methods of controlling the biofilm growth. Here, we show that biofilm formation is strongly affected by the flows in thin layers of bacterial suspensions controlled by surface waves. Deterministic wave patterns promote the growth of patterned biofilms, while wave-driven turbulent motion discourages patterned attachment of bacteria. Strong biofilms form under the wave antinodes, while inactive bacteria and passive particles settle under nodal points. By controlling the wavelength, its amplitude, and horizontal mobility of the wave patterns, one can shape the biofilm and either enhance the growth or discourage the formation of the biofilm. The results suggest that the deterministic wave-driven transport channels, rather than hydrodynamic forces acting on microorganisms, determine the preferred location for the bacterial attachment.","Hong, Sung-Ha; Gorce, Jean-Baptiste; Punzmann, Horst; Francois, Nicolas; Shats, Michael; Xia, Hua",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766446/,401

Within this context, three distinct entities are recognized, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Management options for each of these disorders are now reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS A recent pilot study and subsequent phase II trial suggest that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors hold promise in treating IPS. A randomized phase III trial ended prematurely, without a definitive conclusion regarding TNF inhibitors established. Few prospective trials for BOS have been performed, with current therapy based on observational studies and small case reports. Therapy for BOOP is based upon minimal clinical evidence. SUMMARY Although corticosteroids remain the backbone of therapy for IPS, BOS, and BOOP, TNF inhibition may augment management of IPS and potentially BOS as well. Diagnostic criteria for IPS and BOS have been established, although optimal treatment strategies will ultimately require consensus monitoring and response criteria, coupled with an improved understanding of the pathophysiology underlying each disorder. For BOS and BOOP in particular, therapy has been based upon a paucity of data and anecdotal experiences.","Yanik, Gregory; Kitko, Carrie",Current opinion in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0b013e32835dc8a5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23340330/,401

Stroke centers worldwide were surveyed regarding typical imaging used to work up representative acute stroke patients, make treatment decisions, and willingness to enroll in clinical trials. METHODS STroke Imaging Research and Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive-Imaging circulated an online survey of clinical case vignettes through its website, the websites of national professional societies from multiple countries as well as through email distribution lists from STroke Imaging Research and participating societies. Survey responders were asked to select the typical imaging work-up for each clinical vignette presented. Actual images were not presented to the survey responders. Instead, the survey then displayed several types of imaging findings offered by the imaging strategy, and the responders selected the appropriate therapy and whether to enroll into a clinical trial considering time from onset, clinical presentation, and imaging findings. A follow-up survey focusing on 6 h from onset was conducted after the release of the positive endovascular trials. RESULTS We received 548 responses from 35 countries including 282 individual centers; 78% of the centers originating from Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States. The specific onset windows presented influenced the type of imaging work-up selected more than the clinical scenario. Magnetic Resonance Imaging usage (27-28%) was substantial, in particular for wake-up stroke. Following the release of the positive trials, selection of perfusion imaging significantly increased for imaging strategy. CONCLUSIONS Usage of vascular or perfusion imaging by Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging beyond just parenchymal imaging was the primary work-up (62-87%) across all clinical vignettes and time windows. Perfusion imaging with Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging was associated with increased probability of enrollment into clinical trials for 0-3 h. Following the release of the positive endovascular trials, selection of endovascular only treatment for 6 h increased across all clinical vignettes.","Luby, Marie; Warach, Steven J; Albers, Gregory W; Baron, Jean-Claude; Cognard, Christophe; Dávalos, Antoni; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Hacke, Werner; Lansberg, Maarten G; Liebeskind, David S; Mattle, Heinrich P; Oppenheim, Catherine; Schellinger, Peter D; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Wintermark, Max",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493015616634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26783309/,401
159968,Use of Google Trends to investigate anosmia: Power and pitfalls of infodemiology.,2020-10-20,"Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) has numerous advantages over open donor nephrectomy. The cosmetic issues and pain that arise due to the 5 to 6-cm incisions on the abdominal wall in LDN have led to transvaginal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (TVLDN). Between May and August 2012, we performed seven donor nephrectomies via a transvaginal approach. The mean age of the donors was 53.0 ± 9.52 years. The mean operative time was 97.29 ± 39.47 minutes and mean warm ischemia time, 220.71 ± 55.49 seconds. Donors were mobilized, began oral intake at 8 hours postoperative, and were all discharged within the first 24 hours. Except one dose of analgesic applied immediately after the operation, no additional medication was required. No infectious complications were encountered in any recipient. TVLDN may be a good alternative for female donors. Compared with LDN, TVLDN has benefits of less postoperative pain, faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, and excellent cosmetic results.","Eroğlu, A; Şener, C; Tabandeh, B; Tilif, S; Okçuoğlu Kadıoğlu, Z; Kaçar, S",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2013.02.078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23622577/,401

METHODS We surveyed 1,444 Australian adults online in October 2019. To identify factors associated with vaccination site, we used Pearson's chi-square test. We used thematic analysis to describe responses to the question, 'Please explain why you chose to get vaccinated there'. RESULTS Most participants (73%) received the influenza vaccine in a medical setting, while 13% received it at a pharmacy and 14% at their workplace. Being vaccinated in pharmacy was associated with being under 65 years of age (p<0.01), marital status (p=0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). Workplace vaccination was associated with being under 65 (p<0.01), household income (p<0.01), not having a regular general physician/practice (p=0.01), having private insurance (p<0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). There was no association between site of vaccination and first-time vaccination (p=0.71, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS Despite new policies allowing pharmacists to administer influenza vaccines, most Australian adults are still vaccinated in medical settings. Pharmacy and workplace vaccination settings were more common among younger adults without high-risk comorbidities. Implications for public health: Workplaces, pharmacies and other non-medical settings may provide an opportunity to increase influenza vaccination among healthy, working-age adults who might otherwise forego annual vaccination. Pharmacies may also provide a convenient location for the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly in medically underserved areas.","Trent, Mallory J; Salmon, Daniel A; MacIntyre, C Raina",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818843/,401

161883,Is Sexting Associated with Sexual Behaviors During Adolescence? A Systematic Literature Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome and is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Our previous studies showed the existence of epitopes in the C-terminal region of DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) which are cross-reactive with host Ags and trigger anti-DENV NS1 Ab-mediated endothelial cell damage and platelet dysfunction. To circumvent these potentially harmful events, we replaced the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 with the corresponding region from Japanese encephalitis virus NS1 to create chimeric DJ NS1 protein. Passive immunization of DENV-infected mice with polyclonal anti-DJ NS1 Abs reduced viral Ag expression at skin inoculation sites and shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time. We also investigated the therapeutic effects of anti-NS1 mAb. One mAb designated 2E8 does not recognize the C-terminal region of DENV NS1 in which host-cross-reactive epitopes reside. Moreover, mAb 2E8 recognizes NS1 of all four DENV serotypes. We also found that mAb 2E8 caused complement-mediated lysis in DENV-infected cells. In mouse model studies, treatment with mAb 2E8 shortened DENV-induced prolonged bleeding time and reduced viral Ag expression in the skin. Importantly, mAb 2E8 provided therapeutic effects against all four serotypes of DENV. We further found that mAb administration to mice as late as 1 d prior to severe bleeding still reduced prolonged bleeding time and hemorrhage. Therefore, administration with a single dose of mAb 2E8 can protect mice against DENV infection and pathological effects, suggesting that NS1-specific mAb may be a therapeutic option against dengue disease.","Wan, Shu-Wen; Chen, Pei-Wei; Chen, Chin-Yu; Lai, Yen-Chung; Chu, Ya-Ting; Hung, Chia-Yi; Lee, Han; Wu, Hsuan Franziska; Chuang, Yung-Chun; Lin, Jessica; Chang, Chih-Peng; Wang, Shuying; Liu, Ching-Chuan; Ho, Tzong-Shiann; Lin, Chiou-Feng; Lee, Chien-Kuo; Wu-Hsieh, Betty A; Anderson, Robert; Yeh, Trai-Ming; Lin, Yee-Shin",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1601523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28904127/,401

The planned cognitive contribution is the verification of the hypothesis pertaining to the uneven occurrence of individual types of loyalty. The study was conducted on a nationwide, representative sample (n = 1000) with the use of the CAWI questionnaire. Research has confirmed that sustainable loyalty occurs more often than other types of loyalty. This is a balanced type of loyalty in which the commitment of the employer and the employee is equal, and the employee is attached to the organization and puts their trust in it.

171356,Deleterious drugs in COVID-19: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-09-21,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise in early 2020. The preventive measures imposed by many countries limited human movement, causing uncertainty and disrupting consumption patterns and consumer decision-making. This study aims to explore consumers’ panic buying (PB) and compulsive buying (CB) as outcomes of the intolerance of uncertainty (IU). The moderating role of sustainable consumption behaviours (SCBs) (e.g. quality of life [QOL], concern for future generation and concern for environmental well-being) were also tested to raise awareness of responsible and mindful consumption amongst the society and business stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: To empirically examine the grocery shopping behaviours of Malaysian consumers during COVID-19, a total of 286 valid grocery consumer survey responses based on a purposive sampling were collected and analysed during the movement control order period between March and July 2020. Findings: The findings confirmed the statistically significant impact of IU on both PB and CB and the impact of PB on CB behaviour. Amongst the three SCBs tested, only QOL significantly moderated the relationship between the IU and PB. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to construct a framework of consumers’ PB and CB during the pandemic, building upon the stimulus-organism-response model and the concepts of IU and SCB. This study further serves as the pioneering study on the moderating role of SCB in consumer behaviour research in the pandemic context, whereby consumers’ QOL significantly moderates the relationship between their IU and PB. This study has also drawn specific implications for grocery retailers and government agencies for retail and policy planning to promote positive social transformation in consumer buying behaviours during a pandemic or crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Phang, I.

However, COVID-19 affected various churches in all the nooks and crannies of the country. It brought about obvious changes in numerous practices of churches in Nigeria. Long-standing traditions of churches such as solemnisation of Holy Matrimony, Holy Communion, baptism, prayer and sharing of peace (This practice is commonly observed by the orthodox churches and entails shaking one another's hands in the course of a communion service) have been modified or suspended. Whilst this article appreciates the efforts of the federal and state governments, it investigates the implications of COVID-19 outbreak on traditional religious practices of churches in Nigeria. It also examines the responses of churches towards controlling the pandemic. The phenomenological method is used to analyse the data collected from both primary (semi-structured interview) and secondary sources (journals and internet materials).

Here, we compare the hashing performance of TotalSeq-A and -C antibodies, custom synthesized lipids and MULTI-seq lipid hashes in four cell lines, both for single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq. Hashing efficiency was evaluated using the intrinsic genetic variation of the cell lines. Benchmarking of different hashing strategies and computational pipelines indicates that correct demultiplexing can be achieved with both lipid- and antibody-hashed human cells and nuclei, with MULTISeqDemux as the preferred demultiplexing function and antibody-based hashing as the most efficient protocol on cells. Antibody hashing was further evaluated on clinical samples using PBMCs from healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, where we demonstrate a more affordable approach for large single-cell sequencing clinical studies, while simultaneously reducing batch effects.","Mylka, Viacheslav; Aerts, Jeroen; Matetovici, Irina; Poovathingal, Suresh; Vandamme, Niels; Seurinck, Ruth; Hulselmans, Gert; Van Den Hoecke, Silvie; Wils, Hans; Reumers, Joke; Van Houdt, Jeroen; Aerts, Stein; Saeys, Yvan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.16.384222,401

A part of the mother solution of the complex 1 and THF yielded single crystals in a triclinic space group and are found same from the crystals obtained from another mixture of the mother solution and ethyl acetate. Single crystal XRD studies have confirmed the mononuclear complex formation and absence of any interactions between the Mn(II) centers. A solution of the complex 1 in chloroform, conversely, yielded a crystallographically different complex [Mn(H2L)Cl2]•CHCl3 (1a) in monoclinic and is also characterised with single crystal XRD. The ligand is coordinated through thione sulfur atom to form a square pyramidal geometry around Mn(II) center in both the complexes. The molecular packing of the complexes is found influenced by the nature of solvent inclusion, and are stabilized by different non-covalent interactions in the lattice. The intermolecular interactions are quantified by Hirshfeld surface analyses, which reveal that H•••Cl interactions has maximum contribution to the total Hirshfeld surface in the complex 1a. This is the first crystal structure study of a manganese(II) complex of a bisthiocarbohydrazone ligand. The molecular and electronic structures of the complexes are studied by DFT quantum chemical calculations. The band gap (Eg) of the complex 1 was estimated as 2.45 eV using Kubelka-Munk model and is in agreement with the electronic spectral calculations of the complex at TD-DFT level. Molecular docking studies of both the ligand and the complex reveal their greater propensity towards SARS-CoV-2 main protease compared to B-DNA dodecamer.

Little is known about such ancient epidemics and a deep evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats is lacking. The study of past epidemics has typically been limited in temporal scope to recorded history, and in physical scope to pathogens that left sufficient DNA behind, such as Yersinia pestis during the Great Plague. Host genomes however offer an indirect way to detect ancient epidemics beyond the current temporal and physical limits. Arms races with pathogens have shaped the genomes of the hosts by driving a large number of adaptations at many genes, and these signals can be used to detect and further characterize ancient epidemics. Here, we detect the genomic footprints left by ancient viral epidemics that took place in the past ~50,000 years in the 26 human populations represented in the 1,000 Genomes Project. By using the enrichment in signals of adaptation at ~4,500 host loci that interact with specific types of viruses, we provide evidence that RNA viruses have driven a particularly large number of adaptive events across diverse human populations. These results suggest that different types of viruses may have exerted different selective pressures during human evolution. Knowledge of these past selective pressures will provide a deeper evolutionary perspective on current pathogenic threats.","Enard, David; Petrov, Dmitri A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.18.997346,401

De ello se desprende que la crisis del capitalismo, ya sea evolutiva o epocal, no se origina en la convergencia de crisis ontológicamente distintas e independientes, la económica (sociedad) y la medioambiental (naturaleza), sino que expresa la esencia misma del capitalismo. En este sentido, los acuerdos comerciales, de inmigración, de seguridad y de empleo entre los estados del centro, las semiperiferias y los estados de la periferia encarnan la misma esencia antagonista del capitalismo: la tendencia a la acumulación incesante de capital y la caída del excedente ecológico. En este artículo exploramos que si, por un lado, los acuerdos estipulados entre los estados del centro, las semiperiferias y los estados de la periferia representan una forma de apropiarse del ""trabajo"" barato y gratuito de naturalezas humanas y extrahumanas para ponerlos al servicio del proceso de acumulación capitalista, estos acuerdos, por su propia construcción y sus dinámicas de negociación, aceleran, por otro lado, la caída del excedente ecológico, lo que se hace visible en el aumento de los precios de los bienes primarios a través del continuo agotamiento de las naturalezas humanas y extrahumanas no capitalizadas o infracapitalizadas. El texto, además de introducción y conclusiones, consta de tres apartados. En el primero se establecen las principales características de la perspectiva de la ecología-mundo de Moore, que se desarrollarán a lo largo del artículo. En el segundo apartado se aíslan las cuatro grandes razones que nos ayudan a entender cómo y por qué los acuerdos entre estados del centro, de la semiperiferia y los estados de la periferia pueden acelerar la caída del excedente ecológico. En el tercero se desarrolla el argumento principal del artículo, aplicándolo al caso concreto de los acuerdos estipulados entre algunos estados del centro, de la semiperiferia y los estados de la periferia africana.Alternate abstract:In this article I provide a contribution to the ongoing discussion on the approach developed by Jason W. Moore in the field of International Relations, known as ""World-Ecology"".Through this perspective I analyze the agreements that are negotiated between core and semi-periphery states, and the periphery states in the African continent in the field of trade, migration, security and employment. Recent studies analysed the agreements negotiated between the core, semi-periphery and periphery states from very different perspectives. For example, from an economic point of view, previous research has highlighted the link between migration and development or analysed the increasing dependence on the migrant workforce in some specific sectors in the global center. Other studies opted for a more ""social"" standpoint and analysed the process of integration of migrant-origin workforce from periphery states in the socio-economic fabric of core states. A third group of studies focused on the repercussions that security agreements have on regular and irregular migrants oming from periphery states. Other scholars have investigated the environmental impact of the appropriation of raw materials and energy following (dis)agreements between core, semi-periphery, and periphery states. All these contributions help to shed light on the core-periphery relations from different angles.Yet, Moore's World-Ecology perspective can help us go beyond the intrinsic limitations of these ""compartmentalised"" approaches and activate a holistic re-reading of these core-periphery relations in the field of migration, trade, security and employment. In this article, I focus on these agreements to demonstrate how this perspective can be used to theorise those strategic and dialectical bundles of human and extra-human relations that are at the foundation of the global capitalist civilisation. As I will show, core-periphery state agreements provide the structure through which patterns and relationships of power and production within nature can be co-produced, exerting continuous pressure on human and extra-human nature to keep it cheap. Moore refers in this regard to the ""Four Cheaps"": labour, food, energy, and raw materials, and the tendency of capitalism to appropriate them with as little capital as possible, or even better free of charge in order to generate surplus value and an ecological surplus. Core-periphery state agreements serve to extend the zone of appropriation and set up new streams of the Four Cheaps. Core-periphery state agreements are the Janus face of capitalism: if on the one hand they exert pressure to keep nature cheap, on the other hand, the same dynamics of negotiation inherent in these agreements progressively leads to the exhaustion of capitalism's Cheap Nature strategy. Core-periphery state agreements include, for example, the temporal migration programs signed between the European Union and the periphery states in Africa with the explicit aim of providing cheap labour to specific sectors (e.g. social care) in the global centre that would otherwise need higher remuneration and much better working conditions to motivate core states' autochthonous labour power.These programs also result in promoting a specific type of migrant-origin labour force: temporal, circular, vulnerable, and therefore cheap. In turn, the promotion of this type of migration solidifies hierarchical and dualistic constructions within the labour market. Moore's World-Ecology perspective can also be used to place emphasis on the link between migration, cheap labour, and the production of cheap food. The function of labour reserves, which in the past was covered by slaves and colonized labour, is today entrusted to migrants from the global periphery. This article also analyses the trade agreements between core, semi-periphery and periphery states for their role in securing cheap energy and raw materials. Core-periphery trade (dis)agreements are primarily power relations that mobilize and recombine human and extra-human natures, and that have as their purpose the endless accumulation and production of global spaces of appropriation. The packages of trade agreements signed between the core, semi-periphery and periphery states are also closely linked to security measures. Security is not a by-product of these agreements, but rather a constitutive element of the negotiations, through which interlocking agencies of capital, science, and political power together release new sources of free or low-cost human and extra-human natures for capital accumulation. Going beyond the consideration that the proliferation of fences of razor wire and walls around the globe is a valid indicator of the flourishing state experienced by the security industry in the current phase of capitalism, once we embrace the World-Ecology perspective we can see how the security agreements between core, semi-periphery and periphery state alter extra-human and human nature. In fact, securitarian measures are inserted in pre-existing geographical patterns and social structures (re)producing clusters of nature hierarchized according to historical-geographical sp cificities, and patterns of race, gender, and class. Here I think for example about the categories of Arabised North Africa (e.g. the Maghreb) vs the rest of ""Black"" Africa or the category of ""illegal"" migrant vs ""legal"" migrant, which are solidified through the security ""deals"" struck between core, semi-periphery states and periphery states. In addition to its introduction and conclusions, this article has three sections.The first section establishes the main features of Moore's World-Ecology perspective that will be developed throughout the article. In the second section, the article isolates four broad reasons that help us understand how and why agreements between core, semi-periphery and periphery countries can accelerate the decline of the ecological surplus and presents the main argument around which the article revolves: while in the past, appropriation practices combined with the global market and technological innovations ensured rapid global expansions, based on the identification, codification, and rationalization of the Cheap Natures, notably through the practices of colonisation and slavery,today this ""advantage"" is no longer available. Moreover, the identification, appropriation and mobilization of uncapitalised nature must undergo long, tedious, and above all expensive core-periphery negotiations, which ultimately take the form of agreement packages that include measures in the field of trade, migration, security, and employment. The third section further develops this argument by applying it to the concrete case of the African periphery countries. In the concluding remarks, the article highlights the dual characters of the core,semi-periphery and periphery state agreements and reflects on the nature of the ongoing crisis. The core-periphery agreements analysed in this article are certainly a display of capitalism's adaptive power, yet at the same time core-(semi)periphery negotiations accelerate the crisis of modernity-in-nature by exhausting the Cheap Nature, making everything less cheap, and at fast speed, as evidenced by the last commodity supercycle and the one on the horizon. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the fragilities of the global capitalist economy and woken up post-capitalist imaginaries. However, as of today it is an open question as to whether we are facing a developmental crisis of capitalism, which can be solved within the boundaries of the neoliberal order through new rounds of accumulation and commodification, or we are witnessing instead the beginning of an epochal crisis marked by an irreversible decline of capitalism's capacity to restructure itself as the mode of organisation of human and extra-human nature.","Sajir, Zakaria",Relaciones Internacionales,https://doi.org/10.15366/relacionesinternacionales2021.47.010,401
178344,When Home is Not Safe: Media Coverage and Issue Salience of Child Maltreatment during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Aim of the Study: To evaluate the views of medical students about online classes started in view of COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: An online survey was conducted using Survey monkey platform (R). A survey link which was sent through the WhatsApp platform (R) to the MBBS/BDS students across the country. The survey questionnaire evaluated the views about the various aspects of the online classes. Results: A total of 1059 students completed the survey, of which 1033 entries were analyzed. The participants' mean age was 20.8 years with nearly equal male-to-female ratio, majority being MBBS students who were taking part in online classes mostly from home (95.4%), by using smart phones (85%). When asked to compare the experience of online classes with regular in-person classes, a majority of the participants reported having poor attention and concentration, poor retention of knowledge, poor learning of theoretical aspects of subject, poor learning of practical aspects of the subject, poor questions/answers sessions, and only 38.9% and 10.6% rated online theory and online practical classes as 'good' or 'very good,' respectively. The most common advantages of online classes reported by the students were that they do not have to travel (69%) and do not have to dress up (69.9%), while the most commonly reported disadvantages included poor learning of practical aspects (75%), followed by strain on eyes (73.4%) and difficulties with internet connectivity (64.8%). A small proportion of students 'occasionally' or more often indulged in surfing Internet, Chatting on WhatsApp/Telegram/FB Messenger, and using Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, We Chat, Snap Chat, and Telegram) while attending online classes. Conclusions: This study suggests that although various colleges are running online classes, as a substitute for the regular in person classes in view of the need for social distancing, these classes are not well received by the students and are possibly does not fulfilling the desired needs of the students. Further, the present study suggests that students still prefer in-person classes.","Grover, S.; Goyal, S.

The instruments included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Perceived Relationship Quality Components, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales.ResultsWomen show a considerably higher level of stress (t=3.805;p<0.001), depression (t=3.76;p<0.001) and anxiety (t=2.959;p=0.003). The quality of relationship for women is significantly connected with mental wellbeing (r=0.423;p<0.001) and negatively correlated with the stress level (r= -0.60;p<0.001), depression (r= -0,381;p<0,001) and anxiety (r=-0,313;p<0,001). Meanwhile for men, the quality of the relationship is connected to mental wellbeing (r=0.280;p=0.049), opposed to stress levels (r= -0.316;p=0.025) and is neither connected to depression (r= -0.210;p=0.144) nor to anxiety (r= -0.126;p=0.383).ConclusionsDuring the pandemic, a favorable partnership has a positive effect on the mental health of both men and women.

Methods: We assess viral acceleration using a novel indicator introduced in Baunez et al. (2021). The acceleration index relates the percentage change of tests that have been performed on a given day to the percentage change in the associated positive cases that same day. We compare viral acceleration among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in France over the period May 31st - August 29, 2021. Results: Once the state of the epidemic within each groups is accounted for, it turns out that viral acceleration has since mid-July converged to similar levels among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in France, even though viral speed is larger for the latter group compared to the former. Conclusion: Our results call for an increasing testing effort for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, in view of the fact that viral circulation is currently accelerating at similar levels for both groups in France.","Baunez, C.; Degoulet, M.; Luchini, S.; Pintus, P.; Teschl, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.18.21263773v1?rss=1,401
181246,The incidence and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients post-vaccination in eastern India,2021-07-19,"Background: This prevalence study involved participants from various cities in Turkey was conducted in April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic in Turkey, with a view to evaluate the pandemic-related anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression in the society. Method: The study was conducted with 1267 people in more than 70 cities in Turkey. The study data were obtained by means of online data collection forms, due to the risks posed by the contagious COVID-19 disease in face to face interviews. The Demographic Properties Form, the Utkan Pandemic Anxiety (UPA) scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) were utilized as data collection tools. Results: The average value for the UPA scale for the sample was calculated as 10.5 +/- 0.257 points, for the GAD-7 scale as 5.5 +/- 0.153 points, and for the BDI-PC as 3.8 +/- 0.095 points. The cut-off threshold for the UPA scale was exceeded by 34%, for the GAD-7 scale by 25.7%, and for the BDI-PC by 30.9% of the sample. Conclusion: It was concluded that the level of pandemic-related anxiety in the community was high, that the level of generalized anxiety and depression had increased in comparison to pre-pandemic times, and that women had a higher risk of pandemic-related anxiety, generalized anxiety, and depression, because they were a group at risk, and also due to the effect of media surveillance and reports.","Firat, M.; Okanli, A.; Kanbay, Y.; Utkan, M.; Gokmen, B.

While numerous vaccines have been developed to combat this pandemic, limited literature is available regarding the comparison of these vaccines. This study aims to systematically review and evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines compared with control arms in the healthy adult population. Methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane up to July 4, 2021. Randomized controlled trials assessing the immunogenicity of any dose of COVID-19 vaccine in adults by anti–severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G antibodies geometric mean titers (GMTs) and neutralizing antibodies GMT response at 28 days postimmunization compared with the control groups in the healthy adults were considered for inclusion. Groups at day 28 with the highest GMT were further examined for their adverse events. Results Of the 341 citations retrieved, 19 were included. This covered a total of 16 vaccines involving 8342 subjects aged between 30.8 and 69.7 years, comprising 52.13% females. All studies reported GMT at or close to 28 days postvaccination compared with placebo and comparator, and 13 of 19 studies reported seroconversion rates. While 15 of 16 vaccines reported adverse events that ranged from mild to severe, 1 of 16 (AD26.COV2.S) noted 1 case of a vaccine-related serious adverse event—high fever 6 hours after vaccination. Local reactions (such as redness, pain, and swelling) and systematic reactions (such as fatigue, fever, and headache) were commonly noted. Safety between vaccines was similar; however, higher rates of severe adverse events were noted in Ad5-vectored COVID-19, AD26.COV2.S, ChAdOx nCoV-19, and mRNA-1273. No all-cause mortality was documented in any vaccines. Conclusions All 16 vaccines elicited an immune response substantially higher than the control groups while maintaining tolerable safety profiles.","Lau, Oscar; Vadlamudi, Nirma Khatri",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301521017344; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301521017344,401

Based on the reserve and demand of medical resources in a given area, the proposed model provides daily real-time transportation decisions and expansion decisions of hospitals, factories and warehouses under epidemic situation by analysing factors such as different regions, duration, factory capacity, warehouse reserves, hospital demand, transportation and expansion costs of factories, warehouses and hospitals. The promo package of Python language is used to formulate a mixed integer linear programming model. In this model, under the conditions of meeting the demand of medical resources in the case of slow development and sudden outbreak of epidemic situation, a commercial solver, CPLEX, is able to provide the solution for each situation with the lowest supply cost within one second CPU time.

The aim of this study was to examine the value of biochemical and hematological parameters in the estimation of hospital stay, disease severity, and likelihood of death. METHODS: Routine blood analysis data of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n=222) were collected and analyzed. The patients were divided into 3 groups: outpatient, inpatient, and patients requiring intensive care. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 3 groups in terms of age, lymphocyte, neutrophil, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer values. Univariate analysis for mortality revealed significant differences in neutrophil, NLR, PLR, NMR, procalcitonin, and CRP values. Multivariable logistic regression yielded significant differences in only NMR and procalcitonin values. A positive correlation was determined between the length of hospital stay and age, MPV, procalcitonin, and D-dimer values. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The neutrophil count was the most appropriate parameter to predict the need for intensive care (area under the curve: 0.782, sensitivity: 73%, specificity: 75%, with a cutoff of 4.43). The NMR and procalcitonin values were significant to predict death in multivariate analysis. Age, CRP, and D-dimer values were the parameters most associated with the duration of hospitalization.","Merve Sena, Odabaşı Ozkaya Güven Serin Erdinç Akkuş Anıl Yılmaz Pınar Sayan amp; Iacute,; smet,",International Journal of Medical Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.14744/ijmb.2021.53315,401
183779,Acute Pancreatitis in Severe COVID Pneumonia.,2021-07-01,"The study of emotions in a human computing interaction context has gained special attention during the last years. Different AI-based tools have emerged in order to smartly analyze content -and particularly emotions- in social networks with marketing, financial, and/or political purposes. However, effective emotion recognition is still a hard task due to the presence of ironies, sarcasm, hybrid languages, and argot in most people comments. Additionally, the presence of such components may be larger when the comment is related to a controversial concern such as the current coronavirus vaccine or political corruption scandals. In this paper, we explore the combination of AI-based and linguistic techniques, namely sentiment analysis and critical discourse analysis, in order to effectively study the emotions on social networks. We take as case study a set of important corruption episodes occurred in Chile, which has internationally been observed as its corruption index has systematically been increased from 2012. During this period, different respected institutions and companies have been involved in important corruptions cases. This concern in conjunction to other social aspects triggered the Chilean social outbreak at the end of 2019, which added to the COVID-19 pandemic have generated a very complex scenario for the whole country. This complicated situation has of course turned people more sensible and overreactive, making the social networks a proper test bed worth to carefully analyze.

187601,Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19: Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses and Evidence-Based Algorithms.,2021,"The original antiviral drug Proteflazid® has been used in clinical practice since the early 2000s for the etiotropic treatment of acute respiratory viral diseases, due to its property of blocking viral RNA and DNA polymerases. Considering that at the beginning of the global COVID- 19 pandemic, caused by RNA-containing virus of SARS-CoV-2 species in 2020, the ability of the drug active substance to inhibit the activity of 3CL- protease of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was shown by molecular docking and, subsequently, to confirm the property of the active substance to block the reproduction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in cell cultures in vitro. It was extremely important to test the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid, drops for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 disease at ""off labell use"". AIM The aim of the study was to provide a statistical assessment of the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid®, drops in terms of COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS The analysis has been performed including the letters-references from medical institutions from different regions of Ukraine about the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid®, drops. Methods of statistical analysis have been focused on dynamics and structure analysis, meta-analysis, generalization, etc. RESULTS 90 letters-references about the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid®, drops, during the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19 diseases were analyzed. The study used references that contained the most complete information. The number of deleted letters-references is 11. Lettersreferences from 79 medical institutions from different cities and regions of Ukraine were analyzed. The period of starting taking the drug by employees and patients of medical institutions began on February 27, 2020. Final information - October 01, 2020. The vast majority of letters from medical institutions indicated that medical staff were in contact with patients potentially suffering from COVID-19. This means a high risk of being infected with Coronavirus infection. Total number of patients who took Proteflazid® for preventive purpose was 8,572, including 7,444 medical workers and 1,128 ordinary patients. Indicator ""Number of fatalities"" for the medical institutions providing such information was ""0"". Total number of patients who took Proteflazid® for therapeutic purposes was 433, including 23 medical workers and 410 ordinary patients. Indicator ""Number of fatalities"" for the medical institutions providing such information was ""0"". The total number of medical personnel and patients who used Proteflazid drops for preventive and therapeutic purposes was 9005 people. CONCLUSIONS The statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the drug Proteflazid® for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as, when compared with official actual data, regarding the main indicators of the incidence of COVID-19: there were no fatalities; the average treatment period decreased (1.8 times); the proportion of recovered increased (at least 1.5 times); the proportion of sick medical workers in the total population of sick medical workers decreased (2.2 times); the proportion of patients with a severe course decreased (3.3 times). It can be argued that the drug Proteflazid®, drops has shown high effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19, among medical personnel and patients.","Grynevych, Oleksandr; Borshov, Sergiy; Matyash, Victor; Momotiuk, Liudmyla; Motuzka, Olena; Yashchenko, Lyudmila",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464364/,401
187854,Summaries for patients. Do some patients with SARS have mild disease?,2004,"BACKGROUND Kidney disease and cardiovascular disease seem to be lethally synergistic and both are approaching the epidemic level. A reduced glomerular filtration rate is associated with increased mortality risk in patients with heart failure. Many patients with congestive heart failure are anemic. Anemia is very often associated with chronic kidney disease. OBJECTIVES To assess--in relation to New York Heart Association class--the prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease in patients with normal serum creatinine in a cohort of 526 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. METHODS GFR was estimated using the simplified MDRD formula, the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the Jeliffe and the novel CKD-EPI formula. RESULTS According to the WHO definition the prevalence of anemia in our study was 21%. We observed a progressive decline in GFR and hemoglobin concentration together with a rise in NYHA class. Significant correlations were observed between eGFR and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, age, NYHA class, complications of PCI, including bleeding, and major adverse cardiac events. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anemia and chronic kidney disease is high in patients undergoing PCI despite normal serum creatinine, particularly in higher NYHA class. Lower eGFR and hemoglobin are associated with more complications, including bleeding after PCI and higher prevalence of major adverse cardiac events. In patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease, GFR should be estimated since renal dysfunction and subsequent anemia are important risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","Malyszko, Jolanta; Bachorzewska-Gajewska, Hanna; Malyszko, Jacek; Levin-Iaina, Nomy; Iaina, Adrian; Dobrzycki, Slawomir",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21337818/,401
189968,Cost-effectiveness of New Surgical Treatments for Hemorrhoidal Disease: A Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Transanal Doppler-guided Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation With Mucopexy and Circular Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy.,2016,"In late 2003 and early 2004 the ACT Division of General Practice and ACT Health conducted two concurrent surveys designed to identify knowledge, attitudes and practices of Australian Capital Territory (ACT) general practitioners around severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and biothreat preparedness. One survey asked individual general practitioners (GPs) about how they gathered information about SARS in 2003, how they preferred to receive information, current practices, and how they perceived the threat of SARS and other infectious agents. The second survey asked practice principals how they organised their practice to respond to the SARS threat in 2003, any difficulties they had with implementing this response, use of SARS infection control guidelines and current policies. The response rate for the individual GP survey was 48 per cent (184/381) and the response rate for the practice organisation survey was 54 per cent (74/136). GPS used many sources of information on SARS during the 2003 outbreak. Facsimiles from the ACT Division of General Practice were the primary source (17%) and facsimile was the preferred method of receiving information in future outbreaks. The majority of GP respondents felt adequately informed about SARS during the 2003 outbreak, but many general practices did not follow the national guidelines on telephone screening of patients, warning signs and having infection control kits available. The majority of practices reported that they had policies or procedures in place to isolate potentially infectious patients from others in the waiting room. GPs rated an influenza pandemic as a threat to themselves and their patients much more highly than SARS or bioterrorism. Suggestions and comments on how ACT GPs could be better prepared to respond to future outbreaks included the need for timeliness of information, information delivery mechanisms, communication issues, education, the availability of guidelines and protocols, planning, role delineation, the use of response teams, provision of equipment, and vaccination. Planning for future infectious disease outbreak events in the Australian Capital Territory should incorporate general practitioners so that the plans reflect what is a feasible response in the general practice setting.","Herceg, Ana; Geysen, Alison; Guest, Charles; Bialkowski, Richard",Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16220864/,401
190920,How to interpret and pursue an abnormal complete blood cell count in adults.,2005,"The COVID-19 outbreak has raised numerous attempts of diverse pharmacological interventions to improve the prognosis of the infection, especially among hospitalized patients due to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Initially, these interventions used known medications capable to directly target SARS-CoV-2 by investigating several antiviral therapies already applied with some success in other viral infections. Among them remdesivir appears to be the most promising drug against SARS-CoV-2. Then, owing to the deleterious impact of the cytokine storm, medications that more specifically inhibit proinflammatory cytokines (especially interleukin-1 and interleukin-6) were tested. Hydroxychloroquine, sometines combined with azithromycin, has benefited for a while from a media buzz. However, hopes initially founded in all such drugs turned into disappointments because the specificities of SARS-CoV-2 make this virus resistant to most pharmacological interventions. Only glucocorticoids, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, were associated with a significant reduction in mortality of patients with ARDS due to COVID-19, most probably via non-specific anti-inflammatory effects. These corticosteroids are currently recommended by the World Health Organisation. An intensive research is ongoing worldwide to find effective combined therapies or innovative drugs which could unequivocally improve the prognosis of COVID-19 at the different stages of the infection.","Scheen, A J; Moutschen, M",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211441/,401
192356,Listening to SARS: lessons for infection control.,2003,"OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety profile of stent-retriever thrombectomy (SRT) in acute anterior ischemic stroke patients with tandem occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the MEDLINE database, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that included patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to tandem occlusion who received treatment with SRT between November 2010 and May 2015. RESULTS The literature search identified 11 previous studies involving a total of 237 subjects out of whom 193 (81.4 %) were treated with acute stent placement for the extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Mean initial NIHSS score was 17, and median time from onset to recanalization was 283.5 min. Mean intravenous thrombolysis rate was 63.8 %. In the meta-analysis, the recanalization rate reached 81 % (95 % CI, 73-89). Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed a pooled estimate of 44 % (95 % CI, 33-55; 10 studies) for favourable outcome, 13 % (95 % CI, 8-20; 10 studies) for mortality, and 7 % (95 % CI, 2-13; eight studies) for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. CONCLUSION SRT with emergency carotid stenting is associated with acceptable safety and efficacy in acute anterior stroke patients with tandem occlusion compared to natural history. However, the best modality to treat proximal stenosis is based on an individual case basis. KEY POINTS • Stent retriever thrombectomy of tandem occlusion is efficient and safe. • Emergent carotid stenting during thrombectomy increase symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage without impact mortality. • Thrombectomy of tandem anterior circulation occlusion may be the first therapeutic option.","Sivan-Hoffmann, Rotem; Gory, Benjamin; Armoiry, Xavier; Goyal, Mayank; Riva, Roberto; Labeyrie, Paul Emile; Lukaszewicz, Anne-Claire; Lehot, Jean-Jacques; Derex, Laurent; Turjman, Francis",European radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27085698/,401
192941,Treatment of Staphylococcal infection.,1979,"Computational search of genomes for RNA secondary structure is an important approach to the annotation of non-coding RNAs. The bottleneck of the search is sequence-structure alignment, which is often computationally intensive. A plausible solution is to devise effective filters that can efficiently remove segments unlikely to contain the desired structure patterns in the genome and to apply search only on the remaining portions. Since filters can be substructures of the RNA to be searched, the strategy to select which substructures to use as filters is critical to the overall search speed up. Such an issue becomes more involved when the structure contains pseudoknots; approaches that can filter pseudoknots are yet available. In this paper, a new effective filtration scheme is introduced to filter RNA pseudoknots. Based upon the authors' earlier work in tree-decomposable graph model for RNA pseudoknots, the new scheme can automatically derive a set of filters with the overall optimal filtration ratio. Search experiments on both synthetic and biological genomes showed that, with this filtration approach, RNA structure search can speed up 11 to 60 folds while maintaining the same search sensitivity and specificity of without the filtration. In some cases, the filtration even improves the specificity that is already high.","Liu, Chunmei; Song, Yinglei; Hu, Ping; Malmberg, Russell L; Cai, Liming",Computational systems bioinformatics.

In fact, changes in calculus management have increased the percentage of calculi that are difficult to manage medically.1 Endoscopic techniques that reduce the need for calculus removal by traditional laparotomy and cystotomy have been developed. In my experience, most cystic and urethral calculi can be removed by transurethral or laparoscopic-assisted cystoscopy. These techniques decrease trauma to and urine contamination of the abdomen. Endoscopy also improves the ability to examine the urinary system for disease and the presence of more calculi.","Rawlings, Clarence",Compendium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20180217/,401

Even so, their prevalence is reported with large variations in the literature. Furthermore, marginal mandibular nerve (MMN) injuries are claimed to be underreported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SS, SAN and MMN injuries after different types of ND. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis included studies reporting SAN and MMN injuries following the three main types of ND. Pooled estimates of the prevalence were made by the main types of ND with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS Nineteen studies reported a total of 457 SAN injuries. The estimated prevalence of SS or SAN injuries following radical neck dissection, modified radical neck dissection and selective neck dissection was 94.8% (95% CI: 88.5-98.9%), 33.0% (95% CI: 19.4-48.3%) and 27.9% (95% CI: 7.1-54.5%), respectively. Five studies reported a total of 64 MMN injuries. The estimated prevalence following modified radical neck dissection and selective neck dissection was 13.1% (95% CI: 0-37.6%) and 12.7% (95% CI: 4.3-24.1%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis estimated a high prevalence of SS, SAN and MMN injuries following the three main types of ND. If oncological considerations allow it, the less morbid ND should be considered. MMN injuries have only been reported in a limited number of small studies. The results may be used to compare future research and as guidance for quality evaluation within departments.","Larsen, Mishael Houlind; Lorenzen, Mike Mikkelsen; Bakholdt, Vivi; Sørensen, Jens Ahm",Danish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32741441/,401

Organs samples from 20 IBV-positive flocks with variable clinical signs were submitted to the partial amplification of S gene (nucleotides 726-1071) of IBV. Fifteen of the 20 sequenced strains segregated in a unique Brazilian cluster subdivided in three subclusters (Brazil 01, 02, and 03). Whereas three strains could be classified as Massachusetts (Mass) genotype, the remaining two strains, originating from flocks with reproductive and respiratory disorders, grouped within the 4/91-793B genotype, a genotype that has not been detected before in Brazil. The potential relevance of the findings to the poultry industry is discussed because the low level of identity of the sequenced part of the S gene from 17 of 20 detected field strains and the vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype used suggest that the level of cross-protection by the Massachusetts vaccines might be low.","Villarreal, L Y B; Sandri, T L; Souza, S P; Richtzenhain, L J; de Wit, J J; Brandao, P E",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20608535/,401

199387,The role of pandemic-related pregnancy stress in preference for community birth during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,2021,"The coronavirus spike protein (S) forms the distinctive virion surface structures that are characteristic of this viral family, appearing in negatively stained electron microscopy as stems capped with spherical bulbs. These structures are essential for the initiation of infection through attachment of the virus to cellular receptors followed by fusion to host cell membranes. The S protein can also mediate the formation of syncytia in infected cells. The S protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is very large compared to other viral fusion proteins, and all except a short carboxy-terminal segment of the S molecule constitutes the ectodomain. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it has previously been established that S protein assembly into virions is specified by the carboxy-terminal segment, which comprises the transmembrane domain and the endodomain. We have genetically dissected these domains in the MHV S protein to localize the determinants of S incorporation into virions. Our results establish that assembly competence maps to the endodomain of S, which was shown to be sufficient to target a heterologous integral membrane protein for incorporation into MHV virions. In particular, mutational analysis indicated a major role for the charge-rich carboxy-terminal region of the endodomain. Additionally, we found that the adjacent cysteine-rich region of the endodomain is critical for fusion of infected cells, confirming results previously obtained with S protein expression systems.","Ye, Rong; Montalto-Morrison, Cynthia; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15331724/,401
200980,"Clinical predictors of mortality due to COVID-19 based on an analysis of data of 150 patients from Wuhan, China",2020,"Expression of the coronavirus gene 1-encoded polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, is linked to a series of proteolytic events involving virus-encoded proteinases. In this study, we used transfection and immunoprecipitation assays to show that the human coronavirus 229E-encoded papain-like cysteine proteinase, PCP1, is responsible for the release of an amino-terminal protein, p9, from the gene 1-encoded polyproteins. The same protein, p9, has also been identified in virus-infected cells. Furthermore, using an in vitro trans-cleavage assay, we defined the proteolytic cleavage site at the carboxyl terminus of p9 as pp1a-pp1ab amino acids Gly-111 and Asn-112. These results and a comparative sequence analysis suggest that substrate positions P1 and P5 seem to be the major determinants of the PCP1 cleavage site and that the latter can occupy a variable position at the amino terminus of the coronavirus ppla and pplab polyproteins. By combining the trans-cleavage assay with deletion mutagenesis, we were also able to locate the boundaries of the active PCP1 domain between pp1a-pp1ab amino acids Gly-861-Glu-975 and Asn-1209-Gln-1285. Finally, codon mutagenesis was used to show that Cys-1054 and His-1205 are essential for PCP1 proteolytic activity, suggesting that these amino acids most likely have a catalytic function.","Herold, J; Gorbalenya, A E; Thiel, V; Schelle, B; Siddell, S G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9444982/,401
201033,Prone positioning in awake and asleep patients with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed a significant and urgent threat to global health and economy. Currently, there is no effective treatment known to alter the course of COVID-19. Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used previously to treat several types of infections during pandemics. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of CP in the treatment of severe COVID-19 infections at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Kedah, Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study of all severe COVID-19 patients who received CP treatment from 1st August 2020 until 31st December 2020 was conducted. Clinical outcomes were compared before and after CP transfusion. RESULTS Thirty-four patients were enrolled and received CP transfusion during the study period. The most common presenting complaints were fever (64.7%) and cough (58.8%). Fourteen patients showed improvement in oxygen support after CP transfusion. Several laboratory parameters also improved such as increased lymphocyte count (1.48 vs 1.98, p=0.008) and decreased C-reactive protein levels (28.1 vs 10.6, p=0.004), and these were statistically significant. Median time from symptoms onset to CP transfusion was 6 days (range 1-11) while median time from PCR diagnosis to CP transfusion was 5 days (range 1-11). One patient developed urticaria after CP transfusion and no severe adverse events were observed. Two of our patients passed away due to secondary causes. CONCLUSION This study showed CP treatment was well tolerated and could potentially prevent progression of COVID-19 to a severe disease if administered early during the viraemic phase. Further evaluation with randomized control trial should be conducted to help ascertain the optimal dose and effectiveness of CP treatment, in correlation with the IgG titer of the donated CP.","Lee, K T; Yeoh, W C; Zainul, N H; Syed Alwi, S B; Low, L L",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34508370/,401

207290,Thromboembolic disease in COVID-19 patients: A brief narrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many healthcare facilities are lacking a steady supply of masks worldwide. This emergency situation warrants the taking of extraordinary measures to minimize the negative health impact from an insufficient supply of masks. The decontamination, and reuse of healthcare workers' N95/FFP2 masks is a promising solution which needs to overcome several pitfalls to become a reality. AIM: The overall aim of this article is to provide the reader with a quick overview of the various methods for decontamination and the potential issues to be taken into account when deciding to reuse masks. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide, steam, ozone, ethylene oxide, dry heat and moist heat have all been methods studied in the context of the pandemic. The article first focuses on the logistical implementation of a decontamination system in its entirety, and then aims to summarize and analyze the different available methods for decontamination. METHODS: In order to have a clear understanding of the research that has already been done, we conducted a systematic literature review for the questions: what are the tested methods for decontaminating N95/FFP2 masks, and what impact do those methods have on the microbiological contamination and physical integrity of the masks? We used the results of a systematic review on the methods of microbiological decontamination of masks to make sure we covered all of the recommended methods for mask reuse. To this systematic review we added articles and studies relevant to the subject, but that were outside the limits of the systematic review. These include a number of studies that performed important fit and function tests on the masks but took their microbiological outcomes from the existing literature and were thus excluded from the systematic review, but useful for this paper. We also used additional unpublished studies and internal communication from the University of Geneva Hospitals and partner institutions. RESULTS: This paper analyzes the acceptable methods for respirator decontamination and reuse, and scores them according to a number of variables that we have defined as being crucial (including cost, risk, complexity, time, etc.) to help healthcare facilities decide which method of decontamination is right for them. CONCLUSION: We provide a resource for healthcare institutions looking at making informed decisions about respirator decontamination. This informed decision making will help to improve infection prevention and control measures, and protect healthcare workers during this crucial time. The overall take home message is that institutions should not reuse respirators unless they have to. In the case of an emergency situation, there are some safe ways to decontaminate them.","Peters, Alexandra; Palomo, Rafael; Ney, Hervé; Lotfinejad, Nasim; Zingg, Walter; Parneix, Pierre; Pittet, Didier",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,401

Currently, near 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities. Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type C$>$T over T$>$C.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Zheng, Yong-Hui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07488v2.pdf,401

Presently, there is no defined COVID-19 intervention and clinical trials of prospective therapeutic agents are still in the nascent stage. Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS), is an important medicinal plant in Ayurveda. The present study aimed to evaluate the antiviral potential of selected WS phytoconstituents against the novel SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and human ACE2 receptor using in silico methods. Most of the phytoconstituents displayed good absorption and transport kinetics and were also found to display no associated mutagenic or adverse effect(s). Molecular docking analyses revealed that most of the WS phytoconstituents exhibited potent binding to human ACE2 receptor, SAR-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins as well as the two main SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Most of the phytoconstituents were predicted to undergo Phase-I metabolism prior to excretion. All phytoconstituents had favorable bioactivity scores with respect to various receptor proteins and target enzymes. SAR analysis revealed that the number of oxygen atoms in the withanolide backbone and structural rearrangements were crucial for effective binding. Molecular simulation analyses of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and papain-like protease with Withanolides A and B, respectively, displayed a stability profile at 300 K and constant RMSDs of protein side chains and C&#945; atoms throughout the simulation run time. In a nutshell, WS phytoconstituents warrant further investigations in vitro and in vivo to unravel their molecular mechanism(s) and modes of action for their future development as novel antiviral agents against COVID-19.

In this study, the IDW (Inverse Distance Weight), Hotspots, and GWR (Geography Weighted Regression) Model are used as methods for analyzing big data COVID-19 in Tehran. The results showed that the majority of patients and deaths were men, but the death rate was higher in women than in men; also was observed a direct relationship between the area of the houses, and the infected rate, to COVID-19. Also, the results showed a disproportionate distribution of patients in Tehran, although in the eastern regions the number of infected people is higher than in other districts; the eastern areas have a high population density as well as residential land use, and there is a high relationship between population density in residential districts and administrative-commercial and the number of COVID-19 cases in all regions. The outputs of local R2 were interesting among patients and underlying disorders; the local R2 between hypertension and neurological diseases was 0.91 and 0.79, respectively, which was higher than other disorders. The highest rates of local R2 for diabetes and heart disease were 0.67 and 0.55, respectively. From this study, it can be concluded the restrictions must be considered especially, in areas densely populated for all people.","Nasiri, R; Akbarpour, S; Zali, A R; Khodakarami, N; Boochani, M H; Noory, A R; Soori, H",GeoJournal,,401

Objective: To assess the feasibility of an online clinical rotation in Obstetrics and Gynecology during the Covid-19 pandemic and to identify effective pedagogical modalities as well as obstacles to online learning. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to the students and staff at the end of the 3-week online rotation. The online curriculum included synchronous learning such as problem-based learning, video demonstrations and discussions, as well as asynchronous pre-recorded lectures. Questions addressed expectations, previous experience, difficulties encountered, effectiveness of different types of pedagogy, and willingness to participate in online education in the future. Results: We received 27 completed questionnaires, 77% response rate. Overall course rating was 4.14/5 from the students and 3.38/5 from the staff. Previous experience in online education had a positive correlation with higher overall course evaluations; however, low expectations of effectiveness of online learning prior to the course did not correlate with the overall course rate. Challenges identified were absence of bedside teaching and lack of feedback. Effective pedagogical modules were problem-based learning and videos. Additionally, 72% stated that online learning should be part of the formal curriculum. Conclusion: Further research into tele-teaching should be part of medical school strategic plan to ensure meaningful learning in these emerging modalities not limited to exceptional situations such as pandemics.

Thus, it is paramount to control its further transmission, for which purpose it is necessary to find the mechanism of its transmission process and evaluate the effect of different control strategies. To deal with these issues, we describe the transmission of COVID-19 as an explosive Markov process with four parameters. The state transitions of the proposed Markov process can clearly disclose the terrible explosion and complex heterogeneity of COVID-19. Based on this, we further propose a simulation approach with heterogeneous infections. Experimentations show that our approach can closely track the real transmission process of COVID-19, disclose its transmission mechanism, and forecast the transmission under different non-drug intervention strategies. More importantly, our approach can helpfully develop effective strategies for controlling COVID-19 and appropriately compare their control effect in different countries/cities.","Li, Quan-Lin; Wang, Chengliang; Xu, Yiming; Zhang, Chi; Chang, Yanxia; Wu, Xiaole; Fan, Zhen-Ping; Liu, Zhi-Guo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03133v1.pdf,401
214642,Guideline for the management of COVID-19 patients during hospital admission in a non-intensive care setting,2020,"Background: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II characterized by monocytes CD14+ expression of human leukocyte antigen receptors (HLA-DR), is essential for the synapse between innate and adaptive immune response in infectious disease. Its reduced expression is associated with a high risk of secondary infections in septic patients and can be safely corrected by Interferon-y (IFNy) injection. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) induces an alteration of Interferon (IFN) genes expression potentially responsible for the observed low HLA-DR expression in circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR). Methods: We report a case of one-time INFy injection (100 mcg s.c.) in a superinfected 61-year-old man with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with monitoring of mHLA-DR expression and clinical tolerance. Observations: Low mHLA-DR pretreatment expression (26.7%) was observed. IFNy therapy leading to a rapid increase in mHLA-DR expression (83.1%). Conclusions: Severe ARDS in a COVID-19 patient has a deep reduction in mHLA-DR expression concomitantly with secondary infections. The unique IFNy injection was safe and led to a sharp increase in the expression of mHLA-DR. Based on immune and infection monitoring, more cases of severe COVID-19 patients with low mHLA-DR should be treated by IFNy to test the clinical effectiveness.","Dickel, Steffen; Grimm, Clemens; Amschler, Katharina; Schnitzler, Sebastian Uwe; Schanz, Julie; Moerer, Onnen; Payen, Didier; Tampe, Bjoern; Winkler, Martin Sebastian",Front Immunol,,401

Generally, there is a low rate of bonafide co-infections in early COVID-19 pulmonary infection as currently appreciated. Reports of high co-infection rates must be tempered by limitations in current diagnostic methods since amplification technologies do not necessarily confirm live pathogen and may be subject to considerable laboratory variation. Some laboratory methods may not exclude commensal microbes. Concurrent serodiagnoses have long been of concern for accuracy in these contexts. Presumed virus co-infections are not specific to COVID-19. The association of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in co-infection has been considerably variable during influenza season. Other respiratory virus co-infections have generally occurred in less than 10% of COVID-19 patients. Early COVID-19 disease is more commonly associated with bacterial co-pathogens that typically represent usual respiratory micro-organisms. Late infections, especially among severe clinical presentations, are more likely to be associated with nosocomial or opportunistic pathogens given the influence of treatments that can include antibiotics, antivirals, immunomodulating agents, blood products, immunotherapy, steroids, and invasive procedures. As anticipated, hospital care carries risk for multi-resistant bacteria. Overall, co-pathogen identification is linked with longer hospital stay, greater patient complexity, and adverse outcomes. As for other viral infections, a general reduction in the use of empiric antibiotic treatment is warranted.

Several coronaviruses have an ORF located between the N gene and the 3'-UTR, an area previously thought to be non-coding in the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) due to a lack of a canonical TRS-B. Here, we identify a non-canonical TRS-B allowing for a novel sgmRNA relating to this ORF to be produced in several strains of IBV: Beaudette, CR88, H120, D1466, Italy-02 and QX. Interestingly, the potential protein produced by this ORF is prematurely truncated in the Beaudette strain. A single nucleotide deletion was made in the Beaudette strain allowing for the generation of a recombinant IBV (rIBV) that had the potential to express a full-length protein. Assessment of this rIBV in vitro demonstrated that restoration of the full-length potential protein had no effect on viral replication. Further assessment of the Beaudette-derived RNA identified a second non-canonically transcribed sgmRNA located within gene 2. Deep sequencing analysis of allantoic fluid from Beaudette-infected embryonated eggs confirmed the presence of both the newly identified non-canonically transcribed sgmRNAs and highlighted the potential for further yet unidentified sgmRNAs. This HiSeq data, alongside the confirmation of non-canonically transcribed sgmRNAs, indicates the potential of the coronavirus genome to encode a larger repertoire of genes than has currently been identified.","Keep, Sarah; Oade, Michael S; Lidzbarski-Silvestre, Filip; Bentley, Kirsten; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Freimanis, Graham L; Tennakoon, Chandana; Sanderson, Nicholas; Hammond, John A; Jones, Richard C; Britton, Paul; Bickerton, Erica",J Gen Virol,,401

Several virucidal products exist, including hand soaps, gels and surface disinfectants. Resin acids, which can be derived from Tall oil produced from trees, have been shown to exhibit anti-bacterial activity. However, whether these products or their derivatives have virucidal activity is unknown. Here, we assessed the capacity of Rosin soap to inactivate a panel of pathogenic mammalian viruses in vitro. We show that Rosin soap can inactivate the human enveloped viruses: influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For IAV, rosin soap could provide a 100,000-fold reduction in infectivity. However, Rosin soap failed to affect the non-enveloped encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The inhibitory effect of Rosin soap against IAV infectivity was dependent on its concentration but not dependent on incubation time nor temperature. Together, we demonstrate a novel chemical inactivation method against enveloped viruses, which could be of use in preventing virus infections in certain settings. ImportanceViruses remain a significant cause of human disease and death, most notably illustrated through the current Covid-19 pandemic. Control of virus infection continues to pose a significant global health challenge to the human population. Viruses can spread through multiple routes, including via environmental and surface contamination where viruses can remain infectious for days. Methods to inactivate viruses on such surfaces may help mitigate infection. Here we present evidence identifying a novel virucidal product in Rosin soap, which is produced from Tall oil from coniferous trees. Rosin soap was able to rapidly and potently inactivate influenza virus and other enveloped viruses.","Fairley, Derek J; Kettunen, Hannele; Vuorenmaa, Juhani; Orte, Juha",,,401

To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age &#8805;18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to five non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. RESULTS: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died.

223629,Heparin in COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced in-hospital mortality: the multicentre Italian CORIST Study,2021,"Objective: To investigate the clinical features and prognostic influencing factors of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. From January 2008 to March 2019, a total of 46 TEN patients who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. The gender, age, and admission diagnosis of the 46 patients, the category of department of patients complicated with sepsis, death ratio of the sepsis patients with or without treatment history in intensive care unit (ICU)/department of burns and wound repair, and the cause of death of the deceased patients were recorded. Depending on whether complicated with sepsis, the patients were divided into sepsis group (32 cases) and non-sepsis group (14 cases). According to whether died or not, the patients were divided into death group (9 cases) and survival group (37 cases). The specific conditions of suspected pathogenic agents and combined basic diseases, the transaminase/bilirubin abnormality and creatinine and platelet count levels in blood on admission, and the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and drug resistance during the course of disease of patients were recorded in both sepsis group and non-sepsis group. The gender, age, lesion area, severity of illness score for TEN (SCORTEN) system score, combined basic diseases, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients between sepsis group and non-sepsis group, death group and survival group were compared respectively. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, and Mann-Whitney U test. The factors with statistical significant differences between sepsis group and non-sepsis group, death group and survival group were selected for binary multivariate logistic regression analysis, so as to screen the independent risk factors affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients. Results: Of the 46 TEN patients, 30 were male and 16 were female, aged from 8 months to 92 years, with 11 cases (23.91%) of epidermolysis bullosa, 9 cases (19.57%) of exanthemative dermatitis, 9 cases (19.57%) of TEN, 7 cases (15.22%) of epidermolysis bullosa, 6 cases (13.04%) of Stevenss-Johnson syndrome, and 4 cases (8.70%) of severe drug rash for admission diagnosis. The patients complicated with sepsis were admitted to 11 departments, and the death ratio of patients with treatment history in ICU/department of burns and wound repair was similar to that of patients without such department treatment history (P>0.05). All the dead patients were complicated with sepsis, and the main cause of death was sepsis. On admission, the suspected pathogenic agents of patients in sepsis group were mainly allopurinol (11 cases) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (4 cases), while those in non-sepsis group were allopurinol (3 cases) and psychotropic drugs (3 cases). Patients in sepsis group combined as many as 10 kinds of basic diseases, while those in non-sepsis group combined only 4 kinds of basic diseases. The proportions of patients with increased creatinine (&#967;2=13.349, P<0.01) and decreased platelet count (P<0.01) in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in non-sepsis group, while the transaminase/bilirubin abnormality was similar to that in non-sepsis group (P>0.05). A wide variety of pathogens were detected in the blood, respiratory tract secretions, and skin secretions of 21 patients in sepsis group, and 14 patients were infected with drug-resistant bacteria; among the 9 strains cultured from the blood samples, 8 were drug-resistant bacteria and 6 were Gram-positive bacteria. In non-sepsis group, pathogens were detected in blood, respiratory tract secretions, and skin secretions of 8 patients, with fewer species, and 6 patients were infected with drug-resistant bacteria. The gender, age, lesion area, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients in sepsis group were similar to those of non-sepsis group (P>0.05). The proportion of patients combined with basic diseases and SCORTEN system score of patients in sepsis group were significantly higher than those in non-sepsis group (&#967;2=4.493, 7.222, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The gender, combined basic diseases, lesion area, blood microbial culture positivity, hormone use, and gamma globulin use of patients were similar between survival group and death group (P>0.05). The age and SCORTEN system score of patients in death group were significantly higher than those in survival group (&#967;2=4.412, 11.627, P<0.05 or P<0.01). The SCORTEN system score was an independent risk factor affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients (odds ratio=3.025, 2.757, 95% confidence interval=1.352-6.769, 1.244-6.110, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: The diagnosis of TEN is difficult on admission. Male population is susceptible to TEN, and allopurinol is the common pathogenic agent. The proportion of patients combined with basic diseases is high in TEN patients complicated with sepsis, with mainly drug-resistant bacteria and mostly Gram-positive bacteria in blood-borne infections. The died patients are older than the survival, and the main cause of death is sepsis. The SCORTEN system score is an independent risk factor affecting sepsis and death in TEN patients.","Hu, Z X; Bian, H N; Ma, D; Luo, H M; Sun, C W; Lai, W",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,,401

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To describe the implementation of an IV room technology-assisted workflow (TAWF) system integrated within a health system's electronic medical record (EMR) and compare the TAWF system's impact in improving workflow at multiple ambulatory infusion pharmacies. SUMMARY: IV room TAWFs help to standardize intravenous admixture operations while incorporating patient safety measures such as ingredient barcode scanning and image capture. The 4 oncology infusion center pharmacies of a large health system implemented a TAWF system integrated within the health system's EMR software, transitioning to the new TAWF system from an external TAWF system operating outside of the EMR. Considerable planning was required to determine the hardware and workflow processes needed for the new integrated TAWF system to function within pharmacy IV rooms. Several operational challenges were encountered during the initial implementation phase of the project. Frequent occurrence of system malfunctions during the product imaging step was the largest problem, which was overcome by special hardware and a software upgrade. The project also involved an evaluation of the integrated TAWF system after implementation to ensure the pharmacies maintained operational efficiency and patient safety. The evaluation showed that after an initial transition period, the new technology was able to maintain IV admixture efficiency and safety. CONCLUSION: This project and subsequent evaluation showed the operational feasibility, efficiency, and safety of a TAWF integrated within the health system's EMR software.","Flanagin, Connor M; Little, Jeff; Brookins, Leslie; Wills, Meredith",Am. j. health system pharm,,401
226752,Age and Sex Differences in Incident Thrombosis in Patients Hospitalized with Covid 19,2021,"An effective response to the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will involve a range of complementary preventive modalities. The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and virucidal (irreversible) activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002-0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019-0.032 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.030-0.037 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, irreversibly reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by >99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 min of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10-30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines. Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium being due to irreversible inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a topically administered agent for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic applications.","Paull, Jeremy R A; Heery, Graham P; Bobardt, Michael D; Castellarnau, Alex; Luscombe, Carolyn A; Fairley, Jacinth K; Gallay, Philippe A",Antiviral Res,,401

226983,COVID-19: efficacy of prehospital pulse oximetry for early detection of silent hypoxemia,2020,"The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is superimposed on another well-known pandemic in our society, that of overweight and obesity. Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICU) and premature death. The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological and inflammatory responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat deposits. Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called “obesity paradox” commonly reported in ICU among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, the presence of obesity increases the risk of worse outcome at a younger age. These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19.","Scheen, André J.",Med.

Three NifH variants outperform in tobacco mitochondria and are further tested in yeast. Hydrogenobacter thermophilus (Aquificae) NifH is isolated in large quantities from yeast mitochondria and fulfills NifH protein requirements for efficient N2 fixation, including electron transfer for substrate reduction, P-cluster maturation, and FeMo-co biosynthesis. H. thermophilus NifH expressed in tobacco leaves shows lower nitrogenase activity than that from yeast. However, transfer of [Fe4S4] clusters from NifU to NifH in vitro increases 10-fold the activity of the tobacco-isolated NifH, revealing that plant mitochondria [Fe-S] cluster availability constitutes a bottleneck to engineer plant nitrogenases.","Jiang, Xi; Payá-Tormo, Lucía; Coroian, Diana; García-Rubio, Inés; Castellanos-Rueda, Rocío; Eseverri, Álvaro; López-Torrejón, Gema; Burén, Stefan; Rubio, Luis Manuel",Commun Biol,,401

Based on the geo-tagging Sina Weibo data from February 3rd to 12th, 2020, this paper analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 cases in the main urban area of Wuhan and explores the urban spatial features of COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan. The results show that the elderly population accounts for more than half of the total number of Weibo help seekers, and a close correlation between them has also been found in terms of spatial distribution features, which confirms that the elderly population is the group of high-risk and high-prevalence in the COVID-19 outbreak, needing more attention of public health and epidemic prevention policies. On the other hand, the early transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan could be divide into three phrases: Scattered infection, community spread, and full-scale outbreak. This paper can help to understand the spatial transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan, so as to propose an effective public health preventive strategy for urban space optimization.","Peng, Zhenghong; Wang, Ru; Liu, Lingbo; Wu, Hao",ISPRS Int.

Differences in outcomes based on anesthetic agent choice with MAC has received less attention. The authors sought to determine whether differences in outcomes and cost exist based on whether patients receive dexmedetomidine or propofol when undergoing TAVR with MAC. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 161 patients who underwent TAVR with MAC between May 2014 and March 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A propofol-only (nâ¯=â¯58) group and dexmedetomidine-only (nâ¯=â¯103) group were identified. No differences in in-hospital mortality or complication rate were identified when evaluating for stroke, transfusion, new arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or bleeding and vascular complications (p > 0.05, all). Thirty-day outcomes were also equivalent, with no differences in mortality, stroke, vascular complication, new arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction (p > 0.05, all). The average amount of epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine used intraoperatively was not significantly different. Overall median hospitalization costs were equivalent ($57,554.31 with dexmedetomidine v $58,538.08 with propofol, pâ¯=â¯0.97). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in in-hospital outcomes, 30-day outcomes, or total cost of the patient's hospitalization, based on the use of dexmedetomidine versus propofol in patients undergoing TAVR.","Kronfli, Anthony P; Lehman, Erik; Yamane, Kentaro; Roberts, S Michael; Cios, Theodore J",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,401

OBJECTIVE: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals. SETTING: The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups. All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the supposed notion that COVID-19 could exhibit atypical clinical features or a worse evolution in the frail population of people with SCI.","D039,; Andrea, S; Berardicurti, O; Berardicurti, A; Felzani, G; Francavilla, F; Francavilla, S; Giacomelli, R; Barbonetti, A",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,,401

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"Introduction Surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major concern due to possibility of infection transmission among health care workers (HCWs) and patients, and a worsened surgical outcome;most surgeries are thus being deferred. However, we continued with emergency neurosurgeries using our own Neurosurgical Standard Operating Procedures (NS-SOPs). We describe here our institutional neurosurgical experience and observations of a retrospective analysis done to determine the incidence of workplace-acquired COVID infection among the HCWs, and the outcome of neurosurgery performed during the early phase of the on-going pandemic. Methods Our NS-SOPs included a Screening Proforma, and protocols for the conduct of neurosurgery, starting from the preoperative period till death or postdischarge follow-up of the patients. Protocols to ensure safety and mental well-being of the HCWs were also implemented. Patient and HCW data from April 1 to August 31, 2020 was collected and analyzed for the postsurgical patient outcome and for determining the level of workplace-transmitted COVID infection. Results Neurosurgeries were performed on 169 patients during this 5-month period. We observed a cumulative mortality of 17/169 (10.1%), with 5 patients having unexplained postoperative respiratory manifestations and rapid deterioration suggestive of COVID illness. Nineteen HCWs (8.83%), mostly nurses, were infected, but only 3 (16.7%) had workplace-acquired infection. The infections were sporadic with no cluster of infections observed. Conclusion Implementation of standard perioperative protocols and their continuous scrutiny, evaluation, and modification is important to contain infection in HCWs and to improve the neurosurgical outcome during this pandemic.","Khurana, P.; Ganjoo, P.; Duggal, S.; Kiro, K.

233471,Kidney Complications of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate whether dental and dental hygiene students' career plans postgraduation were affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine wellness and readiness for clinical practice among students who reported a change in career plans. METHODS: An anonymous online REDCap survey was developed and emailed to 436 dental and dental hygiene students at a US dental school. The survey consisted of 81 questions that covered demographics, career plans postgraduation, and readiness and wellness measures. An open-ended question assessing how students' career plans have changed during the pandemic was also included. RESULTS: A total of 252 students completed the survey, of whom 11.5% reported that their plans for future dental practice have changed since the COVID-19 outbreak. Students who reported a change to their career plans had significantly higher mean perceived stress (20.1 vs. 16.3; P = 0.003) and anxiety (9.2 vs. 6.2; P = 0.004) scores and lower mean resilience (18.9 vs. 20.9; P = 0.01) scores than those who reported no change to their career plans. Concerns were raised regarding the limited employment opportunities, long-term stability of the dental profession, and the interruptions to clinical education and licensure examinations consequent to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive effort inclusive of adeptly designed clinical and curriculum experiences paired with wellness interventions and support tailored to students is needed. These measures need to support trainees across varying years in training and resilience levels to be effective for dental and dental hygiene students as they approach their future career intentions in the dental profession. Additional longitudinal research is needed to assess if change in career intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic corresponds with actual change postpandemic and affects the dental profession.

234102,Correction to: Patients in intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia: the lung ultrasound patterns at admission and discharge. An observational pilot study,2021,"Due to their increased transmissibility, three variants of high concern have emerged in the United Kingdom (also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01), South Africa (B.1.351 lineage), and Brazil (P1 lineage) with multiple substitutions in the spike protein. Since neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination are likely considered as correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is important to analyze whether vaccinees with mRNA BNT162b2 are equally protected against these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. To this aim, we enrolled healthy subjects one month after complete vaccination with Comirnaty and evaluated the neutralizing response against the native Wuhan strain and the emerging B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P1 lineages, by using the microneutralization assay, currently considered the gold standard test for the evaluation and detection of functional neutralizing antibodies. The most remarkable finding of this study was the significantly lower neutralizing antibody titer against B.1.351 lineage, compared to the wild-type virus. No significant differences were observed with the other two lineages. These findings provide evidence that vaccinated subjects may not be equally protected against all SARS-CoV-2 lineages.","Anichini, Gabriele Terrosi Chiara Gori Savellini Gianni Gandolfo Claudia Franchi Federico Cusi Maria Grazia",Vaccines,,401

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease outbreak, social distancing measures were imposed to control the spread of the pandemic. However, isolation may affect negatively the psychological well-being and impair sleep quality. Our aim was to evaluate the sleep quality of respiratory patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: All patients who underwent a telemedicine appointment from March 30 to April 30 of 2020 were asked to participate in the survey. Sleep difficulties were measured using Jenkins Sleep Scale. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 365 patients (mean age 63.9 years, 55.6% male, 50.1% with sleep-disordered breathing [SDB]). During the lockdown, 78.9% of participants were confined at home without working. Most patients (69.6%) reported at least one sleep difficulty and frequent awakenings was the most prevalent problem. Reporting at least one sleep difficulty was associated with home confinement without working, female gender and diagnosed or suspected SDB, after adjustment for cohabitation status and use of anxiolytics. Home confinement without working was associated with difficulties falling asleep and waking up too early in the morning. Older age was a protective factor for difficulties falling asleep, waking up too early and non-restorative sleep. Notably, SDB patients with good compliance to positive airway pressure therapy were less likely to report sleep difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Home confinement without working, female gender and SDB may predict a higher risk of reporting sleep difficulties. Medical support during major disasters should be strengthened and potentially delivered through telemedicine, as this comprehensive approach could reduce psychological distress and improve sleep quality.","Pinto, Josué; van Zeller, Mafalda; Amorim, Pedro; Pimentel, Ana; Dantas, Patrícia; Eusébio, Ermelinda; Neves, Andreia; Pipa, Joana; Santa Clara, Elisabete; Santiago, Teresa; Viana, Paulo; Drummond, Marta",Sleep Med,,401

Recent evidence from small samples suggest that it has increased mood and sleep disturbances, including insomnia, around the world. This study aimed to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on insomnia levels worldwide and in the United States during the acute phase of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed search query data recorded between January 2004 and May 2020 from Google Trend and Google Keyword Planner for the search term insomnia. RESULTS: The number of search queries for insomnia has increased over the past decade and is greater than the number of search queries for other major sleep disorders. The COVID-19 pandemic increased search queries for insomnia both worldwide and in the United States, with the number in the United States increasing by 58% during the first five months of 2020 compared to same months from the previous three years. There is a robust diurnal pattern in insomnia search queries in the United States, with the number of queries peaking around 3 AM and the overall pattern remaining stable during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on sleep health, and the urgent need for making effective interventions accessible. Future studies will be needed to determine whether the increase in insomnia symptoms will persist and lead to higher rates of chronic insomnia in the population.","Zitting, Kirsi-Marja; Lammers-van der Holst, Heidi M; Yuan, Robin K; Wang, Wei; Quan, Stuart F; Duffy, Jeanne F",J. clin. sleep med,,401

The proposed evolutionary epidemic diffusion (EED) computational model has a limited number of variables and parameters, but is still able to simulate a variety of configurations that have a good adherence to real-world cases. The use of two space distances and the calculation of spatial 2-dimensional entropy are also examined. Several simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the EED for testing distinct social, logistic and economy risks. The performance of the system dynamics is assessed by several variables and indices. The global information is efficiently condensed and visualized by means of multidimensional scaling.","Machado, J.

237720,Impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on body weight: A combined systematic review and a meta-analysis,2021,"Advancements in the field of cellular immunotherapy have accelerated in recent years and have changed the treatment landscape for a variety of hematologic malignancies. Cellular immunotherapy strategies exploit the patient's immune system to kill cancer cells. The successful use of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in treating B-cell malignancies is the paradigm of this revolution, and numerous ongoing studies are investigating and extending this approach to other malignancies. However, resistance to CAR-T-cell therapy and non-durable efficacy have prevented CAR-T-cells from becoming the ultimate therapy. Because natural killer (NK) cells play an essential role in antitumor immunity, adoptively transferred allogeneic NK and CAR-modified NK cell therapy has been attempted in certain disease subgroups. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the oldest form of cellular immunotherapy and the only curative option for hematologic malignancies. Historically, the breadth of application of allo-HSCT has been limited by a lack of identical sibling donors (ISDs). However, great strides have recently been made in the success of haploidentical allografts worldwide, which enable everyone to have a donor. Haploidentical donors can achieve comparable outcomes to those of ISDs and even better outcomes in certain circumstances because of a stronger graft vs. tumor effect. Currently, novel strategies such as CAR-T or NK-based immunotherapy can be applied as a complement to allo-HSCT for curative effects, particularly in refractory cases. Here, we introduce the developments in cellular immunotherapy in hematology.","Xu, Zhengli; Huang, Xiaojun",,,401

The use of this technology has been shown to improve outpatient glycemic outcomes and quality of life and oftentimes may be continued in the hospital setting. Our aim is to review the current guidelines and available evidence on the continuation of insulin pumps and CGMs in the inpatient setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients with diabetes are at higher risk for hospitalizations and complications due to hyper- or hypoglycemia, metabolic co-morbidities, or as seen recently, more severe illness from infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The maintenance of euglycemia is important to decrease both morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. There is consensus among experts and medical societies that inpatient use of diabetes technology in carefully selected patients with proper institutional protocols is safe and can improve inpatient glycemic outcomes and reduce hypoglycemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CGMs played a vital role in managing hyperglycemia in some hospitalized patients. Insulin pumps and CGMs have the potential to transform glycemic management in hospitalized patients. In order for institutions to safely and effectively incorporate these technologies on their inpatient units, hospital-based providers will need to be able to understand how to manage and utilize these devices in their practice in conjunction with diabetes experts.","Yeh, Tiffany; Yeung, Michele; Mendelsohn Curanaj, Felicia A",Curr Diab Rep,,401

Abnormality in liver function tests (LFTs) has been commonly observed in patients with COVID-19, but there is controversy on its clinical significance. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, the characteristics and the clinical impact of abnormal LFTs in hospitalized, non-critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective study, we collected data about 565 inpatients with COVID-19. Data on LFTs were collected at admission and every 7 ± 2 days during the hospitalization. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death or transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: Upon admission 329 patients (58%) had LFTs abnormality. Patients with abnormal LFTs had more severe inflammation and higher degree of organ dysfunction than those without. During hospitalization, patients with abnormal LFTs had a higher rate of transfer to ICU (20% vs 8%; P < .001), acute kidney injury (22% vs 13%, P = .009), need for mechanical ventilation (14% vs 6%; P = .005) and mortality (21% vs 11%; P = .004) than those without. In multivariate analysis, patients with abnormal LFTs had a higher risk of the composite endpoint of death or transfer to ICU (OR = 3.53; P < .001). During the hospitalization, 86 patients developed de novo LFTs abnormality, which was associated with the use of tocilizumab, lopinavir/ritonavir and acetaminophen and not clearly associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: LFTs abnormality is common at admission in patients with COVID-19, is associated with systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction and is an independent predictor of transfer to ICU or death.","Piano, Salvatore; Dalbeni, Andrea; Vettore, Elia; Benfaremo, Devis; Mattioli, Massimo; Gambino, Carmine G; Framba, Viviana; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Mantovani, Anna; Martini, Andrea; Luchetti, Michele M; Serra, Roberto; Cattelan, Annamaria; Vettor, Roberto; Angeli, Paolo",Liver Int,,401

The secondary aim was to estimate the promptness of contact tracing. MethodsA population-based analysis of surveillance data of all COVID-19 cases occurring in RE, Italy, from September 1, 2020, to April 4th, 2021, for which a school contact and/or exposure was suspected. Indicator of the delay in contact tracing was computed as the time elapsed since positivity of the index case and the date on which the swab for classmates was scheduled (or most were scheduled). ResultsOverall, 30,426 and 13,571 contacts among classmates and teachers/staff, respectively, were identified and received recommendation for testing; 43,414 (98.7%) performed the test. Secondary transmission occurred in about 40% of the investigated classes, and the overall secondary case attack rate was 4%, slightly higher when the index case was a teacher, but with almost no differences by type of school and stable during the study period. Promptness of contact tracing increased during the study period, reducing the time from index case identification and testing of contacts from 7 to 3 days, as well the ability to identify possible source of infection in the index case (from 42% in September/October, to 22% in November, to 50% in December-April).

Data were collected at two different points: November 2019 (Coronavirus disease 19 had not yet spread) and April 2020 (during the lockdown in Italy). Twenty-two study participants were recruited from three residential accredited psychiatric facilities. During lockdown, the patients showed a small increase in symptomatology in terms of emotional isolation. In addition, it was been observed significant differences in certain functional areas of the behavior, measured as lower inclination towards violent behaviors during lockdown, and higher scores in substance abuse and medical impairment. The lockdown condition could represent a form of containment; daily routines, along with adequate social support, are important aspects of the stability and the level of behavioral functioning of psychiatric patients. Social support and continuity of care offered by psychiatric communities can be an effective safeguard against the psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Cordellieri, Pierluigi; Barchielli, Benedetta; Masci, Valeria; Viani, Francesca; de Pinto, Ivan; Priori, Andrea; Torriccelli, Felice Damiano; Cosmo, Chiara; Ferracuti, Stefano; Giannini, Anna Maria; Burrai, Jessica",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,401
246525,Prevalence and Outcomes of Cardiovascular Complications amongst Covid-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported a low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 cases; however, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of tobacco smoke exposure with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity accounting for possible confounders. METHODS: The nationwide, self-administered, cross-sectional web-based Italian National Epidemiological Survey on COVID-19 (EPICOVID19) was administered to an Italian population of 198,822 adult volunteers who filled in an online questionnaire between April 13 and June 2, 2020. For this study, we analyzed 6857 individuals with known NPS test results. The associations of smoking status and the dose-response relationship with a positive NPS test result and infection severity were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs by means of logistic and multinomial regression models adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Out of the 6857 individuals (mean age 47.9 years, SD 14.1; 4516/6857, 65.9% female), 63.2% (4334/6857) had never smoked, 21.3% (1463/6857) were former smokers, and 15.5% (1060/6857) were current smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, current smokers were younger, were more educated, were less affected by chronic diseases, reported COVID-19-like symptoms less frequently, were less frequently hospitalized, and less frequently tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, current smokers had almost half the odds of a positive NPS test result (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to nonsmokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate smokers (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), and heavy smokers (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53). This inverse association also persisted when considering the severity of the infection. Current smokers had a statistically significantly lower probability of having asymptomatic (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), mild (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.81), and severe infections (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) compared to those who never smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-dependent relationship.

This requires that scientific results be reproduced, reviewed by peers and independent experts, and with conflicts of interest fully declared. By following this and invoking the four ethical principles of necessity, precaution, proportionality, and clarity, scientific information will be valid and public health decisions respected.","Deps, Patrícia; Cassimiro, Márcia",Ethics Med Public Health,,401

Therefore, the knowledge of coinfection and the common pathogens during these challenging times is essential for antibiotic stewardship practices. Recent findings:The incidence of reported superimposed bacterial and viral coinfections in COVID-19 patients Is around 0.04 to 17%. However, more than 70% of patients have received broad-spectrum antibiotics.The presence of a simultaneous coinfection can be suspected in patients with neutrophilic lymphocytosis and elevated procalcitonin in the setting of COVID-19. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels, with its short turnaround time, aid in the definitive diagnosis of possible coinfection. Acinetobacter baumanii, Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza virus, Aspergillus, Candida, etc., are commonly implicated pathogens. Summary: Rapid characterization of coinfection and avoidance of overzealous use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in COVID-19 patients are the key to prevent antibiotic resistance during this pandemic.","Kayarat, B.; Khanna, P.; Sarkar, S.",Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine,,401
250663,Simple Parameters from Complete Blood Count Predict In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19,2021,"Neutralizing antibodies are the basis of almost all approved prophylactic vaccines and the foundation of effective protection from pathogens, including the recently emerging SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the contribution of antibodies to protection and to the course of the disease during first-time exposure to a pathogen is unknown. We analyzed the antibodies and B cell responses in severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Despite our primary assumption that high antibody titers contribute to a mild disease, we found that severe COVID-19 illness, and not mild infection, correlates with strong anti-viral antibody and memory B cell responses. This phenomenon was also demonstrated for anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibiting antibodies that we recently isolated from an actively infected Tuberculosis-sick donor. This correlation between disease severity and antibody responses can be explained by the fact that high viral loads drive B cell stimulation and generation of high-affinity antibodies that will be protective upon future encounter with the particular pathogen.","Freund, Natalia T",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,401

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also caused serious outbreak previously but the intensity was much lower than the ongoing SARS-CoV-2. The main infectivity factor of all the three viruses is the spike glycoprotein. In this study we have examined the intrinsic dynamics of the prefusion, lying state of trimeric S protein of these viruses through Normal Mode Analysis using Anisotropic Network Model. The dynamic modes of the S proteins of the aforementioned viruses were compared by root mean square inner product (RMSIP), spectral overlap and cosine correlation matrix. S proteins show homogenous correlated or anticorrelated motions among their domains but direction of C&#945; atom among the spike proteins show less similarity. SARS-CoV-2 spike shows high vertically upward motion of the receptor binding motif implying its propensity for binding with the receptor even in the lying state. MERS-CoV spike shows unique dynamical motion compared to the other two S protein indicated by low RMSIP, spectral overlap and cosine correlation value. This study will guide in developing common potential inhibitor molecules against closed state of spike protein of these viruses to prevent conformational switching from lying to standing state.","Majumder, Satyabrata; Chaudhuri, Dwaipayan; Datta, Joyeeta; Giri, Kalyan",J Mol Graph Model,,401

METHODS: The active components and target proteins in 21 drugs such as Ephedrae Herba and Pinelliae Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu decoction were analyzed, and the signaling pathways and biological functions of the target proteins common with COVID-19 were screened by using TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction, CooLGeN, GeneCards, DAVID and other databases. The network diagram of Qingfei Paidu decoction was constructed using Gephi software. RESULTS: We identified 163 active ingredients, including MOL004798, MOL000519, MOL004824, MOL000554, MOL010428, and MOL013443, from 18 drugs in Qingfei Paidu decoction (such as Ephedrae Herba, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhiizoma, Farfarae Flos, Asteris Radix Et Rhizoma and Aurantii Fructus Immaturus). These ingredients activate renin-angiotensin system signaling pathway and apoptosis signaling pathway by regulating 10 protein targets (ACE, ACE2, AGTR1, FURIN, TNF, CASP3, CASP6, DPP4, MCL1 and POLD1) to execute 42 biological functions such as renin-angiotensin regulation of blood volume and systemic arterial blood pressure to treat COVID-19. The results of preliminary molecular docking showed that MOL000519 (from Pinelliae Rhizoma), MOL000554 (from Farfarae Flos), MOL004798 (from Ephedrae Herba), MOL004824 (from Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhiizoma), MOL010428 (from Asteris Radix Et Rhizoma), and MOL013443 (from Aurantii Fructus Immaturus) had good affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase to form complexes with stable conformations and high binding activity (binding energy &#8804;- 5 kJ/mol). CONCLUSIONS: Qingfei Paidu decoction can treat COVID-19 through its multiple medicinal ingredients that have multiple targets and involve multiple signaling pathways for different biological functions. Our finding provides reference for further investigation into the pharmacological mechanism of Qingfei Paidu decoction in treating COVID-19.","Yan, Haiyan; Zou, Yan; Zou, Chuncai",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,401

Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed on 150 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in the fever clinic of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January to February in 2020, including 126 mild cases and 24 cases in critical care. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the correlation of past medical history including hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) , as well as the levels of serum NT-proBNP and cTnI to the disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Results: Age, hypersensitive C-reactive protein(hs-CRP) and serum creatinine levels of the patients were higher in critical care cases than in mild cases(all P<0.05). Prevalence of male, elevated NT-proBNP and cTnI, hypertension and coronary heart disease were significantly higher in critical cases care patients than in the mild cases(all P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, male, elevated NT-proBNP, elevated cTnI, elevated hs-CRP, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and CHD were significantly correlated with critical disease status(all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated cTnI(OR=26.909, 95%CI 4.086-177.226, P=0.001) and CHD (OR=16.609, 95%CI 2.288-120.577, P=0.005) were the independent risk factors of critical disease status. Conclusions: COVID-19 can significantly affect the heart function and lead to myocardial injury. The past medical history of CHD and increased level of cTnI are two independent determinants of clinical disease status in patients with COVID-19.","Chen, C; Yan, J T; Zhou, N; Zhao, J P; Wang, D W",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,401

COVID-19 infection has a thrombogenic potential for stents. Herein, we report a case of stent thrombosis in diabetic obese patient COVID-19 positive where was previously released a Multilayer Flow Modulator stent (MFM) for large popliteal aneurysm. CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old male was referred to our hospital for fever and acute pain in the left leg. At history, the same patient had endovascular procedure for a large symptomatic popliteal aneurysm, treated through release of three MFM. The pulmonary CT scan showed COVID-19 infection with confirm of rhino-laryngeal swab. Duplex ultrasound and CT-angiography showed complete thrombosis of stents. The treatment consisted of mechanical thrombectomy using an 8Fr catheter Rotarex plus release of Vibahn stent-graft. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 patients can present arterial occlusion. In literature are not reported cases about thrombosis peripheral stent. Minimally invasive approaches in redo-procedure reduce risk of infection. Rotarex device was used in revascularization of acute and subacute iliac and femoropopliteal arteries. The goal is to have a debulking, to avoid an incomplete deployment of stent-graft. In our precedent experience, MFM and stent-graft to treatment of popliteal aneurism were safe. It is important to monitor these patients for early identification of failure and rapprochement. In this case, the COVID-19 infection was determinant in promoting thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 increases risk of thrombosis stent. In our experience debulking through Rotarex and stenting, were decisive factors for revascularization and limb salvage.","Dinoto, E; Ferlito, F; Urso, F; Pakeliani, D; Bajardi, G; Pecoraro, F",Int J Surg Case Rep,,401

However, most researchers have recorded smell dysfunction solely as present or absent and based on subjective evaluation by patients. We described the results of 57 consecutive COVID-19 patients seen at FIOCRUZ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from April to May 2020. Data about the presence of smell loss, the onset of smell loss and other COVID-19 symptoms such as ageusia and nasal congestion or rhinorrhea were recorded. All patients at the initial consultation and 34 healthy controls underwent the Q-SIT, which is a quick disposable three-item smell identification test, by a trained physician. We compared three groups: healthy controls, COVID+ patients with reported smell loss (COVID w/ SL) and COVID+ patients without smell loss (COVID+ w/o SL). The mean age of patients was 41.4 years (SD ± 10.4), and 54.4% were women. Smell loss was reported by 40.4% of COVID-19 patients. We observed a gradual effect with higher Q-SIT scores in healthy controls, followed by COVID+ w/o SL and COVID+ w/ SL (medians = 3, 2 and 0; respectively, p < 0.001). Anosmia or severe microsmia (Q-SIT&#8804;1) was present in 11.1% (CI: 3.1%-26.1%) of controls, 32.4% (CI: 17.4%-50.5%) of COVID-19 w/o SL and 87% (CI: 66.4%-97.2%) of COVID+ w/ SL (p < 0.001).

264231,Risk Factors for Covid-19 Related Mortality- a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 26 Studies and 9690 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: An established body of literature has shown evidence of implicit bias in the health care system on the basis of patient race and ethnicity that contributes to well documented disparities in outcomes. However, little is known about the influence of patient race and ethnicity on the decision to order diagnostic radiology exams in the acute care setting. This study examines the role of patient race and ethnicity on the likelihood of diagnostic imaging exams being ordered during United States emergency department encounters. METHODS: Publicly available data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Emergency Department sample for the years 2006-2016 was compiled. The proportion of patient encounters where diagnostic imaging was ordered was tabulated by race/ethnicity, sub-divided by imaging modality. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the influence of patient race/ethnicity on the ordering of diagnostic imaging controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Survey weighting variables were used to formulate national-level estimates. RESULTS: Using the weighted data, an average of 131,558,553 patient encounters were included each year for the 11-year study period. Imaging was used at 46% of all visits although this varied significantly by patient race and ethnicity with white patients receiving medical imaging at 49% of visits and non-white patients at 41% of visits (p < 0.001). This effect persisted in the controlled regression model and across all imaging modalities with the exception of ultrasound. Other factors with a significant influence on imaging use included patient age, gender, insurance status, number of co-morbidities, hospital setting (urban vs non-urban) and hospital region. There was no evidence to suggest that the disparate use of imaging by patient race and ethnicity changed over the 11-year study time period. CONCLUSION: The likelihood that a diagnostic imaging exam will be ordered during United States emergency department encounters differs significantly by patient race and ethnicity even when controlling for other patient and hospital characteristics. Further work must be done to understand and mitigate what may represent systematic bias and ensure equitable use of health care resources.","Ross, Andrew B; Kalia, Vivek; Chan, Brian Y; Li, Geng",BMC Health Serv Res,,401

Methods: A total of 115 patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to Tianyou Hospital of Wuhan University of Science and Technology between January 18, 2020, and March 5, 2020, were included. The dynamic changes of DD, PT, APTT, and Fg were tested, and the correlation with CT imaging, clinical classifications, and prognosis was studied. Results: Coagulation disorder occurred at the early stage of COVID-19 infection, with 50 (43.5%) patients having DD increased and 74 (64.3%) patients having Fg increased. The levels of DD and Fg were correlated with clinical classification. Among 23 patients who deceased, 18 had DD increased at the first lab test, 22 had DD increased at the second and third lab tests, and 18 had prolonged PT at the third test. The results from ROC analyses for mortality risk showed that the AUCs of DD were 0.742, 0.818, and 0.851 in three times of test, respectively; PT was 0.643, 0.824, and 0.937. In addition, with the progression of the disease, the change of CT imaging was closely related to the increase of the DD value (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Coagulation dysfunction is more likely to occur in severe and critically ill patients. DD and PT could be used as the significant indicators in predicting the mortality of COVID-19.","Long, Hui; Nie, Lan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Li, Huan; Zhang, Xiaoli; Fu, Xiaozhi; Ren, Hongwei; Liu, Wanxin; Wang, Qiang; Wu, Qingming",Biomed Res Int,,401

273539,Impact of the Covid Pandemic on Non-covid Heart Failure Patients,2021,"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus associated with diarrhea and high mortality in piglets. To gain insight into the evolution and adaptation of TGEV, a comprehensive analysis of phylogeny and codon usage bias was performed. The phylogenetic analyses of maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference displayed two distinct genotypes: genotypes I and II, and genotype I was classified into subtypes Ia and Ib. The compositional properties revealed that the coding sequence contained a higher number of A/U nucleotides than G/C nucleotides, and that the synonymous codon third position was A/U-enriched. The principal component analysis based on the values of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) showed the genotype-specific codon usage patterns. The effective number of codons (ENC) indicated moderate codon usage bias in the TGEV genome. Dinucleotide analysis showed that CpA and UpG were over-represented and CpG was under-represented in the coding sequence of the TGEV genome. The analyses of Parity Rule 2 plot, ENC-plot, and neutrality plot displayed that natural selection was the dominant evolutionary driving force in shaping codon usage preference in genotypes Ia and II. In addition, natural selection played a major role, while mutation pressure had a minor role in driving the codon usage bias in genotype Ib. The codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index (SiD) analyses suggested that genotype I might be more adaptive to pigs than genotype II. Current findings contribute to understanding the evolution and adaptation of TGEV.","Cheng, Saipeng; Wu, Huiguang; Chen, Zhenhai",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),,401

273801,In the Limelight: November 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This clinical trial evaluated the effects of red wine exposure on the effectiveness of at-home bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide, degree of tooth sensitivity, and levels of periodontal inflammatory markers. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eighty participants were assigned to two groups, namely, those who drank red wine (experimental group), and those who did not drink red wine (control group). The experimental group participants rinsed their mouths with 25 mL of red wine four times a day during the bleaching period. Shade evaluation was assessed visually by using the Vita Classical and Vita Easyshade techniques. Tooth sensitivity was evaluated by the numeric and visual analog scales, and the salivary and gingival crevicular fluids were collected for assessment of nitric oxide (NO) levels, a marker of inflammation. Differences in color change were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The absolute risks of tooth sensitivity were compared by the Fisher exact test. Tooth sensitivity intensity data sets for both the visual analog scale and the numeric rating scale were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (&#945; = .05). Repeated measures and two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test were used to assess time-course and differences between groups in NO production. RESULTS: The bleaching technique was effective regardless of wine consumption (P > .05). Tooth sensitivity was classified as mild, with no differences between groups (P > .05). Red wine reduced both the gingival crevicular fluid and salivary levels of NO (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Red wine does not interfere with the effectiveness and sensitivity of at-home teeth bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide and protects against bleaching-induced inflammation.","Menezes, Lucas Lage; Lima, Suellen Nogueira Linares; Maia-Filho, Etevaldo Matos; Fernandes, Elizabeth Soares; Mendes, Saulo Jose Figueredo; Gonçalves, Leticia Machado; Bandeca, Matheus Coelho; Reis, Alessandra; Loguercio, Alessandro D; Tavarez, Rudys Rodolfo De Jesus",Quintessence Int,,401

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Horizontal/vertical defects of 2 cm length and 1 cm height were created bilaterally in the alveolar crest of the maxillae of 18 minipigs together with the extraction of all premolar teeth and one molar tooth on both sides. After 3 months of healing, defects were augmented with 0.5 g particulate PDLLA/CaCO3 composite loaded with 400 µg rhBMP2/50 µg rhVEGF165 on one side and 800 µg rhBMP2 on the other in 12 test animals, whereas defects in six control animals were sham operated and left unfilled on one side and augmented with blank carriers on the other. After 4 and 13 weeks, the animals were evaluated each for area of new bone formation (mm²) and bone density (area %). RESULTS: Augmentations with carriers loaded with 800 g µrhBMP2 failed to induce significantly more bone than in the augmentations with unloaded carrier after 4 and 13 weeks (p = .1000, p = .381). Augmentations with carriers loaded with 400 µg rhBMP2 and 50 µg erhVEGF165 resulted in significantly increased bone formation after 13 weeks (p = .024) compared to blank carriers. Soft tissue in augmentations with combined rhBMP2/rhVEGF165 loading exhibited numerous microvessels compared to soft tissue in augmentations with rhBMP2. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that effective bone regeneration in augmentations of established alveolar ridge defects may require the application of rhVEGF additionally to rhBMP2.","Kauffmann, Philipp; Raschke, David; Tröltzsch, Markus; Santander, Petra; Brockmeyer, Phillip; Schliephake, Henning",Clin. oral implants res,,401

Following the outbreak, the government provided the first national disaster relief fund to citizens as financial aid. This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and t-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens' mental health care.","Kim, Young-Jae; Cho, Jeong-Hyung; Kim, E-Sack",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,401

Studies show that colchicine, among other actions, inhibits the assembly of NLRP3 complex that is responsible for generating the active form of Caspase-1 that will convert Pro-IL-1ß and Pro-IL-18 into their active forms. We suggest using colchicine, a class of drugs with low-cost, extensively tested, well-tolerated medicine as a complementary treatment for patients with COVID-19, in early stages of the disease based on knowledge of its immunomodulatory properties.","Ribeiro, Sandro Augusto; Lopes, Cassio; Amaral, Ricardo; Amaral, Adilaine",Metabol Open,,401

There is ongoing debate about the appropriate duration of quarantine, particularly since the fraction of individuals who eventually test positive is perceived as being low. We use empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how the duration of quarantine affects onward transmission from traced contacts of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and from returning travellers. We also consider the roles of testing followed by release if negative (test-and-release), reinforced hygiene, adherence, and symptoms in calculating quarantine efficacy. We show that there are quarantine strategies based on a test-and-release protocol that, from an epidemiological viewpoint, perform almost as well as a 10-day quarantine, but with fewer person-days spent in quarantine. The findings apply to both travellers and contacts, but the specifics depend on the context.","Ashcroft, Peter; Lehtinen, Sonja; Angst, Daniel C; Low, Nicola; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian",eLife (Cambridge),,401

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in China, which causes COVID-19 disease in humans, and its current spread to several countries, leading to the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus, highlights the significance of zoonotic viral diseases. Rift Valley fever, rabies, West Nile, chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, and influenza viruses among many other viruses have been reported from different African countries. The paucity of information, lack of knowledge, limited resources, and climate change, coupled with cultural traditions make the African continent a hotspot for vector-borne and zoonotic viral diseases, which may spread globally. Currently, there is no information available on the status of virus diseases in Africa. This systematic review highlights the available information about viral diseases, including zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, reported in Africa. The findings will help us understand the trend of emerging and re-emerging virus diseases within the African continent. The findings recommend active surveillance of viral diseases and strict implementation of One Health measures in Africa to improve human public health and reduce the possibility of potential pandemics due to zoonotic viruses.","Chauhan, Ravendra P.; Dessie, Zelalem G.; Noreddin, Ayman; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.",Pathogens,,401
289302,Predicting outcomes of COVID-19 from admission biomarkers: a prospective UK cohort study,2021,"This paper assesses the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of exporting companies in Benin. It also identifies factors that explain the perceived effect of COVID-19 on the companies' performance. To do this, we used a survey data covering 122 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and micro, small, and medium industry (MSMIs) in four communes in Benin. Firstly, we computed the annual rate change in quarterly turnover to capture the effect of the COVID-19. Secondly, a multiple regression was estimated to identify factors explaining the perceived effect of the COVID-19 on the exporting companies. We found that the exporting companies experience on average a 53.308% drop in quarterly turnover in 2020 probably due to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the forecasts, the results also revealed a very slow recovery in activities but the rate of change will remain negative until 2021 if nothing is done to support the MSMEs/MSMIs. Finally, we found that the perceived effect of the COVID-19 depends on the level of education of head of the companies, on the experience in exportation, and on the organization of the work because of the pandemic. Our findings suggest the necessity for public policy support toward the MSMEs/MSMIs to contain the effect of the pandemic in Benin.","Chabossou, Augustin F C; Nonvide, Gbêtondji Melaine Armel; Lokonon, Boris O K; Amegnaglo, Cocou Jaurès; Akpo, Laurent G",Eur J Dev Res,,401

These properties allow them to be used as an element of biosensors for the detection of specific proteins, including viral ones, which makes it possible to design valuable diagnostic tools. The influenza virus causes a huge number of human and animal deaths worldwide every year, and contributes to remarkable economic losses. In addition, in 2020, a new threat appeared-the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Both disease entities, especially in the initial stage of infection, are almost identical in terms of signs and symptoms. Therefore, a diagnostic solution is needed that will allow distinguishing between both pathogens, with high sensitivity and specificity; it should be cheap, quick and possible to use in the field, for example, in a doctor's office. All the mentioned properties are met by aptasensors in which the detection elements are specific aptamers. We present here the latest developments in the construction of various types of aptasensors for the detection of influenza virus. Aptasensor operation is based on the measurement of changes in electric impedance, fluorescence or electric signal (impedimetric, fluorescence and electrochemical aptasensors, respectively); it allows both qualitative and quantitative determinations. The particularly high advancement for detecting of influenza virus concerns impedimetric aptasensors.","Wedrowska, Ewelina; Wandtke, Tomasz; Piskorska, Elzbieta; Kopinski, Piotr",Viruses,,401

This COVID-19 pilot project was conducted during June and July 2020 in low-income residential neighborhoods in West Baltimore, Maryland. Quantitative data were collected and assessed cross-sectionally. Demographically, 85% of the patients identified as Black or African American (n = 265) and 58.2% as female (n = 184). The COVID-19 test was administered by the registered nurse to 78.2% (n = 288) of the patients. More than 90% of patients confirmed high levels of satisfaction with the services they received from the community mobile health clinic. Social determinants were assessed and females reported significantly worse health literacy than their male counterparts (P < 0.05). Study findings suggest that the community mobile health clinic model was effective in attracting hard-to-reach and marginalized individuals, who otherwise may have gone untested or undiagnosed. This care delivery model can be one solution to disparities by improving access to COVID-19 testing and primary care for communities with higher vulnerability to COVID-19 complications.","Baker, David R; Cadet, Kechna; Mani, Susan",Popul. health manag.

However, the high volume of vaping-related posts on social media makes compliance auditing expensive and time-consuming, suggesting that an automated, scalable method is needed. We sought to develop and evaluate a deep learning system designed to automatically determine if an Instagram post promotes vaping, and if so, if an FDA-compliant warning label was included or if a non-compliant warning label was visible in the image. We compiled and labeled a dataset of 4,363 Instagram images, of which 44% were vaping-related, 3% contained FDA-compliant warning labels, and 4% contained non-compliant labels. Using a 20% test set for evaluation, we tested multiple neural network variations: image processing backbone model (Inceptionv3, ResNet50, EfficientNet), data augmentation, progressive layer unfreezing, output bias initialization designed for class imbalance, and multitask learning. Our final model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) and [accuracy] of 0.97 [92%] on vaping classification, 0.99 [99%] on FDA-compliant warning labels, and 0.94 [97%] on non-compliant warning labels.

Here, the authors propose a sulcus-centered resection strategy for this malformation, provide technical details, and assess the efficacy and safety of this technique. The main purpose of the sulcus-centered resection is to remove the folded gray matter surrounding a dysplastic sulcus, particularly that at the bottom of the sulcus. The authors also retrospectively reviewed the records of 88 consecutive patients with FCD II treated with resective surgery between January 2015 and December 2018. The demographics, clinical characteristics, electrophysiological recordings, neuroimaging studies, histopathological findings, surgical outcomes, and complications were collected. After the exclusion of diffusely distributed and gyrus-based lesions, 71 patients (30 females, 41 males) who had undergone sulcus-centered resection were included in this study. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the cohort was 17.78 ± 10.54 years (38 pediatric patients, 33 adults). Thirty-five lesions (49%) were demonstrated on MRI; 42 patients (59%) underwent stereo-EEG monitoring before resective surgery; and 37 (52%) and 34 (48%) lesions were histopathologically proven to be FCD IIa and IIb, respectively. At a mean follow-up of 3.34 ± 1.17 years, 64 patients (90%) remained seizure free, and 7 (10%) had permanent neurological deficits including motor weakness, sensory deficits, and visual field deficits. The study findings showed that in carefully selected FCD II cases, sulcus-centered resection is an effective and safe surgical strategy.","Zhao, Baotian; Zhang, Chao; Wang, Xiu; Wang, Yao; Liu, Chang; Mo, Jiajie; Zheng, Zhong; Zhang, Kai; Shao, Xiao-Qiu; Hu, Wenhan; Zhang, Jianguo",J Neurosurg,,401

The risk factors already identified for developing complications from a COVID-19 infection are age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease. These risk factors, however, do not account for the other 52% of deaths arising from COVID-19 in often seemingly healthy individuals. This paper investigates the potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and bacterial load, questioning whether bacteria may play a role in bacterial superinfections and complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. The connection between COVID-19 complications and oral health and periodontal disease is also examined, as the comorbidities at highest risk of COVID-19 complications also cause imbalances in the oral microbiome and increase the risk of periodontal disease. We explore the connection between high bacterial load in the mouth and post-viral complications, and how improving oral health may reduce the risk of complications from COVID-19.","Sampson, Victoria; Kamona, Nawar; Sampson, Ariane",Br Dent J,,401

Among other reasons, the exorbitant costs, high attrition rate and extensive periods of time from research to market approval are the primary contributing factors to the lag in recent traditional drug developmental activities. Due to these reasons, drug developers are starting to consider drug repurposing (or repositioning) as a viable alternative to the more traditional drug development process. Drug repurposing aims to find alternative uses of an approved or investigational drug outside of its original indication. The key advantages of this approach are that there is less developmental risk, and it is less time-consuming since the safety and pharmacological profile of the repurposed drug is already established. To that end, various approaches to drug repurposing are employed. Computational approaches make use of machine learning and algorithms to model disease and drug interaction, while experimental approaches involve a more traditional wet-lab experiments. This review would discuss in detail various ongoing drug repurposing strategies and approaches to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic, along with the advantages and the potential challenges.","Ng, Yan Ling; Salim, Cyrill Kafi; Chu, Justin Jang Hann",Pharmacol Ther,,401

Positive significant correlations were found between the prevalence (per million) and mortality rates (per million), and GT genotype (P < .05) while there was a negative significant correlation between prevalence (per million) and mortality rates (per million), and TT genotype at rs7041 locus among all populations (P < .05). However, no significant correlation was found at rs4588 locus. GT genotype was found to confer this susceptibility to the populations of Germany, Mexico, Italy, Czech, and Turkey. The variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and its mortality rates among countries may be explained by Vitamin D metabolism differed by the DBP polymorphisms of rs7041 and rs4588.","Karcioglu Batur, Lutfiye; Hekim, Nezih",J Med Virol,,401

There has been much debate on whether the damage of COVID-19 is due predominantly to the pathogen itself or our response to it. We compare SARS-CoV-2 against three other major pandemics (1347 Black Death, 1520's new world smallpox outbreaks, and 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic) over the course of 700 years to unearth similarities and differences in pathogen, social and medical context, human response and behavior, and long-term social and economic impact that should be used to shape COVID-19 decision-making. We conclude that <100 years ago, pandemic disease events were still largely uncontrolled and unexplained. The extensive damage wreaked by historical pandemics on health, economy, and society was a function of pathogen characteristics and lack of public health resources. Though there remain many similarities in patterns of disease spread and response from 1300 onwards, the major risks posed by COVID-19 arise not from the pathogen, but from indirect effects of control measures on health and core societal activities. Our understanding of the epidemiology and effective treatment of this virus has rapidly improved and attention is shifting toward the identification of long-term control strategies that balance consideration of health in at risk populations, societal behavior, and economic impact. Policymakers should use lessons from previous pandemics to develop appropriate risk assessments and control plans for now-endemic COVID-19, and for future pandemics.","Patterson, Grace E; McIntyre, K Marie; Clough, Helen E; Rushton, Jonathan",Front Public Health,,401

Despite its international aggressive extension, with a significant morbidity and mortality, the impact of renal function on its prognosis is uncertain. METHODS: Analysis from the international HOPE-Registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to evaluate the association between kidney failure severity on admission with the mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were categorized in 3 groups according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate on admission (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). RESULTS: 758 patients were included: mean age was 66 ± 18 years, and 58.6% of patient were male. Only 8.5% of patients had a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, 30% of patients had kidney dysfunction upon admission (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). These patients received less frequently pharmacological treatment with hydroxychloroquine or antivirals and had a greater number of complications such as sepsis (11.9% vs 26.4% vs 40.8%, p < 0.001) and respiratory failure (35.4% vs 72.2% vs 62.0%, p < 0.001) as well as a higher in-hospital mortality rate (eGFR > 60 vs eGFR 30-60 vs and eGFR < 30, 18.4% vs 56.5% vs 65.5%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis: age, hypertension, renal function, 02 saturation < 92% and lactate dehydrogenase elevation on admission independently predicted all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Renal failure on admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequent and is associated with a greater number of complications and in-hospital mortality. Our data comes from a multicenter registry and therefore does not allow to have a precise mortality risk assessment. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Uribarri, Aitor; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Aparisi, Alvaro; Becerra-Muñoz, Victor M; Feltes, Gisela; Trabattoni, Daniela; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Viana-Llamas, María C; Pepe, Martino; Cerrato, Enrico; Capel-Astrua, Thamar; Romero, Rodolfo; Castro-Mejía, Alex F; El-Battrawy, Ibrahim; López-País, Javier; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Fabregat-Andres, Oscar; Bardají, Alfredo; Raposeiras-Roubin, Sergio; Marín, Francisco; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; Macaya, Carlos; Estrada, Vicente",J Nephrol,,401

309275,Treatment of COVID-19: old tricks for new challenges,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Recent work has attempted to uncover heterogeneity in experiences of victimization. However, few studies have included important trauma-related characteristics such as known perpetrator, fear of life or injury, and negative reactions to disclosure. Little focus on potentially important subgroup differences including sexual/gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as protective factors have been assessed. METHOD: Participants (N = 2,880) completed four annual surveys during late adolescence and the transition to young adulthood as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Latent class analysis was used to extract classes of victimization and trauma-related characteristics. Latent class regression was used to understand how demographic covariates were related to class membership. Finally, discrete-time survival mixture analysis was used to assess latency to opioid use from ages 17 to 24 years, and how demographic and protective factors influenced opioid use across emergent classes. RESULTS: The four-class solution fit the data best: sexual abuse and indirect violence + high trauma characteristics (n = 79, 3.6%); high all + high trauma characteristics (n = 177; 8.1%); chronic emotional abuse + trusted perpetrator (n = 263; 12.1%); and low all (n = 1,656; 76.1%). Latent class regression results indicated differential risk of class membership by sexual/gender minority status, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Survival analysis noted shorter latency to opioid use across all classes compared to the low all class. Self-efficacy and neighborhood cohesion emerged as important protective factors. CONCLUSION: Furthermore, results highlight key individual- and community-level protective factors that decrease the risk of opioid use.

312539,Association of Inhaled Antibiotics in Addition to Standard IV Therapy and Outcomes of Pediatric Inpatient Pulmonary Exacerbations,2020,"Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency (VDD) are widely recognized as risk factors for respiratory tract infections. Vitamin D influences expression of many genes with well-established relevance to airway infections and relevant to immune system function. Recently, VDD has been shown to be a risk factor for acquisition and severity of COVID-19. Thus, treating VDD presents a safe and inexpensive opportunity for modulating the severity of the disease. VDD is common in those over 60 years of age, many with co-morbid conditions and in people with skin pigmentation sufficient to reduce synthesis of vitamin D. Exposure to fine particulate air pollution is also associated with worse outcomes from COVID19. Vitamin D stimulates transcription of cathelicidin which is cleaved to generate LL37. LL37 is an innate antimicrobial with demonstrated activity against a wide range of microbes including envelope viruses. LL37 also modulates cytokine signaling at the site of infections. Fine particles in air pollution can interfere with LL37 destruction of viruses and may reduce effective immune signaling modulation by LL37. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37. Conclusion: Vitamin D plays an important role reducing the impact of viral lung disease processes. VDD is an acknowledged public health threat that warrants population-wide action to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. While vitamin D influences transcription of many immune related genes, the weakened antimicrobial response of those with VDD against SARS-CoV-2 may be in part due to reduced LL37. Action is needed to address COVID-19 associated risks of air pollution from industry, transportation, domestic sources and from primary and second hand tobacco smoke.","Crane-Godreau, Mardi A.; Clem, Kathleen J.; Payne, Peter; Fiering, Steven",Front.

Current therapeutic options are limited and there is no registered and/or definite treatment or vaccine for this disease or the causative infection, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), serves as the major entry point into cells for SARS-CoV-2 which attaches to human ACE2, thereby reducing the expression of ACE2 and causing lung injury and pneumonia. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble-vitamin, is a negative endocrine RAS modulator and inhibits renin expression and generation. It can induce ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis activity and inhibits renin and the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, thereby increasing expression and concentration of ACE2, MasR and Ang-(1-7) and having a potential protective role against acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, targeting the unbalanced RAS and ACE2 down-regulation with vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potential therapeutic approach to combat COVID-19 and induced ARDS.","Malek Mahdavi, Aida",Rev Med Virol,,401

It was found that both countries showed a hybrid form of vertical and horizontal coordination in COVID-19 responses despite different political systems. Hubei depended more on vertical steering and horizontal support whereas New York took the primary coordinating role while a nationwide strategy was missing. Contingent upon each country's political legacy, effective multi-level governance in crisis responses should balance national leadership with local autonomy and societal engagement.

We performed an extensive analysis of immune responses in 32 patients with severe COVID-19, some of whom succumbed. A control population of healthy subjects was included. Patients with COVID-19 had an altered distribution of peripheral blood lymphocytes, with an increased proportion of mature natural killer (NK) cells and low T-cell numbers. NK cells and CD8+ T cells overexpressed T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) and CD69. NK cell exhaustion was attested by increased frequencies of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) positive cells and reduced frequencies of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D)-, DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1)- and sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 7 (Siglec-7)-expressing NK cells, associated with a reduced ability to secrete interferon (IFN)Î³. Patients with poor outcome showed a contraction of immature CD56bright and an expansion of mature CD57+ FcÎµRIÎ³neg adaptive NK cells compared to survivors. Increased serum levels of IL-6 were also more frequently identified in deceased patients compared to survivors. Of note, monocytes secreted abundant quantities of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1ß which persisted at lower levels several weeks after recovery with concomitant normalization of CD69, PD-1 and TIM-3 expression and restoration of CD8+ T cell numbers. A hyperactivated/exhausted immune response dominate in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, probably driven by an uncontrolled secretion of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. These findings unveil a unique immunological profile in COVID-19 patients that will help to design effective stage-specific treatments for this potentially deadly disease.","Varchetta, Stefania; Mele, Dalila; Oliviero, Barbara; Mantovani, Stefania; Ludovisi, Serena; Cerino, Antonella; Bruno, Raffaele; Castelli, Alberto; Mosconi, Mario; Vecchia, Marco; Roda, Silvia; Sachs, Michele; Klersy, Catherine; Mondelli, Mario U",Cell. mol. immunol.

Therefore possible hazards in tissue, blood, urine and aerosolized particles generated during surgery, are evaluated. Understanding the risk, recommendations for clinical practice are provided. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of available literature on urological and other surgical procedures in patients with virus infections such as HPV, HIV and hepatitis B and current publications on COVID-19. RESULTS: Several possible pathways for viral transmission appear in the literature. Recent groups detected SARS-CoV-2 in the urine and faeces, even after negative pharyngeal swabs. In addition, viral RNA can be detected in the blood and several tissues. During surgery, viral particles are released, aerosole-borne and present a certain risk for transmission and infection. However, there is currently no evidence on the exact risk for infection by the substances mentioned above. It remains unclear whether or not viral particles in the urine, blood or faeces are infectious. CONCLUSIONS: Whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by aerosols remains controversial. In any case, standard surgical masks offer inadequate protection from SARS-CoV-2. Full PPE including at least FFP-2 masks and safety goggles should be used. Aerosolized particles might remain for a longer time in the operation theatre and contaminate other surfaces, like floors or computer input devices. Therefore scrupulous hygiene and disinfection of surfaces must be carried out. To prevent aerosolization during laparoscopic interventions, the pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated with suction devices. The use of virus proof HEPA filters is recommended. Local separation of anesthesia/intubation and operation theatre can reduce the danger of viral transmission. Lumbar anaesthesia should be considered especially in endourology. Based on current knowledge, COVID-19 is no contraindication for acute urological surgery. If possible however, as european guideline committees recommend, non-emergency urological interventions should be postponed until negative SARS-CoV-2 tests become available.","Kunz, Yannic; Horninger, Wolfgang; Pinggera, Germar-M",BJU int,,401

However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to 18 August 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6-16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID-19, and 1 study found that COVID-19 may impair semen quality in a severity-related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N = 11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N = 2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current studies suggest that semen is rarely considered a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material during the infection period but not in the semen of recovered patients. Fatal COVID-19 may cause testicular structure damage without the presence of virus.","Yao, Yangcheng; Yuan, Xiaoqiong; Wu, Linjing; Guo, Na; Yin, Li; Li, Yufeng",Androl. (Online),,401

In times of uncertainty and stress, the media plays an important role in disseminating information. This study establishes which factors affected risk perception regarding the Coronavirus, which factors determined trust in the measures taken by the Government, and how the presentation of information influenced the spread of fake news. To answer these questions an online survey was created and was completed by 2,034 people from different autonomous communities in Spain, using two multiple linear regression models, as well as different bivariate techniques for parametric statistical analysis. The data shows increased risk perception among the sectors with greater exposure to news about the Coronavirus. A second conclusion refers to the role played by an individual's pre-existing political biases, such as ideology, and their effects on the trust placed in the measures adopted by the Government. In addition, the analysis conducted shows that sectors that follow the news more closely are not immune to the spread of fake news. This research highlights the importance of communication in risk perception and the need to conduct further research in this field, in terms of the psychological, social, and economic implications of this phenomenon.","Mora-Rodríguez, Alberto Melero-López Inmaculada",Comunicar: Media Education Research Journal,,401

323886,Regionalization of General Surgery Within the Mayo Clinic Health System and the Mayo Clinic,2020,"BACKGROUND: We examined the influence of some factors on seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) from test-negative design (TND) studies. METHODS: We systematically searched for full-text publications of VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza from TND studies in outpatient settings after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated pooled adjusted VE across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, using an inverse variance, random-effects model. RESULTS: We included 76 full-text articles from 11,931 citations. VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were homogenous and point pooled VE higher in the Southern hemisphere compared with the Northern hemisphere. The difference in pooled VE between the Southern and Northern hemispheres was statistically significant for A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza. A consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across both hemispheres and continents, with the highest point pooled VE being against A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by influenza B, and lowest against A(H3N2). A nearly consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across age groups in the Northern hemisphere, with pooled VE mostly decreasing with age. Point pooled VE against A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were statistically significantly higher when vaccine was antigenically similar to circulating virus strains compared with when antigenically dissimilar. Similar pattern was observed in the Northern hemisphere, but there was a lack of data from the Southern hemisphere. CONCLUSION: Consistent patterns appear to exist in seasonal influenza VE across regions, age groups, and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, with best vaccine performance against A(H1N1)pdm09 and worst against A(H3N2).

325822,Cardiac involvement at presentation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and their outcome in a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Promoter hypermethylation is common in Breast Cancer (BC) with studies mainly in histological specimens showing frequent methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) compared with normal tissues. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of promoter methylation of RAR-ß2 and RASSF1A genes in breast FNAB material aiming to evaluate the methylation status of these two genes as biomarker for detecting BC in Greek population. METHODS: FNAB material from 104 patients was collected for cytological evaluation and epigenetic analysis. DNA was extracted and subjected to bisulfite conversion. A methylation-specific PCR was carried out and the final products were separated with electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. RESULTS: From 104 samples, RASSF1A hypermethylation was observed in 78 (75%) and RAR-ß2 hypermethylation in 64 (61.6%). 84% and 78% of the cases diagnosed with breast malignancy (n = 50) were methylated for RASSF1A and RAR-ß2, respectively. Methylated RASSF1A and RAR-ß2 were also detected in 88.3% and 76.5% in samples diagnosed as suspicious for malignancy (n = 17) and in 57.2% of samples diagnosed with atypia (n = 14). The Odds Ratio for breast malignancy was 4.545 in patients with RASSF1A hypermethylation and 9.167 in patients with RAR-ß2 hypermethylation underlying their promoter's methylation positive correlation with breast malignancy. CONCLUSION: To optimize the sensitivity and specificity of this epigenetic setting, more TSGs related to BC should be gradually imported in our evaluated methylation panel and be validated in a larger study sample with the aim that the obtained epigenetic profiles will provide clinicians with valuable tools for management of BC patients in Greece.","Kougioumtsidou, Niki; Vavoulidis, Eleftherios; Nasioutziki, Maria; Symeonidou, Marianthi; Pratilas, Georgios Chrysostomos; Mareti, Evangelia; Petousis, Stamatios; Chatzikyriakidou, Anthoula; Grimbizis, Gregorios; Theodoridis, Theodoros; Miliaras, Dimosthenis; Dinas, Konstantinos; Zepiridis, Leonidas",Diagn. cytopathol,,401

However, they not always describe the methodology behind their calculations, which may be problematic because the literature shows no uniformity in the way that the average subtitling speed is estimated. This paper delves into the notion of average subtitling speed as used in Media Accessibility research. It first looks at the role of subtitling speed in guidelines issued by the industry and regulators. Then it moves on to explore how the average subtitling speed is approached in the scholarly literature, which shows three different methods to calculate this parameter. The comparability and interchangeability of those methods is then analyzed from a statistical standpoint. A reflection follows on the use of the average subtitling speed as a measure to inform about the speed of subtitling samples, before concluding with some methodological recommendations that may help improve the way that the average subtitling speed is reported in scholarly works.","Fresno, Nazaret; Sepielak, Katarzyna",Perspect.

The early clinical phase, during viremia, may manifest as pericarditis, acute myocarditis, and sepsis-related cardiomyopathy. Delayed presentations, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, coronary artery dilation/aneurysms, and late myocarditis, may occur in the weeks after the acute infection. These delayed presentations commonly test negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 via polymerase chain reaction testing and are thought to be primarily postviral hyperinflammatory sequelae. The long-term consequences of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are unknown. Most recommendations for cardiac management are based on known conditions that are similar. For example, coronary aneurysms can be managed under Kawasaki disease guidelines. Similarly, for patients with COVID-19 myocarditis, they can be cleared for sports under protocols for other types of myocarditis. There is concern for cardiac involvement as a subclinical entity even in more minor presentations. Several expert algorithms have been developed for clearing competition athletes to return to exercise. Sports clearance should be individualized considering the severity of disease, age of patient, and performance level of the sport.

Therefore, the effect of established messenger RNA (mRNA)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have to be evaluated for solid organ transplant patients (SOT) since they are known to have poor responses after vaccination. We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 immune response via SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in 23 renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol. The antibody response was evaluated once with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA 15.8 +/- 3.0 days after the second dose. As a control, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in 23 healthcare workers (HCW) and compared to the patient cohort. Only 5 of 23 (22%) renal transplant recipients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies after the second dose of vaccine. In contrast, all 23 (100%) HCWs were tested positive for antibodies after the second dose. Thus, the humoral response of renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Kronach, Germany) is impaired and significantly lower compared to healthy controls (22% vs. 100%; p = 0.0001).

A qualitative analysis was conducted by comparing the COVID-19 transmission of six countries: China, Korea, Japan, Italy, the USA, and Brazil. This paper attempted to examine the mitigation effectiveness for the transmission of COVID-19 and the pandemic severity. Time to reach the peak of daily new confirmed cases and the maximum drop rate were used to measure the mitigation effectiveness, while the proportion of confirmed cases to population and the mortality rate were employed to evaluate the pandemic severity. Based on the mitigation effectiveness, the pandemic severity, and the mortality rate, the six sample countries were categorized into four types: high mitigation effectiveness vs. low pandemic severity, middle mitigation effectiveness vs. low pandemic severity, high mitigation effectiveness vs. high pandemic severity, and low mitigation effectiveness vs. high pandemic severity. The results found that Korea and China had relatively higher mitigation effectiveness and lower pandemic severity, while the USA and Brazil had the opposite. This paper suggests that viral testing together with contacts tracing, strict implementation of lockdown, and public cooperation play important roles in achieving a reduction in COVID-19 transmission.","Chen, Yi-Tui; Yen, Yung-Feng; Yu, Shih-Heng; Su, Emily Chia-Yu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,401

The literature suggests that cancer patients are more prone to be affected by COVID-19 because cancer suppresses the immune system and such patients usually present poor results. The objective of this study is to present all clinical, laboratory, and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients with solid tumors. Methodology This study was conducted at the Dow University of Health Sciences for a period of six months from April 2020 to September 2020. In this study, we included a total of 1,519 confirmed patients diagnosed with solid tumors via polymerase chain reaction. The mortality timeline within 30 days of contracting the virus was considered, and the median age of the included individuals was 61 years, with a range of 20-95 years. Of the patients included in the study, 49.4% (750) were men;moreover, 3.15% of our study population had prostate cancer, 10.20% had colorectal cancer, 2.76% had breast cancer, and 10.46% had lung cancer. Of the patients, 25.93% presented with at least one comorbidity. For 73% of the patients, at least one direct therapy for COVID-19 was included in the treatment;56.6% of the patients were hospitalized, and 11.32% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Results The mortality rate was 4.74% in the first 30 days after diagnosis, where 72 patients died. The findings of the first multi-variation model showed that males at older ages who were diabetic and going through cytotoxic therapy were prone to die within the first 30 days. However, the 30-day mortality rate was lower in patients diagnosed with prostate and breast cancer. The second set incorporated laboratory factors, where we found that higher values of leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were correlated with higher rates of mortality within 30 days. Conclusions We conclude that there is a higher mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with solid tumors than in the general population. However, it was found to be lower in the Pakistani population compared with the Chinese and Western populations. Intensive care can decrease mortality rates in COVID-19 and cancer patients.","Farooque, I.; Farooque, U.; Karimi, S.; Syed, M. U. S.; Nadeem, Z.; Zulfiqar, A.; Mustafa, S.; Farooque, R.; Sultan, A.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unique challenges to the rheumatology community. It is known that many individuals with rheumatic disease are at increased risk of severe disease from other infections, sparking a similar fear for COVID-19. In addition, medications routinely used in rheumatology practice are being trialled as treatments, with the potential for drug shortages for rheumatology patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Underlying comorbidities and active disease are associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease. Tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine have not proven to be effective treatments in the management of COVID-19. Telehealth has become an essential tool for the rheumatology community to monitor patients during the pandemic. In this article, we summarise the available COVID-19 evidence that is of relevance to the rheumatology community. We discuss the risk of contracting COVID-19 in individuals with rheumatic disease, along with presenting features and clinical outcomes. We provide an overview of the treatments for COVID-19 which have significance for rheumatology. We highlight published recommendations which can guide our management of rheumatic disease populations during this pandemic. Finally, we discuss the challenges in delivering effective care virtually and present methods and tools which could be adapted for use.","Fitzgerald, Gillian E; Maguire, Sinead; Haroon, Nigil",Curr Rheumatol Rep,,401

In this work, in order to acquire further SAR insights for this class of compounds and identify more potent derivatives, we designed and synthesized additional series of analogues to investigate the role of the substituents around the TZP core. To this aim, we developed four facile and efficient one-step procedures for the synthesis of 5-phenyl-, 6-phenyl- and 7-phenyl-2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and 2-amino-5-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ol. Two analogues having the ethyl carboxylate moiety at the C-2 position of the TZP were also prepared in good yields. Then, the scaffolds herein synthesized and two previous scaffolds were functionalized and evaluated for their anti-IAV activity, leading to the identification of compound 22 that showed both anti-PA-PB1 (IC50 = 19.5 µM) and anti-IAV activity (EC50 = 16 µM) at non-toxic concentrations, thus resulting among the most active TZP derivatives reported to date by us. A selection of the synthesized compounds, along with a set of in-house available analogues, was also tested against SARS-CoV-2.

350126,Risk Factors Associated with Icu Admission and Death among Covid-19 Patients in a Large Academic Healthcare Network,2021,"Background and objective: Serologic testing is a useful additional method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It is also used for population-based seroepidemiological studies. The objective of the study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals and to compare two methods for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Materials and Methods: A total of 432 healthcare workers in Kaunas hospitals were enrolled in this study. Each participant filled a questionnaire including questions about their demographics, contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, acute respiratory symptoms, and whether they contacted their general practitioner, could not come to work, or had to be hospitalized. Capillary blood was used to test for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) a lateral flow immunoassay. Serum samples were used to test for specific IgG and IgA class immunoglobulins using semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: 24.77% of study participants had direct contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19. A total of 64.81% of studied individuals had at least one symptom representing acute respiratory infection, compatible with COVID-19. Lateral flow immunoassay detected SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG class immunoglobulins in 1.16% of the tested group. Fever, cough, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, muscle pain, and loss of smell and taste predominated in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive group. Using ELISA, specific IgG were detected in 1.32% of the tested samples. Diarrhea, loss of appetite, and loss of smell and taste sensations were the most predominant symptoms in anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive group. The positive percent agreement of the two testing methods was 50%, and negative percent agreement was 99.66%. Conclusions: 1.16% of tested healthcare workers of Kaunas hospitals were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive. The negative percent agreement of the lateral flow immunoassay and ELISA exceeded 99%.","Pereckaite, Laura; Dambrauskiene, Asta; Urboniene, Daiva; Sadauskas, Saulius; Petrikonis, Kestutis; Naudziunas, Albinas; Vitkauskiene, Astra",Medicina (Kaunas),,401

The health department of the fourth largest city in the U.S. recognized that sound estimates of viral impact were needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: Adapting standardized disaster research methodology in September 2020, the city was divided into high and low strata based on RT-PCR positivity rates, and census block groups within each stratum were randomly selected with probability proportional to size, followed by random selection of households within each group. Using two immunoassays, the proportion of infected individuals was estimated for the city, as well as by positivity rate and by sociodemographic and other characteristics. The degree of under ascertainment of seroprevalence was estimated based on RT-PCR positive cases. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was estimated to be 14% with a near two-fold difference in areas with high (18%) versus low (10%) RT-PCR positivity rates and was four times higher compared to case-based surveillance data. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence was higher than previously reported and is greater than that estimated from RT-PCR data. Results will be used to inform public health decisions about testing, outreach, and vaccine rollout.","Symanski, Elaine; Ensor, Katherine B; Piedra, Pedro A; Sheth, Komal; Caton, Kelsey; Williams, Stephen L; Persse, David; Banerjee, Deborah; Hopkins, Loren",J. infect. dis,,401

METHODS: Immunohistochemical study was performed in the kidneys of 37 patients with IgAN and 10 patients with HSPN. Serum and urinary AIM levels in the patients and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results were compared with clinical features. RESULTS: In patients with IgAN and HSPN, AIM expression was observed in various areas, including the glomerular mesangial and capillary areas, the proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells, and on infiltrating macrophages in the glomeruli and interstitial areas. Serum and urinary AIM levels were significantly elevated in these patients compared with the HCs. Urinary AIM levels were positively correlated with the histological severity and degree of proteinuria and hematuria as well as urinary ß2 microglobulin and urinary N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase levels. CONCLUSIONS: AIM plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN. Urinary AIM levels can potentially reflect active renal inflammation in these diseases and may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity. IMPACT: Urinary AIM levels may represent a useful biomarker for disease activity of IgAN and HSPN.AIM expression was observed in the glomeruli, tubular epithelial cells, and infiltrating macrophages in glomeruli and interstitial area.U-AIM/Cr were significantly correlated not only with proteinuria, hematuria, and u-ß2MG and u-NAG levels but also with the activity index of histological findings in kidney biopsy specimens.Our results can emphasize the important role of AIM in the pathogenesis of IgAN and HSPN.","Irabu, Hitoshi; Shimizu, Masaki; Kaneko, Shuya; Inoue, Natsumi; Mizuta, Mao; Tasaki, Yuko; Ohta, Kazuhide; Yachie, Akihiro; Wada, Taizo",Pediatr. res,,401

With the release of randomised controlled trial (RCT) results, we are beginning to see possible treatment options for COVID-19. The RECOVERY trial showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality by 2.8% with dexamethasone, and the ACTT-1 trial showed that treatment with remdesivir reduced the time to recovery by 4 days. Treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir did not show any mortality benefit in either the RECOVERY or World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trials. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Brazilian HCQ trials did not show any benefit for HCQ based on the seven-point ordinal scale outcomes. The randomisation methodologies utilised in these controlled trials and the quality of published data were reviewed to examine their adaptability to treat patients. We found that the randomisation methodologies of these trials were suboptimal for matching the studied groups based on disease severity among critically-ill hospitalised COVID-19 patients with high mortality rates. The published literature is very limited regarding the disease severity metrics among the compared groups and failed to show that the data are without fatal sampling errors and sampling biases. We also found that there is a definite need for the validation of data in these trials along with additional important disease severity metrics to ensure that the trials' conclusions are accurate. We also propose proper randomisation methodologies for the design of RCTs for COVID-19 as well as guidance for the publication of COVID-19 trial results.","Emani, Venkata R; Goswami, Sanjeev; Nandanoor, Dheeraj; Emani, Shaila R; Reddy, Nidhi K; Reddy, Raghunath",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,401

We evaluated the utility and cost-savings of pooled testing based on imperfect test performance and potential dilution effect due to pooling and created a practical calculator for online use. METHODS: We developed a 2-stage pooled testing model accounting for dilution. The model was applied to hypothetical scenarios of 100 specimens collected during a one-week time-horizon cycle for varying levels of COVID-19 prevalence and test sensitivity and specificity, and to 338 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in Los Angeles County (Los Angeles) (data collected and analyzed in 2020). RESULTS: Optimal pool sizes ranged from 1 to 12 in instances where there is a least one case in the batch of specimens. 40% of Los Angeles SNFs had more than one case triggering a response-testing strategy. The median number (minimum; maximum) of tests performed per facility were 56 (14; 356) for a pool size of 4, 64 (13; 429) for a pool size of 10, and 52 (11; 352) for an optimal pool size strategy among response-testing facilities. The median costs of tests in response-testing facilities were $8250 ($1100; $46,100), $6000 ($1340; $37,700), $6820 ($1260; $43,540), and $5960 ($1100; $37,380) when adopting individual testing, a pooled testing strategy using pool sizes of 4, 10, and optimal pool size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled testing is an efficient strategy for congregate settings with a low prevalence of COVID-19. Dilution as a result of pooling can lead to erroneous false-negative results.","Nianogo, Roch A; Emeruwa, I Obi; Gounder, Prabhu; Manuel, Vladimir; Anderson, Nathaniel W; Kuo, Tony; Inkelas, Moira; Arah, Onyebuchi A",J Med Virol,,401

In light of this, and to improve the public health skills of professionals working to promote health education, one of the current priorities is to train pre-service teachers on how to search for health-related scientific knowledge relating to bio-health through digital literacy in health. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of eHealth literacy, scientific knowledge in health and confidence on the part of students, analyzing the degree of improvement following a teaching intervention with students of the Bachelor's Degree of Education of the University of Extremadura. A quasi-experimental longitudinal study was carried out with pre-test and post-test groups and a mixed data analysis. It involved the application of an active cooperative methodology with tutoring using the jigsaw technique, with the use of four quality digital browsers to enhance scientific rigor. The results show that the initial level of eHealth literacy and confidence was problematic. Following the intervention with the cooperative methodology, both these levels and the level of scientific knowledge in health reached an excellent level. In conclusion, this suggests that university training programs need to be implemented to improve digital and scientific skills in health education as they are currently insufficient. It has been demonstrated that a cooperative active methodology improved these levels and accordingly its use in active and digital higher education should be promoted.","De la Hoz, Alejandro; Cubero, Javier; Melo, Lina; Durán-Vinagre, Miguel A; Sánchez, Susana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,401
355957,Expert position statements: comparison of recommendations for the care of adults and youth with elevated lipoprotein(a),2021,"Novel strain of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) causes mild to severe respiratory illness. The early symptoms may be fever, dry cough, sour throat, and difficulty in breathing which may lead to death in severe cases. Compared to previous outbreaks like SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV2 disease (COVID-19) outbreak has been much distressing due to its high rate of infection but low infection fatality rate (IFR) with 1.4% around the world. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In the month of January 2020, the whole genome of SARS-CoV2 was sequenced which made work easy for researchers to develop diagnostic kits and to carry out drug repurposing to effectively alleviate the pandemic situation in the world. Now, it is important to understand why this virus has high rate of infectivity or is there any factor involved at the genome level which actually facilitates this virus infection globally? In this study, we have extensively analyzed the whole genomes of different coronaviruses infecting humans and animals in different geographical locations around the world. The main aim of the study is to identify the similarity and the mutational adaptation of the coronaviruses from different host and geographical locations to the SARS-CoV2 and provide a better strategy to understand the mutational rate for specific target-based drug designing. This study is focused to every annotation in a comparative manner which includes SNPs, repeat analysis with the different categorization of the short-sequence repeats and long-sequence repeats, different UTR's, transcriptional factors, and the predicted matured peptides with the specific length and positions on the genomes. The extensive analysis on SNPs revealed that Wuhan SARS-CoV2 and Indian SARS-CoV2 are having only eight SNPs. Collectively, phylogenetic analysis, repeat analysis, and the polymorphism revealed the genomic conserveness within the SARS-CoV2 and few other coronaviruses with very less mutational chances and the huge distance and mutations from the few other species.","Tarique, Mohammed; Ahmad, Shaban; Malik, Arshi; Ahmad, Irfan; Saeed, Mohd; Almatroudi, Ahmad; Qadah, Talal; Murad, Manal Abdulaziz; Mashraqi, Mutaib; Alam, Qamre; Al-Saleh, Yousef",Mol. cell. biochem,,401

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients consecutively enrolled from two major academic hospitals exclusively for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from January 26, 2020, to March 26, 2020. The primary outcome was adjusted in-hospital mortality in the LMWH group compared with the non-LMWH group using the propensity score. RESULTS: Overall, 525 patients with COVID-19 enrolled with a median age of 64 years (IQR 19), and 49.33% men. Among these, 120 (22.86%) were treated with LMWH. Compared with the non-LMWH group, the LMWH group was more likely to be older and male; had a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), or stroke; and had more severe COVID-19 parameters such as higher inflammatory cytokines or D-dimer. Compared with non-LMWH group, LMWH group had a higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate (21.70% vs. 11.10%; p = 0.004), but a lower adjusted mortality risk (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09-0.46). A propensity score-weighting analysis demonstrated similar findings (adjusted OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.10-0.30). Subgroup analysis showed a significant survival benefit among those who were severely (adjusted OR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.23) and critically ill (adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15-0.65), as well as among the elderly patients' age > 65, IL-6 > 10 times upper limit level, and D-dimer > 5 times upper limit level.

We present a novel representation of the 2-Wasserstein space, based on a well known isometric bijection and a B-spline expansion. Thanks to this representation, we are able to reinterpret previous work and derive more efficient optimization routines for existing approaches. As shown in our simulations, the solution of these optimization problems can be costly in practice and thus pose a limit to their usage. We propose a novel definition of Principal Component Analysis in the Wasserstein space that, when used in combination with the B-spline representation, yields a straightforward optimization problem that is extremely fast to compute. Through extensive simulation studies, we show how our PCA performs similarly to the ones already proposed in the literature while retaining a much smaller computational cost. We apply our method to a real dataset of mortality rates due to Covid-19 in the US, concluding that our analyses are consistent with the current scientific consensus on the disease.","Pegoraro, M.; Beraha, M.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,,401

Some consequences are sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, stress-related sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These sleep alterations critically affect mental health, precipitating or perpetuating anxiety, stress, and depression, resulting in the inability to regulate positive and negative emotions. Pre-existing sleep disorders are an important risk factor for the development and maintenance of PSTD when individuals are exposed to an important stressor such as a COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, how an individual regulates the emotion associated with worries during daytime functioning impacts nighttime sleep, precipitating and perpetuating difficulties in sleeping. All of these changes in sleep and emotional regulation also alter the immune system. Sleep deprivation is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, due to the desynchronizations in circadian rhythms, causing possible psychophysiological disorders and impaired neuroimmune-endocrine homeostasis. From this perspective, we clarify in this article how sleep disorders affect the immune system and emotional regulation, explaining their phenomenological and neurobiological mechanisms, and discussing elements of cognitive and behavioral coping for health professionals to adopt and manage a healthier sleep pattern in the COVID-19 outbreak.","de Almondes, K.

While adaptive immune responses versus SARS-CoV-2 can be of critical importance to both recovery and vaccine efficacy, how protein antigens from this pathogen are processed to generate antigenic peptides is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the proteolytic processing of overlapping precursor peptides spanning the entire sequence of the S1 spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, by three key enzymes that generate antigenic peptides, aminopeptidases ERAP1, ERAP2, and IRAP. All enzymes generated shorter peptides with sequences suitable for binding onto HLA alleles, but with distinct specificity fingerprints. ERAP1 was the most efficient in generating peptides 8-11 residues long, the optimal length for HLA binding, while IRAP was the least efficient. The combination of ERAP1 with ERAP2 greatly limited the variability of peptide sequences produced. Less than 7% of computationally predicted epitopes were found to be produced experimentally, suggesting that aminopeptidase processing may constitute a significant filter to epitope presentation. These experimentally generated putative epitopes could be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 immunogenicity studies and vaccine design. We furthermore propose that this in vitro trimming approach could constitute a general filtering method to enhance the prediction robustness for viral antigenic epitopes.","Stamatakis, George; Samiotaki, Martina; Mpakali, Anastasia; Panayotou, George; Stratikos, Efstratios",J Proteome Res,,401

For this retrospective study, we included 168 consecutive severe patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized between January 16th and February 4th, 2020, at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, and outcomes were compared and analyzed between males and females. In the present study, we analyzed 168 severe patients with COVID-19, including 86 males and 82 females, and 48 patients (28.6%) were diagnosed as critically ill. Of 86 male patients, 12.8% (11/86) died and 75.6% (65/86) were discharged; of 82 female patients, 7.3% (6/82) died and 86.6% (71/82) were discharged. Eleven laboratory parameters showed significant differences between male and female patients, and six of them were higher during the whole clinical course in patients who died than in patients who were discharged. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, males with comorbidities presented a higher risk of being critically ill than males without comorbidities (OR = 3.824, 95% CI = 1.279-11.435). However, this association attenuated to null in female patients (OR = 2.992, 95% CI = 0.937-9.558). A similar sex-specific trend was observed in the relation between age and critically ill conditions. We highlighted sex-specific differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis. Male patients appeared to be more susceptible to age and comorbidities. Sex is an important biological variable that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Meng, Yifan; Wu, Ping; Lu, Wanrong; Liu, Kui; Ma, Ke; Huang, Liang; Cai, Jiaojiao; Zhang, Hong; Qin, Yu; Sun, Haiying; Ding, Wencheng; Gui, Lingli; Wu, Peng",PLoS Pathog,,401
372215,COVID-19 and liver dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of retrospective studies,2020,"Phyloepidemiological approaches have provided specific insight into understanding the emergence and evolution of infection. Knowledge on the outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Nigeria would assist in provision of preventive measures to reduce transmission among populations at risk. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. A total of 39 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiFlu™ database on 29 March 2020 to investigate its evolution in Nigeria. Sequences were selected based on the travel history of the individual and the collection date. Other sequences were not selected because they were short, contained artefacts, were not from an original source or had insufficient information. Evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the common ancestor of each strain. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain in Nigeria clustered in a monophyletic clade with a Wuhan sublineage. Nucleotide alignment also showed a 100% similarity indicating a common origin of evolution. Comparative analysis showed 27 972 (93.6%) identical sites and 97.6% pairwise identity with the consensus. The study evidently showed the entire outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nigeria stemmed from a single introduction sharing consensus similarity with the reference SARS-CoV-2 human genome from Wuhan. Preventive measures that can limit the spread of the infection among populations at risk should be implemented.","Awoyelu, E. H.; Oladipo, E. K.; Adetuyi, B. O.; Senbadejo, T. Y.; Oyawoye, O.

RESULTS: 25.5% (117/458) of women were severe and 74.4% (341/458) mild presentation. Three percent (9/341) of mild presentations required a subsequent hospitalization. Overall, 26/458 women (5.6%) were admitted to ICU, and 13/458 (2.8%) required mechanical ventilation. One maternal death occurred at 49-days postpartum. Severe presentation, infection above 24 weeks, and comorbidities were associated with an adverse maternal outcome. Of total deliveries, 16.5% (36/217) were <37 weeks. Perinatal mortality was 6/226 (2.7%), mostly due to the fetal component. CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of the women had severe COVID-19 that, combined with occurrence of disease in the second half of pregnancy, resulted in substantial maternal compromise. Perinatal morbidity and mortality in women with severe disease were high and warrant consideration. Outpatient management was safe for mild cases.","Haye, Maria Teresa; Cartes, Giorgia; Gutiérrez, Jorge; Ahumada, Paz; Krause, Bernardo; Merialdi, Mario; Gonzalez, Rogelio",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,401

The novel COVID-19 infection, caused by a beta coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, is a new outbreak that has been emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and dyspnea. As per the March 12, 2020, WHO report, more than 125,048 confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 4613 deaths have been identified in more than 117 countries. It is now regarded as a pandemic that seriously spread and attack the world. The primary means of transmission is person to person through droplets that occurred during coughing or sneezing, through personal contact (shaking hands), or by touching contaminated objects. So far, there is no effective therapy and vaccine available against this novel virus and therefore, only supportive care is used as the mainstay of management of patients with COVID-19. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is considerable. This work aimed to provide insight on the newly emerged COVID-19, in the hope to gain a better understanding on the general overview, epidemiology, transmission, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes as well as the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Abebe, Endeshaw Chekol; Dejenie, Tadesse Asmamaw; Shiferaw, Mestet Yibeltal; Malik, Tabarak",Virol J,,401

Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze longitudinally the psychopathological consequences of the pandemic in pregnant women, and to explore differences with non-pregnant women. The participants in this study were 102 pregnant women, and a control group of 102 non-pregnant women (most of them reported having university studies and little financial impact from the pandemic). They completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, in three different times (2, 14, and 47 days after the start of the lockdown). In a time range of 50 days of quarantine, all women showed a gradual increase in psychopathological indicators and a decrease in positive affect. Pregnant women showed a more pronounced increase in depression, anxiety and negative affect than the non-pregnant women did. In addition, pregnant women showed a more pronounced decrease in positive affect. It is important for institutions dedicated to perinatal health care to count on empirical information to optimize the provision of their services.","López-Morales, Hernán; Del Valle, Macarena Verónica; Canet-Juric, Lorena; Andrés, María Laura; Galli, Juan Ignacio; Poó, Fernando; Urquijo, Sebastián",Psychiatry Res,,401

Wearable devices that can measure physiologic changes in biometrics including heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, respiratory, activity (such as steps taken per day) and sleep patterns, and blood oxygen saturation show utility for the early detection of infection before clinical presentation of symptoms. Recent algorithms developed using preliminary wearable datasets show that SARS-CoV-2 is detectable before clinical symptoms in >80% of adults. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and other pathogens in SOTR, and their household members, could facilitate early interventions such as self-isolation and early clinical management of relevant infection(s).

This review aims to summarize current progress of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems in the applications for diagnostics of infectious diseases including the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss class 2 CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems-based diagnostics in various emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, CRISPR-Cas systems have created a new era for early diagnostics of infectious diseases, especially with the discovery of the collateral cleavage activity of Cas12 and Cas13. We mainly focus on different CRISPR-Cas effectors for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms as well as provide a detailed explanation of the pros and cons of CRISPR-Cas biosensing systems. In addition, we also introduce future research perspectives. EXPERT COMMENTARY: However, further improvement of newly discovered systems and engineering existing ones should be developed to increase the specificity, sensitivity or stability of the diagnostic tools. It may be a long journey to finish the clinical transition from research use. CRISPR-Cas approaches will emerge as more promising and robust tools for infectious disease diagnosis in the future.","Li, Peipei; Wang, Li; Yang, Junning; Di, Li-Jun; Li, Jingjing",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,,401

In this study, we aimed to assess the pandemic's effect on women's COVID-19-related publishing over the first year of the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the gender distribution of first authorships for 42 898 publications on COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021 to 483 232 publications appearing in the same journals during the same period the year prior. We found that the gender gap-the percentage of articles on which men versus women were first authors-widened by 14 percentage points during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite many pertinent research fields showing near equal proportions of men and women first authors publishing in the same fields before the pandemic. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the significant initial expansions of the gender gap began to trend backwards to expected values over time in many fields. As women may have been differentially affected depending on their geography, we also assessed the gender distribution of first authorships grouped by countries and geographical areas. While we observed a significant reduction of the shares of women first authors in almost all countries, longitudinal analyses confirmed a resolving trend over time. CONCLUSION: The reduction in women's COVID-19-related research output appears particularly concerning as many disciplines informing the response to the pandemic had near equal gender shares of first authorship in the year prior to the pandemic. The acute productivity drain with the onset of the pandemic magnifies deep-rooted obstacles on the way to gender equity in scientific contribution.","Lerchenmüller, Carolin; Schmallenbach, Leo; Jena, Anupam B; Lerchenmueller, Marc J",BMJ Open,,401

Taking this into account, in the present work, we have analysed a Bats–Hosts–Reservoir–People transmission fractional-order COVID-19 model for simulating the potential transmission with the thought of individual response and control measures by the government. The real data available about number of infected cases from 14 March, 2000 to 26 March, 2020 is analysed and, accordingly, various parameters of the model are estimated or fitted. The Picard successive approximation technique and Banach’s fixed point theory have been used for verification of the existence and stability criteria of the model. Further, we conduct stability analysis for both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states. On the basis of sensitivity analysis and dynamics of the threshold parameter, we estimate the effectiveness of preventive measures, predicting future outbreaks and potential control strategies of the disease using the proposed model. Numerical computations are carried out utilising the iterative Laplace transform method and comparative study of different fractional differential operators is done. The impacts of various biological parameters on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is investigated. Finally, we illustrate the obtained results graphically.","Shaikh, Amjad Salim; Shaikh, Iqbal Najiroddin; Nisar, Kottakkaran Sooppy",Adv. Differ. Equations,,401

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: To identify cellular phenotypes that may be shared across tissues affected by disparate inflammatory diseases, we developed a meta-analysis and integration pipeline that models and removes the effects of technology, tissue of origin, and donor that confound cell-type identification. Using this approach, we integrated > 300,000 single-cell transcriptomic profiles from COVID-19-affected lungs and tissues from healthy subjects and patients with five inflammatory diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and interstitial lung disease. We tested the association of shared immune states with severe/inflamed status compared to healthy control using mixed-effects modeling. To define environmental factors within these tissues that shape shared macrophage phenotypes, we stimulated human blood-derived macrophages with defined combinations of inflammatory factors, emphasizing in particular antiviral interferons IFN-beta (IFN-ß) and IFN-gamma (IFN-Î³), and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF. RESULTS: We built an immune cell reference consisting of > 300,000 single-cell profiles from 125 healthy or disease-affected donors from COVID-19 and five inflammatory diseases. We observed a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state that is shared and strikingly abundant in severe COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, inflamed RA synovium, inflamed CD ileum, and UC colon. These cells exhibited a distinct arrangement of pro-inflammatory and interferon response genes, including elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. Further, we found this macrophage phenotype is induced upon co-stimulation by IFN-Î³ and TNF-&#945;. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis identified immune cell states shared across inflamed tissues affected by inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. Our study supports a key role for IFN-Î³ together with TNF-&#945; in driving an abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19-affected lungs, as well as inflamed RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, Fan; Mears, Joseph R; Shakib, Lorien; Beynor, Jessica I; Shanaj, Sara; Korsunsky, Ilya; Nathan, Aparna; Donlin, Laura T; Raychaudhuri, Soumya",Genome Med,,401

386996,The effect of cardiovascular disease and acute cardiac injury on fatal COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide shortage of medical-grade face masks. Donning masks can play an important role in curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. AIM: To conclude whether there is an effective mask for the population to wear in public that could easily be made during a medical face mask shortage using readily available materials. METHODS: We determined the effectiveness of readily available materials and models for making a face mask. The outcomes were compared with N95/FFP2/KN95 masks that entered the Netherlands in April-May 2020. Masks were tested to determine whether they filtered a minimum of 35% of 0.3-µm particles, are hydrophobic, seal on the face, are breathable, and can be washed. FINDINGS: Fourteen of the 25 (combinations of) materials filtered at least 35% of 0.3-µm particles. Four of the materials proved hydrophobic, all commercially manufactured filters. Two models sealed the face. Twenty-two of the 25 materials were breathable at <0.7 mbar. None of the hydrophobic materials stayed intact after washing. CONCLUSIONS: It would be possible to reduce the reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2 from 2.4 to below one if 39% of the population would wear a mask made from ePM1 85% commercially manufactured filter fabric and in a duckbill form. This mask performs better than 80% of the imported N95/FFP2/KN95 masks and provides a better fit than a surgical mask. Two layers of quilt fabric with a household paper towel as filter is also a viable choice for protecting the user and the environment.","Teesing, G R; van Straten, B; de Man, P; Horeman-Franse, T",J Hosp Infect,,401

However, their clinical relevance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not well characterized. We analyzed the frequency, clinical significance, and prognostic relevance of RAS pathway alterations in 328 pediatric patients with de novo AML. RAS pathway alterations were detected in 80 (24.4%) out of 328 patients: NF1 (n = 7, 2.1%), PTPN11 (n = 15, 4.6%), CBL (n = 6, 1.8%), NRAS (n = 44, 13.4%), KRAS (n = 12, 3.7%). Most of these alterations were mutually exclusive and were also mutually exclusive with other aberrations of signal transduction pathways such as FLT3-ITD (p = 0.001) and KIT mutation (p = 0.004). NF1 alterations were frequently detected in patients with complex karyotype (p = 0.031) and were found to be independent predictors of poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007). At least four of seven patients with NF1 alterations had bi-allelic inactivation. NRAS mutations were frequently observed in patients with CBFB-MYH11 and were independent predictors of favorable outcomes in multivariate analysis [OS, p = 0.023; event-free survival (EFS), p = 0.037]. Patients with PTPN11 mutations more frequently received stem cell transplantation (p = 0.035) and showed poor EFS than patients without PTPN11 mutations (p = 0.013). Detailed analysis of RAS pathway alterations may enable a more accurate prognostic stratification of pediatric AML and may provide novel therapeutic molecular targets related to this signal transduction pathway.","Kaburagi, Taeko; Yamato, Genki; Shiba, Norio; Yoshida, Kenichi; Hara, Yusuke; Tabuchi, Ken; Shiraishi, Yuichi; Ohki, Kentaro; Sotomatsu, Manabu; Arakawa, Hirokazu; Matsuo, Hidemasa; Shimada, Akira; Taki, Tomohiko; Kiyokawa, Nobutaka; Tomizawa, Daisuke; Horibe, Keizo; Miyano, Satoru; Taga, Takashi; Adachi, Souichi; Ogawa, Seishi; Hayashi, Yasuhide",Haematologica,,401

391013,Optimal Respiratory Assistance Strategy for Patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the continuance of the global COVID-19 pandemic, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiac injury have been suggested to be risk factors for severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the mortality risks associated with CVD and cardiac injury among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially in subgroups of populations in different countries. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed using 9 databases from November 1, 2019 to November 9, 2020. Meta-analyses were performed for CVD and cardiac injury between non-survivors and survivors of COVID-19. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of CVD in different populations was different, hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CVD were at a higher risk of fatal outcomes (OR = 2.72; 95% CI 2.35-3.16) than those without CVD. Separate meta-analyses of populations in four different countries also reached a similar conclusion that CVD was associated with an increase in mortality. Cardiac injury was common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients with cardiac injury had a significantly higher mortality risk than those without cardiac injury (OR = 13.25; 95% CI: 8.56-20.52). CONCLUSIONS: Patients' CVD history and biomarkers of cardiac injury should be taken into consideration during the hospital stay and incorporated into the routine laboratory panel for COVID-19.","Long, Jiali; Luo, Yefei; Wei, Yuehong; Xie, Chaojun; Yuan, Jun",Am J Emerg Med,,401
391388,Association Between Hypoxemia and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19,2020,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Weimaining (WMN) is a condensed Tannin compound extracted from Fagopyrum cymosum (Trevir.) Meisn., which comes from the roots of buckwheat, a type of Chinese herbal medicine, was first recorded in ""Bencao Shiyi"". WMN has inhibitory effects on multiple cancer types and is widely used in clinical practice; however, the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effect of WMN is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect of WMN on the cellular activity and apoptosis of mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells, and caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells were inoculated into the mouse breast pad to establish a luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer cell model. BALB/C-nu mice were randomly divided into model, WMN, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) groups (n=10). Another 10 mice served as the normal control group (no cancer cell injection). The WMN group was administered WMN 250 mg/kg per day for 14 days, the LMWH group was given LMWH (1500 U/kg) daily for 14 days by intraperitoneal injection, and the model and normal control groups were given an equal dose of 0.9% NaCl. The number and distribution of transplanted tumors in 4T1-luc2 breast cancer cells were observed in nude mice by an in vivo imaging system at the time of inoculation after successful modeling, and on days 7 and 14 after drug administration. Tumor cell apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method; caspase-3 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting was applied to detect the levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression. RESULTS: The apoptosis index (AI) of the WMN group was detected by the TUNEL method, and the AI increased with the increase of treatment time. Compared with the model group, the mRNA expression of caspase-3 and the protein levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were notably elevated in the WMN group. After in vivo bioluminescent imaging, the total photon number of the WMN group was found to be lower than that of the LWMH group on day 14 after administration. Additionally, the AI and expression levels of caspase-3 mRNA, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3 protein of the WMN group were higher than those of the LWMH group. CONCLUSION: WMN can effectively suppress the growth of 4T1-luc2 breast cancer xenografts in mice, and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells by upregulating the expression of caspase-3.","Ke, Haoliang; Wang, Xiuping; Zhou, Zhen; Ai, Wang; Wu, Zhaoyan; Zhang, Yingwen",J Ethnopharmacol,,401

392297,Efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 ARDS undergoing noninvasive ventilation,2020,"Favipiravir, a promising antiviral agent, is undergoing clinical trials for the potential treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This is the first report for the electrochemical activity of favipiravir and its electroanalytical sensing. For this purpose, the effect of cationic surfactant, CTAB was demonstrated on the enhanced accumulation of favipiravir at the surface of cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (CPT-BDD) electrode. At first, the electrochemical properties of favipiravir were investigated in the surfactant-free solutions by the means of cyclic voltammetry. The compound presented a single oxidation step which is irreversible and adsorption controlled. A systematic study of various operational conditions, such as electrode pretreatment, pH of the supporting electrolyte, concentration of CTAB, accumulation variables, and instrumental parameters on the adsorptive stripping response, was examined using square-wave voltammetry. An oxidation signal at around +1.21 V in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 8.0 containing 6 × 10-4 M CTAB allowed to the adsorptive stripping voltammetric determination of favipiravir (after 60 s accumulation step at open-circuit condition). The process could be used in the concentration range with two linear segments of 0.01-0.1 µg mL-1 (6.4 × 10-8-6.4 × 10-7 M) and 0.1-20.0 µg mL-1 (6.4 × 10-7-1.3 × 10-4 M). The limit of detection values were found to be 0.0028 µg mL-1 (1.8 × 10-8 M), and 0.023 µg mL-1 (1.5 × 10-7 M) for the first and second segments of calibration graph, respectively. The feasibility of developed methodology was tested to the analysis of the commercial tablet formulations and model human urine samples.","Allahverdiyeva, Shabnam; Yunusoglu, Oruc; Yardim, Yavuz; Sentürk, Zühre",Anal Chim Acta,,401

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Single institution across 3 hospital sites during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients who were intubated for respiratory wean tracheotomy underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasal, throat, and endotracheal tube swabs at the time of the procedure. These were assessed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. The tracheal tissue excised during the tracheotomy was cultured for SARS-CoV-2 with Vero E6 and Caco2 cells. Serum was assessed for antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 via neutralization assays. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this study. The mean number of days intubated prior to undergoing surgical tracheotomy was 27.8. At the time of the surgical tracheotomy, PCR swab testing yielded 8 positive results, but none of the 35 individuals who underwent tissue culture were positive for SARS-CoV-2. All 18 patients who had serum sampling demonstrated neutralization antibodies, with a minimum titer of 1:80. CONCLUSION: In our series, irrespective of positive PCR swab, the likelihood of infectivity during tracheotomy remains low given negative tracheal tissue cultures. While our results do not undermine national and international guidance on tracheotomy after day 10 of intubation, given the length of time to procedure in our data, infectivity at 10 days cannot be excluded. We do however suggest that a preoperative negative PCR swab not be a prerequisite and that antibody titer levels may serve as a useful adjunct for assessment of infectivity.","George, Manish M; McIntyre, Charlotte J; Zhou, Jie; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Amos, Dora C; Dillon, Ivan J; Barclay, Wendy S; Tolley, Neil S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,401

Given the global spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), social isolation regulations and laws have been implemented in many countries to contain the spread of the virus and this has caused a drastic shift from the usual physically demanding life to a sedentary lifestyle characterized by significantly reduced physical activities and prolong sitting. Methods/Data Source: Human and nonhuman primate literature was examined to compare experimental and clinical modulation of inflammatory cytokines by exercised-induced myokines. Data synthesis: Experimental and clinical evidence was used to examine whether exercised-induced myokines can prime the immune system of the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The immune system changes with advancement in age which increases the likelihood of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in older adults. Several epidemiological studies have also shown that physical inactivity among geriatric population impacts negatively on the immune system. Evidences on the importance of exercise in priming the immune system of elderly individuals could be an effective therapeutic strategy in combating the virus as it may well be a case of ""let those with the best immune system win"".","Tokunbo, Olorunfemi; Abayomi, Taiwo; Adekomi, Damilare; Oyeyipo, Ibukun",Afr Health Sci,,401

Furthermore, most DM patients were unable to engage in physical activity during that period. This impediment to proper healthcare management had increased Blood Glucose Levels (BGL). Therefore, initiatives must be adopted to prevent the same result in the second lockdown in 2021 for the well-being of patients. MethodThis statistical analysis aimed to assess the rise in BGL of diabetic patients before and during the lockdown. A survey was conducted among the DM patients in the Bangladeshi cohort, who came from various socioeconomic backgrounds and included both men and women. The statistical modeling, performed with the help of stat-ease software, was conducted by applying the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method to Response Surface Methodology (RSM). ResultOut of the 3 models applied (quadratic, main effect and sequential sum of squares for 2 factor interaction (2FI)) in 2 different response vectors the 2FI model was the best suited (p value - 0.0441 and 0.0015). The results yielded by the 2FI model were used to evaluate RSM. ConclusionThe analysis had shown a significant rise in the BGL among the DM patients during the lockdown, and the patients with the higher BMI tend to have a more significant increment in the BGL. Male patients experienced a greater rise in BGL. Furthermore, elderly patients with high Random Blood Glucose (RBG) levels before lockdown were more likely to have high RBG levels during the lockdown.","Abrar, Shams Mohammad",,,401

401409,Mortality of patients with COVID-19 who undergo an elective or emergency surgical procedure: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"How can we effectively promote the public's prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection? Jordan et al. (2020) found with United States samples that emphasizing either self-interest or collective-interest of prevention behaviors could promote the public's prevention intention. Moreover, prosocially framed messaging was more effective in motivating prevention intention than self-interested messaging. A dual consideration of both cultural psychology and the literature on personalized matching suggests the findings of Jordan et al. (2020) are counterintuitive, because persuasion is most effective when the frame of the message delivered and the recipient of the message are culturally congruent. In order to better understand the potential influence of culture, the current research aimed to replicate and extend Jordan et al. (2020) findings in the Japanese context. Specifically, we examined the question (1) whether the relative effectiveness of the prosocial appeal is culturally universal and robust, (2) which types of 'others' especially promote prevention intention, and (3) which psychological mechanisms can explain the impact of messaging on prevention intention. In Study 1 (N = 1,583), we confirmed that self-interested framed, prosocially framed, and the combination of both types of messaging were equally effective in motivating prevention intention. In Study 2 (N = 1,686), we found that family-framed messaging also had a promoting effect similar to that from self-interested and prosocial appeals. However, the relative advantage of prosocial appeals was not observed. Further, a psychological propensity relevant to sensitivity to social rejection did not moderate the impact of messaging on prevention intention in both studies. These results suggest that since engaging in the infection control itself was regarded as critical by citizens after public awareness of COVID-19 prevention has been sufficiently heightened, for whom we should act might not have mattered. Further, concerns for social rejection might have had less impact on the prevention intentions under these circumstances. These results suggest that the relative advantage of a prosocial appeal might not be either culturally universal or prominent in a collectivistic culture.

In order to investigate the aerosol evolution processes before, in, and after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown period of 2020, ambient monitoring data of six air pollutants were analyzed from Jan 1 to Apr 11 in both 2020 and 2019. Our results showed that the six ambient pollutants concentrations were much lower during the COVID-19 lockdown due to a great reduction of anthropogenic emissions. BTH suffered from air pollution more seriously in comparison of YRD, suggesting the differences in the industrial structures of these two regions. The significant difference between the normalized ratios of CO and NO2 during COVID-19 lockdown, along with the increasing PM2.5, indicated the oxidation of NO2 to form nitrate and the dominant contribution of secondary processes on PM2.5. In addition, the most health risk factor was PM2.5 and health-risked based air quality index (HAQI) values during the COVID-19 pandemic in YRD in 2020 were all lower than those in 2019. Our findings suggest that the reduction of anthropogenic emissions is essential to mitigate PM2.5 pollution, while O3 control may be more complicated.","Wang, Junfeng; Lei, Yali; Chen, Yi; Wu, Yangzhou; Ge, Xinlei; Shen, Fuzhen; Zhang, Jie; Ye, Jianhuai; Nie, Dongyang; Zhao, Xiuyong; Chen, Mindong",J Environ Manage,,401

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and severity of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from 01 August 2018 to 30 July 2020 were included. The monthly ratios of inpatient cases were compared from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. These ratios were also compared according to the ""A-DROP"" severity score, and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. RESULTS: This study included a total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020) the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased compared with the same period in the previous year (-48.1%), despite a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones: mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%. The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI -521 to -1955). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, Hiroyuki; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Int J Infect Dis,,401

410533,Timing of corticosteroids impacts mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,2021,"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has rapidly developed into a global public health threat. Patients severely affected with COVID-19 present distinct clinical features, including acute respiratory disorder, neutrophilia, cytokine storm, and sepsis. In addition, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines are found in the plasma of such patients. Transcriptome sequencing of different specimens obtained from patients suffering from severe episodes of COVID-19 shows dynamics in terms of their immune responses. However, those host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 propagation and the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for dysfunctional immune responses during COVID-19 infection remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the mRNA-long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) co-expression network derived from publicly available SARS-CoV-2-infected transcriptome data of human lung epithelial cell lines and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients. Through co-expression network analysis, we identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs strongly correlated with genes involved in various immune-related pathways crucial for cytokine signaling. Our findings suggest that the aberrant expression of these four lncRNAs can be associated with cytokine storms and anti-viral responses during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs. Thus, the present study uncovers molecular interactions behind the cytokine storm activation potentially responsible for hyper-inflammatory responses in critical COVID-19 patients.","Mukherjee, Sumit; Banerjee, Bodhisattwa; Karasik, David; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana",Viruses,,401

416617,More Than 50 Long-Term Effects of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. RESULTS: The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. CONCLUSION: In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.","Ölcer, Sabahat; Yilmaz-Aslan, Yüce; Brzoska, Patrick",BMC Public Health,,401

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (&#8804;3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Dong, Xuan; Li, Zhongyi; Xu, Qianghong; Feng, Huibin; Cai, Jing; Huang, Sisi; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Zhu, Wei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Annane, Djillali; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",J Clin Invest,,401

This mixed-methods study explored and evaluated the adaptations made to early childhood teacher preparation courses in an undergraduate program in order to provide relevant training through a variety of instructional modalities including face-to-face, virtual, hypothetical, and mixed reality. Focused on maintaining professional standards through adapted coursework designed to meet student learning outcomes, instructors reflected on multiple instructional modalities and analysis of demonstrable learning outcomes for students in a four-year bachelor's degree program resulting in state teacher certification. Data were collected from students from three different cohorts (n = 26) through course assignments, reflections, and instructor- and self-assessments. Results highlight several areas where students found success in meeting professional standards in new ways including: knowledge of development, relevant and responsive curriculum, collaborative engagement, cultural and familial knowledge, inclusive and individualized design, and flexibility and adaptability. Students were prepared to teach in the following ways: designing curriculum, implementation, and reflective practice. Students felt unprepared to teach citing needing more practice and continued skills development. These findings highlight the need for flexibility in the face of the pandemic and underscore the importance of using the new knowledge and practices generated about student learning to reinvent early childhood teacher education programs when faced with post-pandemic realities.","Callaway-Cole, Larisa; Kimble, Ashley",Early Child Educ J,,401

425924,COVID-19 Prevalence and Mortality Among Schizophrenia Patients: A Large-Scale Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has required facilities to quickly respond to a myriad of infection prevention recommendations, as well as design their own protocols. The varied and changing guidance has been difficult for staff to absorb and has presented challenges for managing compliance. APPROACH: HCA Healthcare recognized the need for a coordinated approach to managing infection prevention guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and a mechanism for monitoring compliance and responding to implementation challenges remotely. This innovation consisted of a bundle of infection prevention guidance referred to as the Universal Protection Framework that collated existing recommendations into an easy-to-understand structure with four domains: core infection prevention practices, access control, distancing, and patient flow. This was supported by education and clear communication. A remote monitoring program that incorporated a combination of report review and virtual observation via videoconferencing using an on-site leader as a navigator for the discussion assessed 46 survey domains for compliance. RESULTS: This framework was implemented in a large health care system, and to date compliance has been monitored at 15 facilities. Overall, compliance was high (average, 90%). High compliance was seen with oversight and distribution of personal protective equipment, cohorting of COVID-19 patients, facility access controls, and employee exposure monitoring. Challenges were identified in compliance with social distancing and universal masking. CONCLUSION: Complex infection prevention expectations for COVID-19 can be communicated and implemented by bundling into a simple framework. This innovation also demonstrated that compliance can be measured remotely, which may be useful even after the pandemic challenges have passed.","Sands, Kenneth; Blanchard, Jackie; Grubbs, Ken; O039,; Neal, Fredrick; Schlosser, Michael; Korwek, Kimberly; Englebright, Jane; Perlin, Jonathan",Jt.

426533,Timely rehabilitation for critical patients with COVID-19: another issue should not be ignored,2020,"This study examined self-reported changes in young adults' sexual desire and behaviors during the most significant social restrictions imposed to deal with COVID-19. Drawing on a survey of 565 British adults aged 18-32 collected at the peak of social lockdown restrictions, we document an overall decrease in sexual behaviors consistent with abiding by social restrictions. We found that the levels of sexual desire reported by women (but not men) decreased compared with reports of pre-lockdown levels. Participants in serious relationships reported more increases in sexual activity than people who were single or dating casually, and there were significant differences according to gender and sexual orientation. The perceived impact of subjective wellbeing of people with high sociosexuality scores was disproportionately associated with social lockdown but there was no effect for general health. Thus, the impact on sexuality and general wellbeing should be considered by policymakers when considering future social restrictions related to COVID-19 or other public health emergencies.","Wignall, Liam; Portch, Emma; McCormack, Mark; Owens, Rebecca; Cascalheira, Cory J; Attard-Johnson, Janice; Cole, Terri",J Sex Res,,401

Multilevel urine pregnancy tests (MLPTs), which provide accurate results in one week, are a promising alternative, but their use has not been evaluated within telemedicine services. METHODS: From November 2017 to May 2018, 165 eligible and consenting pregnant people who contacted safe2choose-an organization providing telemedicine abortion services internationally-for medication abortion were enrolled in a pilot study and mailed a package containing medication abortion drugs, two MLPTs and instructions. Data on 118 participants who completed a web-based evaluation survey two weeks after the package was sent were analyzed to examine participant experiences and satisfaction with the service. RESULTS: Responding participants were from 11 countries, including Mexico, the Philippines and Singapore. Ninety-three percent used both MLPTs, and 91% of those who used both tests used them at the correct time intervals. Among the 95% of participants whose MLPT results indicated that their pregnancy hormone levels decreased from before to after medication abortion, 86% correctly interpreted the results to mean that they were no longer pregnant. Satisfaction was high, with all indicating that the supplied information was helpful; more than nine out of 10 noted that they would want to use the MLPTs again. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating MLPTs into telemedicine abortion services is feasible and associated with high client satisfaction. Enabling people to manage their own abortion follow-up care could greatly improve their overall abortion experience.","Chong, Erica; Sheldon, Wendy R; Lopez-Green, Danielle; Gonzalez H, Cecilia; Castillo, Bárbara Hernández; Ogando, Marián Gulías; Tuladhar, Nirdesh; Blum, Jennifer",Int Perspect Sex Reprod Health,,401
429975,To Do or Not to Do: On Being a Medical Student During COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors. DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception. There is a need for further efforts to understand the mechanism regarding the general public's risk perception for eï¬ective risk communication.","Jang, Won Mo; Kim, Un-Na; Jang, Deok Hyun; Jung, Hyemin; Cho, Sanghyun; Eun, Sang Jun; Lee, Jin Yong",BMJ Open,,401

SUMMARY: A 21-year-old male with a past medical history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was in full remission after allogenic bone marrow transplantation complicated with chronic graft-versus-host disease. He was hospitalized due to fever, malaise, and respiratory symptoms. A diagnosis of RSV upper respiratory tract infection complicated by secondary pneumonia was made, and oral ribavirin (600 mg in 3 divided doses daily) and intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) were initiated. On day 2 of the hospital admission, the patient's uric acid levels had increased from a baseline of 4 to 6 mg/dL to 19.3 and 22.2 mg/dL after the fourth and fifth doses of ribavirin, respectively, and his serum creatinine steadily had increased from a baseline of 0.7 to 0.8 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL. Ribavirin was discontinued after the sixth dose, and a single dose of intravenous rasburicase (7.5 mg) was administered. On day 3, the patient's serum uric and creatinine concentrations had decreased to 4.7 mg/dL and 1.1 mg/dL, respectively. He continued to recover on antibiotics and was discharged with normal uric acid and serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: We report a case of severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury that developed early after initiation of ribavirin for RSV infection and suspected bacterial pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient without hepatitis C, requiring ribavirin discontinuation and rasburicase administration. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe hyperuricemia in a patient treated with ribavirin for RSV infection rather than chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute and severe hyperuricemia following ribavirin administration.","Sakran, Razan; Frisch, Avraham; Elias, Adi; Sliman, Hend; Ammuri, Hanna; Kurnik, Daniel",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,401

Previous scholarship in this area examined the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across various populations. Currently, there is limited research examining how these populations engage in and navigate challenges relating to exercise during shelter-in-place mandates and no studies examining the role of social support in promoting exercise during the pandemic. In this study, we examine perceptions of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic among members who belong to a fitness community based in Oakland, California. In-depth interviews (n = 31) were used to understand how the pandemic has affected participants' perceptions of current exercise habits and how understandings of social support facilitate engagement in physical activity. Reported narratives encompassed two primary themes: (1) Facilitators of Social Support and (2) Challenges and Barriers to Social Support. Our findings highlight the importance of social support for reinforcing perceptions of exercise adherence amid challenges experienced by members of a fitness community to remain physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carter, Andrew; Alexander, Adam C",Health Promot Pract,,401

Wuhan, a city in Hubei province from which COVID-19 emanated, has been quarantined since 12 January 2020, and many other cities have been placed under travel restrictions. Citizens have been strongly encouraged to stay home and limit face-to-face contact; as a result, people’s daily lives are dominated by the Internet as never before. Here, we visualize the spread of COVID-19 and people’s Internet attention in China in the form of cartograms using the diffusion-based method.","Zhang, Hong; Chen, Yanyu; Gao, Peichao; Wu, Zhiwei",Environ.

438142,Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2020,"The novel pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has challenged the medical community. While diagnostic and therapeutic efforts have been focused on respiratory complications of the disease, several ocular implications have also emerged. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in tears of the infected patients, and reports suggest that the ocular surface could serve as a portal of entry and a reservoir for viral transmission. Clinically, COVID-19 has been associated with mild conjunctivitis, which can be the first and only symptom of the disease. Subtle retinal changes like hyperreflective lesions in the inner layers on optical coherence tomography (OCT), cotton-wool spots, and microhemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, COVID-19 has been associated with an increased incidence of systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus and Kawasaki disease, which are particularly relevant for ophthalmologists due to their potentially severe ocular manifestations. Several treatment strategies are currently under investigation for COVID-19, but none of them have been proved to be safe and effective to date. Intensive care unit patients, due to risk factors like invasive mechanical ventilation, prone position, and multiresistant bacterial exposure, may develop ocular complications like ocular surface disorders, secondary infections, and less frequently acute ischemic optic neuropathy and intraocular pressure elevation. Among the array of drugs that have shown positive results, the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine has raised a concern due to their well-known retinal toxic effects. However, the risk of retinal toxicity with short-term high-dose use of antimalarials is still unknown. Ocular side effects have also been reported with other investigational drugs like lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons, and interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibitors. The aim of this review was to summarize ophthalmological implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to serve as a reference for eye care and other physicians for prompt diagnosis and management.","Bertoli, Federica; Veritti, Daniele; Danese, Carla; Samassa, Francesco; Sarao, Valentina; Rassu, Nicolò; Gambato, Tommaso; Lanzetta, Paolo",J Ophthalmol,,401

The objective is to better understand the peri-traumatic experience in order to identify vulnerable people to whom psychological care could be offered. Materials and methods: An online descriptive survey containing three questionnaires, a demographic questionnaire, the questionnaire for peri-traumatic distress and the questionnaire for peri-traumatic dissociation experiences, was conducted using the snowball sampling technique to select 1374 Algerians. Results: The results of this survey indicate that 32.7 % of the participants present a peri-traumatic distress and 61.8 % of the participants present a significant level of peri-traumatic dissociation during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to confinement, stress, female gender, the origin of a particularly affected department, the average economic situation and a history of psychological problems are predictors of peri-traumatic distress. Conclusion: This study provides the first empirical data on the incidence of peri-traumatic reactions (distress and dissociation), as well as their predictors in an Algerian population during the initial phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. The Algerian population has experienced levels of distress in the low range of what has been described in the literature, while the dissociation shows that the majority of the population is affected. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the peri-traumatic reactions according to the two dimensions of distress and dissociation, and offering psychological care for the most vulnerable people, in order to prevent the risk of their possible chronicisation, and developing post-traumatic stress disorder in later periods.","Djillali, Slimane; Ouandelous, Nassima-Nassiba; Zouani, Naziha; Crettaz Von Roten, Fabienne; de Roten, Yves",Ann. med.-psychol,,401

441325,Clinical and Demographic Characteristics Including Comorbidities and Their Outcomes Among Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in Four Tertiary Care Hospitals Across Lahore,2021,"BACKGROUND: Testing is one of the most effective means to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. METHODS: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. RESULTS: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals' infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. CONCLUSIONS: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume. Thus, it is highly recommended that testing be adopted in combination with measures such as wearing masks and social distancing to better manage infectious diseases. Our research contributes to understanding the role of testing in epidemic control and provides useful suggestions for the government and individuals in responding to epidemics.","Cui, Yapeng; Ni, Shunjiang; Shen, Shifei",BMC Infect Dis,,401

442609,"Efficacy, Practicality, and Safety of Inhaled Methoxyflurane in Elderly Patients with Acute Trauma Pain: Subgroup Analysis of a Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Open-Label Trial (MEDITA)",2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a major global public health issue. SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed by the detection of viral RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Prolonged viral shedding has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the presence of viral RNA does not always correlate with infectivity. Therefore, the present study aimed to confirm the presence of viable virus in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients in the later phase of the disease, more than two weeks after diagnosis. Method: Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients who had been diagnosed with the disease at least two weeks previously and admitted to a community treatment center (CTC) from 15 March to 10 April 2020 were enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal and salivary swab specimens were collected from each patient. Using these specimens, RT-PCR assay and viral culture were performed. Result: In total, 48 patients were enrolled in this study. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patient groups. RT-PCR assay and viral culture of SARS-CoV-2 were performed using nasopharyngeal and salivary swabs. The results of RT-PCR performed using salivary swab specimens, in terms of cycle threshold (Ct) values, were similar to those of RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal swab specimens. In addition, no viable virus could be cultured from swab specimens collected from the late-phase COVID-19 patients with prolonged viral RNA shedding. Conclusions: In conclusion, our study suggests that even if viral shedding is sustained in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with later phase of COVID-19, it can be expected that the transmission risk of the virus is low. In addition, saliva can be used as a reliable specimen for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sohn, Yujin; Jeong, Su Jin; Chung, Won Suk; Hyun, Jong Hoon; Baek, Yae Jee; Cho, Yunsuk; Kim, Jung Ho; Ahn, Jin Young; Choi, Jun Yong; Yeom, Joon-Sup",J.

We show that hamsters treated prophylactically with a 1:2560 titer of human convalescent plasma or a 1:5260 titer of monoclonal antibody were protected against weight loss, had a significant reduction of virus replication in the lungs, and showed reduced pneumonia. Interestingly, this protective effect was lost with a titer of 1:320 of convalescent plasma. These data highlight the importance of screening plasma donors for high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Our data show that prophylactic administration of high levels of neutralizing antibody, either monoclonal or from convalescent plasma, prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a hamster model, and could be used as an alternative or complementary to other antiviral treatments for COVID-19.","Haagmans, Bart L; Noack, Danny; Okba, Nisreen M A; Li, Wentao; Wang, Chunyan; Bestebroer, Theo; de Vries, Rory; Herfst, Sander; de Meulder, Dennis; Verveer, Elwin; van Run, Peter; Lamers, Mart M; Rijnders, Bart; Rokx, Casper; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Grosveld, Frank; Drabek, Dubravka; Geurts van Kessel, Corine; Koopmans, Marion; Bosch, Berend Jan; Kuiken, Thijs; Rockx, Barry",J Infect Dis,,401

We aimed to identify simple hematological prognostic markers in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: Retrospective study of RT-PCR confirmed hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients (total: n = 154 patients, including diabetic subset n = 57) were analyzed. Clinically applicable cut-offs were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) in order to prognosticate the outcome. RESULTS: Among 154 severe COVID-19 patients, significant association with mortality was seen with respect to TLC(p < 0.001), ANC (p < 0.001), NLR(p < 0.001) and dNLR(p < 0.001). In the total cohort, applicable cut-offs based on ROC curve in predicting outcome were, for TLC 8950 cells/mm3 (area under curve (AUC)-0.764, odds ratio (OR)-7.53), ANC 7679 cells/mm3 (AUC-0.789, OR-8.14), NLR 5.13 (AUC-0.741, OR-4.77), dNLR 3.44 (AUC -0.741, OR-4.43) respectively.In diabetic subset, the cut-offs for TLC was 8950 cells/mm3 (AUC -0.762, OR-14.9), ANC 6510 cells/mm3 (AUC -0.773, OR-16.8), NLR 5.13(AUC -0.678, OR-6) and dNLR 3.25(AUC -0.685, OR-4.7) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In severe COVID-19 patients irrespective of diabetes, a simple, applicable total leucocyte count cut-off, 8950 cells/mm3 , together with easily derived cut-offs for ANC, NLR, dNLR may serve as cost-effective prognosticators of clinical outcome. A normal TLC may be misleading in the intensive care and the above applicable cut-off for TLC serves as an early warning tool for high-risk identification and better in-hospital management. Even with similar or lower cut-offs, diabetics had a higher mortality.","Ramesh, Jayanthy; Reddy, S L Sagar; Rajesh, Moganti; Varghese, Johann",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,401

Early blockading to prevent transmission into the community, strict maintenance of social distance to prevent internal diffusion, timely elimination of public panic, and efficient guarantees of household supplies have proven effective in preventing the spread of the epidemic. Our research shows that collaborative leadership can achieve these goals mainly by effectively integrated local knowledge, modern information technology, and social self-organization, and then promoting the realization of collective action of community epidemic prevention and control.

Experimental data show that collateral coherence between different organs is strain-dependent. Whether this interrelation is also present in humans is unknown. This study investigates the relation between the palmar and the coronary circulation in patients with coronary artery disease and which factors possibly influence collateral development. Approach and Results: In 50 patients with a chronic total occlusion, both the coronary collateral flow index (CFI) and the palmar CFI was measured. The correlation between both indices was determined, together with the relation to clinical variables. Mean coronary CFI was 0.51±0.16, and mean palmar CFI was 0.82±0.13. The coronary and palmar CFI were significantly correlated (&#961;=0.48, P=0.001). Coronary CFI was 22% lower in low palmar CFI patients (<0.82) as compared with high palmar CFI patients (0.43±0.12 versus 0.57±0.18, P=0.03). In multivariable analysis, coronary CFI was significantly correlated with the palmar CFI and the duration of angina pectoris. Coronary CFI was inversely correlated with peripheral artery disease and systolic blood pressure.

Therefore, this study attempts to review the Bangladeshi COVID-19-related suicide studies for the first time. Methods: For conducting a systematic review, the PRISMA guideline was adhered. Bangladeshi literatures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic related to either suicide case or suicidal behavior were identified within 1 to 10 April 2021, from the databases like PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc. Finally, a total of 9 literatures were included in this review. Results: Four literatures were cross-sectional studies assessing the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and the rest five were retrospective suicide studies concerned with either case study (n=3) or case-series study (n=2). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was identified to be ranging between 5% and 19.0%, whereas the rate increased over time of the pandemic inception. Significant risk factors concerning suicidal behavior included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic variables: female gender, being divorced or widows or widowers or single in marital status, having lower levels of education, being urban residence, belonging to higher socioeconomic class, being unemployed, and having no children, (ii) behavior and health-related variables: lack of physical exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol consuming, abnormal sleep status, more exposure to social media, and suffering from the higher number of physical health problems;(iii) COVID-19 pandemic-related variables: lower knowledge of COVID-19, lack of preventive COVID-19 behaviors, higher levels of COVID-19 fear, living in highly COVID-19 infected area, higher economic loss due to the pandemic, and experiencing relatives or acquaintances' death by the COVID-19;(iv) psychopathological variables: depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, suicidal thought history, suicide attempt history, and family with a history of suicide.

We aimed to describe changes in screening, depressive symptoms, and suicide risk among adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: In a repeat cross-sectional analysis of electronic health record data from a large pediatric primary care network, we compared the percentage of primary care visits where adolescents aged 12 to 21 were screened for depression, screened positive for depressive symptoms, or screened positive for suicide risk between June and December 2019 (prepandemic) and June and December 2020 (pandemic). Changes were examined overall, by month, and by sex, race and ethnicity, insurance type, and income. Modified Poisson regression was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) for the prepandemic to pandemic changes. RESULTS: Depression screening at primary care visits declined from 77.6% to 75.8% during the pandemic period (PR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-1.06). The percentage of adolescents screening positive for depressive symptoms increased from 5.0% to 6.2% (PR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.15-1.34), with greater increases among female, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic white adolescents. Positive suicide risk screens increased from 6.1% to 7.1% (PR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.08-1.26), with a 34% relative increase in reporting recent suicidal thoughts among female adolescents (PR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.52).

It has also led to many environmental ones. For instance, the lockdowns have led to higher levels of consumption of packaged products, and of take-away food. This paper reports on an international study on the increased consumption and subsequent changes in the amounts of waste produced since the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that 45-48% of the respondents observed an increased consumption of packed food, fresh food, and food delivery. One of the main reasons for the increased waste generation during the lockdown was the fact that people have spent more time at home. In addition, increases of 43% and 53% in food waste and plastic packaging. Drawing from comparisons on the amount of domestic waste produced before and during the pandemic, the findings suggest that some specific types of municipal waste have visibly increased, putting additional pressure on waste management systems. This characterises one of non-intended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from this study provide useful insights to city administrations and municipal utilities on consumption patterns during emergency situations. This, in turn, may support more systemic and strategic measures to be taken, so as to curtail the increase of household waste during pandemic situations.","Filho, Walter Leal; Voronova, Viktoria; Kloga, Marija; Paço, Arminda; Minhas, Aprajita; Salvia, Amanda Lange; Ferreira, Celia Dias; Sivapalan, Subarna",Sci Total Environ,,401
449575,Impact of Transition to Telehealth Care Delivery on Pediatric Cardiology Care during the Early Phase of the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is one of the most notorious pathogens in the global pig industry. During infection, viruses may evolve various strategies, such as modulating stress granules (SGs) formation, to create an optimal surroundings for viral replication. However, the interplay between PRV infection and SGs formation remains largely unknown. Here we showed that PRV infection markedly blocked SGs formation induced by sodium arsenate (AS) and DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT). Accordantly, the phosphorylation of eIF2&#945; was markedly inhibited in PRV-infected cells, although two eIF2&#945; kinases double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) were activated during PRV infection. Furthermore, we also found that the dephosphorylation of eIF2&#945; occurred at the early stage of virus infection but without the elevated production of GADD34 and PP1. Moreover, inhibition of PP1 activity by salubrinal could counteract PRV-mediated eIF2&#945; dephosphorylation partially and inhibit virus replication. Our results revealed that, on the one hand, PRV infection activated eIF2&#945; kinases PKR (latter inhibited) and PERK, and on the other hand, PRV encoded-functions dephosphorylated eIF2&#945; and inhibited SGs formation to facilitate virus replication.","Xu, Shengkui; Chen, Dongjie; Chen, Dengjin; Hu, Qianlin; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Han, Jun; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun",Vet Microbiol,,401
450909,Maintaining physical activity in the era of COVID-19 pandemic: a chair-based exercise program for home-isolated elderly prostate cancer patients,2020,"PURPOSE: The majority of pregnancies affected by maternal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) do not result in fetal transmission. However, several studies have identified parenchymal changes in their placental tissues, suggesting a placental response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the maternal-fetal interface. Although many COVID-19 placental studies have focused on the expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2, further characterization of subcellular molecules involved in viral trafficking have not yet been investigated in these tissues. Of interest are Rab proteins, a family of small GTPase proteins that direct intracellular transport between different endocytic organelles. Rab5 and Rab7 in particular have previously been implicated in HIV and cytomegalovirus invasion of placental trophoblast cells in vitro; the localization of these molecules has not been fully characterized within the human maternal-fetal interface, however, or within placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnancies. METHODS: Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, Rab5 and Rab7 placental localization and comparative fluorescence intensity were explored in a cohort of placental tissues from pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 disease (COVID, n = 15) compared with contemporary control subjects (Control, n = 10). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by using corrected total cell fluorescence values. FINDINGS: Within placental villi, Rab5 was consistently localized in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells. Rab5 had significantly higher mean (SEM) fluorescence intensity in the COVID cohort (Control, 1.96 [0.16]; COVID, 2.62 [0.09]; P = 0.0014). In contrast, although Rab7 was also localized within placental villous syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, mean (SEM) Rab7 fluorescence intensity was significantly downregulated in COVID vs Control placentas (Control, 35.9 [4.1]; COVID, 20.1 [0.52]; P = 0.0001). IMPLICATIONS: This differential expression of Rab5 and Rab7 suggests that placental endocytic pathways may be altered at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. As key molecules governing intracellular vesicle transport, including viral trafficking, Rab GTPase proteins may be of interest for ongoing studies examining placental responses to COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Benarroch, Yoel; Juttukonda, Lillian; Sabharwal, Vishakha; Boateng, Jeffery; Khan, Amir R; Yarrington, Christina; Wachman, Elisha M; Taglauer, Elizabeth",Clin Ther,,401

These are postulated to be related to the virus's use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19. A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints. The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated. Currently there is no firm evidence to suggest that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course. Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases. Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus. As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","Agarwal, Amol; Chen, Alan; Ravindran, Nishal; To, Chau; Thuluvath, Paul J.",J.

454759,Effect of the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic on Outcomes for Patients Admitted With Gastrointestinal Bleeding in New York City,2020,"In the initial stage, the epidemic area is relatively concentrated, and some traffic modes may be subject to traffic control. In this period, the timely delivery of adequate emergency medical supplies to the epidemic points will play an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic. However, the existing emergency medical supplies loading optimization model has not taken the initial period of the epidemic as the research time nor fully considered the traffic control situation in that period. Therefore, combined with the characteristics of the initial epidemic period of COVID-19, this study establishes an optimization model for emergency medical supplies stowage at the rescue point, considering the variation in demand for different kinds of medical supplies at the epidemic point in different cycles and the impact of traffic control on the mode of transportation. The model is an integer programming model. The objective function is the least total cost, including total transportation cost and total inventory cost. The constraints include the supply limit of each medical material that can be provided by the rescue point, the transportation capacity limit of the transportation mode, the demand constraints, inventory constraints, nonnegative constraints, and integer variable constraints of various medical supplies in each cycle of the epidemic location. Finally, combining the development of the epidemic situation in Wuhan January 18–23, 2020, a case study was carried out, and the optimal combination of different transportation modes and different stowage schemes in different periods of the rescue point was obtained, which verified the feasibility and practicality of the model. The model constructed in this study can provide a theoretical reference to the optimal decision-making plan of emergency medical supplies of the implementation of traffic control during the initial period of emergency public health events.

We aimed to review the literature to evaluate gaps and address key questions. A series of key questions were formulated a priori to inform the search strategy and review process; addressed prevalence, severity, etiology, risk factors, preventive methods, screening, and financial costs, potential benefits or harms of screening. Using the National Library of Medicine database, PubMed, detailed literature searches on pneumonia and respiratory infections in Down syndrome were performed. Previously identified review articles were also assessed. The quality of available evidence was then evaluated and knowledge gaps were identified. Forty-two relevant original articles were identified which addressed at least one key question. Study details including research design, internal validity, external validity, and relevant results are presented. Pneumonia and respiratory infections are more prevalent and more severe in individuals with Down syndrome compared to healthy controls through literature review, yet there are gaps in the literature regarding the etiology of pneumonia, the infectious organism, risk factors for infection, and to guide options for prevention and screening. There is urgent need for additional research studies in Down syndrome, especially in the time of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Santoro, Stephanie L; Chicoine, Brian; Jasien, Joan M; Kim, Judy Lu; Stephens, Mary; Bulova, Peter; Capone, George",Am J Med Genet A,,401

Along with COVID-19, other etiologies of pneumonia and tuberculosis constitute additional challenges to the medical system. In this regard, the objective of this work is to develop a new deep transfer learning pipeline to diagnose patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, based on chest x-ray images. We observed in some instances DenseNet and Resnet have orthogonal performances. In our proposed model, we have created an extra layer with convolutional neural network blocks to combine these two models to establish superior performance over either model. The same strategy can be useful in other applications where two competing networks with complementary performance are observed. We have tested the performance of our proposed network on two-class (pneumonia vs healthy), three-class (including COVID-19), and four-class (including tuberculosis) classification problems. The proposed network has been able to successfully classify these lung diseases in all four datasets and has provided significant improvement over the benchmark networks of DenseNet, ResNet, and Inception-V3. These novel findings can deliver a state-of-the-art pre-screening fast-track decision network to detect COVID-19 and other lung pathologies.","Mamalakis, Michail; Swift, Andrew J.; Vorselaars, Bart; Ray, Surajit; Weeks, Simonne; Ding, Weiping; Clayton, Richard H.; Mackenzie, Louise S.; Banerjee, Abhirup",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04006v1.pdf,401
457390,Addendum to: Risk Stratification and Personal Protective Equipment Use in Pediatric Endoscopy During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Single-center Protocol,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) became a global pandemic. Males, compared to females, seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19, but related evidence is scarce, especially in severe patients. We explored sex differences in clinical characteristics and potential risk factors for mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective cohort study, we included all severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Eastern Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, with a definitive clinical outcome as of Apr 10, 2020. Of the included 651 patients, 332 were male, and 319 were female. Males and females did not differ in age and underlying comorbidities. Males were more likely than females to report fever and develop serious complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, secondary infection, acute cardiac injury, coagulopathy, acute kidney injury and arrhythmia. Further, males had much higher mortality relative to females. Multivariable regression showed neutrophilia (odds ratio 6.845, 95% CI 1.227-38.192, p=0.028), thrombocytopenia (19.488, 3.030-25.335, p=0.002), hypersensitive troponin I greater than 0.04 pg/mL (6.058, 1.545-23.755, p=0.010), and procalcitonin greater than 0.1 ng/mL (6.350, 1.396-28.882, p=0.017) on admission were associated with in-hospital death. With either of these risk factors, the cumulative survival rate was relatively lower in males than in females. In conclusion, males are more likely than females to develop serious complications and progress to death. The potential risk factors of neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, hypersensitive troponin I greater than 0.04 pg/mL and procalcitonin more than 0.1 ng/mL may help clinicians to identify patients with poor outcomes at an early stage, especially in males.","Su, Wating; Qiu, Zhen; Zhou, Lu; Hou, Jiabao; Wang, Yafeng; Huang, Fengnan; Zhang, Yi; Jia, Yifan; Zhou, Jun; Liu, Danyong; Xia, Zhengyuan; Xia, Zhong-Yuan; Lei, Shaoqing",Aging (Albany NY),,401

457810,"Association Between Achieving Inpatient Glycemic Control and Clinical Outcomes in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: A Multicenter, Retrospective Hospital-Based Analysis",2021,"The acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system has been shown to be important for cellular infection with at least some viruses, for instance, rhinovirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Functional inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase using tricyclic antidepressants prevented infection of epithelial cells, for instance with SARS-CoV-2. The structure of ambroxol, that is, trans-4-[(2,4-dibromanilin-6-yl)-methyamino]-cyclohexanol, a mucolytic drug applied by inhalation, suggests that the drug might inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase and thereby infection with SARS-CoV-2. To test this, we used vesicular stomatitis virus pseudoviral particles presenting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on their surface (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system for mimicking SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Viral uptake and formation of ceramide localization were determined by fluorescence microscopy, activity of the acid sphingomyelinase by consumption of [14C]sphingomyelin and ceramide was quantified by a kinase method. We found that entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike required activation of acid sphingomyelinase and release of ceramide, events that were all prevented by pretreatment with ambroxol. We also obtained nasal epithelial cells from human volunteers prior to and after inhalation of ambroxol. Inhalation of ambroxol reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity in nasal epithelial cells and prevented pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced acid sphingomyelinase activation, ceramide release, and entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike ex vivo. The addition of purified acid sphingomyelinase or C16 ceramide restored entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike into ambroxol-treated epithelial cells. We propose that ambroxol might be suitable for clinical studies to prevent coronavirus disease 2019.","Carpinteiro, Alexander; Gripp, Barbara; Hoffmann, Markus; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Hoertel, Nicolas; Edwards, Michael J; Kamler, Markus; Kornhuber, Johannes; Becker, Katrin Anne; Gulbins, Erich",J Biol Chem,,401

Recently, thromboembolic complications of Covid-19 have been denoted in literature. We report 5 cases of Covid-19 positive patients with no significant comorbidities who developed 1st time episodes of either; acute limb ischemia or bowel ischemia. Material and methods: This is a retrospective observational study analyzing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of five Covid-19 positive patients. Five patients aged 38-60 presented to our institution from 1st April to 1st June and were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia, subsequently developing severe vascular complications. None of our patients included had any history of thromboembolism nor risk factors that could justify the presentations. Presentation of cases: Patient 1; presented with bowel ischemia as a first presentation. Patient 2 and 3 developed unsalvageable lower limb ischemia secondary to partial to complete occlusion of infra-renal aorta. Patient 4 presented with acute upper limb ischemia due to complete occlusion of the axillary and brachial artery. Patient 5 developed bilateral lower limb unsalvageable ischemia secondary to aortic bifurcation occlusion. All patients tested Covid-19 positive upon admission, and received standard care. Discussion and conclusion: The thromboembolic complications seen in our cases were devastating and resulted in significant mortality and morbidity. All vessels affected were medium-large vessels. None of our cases had any significant predisposing medical conditions or history of thromboembolic or ischemic events. A high index of suspicion is necessary when evaluating such patients regardless of thromboembolic history. Appropriate anticoagulation regimens are essential. Our cases add to the currently increasing severe thromboembolic complications of Covid-19.","Lari, Eisa; Lari, Ali; AlQinai, Shamlan; Abdulrasoul, Mahdi; Al-Safran, Salman; Ameer, Ahmad; Al-Sabah, Salman",,,401
459831,Impact of Epicardial Fat on Clinical Outcomes in Covid-19,2021,"Background: In patients with COVID-19, cardiovascular complications are common and associated with poor prognosis. Among these, an association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and COVID-19 has been described;however, the extent of this relationship is unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the epidemiology of AF in COVID-19 patients and its impact on all-cause mortality. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, and a protocol for this study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021227950). PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Overall, 31 studies were included in the analysis, with a total number of 187,716 COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of AF was found to be as high as 8% of patients with COVID-19 (95% CI: 6.3–10.2%, 95% prediction intervals (PI): 2.0–27.1%), with a high degree of heterogeneity between studies;a multiple meta-regression model including geographical location, age, hypertension, and diabetes showed that these factors accounted for more than a third of the heterogeneity. AF COVID-19 patients were less likely to be female but more likely older, hypertensive, and with a critical status than those without AF. Patients with AF showed a significant increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 3.97, 95% CI: 2.76–5.71), with a high degree of heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis focusing on new-onset AF showed the consistency of these results. Conclusions: Among COVID-19 patients, AF is found in 8% of patients. AF COVID-19 patients are older, more hypertensive, and more likely to have a critical status. In COVID-19 patients, AF is associated with a 4-fold higher risk of death. Further studies are needed to define the best treatment strategies to improve the prognosis of AF COVID-19 patients.","Romiti, Giulio Francesco Corica Bernadette Lip Gregory Y.

We show that the predictive power of statistical models is limited until a few days before curves flatten, forecast deaths and infections assuming current policies continue and compare our predictions to the IHME models.

DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: 3 large acute medical receiving units in NHS Lothian, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Non-COVID-19 acute admissions (n=1682) were examined over the first 31 days after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown policy in the UK on 23 March 2019. Patients admitted over a matched interval in the previous 5 years were used as a comparator cohort (n=14 954). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demography, biochemical markers of clinical acuity and 7-day hospital inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions reduced by 44.9% across all three sites in comparison with the mean of the preceding 5 years (p<0.001). Patients arriving during this period were more likely to be male, of younger age and to arrive by emergency ambulance transport. Non-COVID-19 admissions during lockdown had a greater incidence of acute kidney injury, lactic acidaemia and an increased risk of hospital death within 7 days (4.2% vs 2.5%), which persisted after adjustment for confounders (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.41, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a significant reduction in non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions during the early weeks of lockdown. Patients admitted during this period were of higher clinical acuity with a higher incidence of early inpatient mortality.","Lyall, Marcus J; Lone, Nazir I",Emerg. med. j,,401

466628,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the need to maintain regular physical activity,2020,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are highly prevalent among men who have sex with men who use HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which leads to antimicrobial consumption linked to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to assess use of an antiseptic mouthwash as an antibiotic sparing approach to prevent STIs. METHODS: We invited people using PrEP who had an STI in the past 24 months to participate in this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, AB/BA crossover superiority trial at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Using block randomisation (block size eight), participants were assigned (1:1) to first receive Listerine Cool Mint or a placebo mouthwash. They were required to use the study mouthwashes daily and before and after sex for 3 months each and to ask their sexual partners to use the mouthwash before and after sex. Participants were screened every 3 months for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea at the oropharynx, anorectum, and urethra. The primary outcome was combined incidence of these STIs during each 3-month period, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who completed at least the first 3-month period. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03881007. FINDINGS: Between April 2, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 343 participants were enrolled: 172 in the Listerine followed by placebo (Listerine-placebo) group and 171 in the placebo followed by Listerine (placebo-Listerine) group. The trial was terminated prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 151 participants completed the entire study, and 89 completed only the first 3-month period. 31 participants withdrew consent, ten were lost to follow-up, and one acquired HIV. In the Listerine-placebo group, the STI incidence rate was 140·4 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period, and 102·6 per 100 person-years during the placebo period. In the placebo-Listerine arm, the STI incidence rate was 133·9 per 100 person-years during the placebo period, and 147·5 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period. We did not find that Listerine significantly reduced STI incidence (IRR 1·17, 95% CI 0·84-1·64). Numbers of adverse events were not significantly higher than at baseline and were similar while using Listerine and placebo. Four serious adverse events (one HIV-infection, one severe depression, one Ludwig's angina, and one testicular carcinoma) were not considered to be related to use of mouthwash. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support the use of Listerine Cool Mint as a way to prevent STI acquisition among high-risk populations.

It is mainly transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with secretions from an infected person or through inhalation of droplets containing SARS-CoV-2. It is controversial whether the virus may be transmitted via tears. Exposed ocular surface can serve as a gateway in transmission and acquiring respiratory diseases. Considering the reported cases on healthcare workers indicating nosocomial transmission and the anatomical and physiological aspects it is perceived that ophthalmic healthcare professionals are at higher risk of contracting the virus by virtue of their job. In this narrative review we discuss current evidence around detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human tears and forms of transmissions reported to date. We also provide a comprehensive approach that may be implemented in an ophthalmic care facility to protect healthcare personnel, as well as patients, from contracting the virus.","Sadhu, Soumen; Agrawal, Rupesh; Pyare, Richa; Pavesio, Carlos; Zierhut, Manfred; Khatri, Anadi; Smith, Justine R; de Smet, Marc D; Biswas, Jyotirmay",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,401

471785,Neuromuscular monitoring and neuromuscular blocking agent shortages when treating critically ill COVID-19 patients: a multicentre retrospective analysis,2021,"Research has shown that utilizing active learning techniques in the classroom increases student engagement and performance. With the increased attention focused on active learning, professors are striving to find better ways to engage students in the classroom. Indeed, numerous studies have focused on investigating many different approaches to this topic. COVID 19 has mandated a rapid transition to remote learning and with this forced change has come what some students describe as ?Zoom Fatigue? [1]. Many students have reported feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, and disengaged by the dramatic increase in mandated distance education required by the COVID pandemic. Video conferencing has become the ?go to? panacea for education during this time and students are spending unprecedented amounts of time in front of a screen where normally they would be in a classroom. This heretofore singular and unique approach to education coupled with decreased peer-to-peer interaction has caused a problem with student engagement [2,3]. Problem Students engagement and performance have decreased during COVID 19 due to forced online learning and lack of peer interaction. Hypothesis We hypothesize that creating a non-graded, fun, and relaxing physiology-focused trivia night will increase student engagement and performance on summative assessments. Proposal Using a master's level class progressing through the respiratory physiology module utilizing remote, synchronous lectures to deliver content, we will introduce a voluntary ?pub trivia night? review session with teams randomly assigned to increase interaction amongst peers and review respiratory physiology material. Questions will be provided in rounds and at the end a ?winning team? will be awarded a $100 gift card. Expected Results We expect students who attend and participate in the ?pub trivia night? will perform better than their peers on summative exams as well as report increased engagement with their classmates over the course of the unit. Analysis of test scores of those who competed and those who did not will be compared. All students in class will be surveyed concerning peer engagement and results compared.

CONTEXT: Without a method to understand if day-to-day variation in outcomes may be attributed to meaningful signals of change-rather than variability we would expect-care providers, improvement leaders, policy-makers, and the public will struggle to recognize if epidemic conditions are improving. METHODS: We developed a novel hybrid C-Chart and I-Chart to detect within a geographic area the start and end of exponential growth in reported deaths. Reported deaths were the unit of analysis owing to erratic reporting of cases from variability in local testing strategies. We used simulation and case studies to assess chart performance and define technical parameters. This approach also applies to other critical measures related to a pandemic when high-quality data are available. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid chart detected the start of exponential growth and identified early signals that the growth phase was ending. During a pandemic, timely reliable signals that an epidemic is waxing or waning may have mortal implications. This novel chart offers a practical tool, accessible to system leaders and front-line teams, to visualize and learn from daily reported deaths during an epidemic. Without Shewhart charts and, more broadly, a theory of variation in our epidemiological arsenal, we lack a scientific method for real-time assessment of local conditions. Shewhart charts should become a standard method for learning from data in the context of a pandemic or epidemic.","Perla, Rocco J; Provost, Shannon M; Parry, Gareth J; Little, Kevin; Provost, Lloyd P",Int. j. qual. health care,,401

The herb Psephellus bellus shows strong antifungal activity and is characterized by unique guaianolides, which have an ester on C-2. Thus, a specialized method of isolation and testing was applied to assess the pharmacological effects of these guaianolides. After phytochemical analysis (chromatography and spectral methods), selected lipophilic compounds and the herb extract of this species containing 26 sesquiterpene lactones were tested. The antifungal effect of the herbal compounds was determined on clinical strains of fungi Candida, Rhodotorula, Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Scopulariopsis using a diffusion test. The MTT assay was employed to study the cytotoxic effects of the extract against human fibroblasts. Statistical analysis was performed. All analyzed compounds exhibited antifungal activity in cultivations suitable for assessment.

Therefore, the main objective of this research is to improve this estimation method using the Runge–Kutta technique. The improved method was applied to derive the estimators of the shape scale family parameters and compare them with Bayesian estimators based on the informative and kernel priors, via Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results showed that the improved maximum likelihood estimation method is highly efficient and outperforms the Bayesian method for different sample sizes. Finally, from a future perspective, the proposed model could be important for analyzing real data sets including data on COVID-19 deaths in Egypt, for potential comparative studies with other countries.

We aimed to report our single surgeon experience of the ostioplasty in patients with left main coronary arterial atresia. METHODS: From Jul 2018 to Dec 2019, pediatric patients who presented with left main coronary arterial atresia and subsequently underwent surgical coronary ostioplasty were recruited into this retrospective study. Concomitant mitral repair was applied when the regurgitation was moderate or more. RESULTS: A total of 9 patients diagnosed as left coronary arterial atresia were included. Mitral regurgitation was found in all of them, including 6 (66.7%) severe and 1 (11.1%) moderate and 2 (22.2%) mild. In addition to ischemic lesions which was found in 7 (77.8%) patients, structural mitral problem was also common (presented in 7 (77.8%) patients). All the patients underwent coronary ostioplasty with autologous pulmonary arterial patch augmenting anterior wall of the neo-ostium. Mean Aortic cross clamp time and CPB time was 88.1 ± 18.9 and 124.6 ± 23.6 min, respectively. During a median of 10.9 (range, 3.3 - 17.2) months follow-up, there was only 1 death at 5 months after surgery. All survivors were recovered uneventfully with normal left ventricular function, however, with 4 (50.0%) significant recurrence of MR. CONCLUSIONS: With favorable surgical outcomes, coronary ostioplasty for LMCA atresia may be an option of revascularization. Structural mitral problems presented in majority patients, resulting in the requirement of concomitant mitral repair. However, the optimal technique of mitral repair remains unclear.","Ma, Kai; Qi, Lei; Yuan, Jianhui; Zhang, Benqing; Yuan, Xingang; Fan, Taibing; Mao, Fengqun; Lin, Ye; Wang, Guanxi; Li, Shoujun; Zhang, Tingting; Meng, Hong; Pang, Kunjing",Can. j. cardiol,,401

Opportunities to further improve patient outcomes include addressing frailty, optimizing nutrition, prehabilitation, correcting preoperative anemia, and improving uptake of ERAS worldwide, including in low- and middle-income countries. Challenges facing enhanced recovery today include implementation, carbohydrate loading, reversal of neuromuscular blockade, and bowel preparation. The COVID-19 pandemic poses both a challenge and an opportunity for ERAS. Conclusions and Relevance: To date, ERAS has achieved significant benefit for patients and health systems; however, improvements are still needed, particularly in the areas of patient optimization and systematic implementation.

This study aimed at reporting on the rates of COVID-19 in the country and at making prognoses on cases, deaths, and recoveries through predictive modeling. Also, we attempted to forecast the needs in professional workforce depending on implementation of quarantine measures. METHODS: We calculated both national and local incidence, mortality and case-fatality rates, and made forecast modeling via classic susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model. The Health Workforce Estimator tool was utilized for forecast modeling of health care workers capacity. RESULTS: The vast majority of symptomatic patients had mild disease manifestations and the proportion of moderate disease was around 10%. According to the SEIR model, there will be 156 thousand hospitalized patients due to severe illness and 15.47 thousand deaths at the peak of an outbreak if no measures are implemented. Besides, this will substantially increase the need in professional medical workforce. Still, 50% compliance with quarantine may possibly reduce the deaths up to 3.75 thousand cases and the number of hospitalized up to 9.31 thousand cases at the peak.

Therefore, the need for a vaccine against the virus is huge. Researchers worldwide are working around the clock to find a vaccine. Experts estimate that a fast-tracked vaccine development process could speed a successful candidate to market in approximately 12-18 months. The objective of this review was to describe the coronavirus vaccines candidates in development and the important considerations. The review was conducted through a thematic analysis of the literature on COVID-19 vaccines in development. It only included data until the end of June 2020, 6 months after the emergence of the COVID-19. Different approaches are currently used to develop COVID-19 vaccines from traditional live-attenuated, inactivated, subunit vaccines, to more novel technologies such as DNA or mRNA vaccines. The race is on to find both medicines and vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic. As with drugs, vaccine candidates go through pre-clinical testing first before they go through the three phases of clinical trials in humans. Of the over 130 vaccine candidates, 17 are in clinical trials while others are expected to move to clinical testing after the animal studies.","Sanicas, Merlin; Sanicas, Melvin; Diop, Doudou; Montomoli, Emanuele",Pan Afr Med J,,401

Knowledge about COVID-19 is growing exponentially, but long-term pulmonary outcomes and factors influencing the development of fibrosis, such as intubation status, remain uncertain. We present three patients with no previous underlying pulmonary disease who developed post-ARDS fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 and continue to be severely impaired six months after initial hospitalization. Case Series: Three patients developed post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 within one month of acute infection. Two males and one female, aged 56 to 75, were admitted 4 to 7 days after symptom onset and required ICU admission. One patient required 12 days of mechanical ventilation and was managed with noninvasive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for 15 days and one was managed with HFNC for 37 days. One patient receiving oxygenation via HFNC and oxymask developed pneumomediastinum on day 30 of admission and was managed conservatively. All patients demonstrated characteristic bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT chest and follow up scans showed traction-bronchiectasis with diffuse fibrotic changes. C-reactive protein level on admission ranged from 41.22 to 30.79, and all patients received systemic corticosteroids along with therapeutic anticoagulation. All patients met criteria for home oxygen on discharge. Discussion: Post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19 appears to be multifactorial. Possible outcome predictors identified include: advanced age, illness severity, length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, smoking, and chronic alcoholism. While the mechanism remains uncertain, virus-induced cell injury and inflammatory mediators may be responsible for the accelerated lung damage observed. Management has evolved over the course of the pandemic from emphasis on early intubation to maximal use of non-invasive pressure ventilation, taking into consideration the potential harm associated with patient self-inflicted lung injury versus ventilator induced injury. Our case series demonstrates three patients with varying comorbidities and elevated inflammatory markers, who received steroids and therapeutic anticoagulation. All patients had similar clinical outcomes irrespective of intubation status. Conclusion: Intubation status did not appear to have an impact on progression to post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis in our case series of three patients. All patients developed fibrosis and continued to experience severe dyspnea requiring home oxygen six months after acute infection. Long-term observational cohort studies are required to better establish if mechanical ventilation is a predictor of post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis from COVID-19.","Ghosh, K.; Ibarra, G.; Velasquez Espiritu, M.; Poor, A.; Trenard, N.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,401
484261,The Association between Influenza Vaccination and COVID-19 and Its Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies,2021,"A web application with real-time emotion recognition for psychologists and psychiatrists is presented. Mental health effects during COVID-19 quarantine need to be handled because society is being emotionally impacted. The human micro-expressions can describe genuine emotions that can be captured by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. But the challenge is to implement it under the poor performance of a part of society computers and the low speed of internet connection, i.e., improve the computational efficiency and reduce the data transfer. To validate the computational efficiency premise, we compare CNN architectures results, collecting the floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), the Number of Parameters (NP) and accuracy from the MobileNet, PeleeNet, Extended Deep Neural Network (EDNN), Inception- Based Deep Neural Network (IDNN) and our proposed Residual mobile-based Network model (ResmoNet). Also, we compare the trained models results in terms of Main Memory Utilization (MMU) and Response Time to complete the Emotion (RTE) recognition. Besides, we design a data transfer that includes the raw data of emotions and the basic patient information. The web application was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a utility questionnaire by psychologists and psychiatrists. ResmoNet model generated the most reduced NP, FLOPS, and MMU results, only EDNN overcomes ResmoNet in 0.01sec in RTE. The optimizations to our model impacted the accuracy, therefore IDNN and EDNN are 0.02 and 0.05 more accurate than our model respectively. Finally, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, the web application has good usability (73.8 of 100) and utility (3.94 of 5).","Mitre-Hernandez, Hugo; Ferro-Perez, Rodolfo; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Francisco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07649v2.pdf,401

In this study, we aimed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and affecting factors in healthcare professionals. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey conducted in 1574 healthcare professionals consisting of physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, and healthcare personnel in Turkey in December 2020. Demographic, attitudinal, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores of healthcare professionals were investigated in this survey. RESULTS: About 84.6% of healthcare professionals declared willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine whenever possible. Most physicians (90.4%) stated to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, while 66.5% of nurses, 73.9% of healthcare personnel, also preferred to have it as soon as the vaccine was available. Factors affecting the willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be advanced age, male gender, working in a primary health care center, living with family, having a child, having a chronic disease, having high Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FC-19S) scores. While the group with the highest vaccine rejection rate was nurses with 33.5%, FC-19S scores were significantly higher in nurses who wanted to be vaccinated. In multivariate regression analyses, factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine were identified as advanced age, routine adult vaccination, no history of COVID-19, and recommendation of the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of healthcare professionals declared their willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine, and hence, this will play a leading role in optimizing the vaccination rate of the entire population while combating the pandemic.","Kaplan, Askin Keskin; Sahin, Mustafa Kursat; Parildar, Hulya; Adadan Guvenc, Isil",Int J Clin Pract,,401

This time-consuming responsibility affects their physical and psychosocial health. Therefore, mothers as caregivers are required to receive special training to take care of their children. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a developed web-based intervention for daily care training of children with CP on their mothers' quality of life (QOL), anxiety, depression, stress, and their musculoskeletal pain. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study was a single blind randomized controlled trial. 91 mothers of children with CP with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III, IÑ´, and Ñ´, who aged from 4 to 12 years were assigned to the intervention and control groups using block randomization. Mothers in the control group received their routine face to face occupational therapy intervention and mothers in the intervention group received 12 weeks web-based intervention. QOL, depression, anxiety, stress, and pain were measured before and after the intervention in both groups. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The results of analysis of covariance showed that after controlling the mean score of pretest of pain, the mean score of post-tests in the intervention and control groups was significantly different (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). The mean scores of physical health and total QOL scores of post-tests in the intervention group were significantly higher than the control group with controlling pretest scores. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Designed web-based intervention affects the caregivers' QOL and pain significantly.

The protection of public health has become a priority. However, governments, policy and decision makers, and the global community must also recognize and attempt to mitigate the current and potential negative impacts of the pandemic on major sectors that contribute to food security, nutrition, and livelihoods. The livestock sector is a major contributor to these areas, especially for the world’s most vulnerable populations. The main aim of this review is to summarize recent discoveries related to Covid-19 and how it affects the livestock industry. Even though the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the extent of these effect on the livestock sector are still largely unquantified and yet to be fully felt, formal assessments are yet to commence. The immediate observations showed the disruptions of the livestock chains. Lessons from past epidemics showed that these disruptions may grow along with their dire socio-economic consequences. Since total and immediate eradication of Covid-19 is yet to be actualized, effort was made to provide the way forward that can be taken to protect the livestock sector, its activities, services, and products upon which the world relies. © 2021 Oyeagu et al.

489970,An Observational Cohort Study: How Would Resource Allocation Policies Perform during a Surge of Patients with Covid-19?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 300 million people worldwide suffer from depression. The COVID-19 crisis may dramatically increase these numbers. Severe side effects and resistance development limit the use of standard antidepressants. The steroidal lactone withanolide A (WA) from Withania somnifera may be a promising alternative. Caenorhabditis elegans was used as model to explore WA's anti-depressive and anti-stress potential. METHODS: C. elegans wildtype (N2) and deficient strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109 and MT9772) were used to assess oxidative, osmotic or heat stress as measured by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), determination of lifespan, and mRNA expression of serotonin receptor (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter genes (mod-5). The protective effect of WA was compared to fluoxetine as clinically established antidepressant. Additionally, WA's effect on lifespan was determined. Furthermore, the binding affinities and pKi values of WA, fluoxetine and serotonin as natural ligand to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, Mod-5 and their human orthologues proteins were calculated by molecular docking. RESULTS: Baseline oxidative stress was higher in deficient than wildtype worms. WA and fluoxetine reduced ROS levels in all strains except MT9772. WA and fluoxetine prolonged survival times in wildtype and mutants under osmotic stress. WA but not fluoxetine increased lifespan of all heat-stressed C. elegans strains except DA2100. Furthermore, WA but not fluoxetine extended lifespan in all non-stressed C. elegans strains. WA also induced mRNA expression of serotonin receptors and transporters in wildtype and mutants. WA bound with higher affinity and lower pKi values to all C. elegans and human serotonin receptors and transporters than serotonin, indicating that WA may competitively displaced serotonin from the binding pockets of these proteins. CONCLUSION: WA reduced stress and increased lifespan by ROS scavenging and interference with the serotonin system. Hence, WA may serve as promising candidate to treat depression.","Naß, Janine; Abdelfatah, Sara; Efferth, Thomas",Phytomedicine,,401
490856,Fever and cough are two important factors in identifying patients with the Covid-19: A meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hemoptysis is a frequent and sometimes fatal complication of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease. The risk factors for hemoptysis are not well understood. In the current study, potential risk factors for hemoptysis were investigated in patients with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease, which is the most common NTM in Japan. METHODS: Medical records from the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center were reviewed. Consecutive patients with MAC lung disease diagnosed in 2014 and followed up for more than 1 year in the hospital were included in the study. Hemoptysis was confirmed between 2014 and 2016. The characteristics of patients with hemoptysis and non-hemoptysis at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease were obtained from the medical records, and the two groups were compared. The radiological findings assessed included nodules, infiltration shadows, cavities, and bronchiectasis. Each was classified and scored individually in six lung fields, and these data were used to generate radiological scores. RESULTS: The study included 82 patients with MAC lung disease, 18 with hemoptysis and 64 without. Higher total radiological severity score at the time of the initial diagnosis of MAC was associated with an increased risk of hemoptysis. Among the radiological scores, infiltration and cavities were marginally associated with the risk of hemoptysis. CONCLUSIONS: The radiological severity score at the time of initial diagnosis of MAC lung disease was associated with hemoptysis.","Minomo, Shojiro; Kobayashi, Takehiko; Katayama, Kanako; Ryuge, Misaki; Kagawa, Tomoko; Tsuyuguchi, Kazunari; Matsui, Hideo; Suzuki, Katsuhiro",Respiratory investigation (Online),,401

Here, we present the oropharyngeal microbiota characteristics identified by shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of oropharynx swab specimens from 31 COVID-19 patients, 29 influenza B patients, and 28 healthy controls. Our results revealed a distinct oropharyngeal microbiota composition in the COVID-19 patients, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Veillonella and Megasphaera and depletion of Pseudopropionibacterium, Rothia, and Streptococcus. Based on the relative abundance of the oropharyngeal microbiome, we built a microbial classifier to distinguish COVID-19 patients from flu patients and healthy controls with an AUC of 0.889, in which Veillonella was identified as the most prominent biomarker for COVID-19 group. Several members of the genus Veillonella, especially Veillonella parvula which was highly enriched in the oropharynx of our COVID-19 patients, were also overrepresented in the BALF of COVID-19 patients, indicating that the oral cavity acts as a natural reservoir for pathogens to induce co-infections in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. We also found the increased ratios of Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter sp., and Serratia sp. were correlated with both disease severity and elevated systemic inflammation markers (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, NLR), suggesting that these oropharynx microbiota alterations may impact COVID-19 severity by influencing the inflammatory response. Moreover, the oropharyngeal microbiome of COVID-19 patients exhibited a significant enrichment in amino acid metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism. In addition, all 26 drug classes of antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in the COVID-19 group, and were significantly enriched in critical cases. In conclusion, we found that oropharyngeal microbiota alterations and functional differences were associated with COVID-19 severity.","Ma, Shengli; Zhang, Fan; Zhou, Fengxia; Li, Hui; Ge, Wenyu; Gan, Rui; Nie, Huan; Li, Biao; Wang, Yindong; Wu, Meng; Li, Duo; Wang, Dongmei; Wang, Zheng; You, Yuhong; Huang, Zhiwei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,401

492640,Assessing the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 disease based on a predictive tree model: A retrospective cohort study,2021,"Introduction: Prognosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients with vascular risk factors, and certain comorbidities is worse. The impact of chronic neurological disorders (CND) on prognosis is unclear. We evaluated if the presence of CND in Covid-19 patients is a predictor of a higher in-hospital mortality. As secondary endpoints, we analyzed the association between CND, Covid-19 severity, and laboratory abnormalities during admission. Methods: Retrospective cohort study that included all the consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. The study setting was Hospital Clínico, tertiary academic hospital from Valladolid. CND was defined as those neurological conditions causing permanent disability. We assessed demography, clinical variables, Covid-19 severity, laboratory parameters and outcome. The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality, evaluated by multivariate cox-regression log rank test. We analyzed the association between CND, covid-19 severity and laboratory abnormalities. Results: We included 576 patients, 43.3% female, aged 67.2 years in mean. CND were present in 105 (18.3%) patients. Patients with CND were older, more disabled, had more vascular risk factors and comorbidities and fewer clinical symptoms of Covid-19. They presented 1.43 days earlier to the emergency department. Need of ventilation support was similar. Presence of CND was an independent predictor of death (HR 2.129, 95% CI: 1.382–3.280) but not a severer Covid-19 disease (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.970–3.158). Frequency of laboratory abnormalities was similar, except for procalcitonin and INR. Conclusions: The presence of CND is an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. That was not explained neither by a worse immune response to Covid-19 nor by differences in the level of care received by patients with CND.","García-Azorín, David; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Trigo, Javier; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Talavera, Blanca; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Guerrero, Ángel; Ezpeleta, David; Peñarrubia, María Jesús; Gómez-Herreras, Jose Ignacio; Bustamante-Munguira, Elena; Abad-Molina, Cristina; Orduña-Domingo, Antonio; Ruiz-Martin, Guadalupe; Jiménez-Cuenca, María Isabel; Juarros, Santiago; del Pozo-Vegas, Carlos; Dueñas-Gutierrez, Carlos; de Paula, Jose María Prieto; Cantón-Álvarez, Belén; Vicente, Jose Manuel; Arenillas, Juan Francisco",Front.

This paper highlights that the efficacy of Great Britain’s electricity market design in facilitating net zero is inadequate and must be reconfigured. The rules of the current electricity market design are remnants of an electricity sector dominated by large-scale, centralised, fossil fuel technologies. Therefore, routes to market for the provision of necessary services to support net zero, not least flexibility, are largely inaccessible for distributed energy resources and, despite their benefits to the system, are thus undervalued. Based upon a review and consolidation of 30 proposed electricity market designs from liberalised electricity sectors, this paper proposes a new electricity market design for Great Britain. This design is presented alongside a new institutional framework to aid in the efficient operation of the market. Specifically, this paper proposes a new local balancing and coordinating market located at each grid supply point (the transmission and distribution interface). This is realised through the implementation of a distributed locational marginal pricing structure which is governed by the evolution of the current distributed network operator, known as the distributed service provider (DSP). The DSP also operates a local balancing and ancillary market for their geographical area. The wholesale market is reconfigured to coordinate with these new local markets and to harmonise the actors across the distribution and transmission network. © 2021 by the authors.

495989,Novel Percutaneous Tracheostomy for Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2020,"Background. Despite the danger of infection during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, many patients still need surgical treatment. Most elective surgeries were delayed because of the public health emergency. However, when patients have life-threatening emergencies or illnesses, surgeries are often needed as soon as possible. Moreover, due to hospital overcrowding during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals initially struggled to address the issue due to a lack of experience. This is especially true for day surgery centers with higher patient mobility. Methods. We remodeled pathways to separate patients and medical personnel to minimize the COVID-19 infection rate. Further, strategies for medical staff education and potential patient education, ward disinfection and maintenance, setup with 3 more screening stations, patient and companion management, medical staff management, and perioperative management were implemented before starting elective day surgery. Results. From February 11 to March 11 in 2020, 202 day surgeries were performed. These were all elective surgeries and included ultrasound-guided Mammotome biopsy, endoscopic polypectomy, hernia repair, pediatric surgeries, cholecystectomy, choledochoscopy, radical mastectomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage, liver biopsy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopic resection of colon cancer, colostomy apotheosis, and varicose vein surgery. On days 7, 14, and 30 after discharge, no postoperative complications were reported or infection of COVID-19 cases was reported. Conclusions. Using scientific and well-designed protocols, day surgery can ensure quality surgical care with while ensuring medical safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. These protocols may also be applied to other surgical departments in China.","Jiang, Lisha; Ma, Hongsheng",Surg Innov,,401

496793,Changes in in-hospital mortality in the first wave of COVID-19: a multicentre prospective observational cohort study using the WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK,2021,"Purpose: Since 2008 Sweden has had a structured first-line face-to-face knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) treatment program, BOA (Better management of OsteoArthritis). However, records show that this face-to-face program is underutilized and reaches only a minority of those that would benefit from it. The first-line OA management program has been transformed into a digital version, Joint Academy® (JA), to facilitate implementation, scaling, increased accessibility, and improved patient adherence. The smartphone application consists of video instructions distributed daily with individualized exercises for participants with knee or hip OA, as well as educational information on OA symptoms and self-management based on current international guidelines for the management of OA. Each participant is assigned to a physical therapist available through asynchronous chat and telephone who supervises the participant throughout the whole program. To improve chronically ill patients' health and quality of life, long-standing and continuous treatment is needed at an acceptable cost. Recent evidence suggests that JA costs 25% compared to the BOA program for three months of treatment. Providing patients with equal access to care necessitates availability in urban and rural areas alike. This can potentially be achieved by digital delivery, but it is yet unknown if digital delivery of first-line OA treatment, compared with face-to-face, improves equal access to care. The purpose of this study was to compare utilization of digital and face-to-face delivered OA treatment in the 21 different county councils of Sweden that are responsible for providing healthcare to the residents. Methods: Registered patient participation in the BOA program during 2019 and 2020 was retrieved from the BOA annual reports and live statistics from the BOA website (for 2020, unknown final data retrieval data). Data from digital program participation was retrieved from the JA database (for 2020 until Nov 18th). To be included, a patient needed to have registered for the first visit in the BOA registry or have enrolled in the program by answering the first questionnaire in the JA registry. Population density per county and county size were retrieved from Statistics Sweden. Results were calculated and presented as users per 100 000 residents. Mean and median values as well as standard deviations were calculated separately for registered participants/100 000 for BOA and JA programs, and for regions with more (n=12) or less (n=8) than 20 residents per km2. Results: In total 25652 patients from the BOA registry and 12240 patients from the JA database were included. The differences between individual county councils in the number of registered program participants per 100 000 residents varied far more for the face-to-face BOA program than for the digital JA program (Table 1). This is illustrated by the ratio between the highest and lowest participation numbers/100 000 being 13.6 for BOA and 2.6 for JA, and standard deviations of 162 and 27, respectively. The variability between county councils was greater for remote regions of the country with a population density below 20 per km2, than for more densely populated regions. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary report suggest that digital first-line treatment, compared with the same treatment delivered face-to-face, improves equal access to recommended first-line care of OA of the knee and hip in Sweden. Ongoing work aims to explore temporal changes in usage of the different platforms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

497175,Development of a machine learning algorithm to predict intubation among hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"While COVID-19 has generated a massive burden of illness worldwide, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been disproportionately exposed to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection. During the so-called 'first wave', infection rates among this population group have ranged between 10% and 20%, raising as high as one in every four COVID-19 patients in Spain at the peak of the crisis. Now that many countries are already dealing with new waves of COVID-19 cases, a potential competition between HCW and non-HCW patients for scarce resources can still be a likely clinical scenario. In this paper, we address the question of whether HCW who become ill with COVID-19 should be prioritised in diagnostic, treatment or resource allocation protocols. We will evaluate some of the proposed arguments both in favour and against the prioritisation of HCW and also consider which clinical circumstances might warrant prioritising HCW and why could it be ethically appropriate to do so. We conclude that prioritising HCW's access to protective equipment, diagnostic tests or even prophylactic or therapeutic drug regimes and vaccines might be ethically defensible. However, prioritising HCWs to receive intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilators is a much more nuanced decision, in which arguments such as instrumental value or reciprocity might not be enough, and economic and systemic values will need to be considered.","Real de Asua, Diego; Fins, Joseph J",J. med. ethics,,401
497908,Is Low Dose Aspirin Effective in Reducing In-hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19?,2021,"The massive shock of the COVID-19 pandemic is already showing its negative effects on economies around the world, unprecedented in recent history. COVID-19 infections and containment measures have caused a general slowdown in research and new knowledge production. Because of the link between R&D spending and economic growth, it is to be expected then that a slowdown in research activities will slow in turn the global recovery from the pandemic. Many recent studies also claim an uneven impact on scientific production across gender. In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon across countries, analysing preprint depositions. Differently from other works, that compare the number of preprint depositions before and after the pandemic outbreak, we analyse the depositions trends across geographical areas, and contrast after-pandemic depositions with expected ones. Differently from common belief and initial evidence, in few countries female scientists increased their scientific output while males plunged.","Abramo, Giovanni; D'Angelo, Ciriaco Andrea; Mele, Ida",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05360v1.pdf,401
497909,Is Low Dose Aspirin Effective in Reducing In-hospital Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Covid-19?,2021,"In this work, the relationships between air quality and pollutant emissions were investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic in Shandong Province. During the quarantine period (from January 24 to February 7, 2020), the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants decreased significantly relative to the period before controls were imposed (from January 15 to 23, 2020). Specifically, except for an increase in the concentration of O3, concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO decreased for 72.6 µg·m-3 (45.86%), 47.4 µg·m-3(41.24%), 25.6 µg·m-3 (58.00%), 3.0 µg·m-3 (17.71%), and 0.5 mg·m-3 (31.40%), respectively. RAMS-CMAQ simulation showed that meteorological diffusion had an essential role in improving air quality. Influenced by meteorological factors, emissions of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced 26.04%, 33.03%, 28.35%, 43.27%, and 23.29%, respectively. Furthermore, the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO were reduced by 19.82%, 8.21%, 29.65%, -25.56%, and 8.12%, respectively, due to pollution emissions reductions during the quarantine period. O3 concentrations increased by 20.51% during quarantine, caused by both meteorological factors (10.47%) and human activities (10.04%). These results indicate that primary pollutants were more sensitive to emissions reductions; however, secondary pollutants demonstrated a lagged response the emissions reduction and were significantly affected by meteorological factors. The linear relationship between ozone and the emissions reduction was not significant, and was inverse overall. Further investigation are now required on the impact of emissions reduction on ozone pollution control.","Liu, Hou-Feng; Xu, Wei; Wei, Min; Sui, Xiao; Xu, Peng-Ju; Li, Ming-Yan; Zhang, Mei-Gen",Huan Jing Ke Xue,,401
499362,"Assessing the age specificity of infection fatality rates for COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and public policy implications",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical and laboratory characteristics of the Saudi children with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: Eighty-eight children (0-14 years) with COVID-19 who were admitted to Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from April to June 2020 were recruited. RESULTS: Mean age was 5.74 ± 4.7 years with 41 (49.4%) males and 42 (50.6%) females. The length of hospital stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 17 days. The main source of infection was infected family members. Mean values of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were noticeably above normal. Degree of severity and length of stay was significantly correlated with lymphopenia (r= -0.36; p=0.001), whereas it was positively correlated with absolute neutrophil count and with high inflammatory markers, such as CRP, LDH, and others. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the Saudi children with confirmed COVID-19 will improve understanding of this disease's presentation and will help put rapid and proper management strategies into place to face this pandemic. A high index of suspicion is needed for cases presenting with multi-system inflammatory disease, which represented 5.7% of the included study population.","Shahin, Walaa; Rabie, Walaa; Alyossof, Osama; Alasiri, Mohammed; Alfaki, Mohamed; Mahmoud, Elamin; Hijazi, Muwaffak; Faraidi, Huda El; Alahmari, Hassan",Saudi Med J,,401

However, dialysis supplies and personnel are often limited. METHODS: Using data from adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients from five hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System who were admitted from March 10th and December 26th, 2020, we developed and validated several models (logistic regression, LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost (with and without imputation)) for predicting treatment with dialysis or death at various time horizons (1, 3, 5 and 7 days) following hospital admission. Patients admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital were used for internal validation while the other hospitals were part of the external validation cohort. Features included demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory and vitals signs within 12 hour of hospital admission. RESULTS: 6093 patients (2,442 in training and 3,651 in external validation) were included in the final cohort. Of the different model approaches used, XGBoost without imputation had the highest area under the receiver curve on internal validation (range of 0.93-0.98) and area under the precision recall curve (range of 0.78-0.82 across) for all time points. XGBoost without imputation also had the highest test parameters on external validation (AUROC range 0.85 to 0.87, and AUPRC range of 0.27 to 0.54) across all time windows. XGBoost without imputation outperformed all models with higher precision and recall (mean difference in AUROC of 0.04 and mean difference in AUPRC of 0.15). Features of creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen, and Red cell distribution width were major drivers of model's prediction. CONCLUSIONS: An XGBoost model without imputation for prediction of a composite outcome of either death or dialysis in COVID positive patients had the best performance compared to standard and other machine learning models.","Vaid, Akhil; Chan, Lili; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Jaladanki, Suraj; Paranjpe, Ishan; Russak, Adam; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Levin, Matthew; He, John; Bottinger, Erwin; Charney, Alexander; Fayad, Zahi; Coca, Steven; Glicksberg, Benjamin; Nadkarni, Girish",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,,401
500043,Comment to: Intensive support recommendations for critically-ill patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes-such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic-the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students' mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education.","Browning, Matthew H E M; Larson, Lincoln R; Sharaievska, Iryna; Rigolon, Alessandro; McAnirlin, Olivia; Mullenbach, Lauren; Cloutier, Scott; Vu, Tue M; Thomsen, Jennifer; Reigner, Nathan; Metcalf, Elizabeth Covelli; D039,; Antonio, Ashley; Helbich, Marco; Bratman, Gregory N; Alvarez, Hector Olvera",PLoS One,,401

Because of the complex pathogenesis, high infectivity, and high fatality rate of COVID-19, there are no effective treatments for this epidemic at present. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long clinical history in the prevention and treatment of such acute infectious diseases. The therapeutic effect of Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) on this new coronary pneumonia has attracted the attention of all walks of life, and relevant research reports continue to appear. Here, we intend to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of LHQW in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We will search each database from the built-in until Dec 2020. The English literature mainly search the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science, while the Chinese literature come from CNKI, VIP, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD), and Wan Fang database. Simultaneously, we will retrieve clinical registration tests. This study only screens the RCT of LHQW against COVID-19 and evaluates its efficacy and safety. We will use the Cochrane Handbook to systematically review interventions to assess the risk of bias. The protocol will be reported according to the approach and preferred report items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA - P). Finally, RevMan software version 5.3 will be used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review and meta-analysis aim to review and pool current clinical outcomes of LHQW for treating COVID-19.

503126,The Impact of Vitamin D Level on COVID-19 Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic created pressure to attempt remote consultation, but there are limited data on the use of telepsychiatry in general, and almost none about the experience of telepsychiatry in a consultation-liaison context. OBJECTIVE: We looked for attributes that correlated with satisfactory tele-encounters. METHODS: Eleven consultation-liaison attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March to June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: A vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty in using the platform was less common for female patients (odds ratio = 0.239, P = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 9.059, P < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (odds ratio = 0.189, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it. However, abrupt transition to the use of telepsychiatry to limit contagion risk was mostly satisfactory in our center; identifying for which patient encounters it is most and least appropriate will help guide future use.","Cheung, Stephanie G; Capote, Justin; Fan, Weijia; Mishkin, Adrienne D",,,401

503836,Reply to: Lactate-dehydrogenase associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 patients admitted to a system of community hospitals in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patient data collected from the routine care of COVID-19 patients. SETTING: System of >180 acute-care facilities in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All admitted patients with positive identification of COVID-19 and a documented discharge as of May 12, 2020. METHODS: Determination of demographic characteristics, vital signs at admission, patient comorbidities and recorded discharge disposition in this population to construct a logistic regression estimating the odds of mortality, particular for those patients characterized as not being critically ill at admission. RESULTS: In total, 6,180 COVID-19+ patients were identified as of May 12, 2020. Most COVID-19+ patients (4,808, 77.8%) were admitted directly to a medical-surgical unit with no documented critical care or mechanical ventilation within 8 hours of admission. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and vital signs at admission in this subgroup, the largest driver of the odds of mortality was patient age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08; P < .001). Decreased oxygen saturation at admission was associated with increased odds of mortality (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12; P < .001) as was diabetes (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.21-2.03; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of factors observable at admission that are associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients who are initially admitted to non-critical care units may help care providers, hospital epidemiologists, and hospital safety experts better plan for the care of these patients.","Sands, Kenneth E; Wenzel, Richard P; McLean, Laura E; Korwek, Kimberly M; Roach, Jonathon D; Miller, Karla M; Poland, Russell E; Burgess, L Hayley; Jackson, Edmund S; Perlin, Jonathan B",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,401

The patient presented with acute ataxia, rapidly developed encephalopathy, and autoimmune encephalitis was suspected. Steroid treatment was withheld because of lymphopenia and intravenous immunoglobulin was started. The absence of clinical response prompted plasmapheresis and, when lymphocyte counts improved, pulse steroid treatment was applied. The latter was followed by significant improvement and the patient was discharged in a conscious and ambulatory state. Autoimmune encephalitis should be considered in the presence of neurological symptoms accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infection and steroid treatment should be preferred unless limited by contraindications.","Sarigecili, Esra; Arslan, Ilknur; Ucar, Habibe Koc; Celik, Umit",Childs nerv. syst,,401

The types of response of the immune system to the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 with the start of the inflammation process are considered. The situation is analyzed in detail in which the growing autoimmune inflammation (up to the development of a ""cytokine storm"") affects not only the pulmonary parenchyma, but also the endothelium of the small vessels of the lungs. Simultaneous damage to the alveoli and microthrombosis of the pulmonary vessels are accompanied by a progressive impairment of gas exchange, the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the treatment of which, even with the use of invasive ventilation, is ineffective and does not really change the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In order to interrupt the pathological process at the earliest stages of the disease, the necessity of proactive anti-inflammatory therapy in combination with active anticoagulation treatment is substantiated. The results of the first randomized studies on the use of inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (interleukin-6 (tocilizumab), interleukin-17 (secukinumab), Janus kinase blockers, through which the signal is transmitted to cells (ruxolitinib)), which have potential in the early treatment of COVID- 19. The use of a well-known anti-inflammatory drug colchicine (which is used for gout treatment) in patients with COVID-19 is considered. The design of the original COLORIT comparative study on the use of colchicine, ruxolitinib and secukinumab in the treatment of COVID-19 is presented.

Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with COVID-19 who referred to medical centers under the supervision of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from February 22 to March 25, 2020. The final date of follow-up was April 19, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Clinical laboratory, radiological, treatment, and demographic data were collected and analyzed. The associations among gender, immune disease, diabetes, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic nervous disease, type of treatment, and risk of death were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests were used to estimate survival rate and compare survival rates, respectively. Results: The total number of deaths or desired event in the study was 329 (10.3%).The risk of death in the age groups of 50-60 years, 60-70 years, and >70 years compared to the 30-40 age group was 2.17 (95% CI: 1.03, 4.55; p: 0.040); 3.72 (95 % CI: 1.80, 7.68; p: 0.001) and 5.09 (95 % CI: 2.49, 10.40; p: 0.001), respectively. The results showed men had 11.5% more risk of deaths than women (HR: 1.11; 95 % CI: 0.89, 1.39; p: 0.341). Kidney disease increased the risk of death by 52.3% in these patients, which was not statistically significant (HR: 1.78; 95 % CI: 1.04, 3.04; p: 0.035). Also, chronic pulmonary diseases and diabetes increased the risk of death in COVID-19 patients by 89.5% and 41.3% compared to COVID-19 patients without chronic pulmonary diseases and diabetes [(HR: 1.89; 95 % CI: 1.17, 3.04; p: 0.008), (HR: 1.41; 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.96; p: 0.038)]. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, more attention and care should be paid to COVID-19 patients with underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and kidney disease to reduce the number of deaths.","Eshrati, Babak; Baradaran, Hamid Reza; Erfanpoor, Saeed; Mohazzab, Arash; Moradi, Yousef",Med J Islam Repub Iran,,401

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Study of maximum and minimum principal stresses in models with natural teeth and artificial crowns supported by dental implants, taking into account the coefficient of friction using the finite element analysis. RESULTS: In models represented by fixed partial dentures supported by dental implants and a natural tooth, the maximum tensile stresses arise in the cortical bone in the cervical region of the artificial crown, and the maximum compressive stresses occur both in the cortical layer in the cervical region of the artificial crown and in the cervical region of the tooth. In models with two fixed partial dentures supported by dental implants or two natural teeth, the stress distributions in the cortical layers in the upper and lower jaw are almost identical. CONCLUSION: Modeling the antagonist and adding to the FEA model is important in order to determine the precise and realistic direction of the resulting force vector. Amplification of the number of contact areas should be considered when modeling the occlusal surface of artificial crowns supported by dental implants.","Gvetadze, R Sh; Strekalov, A A; Smerdov, A A",Stomatologiia (Mosk),,401

NPI effect on the transmission of other respiratory viruses has not been examined at the national level thus far. Methods Upper respiratory tract specimens from 3580 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), collected within the nationwide German ARI Sentinel, underwent RT-PCR diagnostics for multiple respiratory viruses. The observation period (weeks 1-38 of 2020) included the time before, during and after a far-reaching contact ban. Detection rates for different viruses were compared to 2017-2019 sentinel data (15350 samples;week 1-38, 11823 samples). Findings The March 2020 contact ban, which was followed by a mask mandate, was associated with an unprecedented and sustained decline of multiple respiratory viruses. Among these, rhinovirus was the single agent that resurged to levels equalling those of previous years. Rhinovirus rebound was first observed in children, after schools and daycares had reopened. By contrast, other nonenveloped viruses (i.e. gastroenteritis viruses reported at the national level) suppressed after the shutdown did not rebound. Interpretation Contact restrictions with a subsequent mask mandate in spring may substantially reduce respiratory virus circulation. This reduction appears sustained for most viruses, indicating that the activity of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the subsequent winter season might be low,whereas rhinovirus resurgence, potentially driven by transmission in educational institutions in a setting of waning population immunity, might signal predominance of rhinovirus-related ARIs.

So far, gas exchange has been examined using transcutaneously measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this structured investigation, arterial blood gas analysis in a 30-year-old female resident was carried out during a 13-hour day shift on the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria. An FFP3 mask (3MTM AuraTM) with an exhalation valve was continuously worn, except for 1 break of 20 min. Arterial blood samples were obtained before putting on the PPE, and after 5 h, 9 h and 13 h of working in the contaminated area. RESULTS: During the multi-hour wearing time, an increase in PaCO2 (the baseline value: 29.3 mm Hg, the max. value: 38.9 mm Hg) and a continuous decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2, the baseline value: 102 mm Hg, the min. value: 80.8 mm Hg) was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: All measured values were within the normal range, but a trend towards an insufficient gas exchange could be suspected.","Fantin, Raffaella",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,401

518018,Reply: Optimal Respiratory Assistance Strategy for Patients with COVID-19,2020,"Preventive and control measures implemented by many countries to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact medication and chronic disease management, which can interfere with achieving patients' therapeutic goals. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on these aspects, while exploring the role of community pharmacists. A cross-sectional study was conducted via a web-based questionnaire that targeted individuals who suffer from chronic diseases in Jordan. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling and were asked to self-report their ability to access medication, and the perceived role of community pharmacists. Among the 431 participants, the mean age ± SD (years) was 53.8 ± 13.7 and 60.1% (n= 259) were females. Participants mainly reported difficulties in accessing medication (n=198, 45.9%), reduced supplies or unavailability of medications (n=213, 49.4%), nonadherence to medications due to lack of access (n=98, 22.7%) and high costs (n=85, 19.7%). Participants avoided follow-ups due to a fear of infection (n=367, 82.5%) or prolonged waiting time in clinics (n=322, 74.7%). An increased reliance on the community pharmacy for medical advice was reported by 39.9% (n=172) of the participants, with half of them (n=217, 50.3%) depending on the pharmacists for advice regarding over-the-counter medications and COVID-19-related information (n=119, 27.6%). There is an urgent need to involve community pharmacists in medication and chronic disease management with a focus on patient adherence to ensure the optimal management of such vulnerable patient groups. Future studies to assess the effect of pharmacists' contributions towards enhancing medication/disease management are warranted.","Akour, Amal; Elayeh, Eman; Tubeileh, Razan; Hammad, Alaa; Ya039,; Acoub, Rawan; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B",Pathog Glob Health,,401

519654,Erratum: Association of Black Race with Outcomes in COVID-19 Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019 in China, which later developed into a pandemic, has forced different countries to implement strict sanitary regimes and social distancing measures. Globally, at least four billion people were under lockdown, working remotely, homeschooling children, and facing challenges coping with quarantine and the stressful events. The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1097), conducted during a nationwide quarantine, aimed to assess whether nutritional and consumer habits have been affected under these conditions. Over 43.0% and nearly 52% reported eating and snacking more, respectively, and these tendencies were more frequent in overweight and obese individuals. Almost 30% and over 18% experienced weight gain (mean ± SD 3.0 ± 1.6 kg) and loss (-2.9 ± 1.5 kg), respectively. Overweight, obese, and older subjects (aged 36-45 and >45) tended to gain weight more frequently, whereas those with underweight tended to lose it further. Increased BMI was associated with less frequent consumption of vegetables, fruit, and legumes during quarantine, and higher adherence to meat, dairy, and fast-foods. An increase in alcohol consumption was seen in 14.6%, with a higher tendency to drink more found among alcohol addicts. Over 45% of smokers experienced a rise in smoking frequency during the quarantine.

519790,"Early echocardiographic findings in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective, single center study",2021,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019 in China and was soon declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Many elective and nonessential surgeries were postponed worldwide in an effort to minimize spread of disease, as well as to conserve resources. Our goal with this article is to review current practice guidelines in setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on available data and literature. METHODS: Websites pertaining to surgical and medical societies, and government agencies were reviewed, along with recently published literature to identify recommendations related to COVID-19 and plastic surgery procedures. RESULTS: Clinical practice modifications are recommended during the pandemic in outpatient and perioperative settings. Use of personal protective equipment is critical for aerosol-generating procedures, such as surgery in the head and neck area. Care for trauma and malignancy should continue during the pandemic; however, definitive reconstruction could be delayed for select cases. Specific recommendations were made for surgical treatment of cancer, trauma, and semiurgent reconstructive procedures based on available data and literature. CONCLUSIONS: The risk and benefit of each reconstructive procedure should be carefully analyzed in relation to necessary patient care, minimized COVID-19 spread, protection of health care personnel, and utilization of resources. Recommendations in this article should be taken in the context of each institute's resources and prevalance of COVID-19 in the region. It should be emphasized that the guidelines provided are a snapshot of current practices and are subject to change as the pandemic continues to evolve.","Ozturk, Cemile Nurdan; Kuruoglu, Doga; Ozturk, Can; Rampazzo, Antonio; Gurunian Gurunluoglu, Raffi",Ann Plast Surg,,401

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Nine women with absolute uterine factor infertility and their male partners participated. INTERVENTION(S): Psychosocial evaluations using questionnaires focusing on health-related quality-of-life, mood, relationship, and fertility-related quality-of-life were conducted at 2- and 3-year follow-up after transplantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Scores were obtained on the validated questionnaires 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and Fertility Quality of life measuring health-related quality-of-life, mood, relationship, and infertility-associated life quality, respectively. RESULT(S): There was a reversible decrease (at year 2) in the physical component of SF-36 concerning recipients, but not in partners. Negative deviations in the mental component of SF-36 were seen in four recipients, and in two of their partners at year 3, possibly related to the fact that live birth had not been achieved yet among three of these women. Childlessness also seemed to be related to reporting elevated anxiety scores. Most recipients and partners stated high satisfaction with marital relationship both at inclusion and at follow-up. CONCLUSION(S): The results of the present study show that even if the baseline psychosocial characteristics of the women to undergo transplantation and their partners were stable and equal or better compared with norm populations, graft failure and failure to achieve parenthood will pose psychological strains on couples in the period up to 3 years after transplantation. Psychological counseling should be offered past 3 years for recipients and their partners.

520610,Prevalence of Obesity and Its Impact on Outcome in Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"AIM: To evaluate the impact of a psychoeducational, mobile health intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based approaches on the mental health of healthcare workers at the frontline against COVID-19 in Spain. DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

522248,Evaluating a Widely Implemented Proprietary Deterioration Index Model among Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Centres for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) reports that there are limited data and information about the impact of underlying medical conditions and the risk of infection. To date, there are no studies that report on the risk of infection among patients with haematological diseases or abnormalities. This cross-sectional study reports on the baseline complete blood count in patients attending publicly funded primary care settings with a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infections in the state of Qatar. The study will report on the descriptive characteristics of the population, including gender, age and prior abnormalities to their blood test results. We will compare the results of those with positive and negative PCR test results, where appropriate. Nine hundred sixty-two adult patients attended publicly funded primary health care settings in the state of Qatar between February the 10th and April the 30th 2020 with a diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infections had prior recorded blood investigations in the last six months and were included in this study. The population was young, mean of age is 38.8±11.6. (Median: 36 [Min: 19 - Max: 85]). Complete blood count of the sample had minimal missing data points. Females were more presented in our samples, Female (n=560, 58.21%) and Male (n=402, 41.79%). Most of our sample had a documented PCR test result, negative (n=831, 86.38%); positive (n=123, 12.79%) and missing (n=8, 0.83%). Low haemoglobin values (n=265, 27.5%) and low red blood cell count (n =170, 17.7%) were the most prevalent complete blood count abnormality in the population. Leukopenia was less common (n=50, 8.2%). Most of the population had normal platelet count (n=895, 93%). Gender was the most influential factor in our sample to increase the odds of having a positive PCR test results; males were more likely to be affected (P<0.001, Chi-square test) (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.73-3.77). Categories for haematological abnormalities were not associated with increased risk of having a positive PCT test result. In a population attending primary healthcare settings with early presentation of symptoms of COVID-19 infection, the risk of infection among our cohort was not affected by the prior haematological values of those patients. Gender was the most influential parameter in the risk of infection in our population. Analysis of the results using gender-specific categories for different haematological parameters suggested that patients with abnormal haematological values were not at increased risk of having a positive COVID-19 infection.","Hamed, Ehab; Syed, Mohamed Ahmed; Alnuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; Soliman, Mohammed; Alemrayat, Bayan; Muktar, Amina Ali Mohamed; AlFehaidi, AlAnoud Saleh; AlQotba, Hamda Abdulla",Hematol Rep,,401

The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with epidemiologic and clinical features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in India. This is a descriptive case series of the first 21 COVID-19 infected patients confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and admitted to a tertiary care centre in India from 01.02.2020 to 19.03.2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including age, sex, nationality, travel history, symptoms, duration of stay, and comorbidities. The mean age of the population was 40.3 years with a male preponderance. Thirteen (62%) patients had recent travel history outside India in the previous 30 days, two thirds of whom had travelled to Italy. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (42.9%) followed by sore throat, headache and breathlessness. Vital and laboratory parameters were preserved in all patients and none of them required ventilatory support. Among the first 21 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in India, the typical clinical presentation consisted in a mild upper respiratory tract infection predominantly affecting the young male population. One patient required supplemental oxygen. All patients recovered with no residual symptoms. *The Safdarjung Hospital COVID 2019 working group: Nitesh Gupta, Sumita Agrawal, Pranav Ish, Suruchi Mishra, Rajni Gaind, Ganapathy Usha, Balvinder Singh, Manas Kamal Sen, Shibdas Chakrabarti (Consultant and Head, Pulmonary Medicine); NK Gupta (Professor, Pulmonary medicine); Dipak Bhattacharya (Consultant, Pulmonary medicine); Rohit Kumar (Assistant Professor, Pulmonary Medicine); Siddharth R.

Une dizaine de candidats vaccins sont au stade de développement clinique. La vaccination des soignants présenterait l’intérêt de les protéger, de protéger leur entourage et leurs patients. L’objectif de notre étude est d’évaluer l’intention de se faire vacciner des professionnels de santé en fonction de leur catégorie. Matériels et méthodes Réalisation d’autoquestionnaire en ligne et en version papier, diffusé sur les réseaux sociaux, le site internet de l’établissement, et au centre de prélèvement COVID-19 de l’établissement du 26 mars 2020 au premier juin. Le critère principal de jugement est l’intention de se faire vacciner contre le COVID-19 si un vaccin existait. Résultats Deux mille quarante-sept professionnels de santé ont répondu aux questionnaires : 431 médecins (21,1 %), 501 pharmaciens (24,5 %), 371 infirmiers (IDE) (18,1 %), 218 aides-soignants (AS) (10,6 %), 37 sages-femmes (SF) (1,8 %), 24 kinésithérapeutes (MKDE) (1,2 %), 465 autres professionnels de santé (22,7 %). Parmi eux 1515 étaient des femmes (74 %), 465 (22,7 %) étaient âgés de moins de 30 ans, 969 de 30 à 49 ans (47,3 %), 549 de 50 à 65 ans (26,8 %), et 45 de plus de 65 ans (3,1 %). Cinq cent trente et un professionnels (25,9 %) avaient des critères d’hésitation vaccinale. Parmi ces professionnels de santé, 1574 (76,9 %) seraient prêts à se faire vacciner si un vaccin était disponible immédiatement. Le pourcentage de professionnels avec l’intention de se faire vacciner contre le COVID-19 varie significativement selon la catégorie : 95,8 % chez les kinésithérapeutes, 92,1 % chez les médecins, 88,8 % chez les pharmaciens, 70,3 % chez les SF, 67,1 % chez les autres professions de santé, 64,7 % chez les IDE et 60,1 % chez les AS, et chez les autres professionnels de santé (p <0,005). Les facteurs associés avec l’intention de se faire vacciner sont le genre masculin, avoir peur du COVID, se percevoir à risque d’être infecté avec des odds ratio (OR) respectifs de 2,21 (1,69–2,90), 2,03 (1,58–2,61) et 2,09 (1,70–2,57). En comparaison avec les moins de 30 ans, les 50–65 ans, et les plus de 65 ans étaient nettement plus enclins à se faire vacciner avec des OR respectifs de 2,27 (1,68–3,07), et de 3,45 (1,53–7,77). En revanche, l’hésitation vaccinale était négativement associée avec l’intention de se faire vacciner avec un OR de 0,35 (0,27–0,44). En analyse multivariée (après ajustement sur l’âge, le genre, l’hésitation vaccinale, la peur et la perception du risque d’infection), en référence aux médecins, les IDE, AS, SF et autres professionnels de santé étaient moins enclins à se faire vacciner contre le COVID-19 si un vaccin était disponible avec des OR respectifs de 0,42 (0,34–0,53), 0,60 (0,51–0,72), 0,72 (0,58–0,89), p <0,005.

593549,Investigating the Influence of Self-Compassion-Focused Interventions on Posttraumatic Stress: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021-09-24,"Background SARS-CoV-2 serology is used to identify prior infection at individual and at population level. Extended longitudinal studies with multi-timepoint sampling to evaluate dynamic changes in antibody levels are required to identify the time horizon in which these applications of serology are valid, and to explore the longevity of protective humoral immunity. Methods Health care workers were recruited to a prospective cohort study from the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic peak in London, undergoing weekly symptom screen, viral PCR and blood sampling over 16-21 weeks. Serological analysis (n=12,990) was performed using semi quantitative Euroimmun IgG to viral spike S1 domain and Roche total antibody to viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) assays. Comparisons were made to previously reported pseudovirus neutralising antibody measurements. Findings A total of 157/729 (21.5%) participants developed positive SARS-CoV-2 serology by one or other assay, of whom 31.0% were asymptomatic and there were no deaths. Peak Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP measurements correlated (r=0.57, p<0.0001) but only anti S1 measurements correlated with near contemporary pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres (measured at 16-18 weeks, r=0.57, p<0.0001). By 21 weeks of follow-up, 31/143 (21.7%) anti S1 and 6/150 (4.0%) anti-NP measurements reverted to negative. Mathematical modelling suggested faster clearance of anti-S1 compared to anti NP (median half-life of 2.5 weeks versus 4.0 weeks), earlier transition to lower levels of antibody production (median of 8 versus 13 weeks), and greater reductions in relative antibody production rate after the transition (median of 35% versus 50%). Interpretation Mild SARS CoV 2 infection is associated with heterogenous serological responses in Euroimmun anti-S1 and Roche anti-NP assays. Anti-S1 responses showed faster rates of clearance, more rapid transition from high to low level production rate and greater reduction in production rate after this transition. The application of individual assays for diagnostic and epidemiological serology requires validation in time series analysis.","Manisty, C.; Treibel, T. A.; Jensen, M.; Joy, G.; Gupta, R.

METHODS A self-designed questionnaire was used to investigate the RTs who treated COVID-19 patients in 31 provinces, cities and autonomous regions in China. The survey questionnaire included the basic work of RTs, the specific work of the treatment for COVID-19 patients and problems encountered at work. RESULTS A total of 126 questionnaires were issued and 40 valid questionnaires were collected from RTs who treated COVID-19 patients at 22 COVID-19 designated hospitals in 8 provinces and municipalities. This included 7 hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. In their medical team, RTs accounted for 2.9% (1.5%, 6.7%) of medical staff, the working experience of the RTs was about (6.2±5.4) years, the ratio of RTs to beds was about 1:11 (1:5, 1:26), and 85.0% (34/40) of RTs were transferred from other hospitals. 97.5% (39/40) of RTs were involved in formulating individual respiratory care strategies in their medical teams, and they were all involved in the evaluation of respiratory care and decision-making as well as the early identification of deterioration of respiratory function. All RTs [100% (40/40)] indicated that they would actively monitor patients' respiratory status, increase the means and frequency of the monitoring, implement standardized oxygen therapy, prevent ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI), and standardize the management of artificial airway. However, less than 50% of RTs had carried out stress and strain, transpulmonary pressure, partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2), end-expiratory lung volume, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and other respiratory function monitoring. 85% of RTs conducted training and education related to respiratory care and formulated relevant standard operating procedures for their medical teams. More than 90% of RTs led the implementation of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), pulmonary protective mechanical ventilation, prone ventilation, pulmonary rehabilitation, airway management, transfer of critical patients, and other respiratory treatment. CONCLUSIONS RTs performed their professional role fully in the assessment, decision-making, and clinical practice in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, the manpower shortage of RTs is extremely prominent, the practical experience has provided the basis for the future treatment of infectious respiratory diseases and effectively promoted the development of respiratory care in China.","Wang, Peng; Xue, Yang; Dong, Meiling; Zhou, Yongfang; Yang, Yunqin; Kang, Yan; Wang, Bo",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296698/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20210318-00400,401
594730,"Virtual triage and outcomes of diabetic foot complications during Covid-19 pandemic: A retro-prospective, observational cohort study",2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be associated with inoculation dose. This has triggered interest in intubation barrier devices to block droplet exposure; however, aerosol protection with these devices is not known. This study hypothesized that barrier devices reduce aerosol outside of the barrier. METHODS: Aerosol containment in closed, semiclosed, semiopen, and open barrier devices was investigated: (1) “glove box” sealed with gloves and caudal drape, (2) “drape tent” with a drape placed over a frame, (3) “slit box” with armholes and caudal end covered by vinyl slit diaphragms, (4) original “aerosol box,” (5) collapsible “interlocking box,” (6) “simple drape” over the patient, and (7) “no barrier.” Containment was investigated by (1) vapor instillation at manikin’s right arm with video-assisted visual evaluation and (2) submicrometer ammonium sulfate aerosol particles ejected through the manikin’s mouth with ventilation and coughs. Samples were taken from standardized locations inside and around the barriers using a particle counter and a mass spectrometer. Aerosol evacuation from the devices was measured using standard hospital suction, a surgical smoke evacuator, and a Shop-Vac. RESULTS: Vapor experiments demonstrated leakage via arm holes and edges. Only closed and semiclosed devices and the aerosol box reduced aerosol particle counts (median [25th, 75th percentile]) at the operator’s mouth compared to no barrier (combined median 29 [−11, 56], n = 5 vs. 157 [151, 166], n = 5). The other barrier devices provided less reduction in particle counts (133 [128, 137], n = 5). Aerosol evacuation to baseline required 15 min with standard suction and the Shop-Vac and 5 min with a smoke evacuator. CONCLUSIONS: Barrier devices may reduce exposure to droplets and aerosol. With meticulous tucking, the glove box and drape tent can retain aerosol during airway management. Devices that are not fully enclosed may direct aerosol toward the laryngoscopist. Aerosol evacuation reduces aerosol content inside fully enclosed devices. Barrier devices must be used in conjunction with body-worn personal protective equipment.","Fidler, Richard L.; Niedek, Christopher R.; Teng, Justin J.; Sturgeon, Mary E.; Zhang, Qi; Robinowitz, David L.; Hirsch, Jan",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125457/,401

Health Care Personnel (HCP) are at high risk of acquiring MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections first identified in 2003. This study described the similarities and differences in epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 183 confirmed global MERS cases and 98 SARS cases in Taiwan associated with HCP. The epidemiological findings showed that the mean age of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were 40 (24~74) and 49 (2~90) years, respectively, much older than those in SARS [SARS-HCP: 35 (21~68) years, p = 0.006; total SARS: 42 (0~94) years, p = 0.0002]. The case fatality rates (CFR) was much lower in MERS-HCP [7.03% (9/128)] or SARS-HCP [12.24% (12/98)] than the MERS-non-HCP [36.96% (34/92), p<0.001] or SARS-non-HCP [24.50% (61/249), p<0.001], however, no difference was found between MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP [p = 0.181]. In terms of clinical period, the days from onset to death [13 (4~17) vs 14.5 (0~52), p = 0.045] and to discharge [11 (5~24) vs 24 (0~74), p = 0.010] and be hospitalized days [9.5 (3~22) vs 22 (0~69), p = 0.040] were much shorter in MERS-HCP than SARS-HCP. Similarly, days from onset to confirmation were shorter in MERS-HCP than MERS-non-HCP [6 (1~14) vs 10 (1~21), p = 0.044]. In conclusion, the severity of MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP was lower than that of MERS-non-HCP and SARS-non-HCP due to younger age and early confirmation in HCP groups. However, no statistical difference was found in MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP. Thus, prevention of nosocomial infections involving both novel Coronavirus is crucially important to protect HCP.","Liu, Shelan; Chan, Ta-Chien; Chu, Yu-Tseng; Wu, Joseph Tsung-Shu; Geng, Xingyi; Zhao, Na; Cheng, Wei; Chen, Enfu; King, Chwan-Chuen",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26930074/,401
596819,High-Dose Corticosteroid Use and Risk of Hip Osteonecrosis: Meta-Analysis and Systematic Literature Review,2015-04-08,"Since the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), in December 2019, the infection has spread around the globe. Some of the risk factors include social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing with soap, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and dysbiosis. Evidence has shown the incidence of total infection and death rates to be lower in sub-Saharan Africa when compared with North Africa, Europe and North America and many other parts of the world. The higher the metabolic syndrome rate, the higher the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Africa has a lower rate of metabolic syndrome risk than many other continents. This paradox has puzzled several in the biomedical and scientific communities. Published results of research have demonstrated the exciting correlation that the combination of young age of the population coupled with their native plant-based diet has lowered their risk factors. The plant-based diet include whole grains (millet, sorghum), legumes (black-eye peas, dry beans, soybean), vegetables, potato, sweet potato, yams, squash, banana, pumpkin seeds, and moringa leaves, and lower consumption of meat. The plant-based diet results in a different gut microbiota than of most of the rest of the world. This has a significant impact on the survival rate of other populations. The “plant-based diet” results in lower rates of obesity, diabetes and dysbiosis, which could contribute to lower and less severe infections. However, these hypotheses need to be supported by more clinical and biostatistics data.","Losso, Jack N.; Losso, MerryJean N.; Toc, Marco; Inungu, Joseph N.; Finley, John W.",Plant Foods Hum Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169470/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11130-021-00907-6,401

We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.","Junglen, S.; Kurth, A.; Kuehl, H.; Quan, P.-L.; Ellerbrok, H.; Pauli, G.; Nitsche, A.; Nunn, C.; Rich, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 53 cases of severe novel coronavirus pneumonia were confirmed. The APACHE II, MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scores of different treatment methods were calculated, and the predictive power of each score on clinical respiratory support treatment and mortality risk was compared. RESULTS: The APACHE II score showed the largest area under ROC curve in both noninvasive and invasive respiratory support treatment assessments, which is significantly different from that of CURB-65. Further, the MuLBSTA score had the largest area under ROC curve in terms of death risk assessment, which is also significantly different from that of CURB-65; however, no difference was noted with the APACHE II score. CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID, the APACHE II score is an effective predictor of the disease severity and mortality risk.

Recent reports and recent pieces of evidence from scientific literature, however, tell a different story. There have been speculations of SARS-CoV-2 escaping the RT-PCR because of the series of mutations it has gone through. It is possible that host-dependent RNA editing and high person-to-person transmission have equipped the virus with mutations enabling it to spread faster and even evade the RT-PCR. Added to this is burnout among healthcare workers and technicians handling the RT-PCR machines and sampling. All of these factors may be working in unison to result in the deluge of false-negative cases India is facing during the second COVID-19 wave. The mutant strains are spreading to other parts, posing challenges to the whole world. These circumstances warrant supplementary diagnostic tests such as serological and radiological findings to deal with cases of high clinical suspicion. Even one misdiagnosed COVID-19 patient poses a risk to hundreds of others in the vicinity. Healthcare workers’ burnout also has to be dealt with.

Accordingly, highly multiplexed dextramer-TCR binding assays have been recently developed, but the utility of the ensuing large datasets is limited by the lack of robust computational methods for normalization and interpretation. Here, we present a computational framework comprising a novel method, ICON (Integrative COntext-specific Normalization), for identifying reliable TCR-pMHC (peptide–major histocompatibility complex) interactions and a neural network–based classifier TCRAI that outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for TCR-antigen specificity prediction. We further demonstrated that by combining ICON and TCRAI, we are able to discover novel subgroups of TCRs that bind to a given pMHC via different mechanisms.

Scoring systems that evaluate the severity of obesity based on the clinical assessment, rather than the Body Mass Index, are a valuable tool. The clinical assessment should explore the underlying contributors for weight gain and screen for obesity-related complications. Bariatric surgery remains the most effective management approach for severe and complex obesity. Nevertheless, pharmacotherapy and other non-surgical approaches play an important role.

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and to develop a nomogram for predicting mortality using clinical parameters and underlying diseases. METHODS: This study was performed in 5,626 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between February 1 and April 30, 2020 in South Korea. A Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression model were used to construct a nomogram for predicting 30-day and 60-day survival probabilities and overall mortality, respectively in the train set. Calibration and discrimination were performed to validate the nomograms in the test set. RESULTS: Age ≥ 70 years, male, presence of fever and dyspnea at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and diabetes mellitus, cancer, or dementia as underling diseases were significantly related to 30-day and 60-day survival and mortality in COVID-19 patients. The nomogram showed good calibration for survival probabilities and mortality. In the train set, the areas under the curve (AUCs) for 30-day and 60-day survival was 0.914 and 0.954, respectively; the AUC for mortality of 0.959.

METHODS: Records of all tuberculosis cases treated in Taiwan from 2002 through 2005 were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Registry Campaign. Initiation of treatment more than 7 days after diagnosis was considered a long treatment delay. RESULTS: The study included 31,937 patients. The mean day of delayed treatment was 3.6 days. Most patients were treated immediately after diagnosis. The relationship between number of TB patients and days of delayed treatment after diagnosis exhibited a Power-law distribution. The long tail of the power-law distribution indicated that an extreme number occur cannot be neglected. Tuberculosis patients treated after an unusually long delay require close observation and follow up.

The CWH model time’s exponent is the distribution’s shape factor, and its concentration-dependent rate parameter represents the distribution’s scale factor’s reciprocal. Theoretically, the concentration- dependence of the Weibull model’s rate parameter need not to be always in a form of a power-law relationship as the CWH model requires, and two possible alternatives are presented. Apart from being chemically reactive, most chemical disinfectants are also volatile, and their effective concentration rarely remains constant. However, the published dynamic versions of the original CWH model are mathematically incongruent with their static versions. The issue is nonexistent in the dynamic version of the Weibull or other distribution-based models, provided that the momentary inactivation rate is expressed as the static rate at the momentary concentration, at the time that corresponds to the momentary survival ratio. The resulting model is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose numerical solution can describe survival curves under realistic regular and irregular disinfectant dissipation patterns, as well as during the disinfectant dispersion and/or its replenishment. KEY POINTS: • The Chick-Watson-Home models are treated as special cases of the Weibull distribution. • Dynamic microbial survival curve described as ordinary differential equation solution. • Survival rate models of disinfectant dissipation and replenishment patterns presented.

604252,SEVERE TAKOTSUBO CARDIOMYOPATHY IN A PATIENT WITH COVID-19,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of oncology consultations have been conducted remotely. The maladaptation or compromise of care could negatively impact oncology patients and their disease management. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the development and implementation process of a web-based, animated patient education tool that supports oncology patients remotely in the context of fewer in-person interactions with health care providers. METHODS: The platform created presents multilingual oncology care instructions. Animations concerning cancer care and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as immunotherapy and chemotherapy guides were the major areas of focus and represented 6 final produced video guides. RESULTS: The videos were watched 1244 times in a period of 6 months. The most watched animation was the COVID-19 & Oncology guide (viewed 565 times), followed by the video concerning general treatment orientations (viewed 249 times) and the video titled “Chemotherapy” (viewed 205 times). Although viewers were equally distributed among the age groups, most were aged 25 to 34 years (342/1244, 27.5%) and were females (745/1244, 59.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a patient education platform can be designed to prepare patients and their caregivers for their treatment and thus improve outcomes and satisfaction by using a methodical and collaborative approach. Multimedia tools allow a portion of a patient’s care to occur in a home setting, thereby freeing them from the need for hospital resources.","Turkdogan, Sena; Schnitman, Gabriel; Wang, Tianci; Gotlieb, Raphael; How, Jeffrey; Gotlieb, Walter Henri",JMIR Cancer,https://doi.org/10.2196/23637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101611/,401

This study will evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on utilization of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services in Nigeria and explore the barriers being experienced by women and their families in getting access to MNCH services, as well as other contextual factors that may have shaped the utilization of MNCH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis: The study will adopt an observational mixed-methods study design involving 18 health care facilities delivering MNCH services in six selected states across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. We will retrieve longitudinal data on MNCH services from all selected hospitals six months before and after the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth interviews conducted via mobile phones or ZOOM meeting platforms among stakeholder participants (users of MNCH services, health workers and policymakers) to ascertain their perceptions on how COVID-19 has shaped the utilization of MNCH services. We will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services in Nigeria. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approvals have been obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the tertiary hospitals involved in the study. Our findings will provide the first evidence from an African setting on the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services using a mixed-methods study design for policy formulation towards sustained MNCH service delivery.","Akaba, Godwin; Dirisu, Osasuyi; Okunade, Kehinde; Adams, Eseoghene; Ohioghame, Jane; Obikeze, Obioma; Izuka, Emmanuel; Sulieman, Maryam; Edeh, Michael",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567535/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26283.2,401

In the absence of a vaccine, knowledge of the transmission routes and risk areas of infection remain the most important existing tools to prevent further spread. METHODS: Here we investigated the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital environment at the Uppsala University Hospital Infectious Disease ward by RT-qPCR and determined the infectivity of the detected virus in vitro on Vero E6 cells. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in several areas, although attempts to infect Vero E6 cells with positive samples were unsuccessful. However, RNase A treatment of positive samples prior to RNA extraction did not degrade viral RNA, indicating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsids or complete virus particles protecting the RNA as opposed to free viral RNA. CONCLUSION: Our results show that even in places where a moderate concentration (Ct values between 30 and 38) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found; no infectious virus could be detected. This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the hospital environment subsides in two states; as infectious and as non-infectious. Future work should investigate the reasons for the non-infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virions.

Thrombosis Research. 2020;196:67–74.",2020-12-02,"Some of the articles being published during the severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic highlight a link between severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the so-called cytokine storm, also with increased ferritin levels. However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined ‘hyperferritinemic syndrome’, which already includes adult-onset Still’s disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.","Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier",RMD Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32423970/; https://doi.org/10.1136/rmdopen-2020-001295,401

Usually these modifications include the addition of active groups, but less frequently, molecules were synthesized in which either two β-lactam rings were joined to create a single bifunctional compound, or the azetidinone ring was joined to another antibiotic scaffold or another molecule with a different activity, in order to create a molecule bearing two different pharmacophoric functions. In this review, we report some examples of these derivatives, highlighting their biological properties and discussing how this strategy can lead to the development of innovative antibiotics that can represent either novel weapons against the rampant increase of antimicrobial resistance, or molecules with a broader spectrum of action.","De Rosa, Margherita; Verdino, Anna; Soriente, Annunziata; Marabotti, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435500/,401
609076,COVID-19: Understanding Inter-Individual Variability and Implications for Precision Medicine,2020-12-03,"In the previous publication “Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?” Conticini et al. hypothesized that the surplus of lethality of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy may be at least in part explained by the evidence of highest pollution reported in this area, as both severe COVID-19 and smog exposure are correlated to an innate immune system hyper-activation with subsequent lung inflammation and injury. Since this hypothesis alone does not fully explain why specific subgroups of patients are at major risk, we hypothesized that obesity may be one of the links between COVID-19 severity and high level of air pollution. First, obesity is a predisposing factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, and unequivocal evidence demonstrated that fat mass excess is independently associated with several pulmonary diseases and lung inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that obesity may intensify the detrimental effects of air pollution on the lungs, and this is not surprising if we consider that these conditions share an excessive activation of the immune system and a lung inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, fat mass excess has also been speculated to be itself a consequence of air pollutants exposure, which has been proved to induce metabolic disruption and weight gain in murine models. In conclusion, although many variables must be taken into account in the analysis of the pandemic, our observations suggest that obesity may act as effect modifier of smog-induced lung-injury, and the concomitant presence of these two factors could better explain the higher virulence, faster spread and greater mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy compared to the rest of the country.","Lubrano, Carla; Risi, Renata; Masi, Davide; Gnessi, Lucio; Colao, Annamaria",Environ Pollut,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32771867/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120360152; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120360152?v=s5,401

612362,1343 A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco smoking behaviour changes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have higher survival rates and more favorable neurological outcomes when basic life support (BLS) maneuvers are initiated quickly after collapse. Although more than half of OHCAs are witnessed, BLS is infrequently provided, thereby worsening the survival and neurological prognoses of OHCA victims. According to the theory of planned behavior, the probability of executing an action is strongly linked to the intention of performing it. This intention is determined by three distinct dimensions: attitude, subjective normative beliefs, and control beliefs. We hypothesized that there could be a decrease in one or more of these dimensions even shortly after the last BLS training session. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the variation of the three dimensions of the intention to perform resuscitation according to the time elapsed since the last first-aid course. METHODS: Between January and April 2019, the two largest companies delivering first-aid courses in the region of Geneva, Switzerland sent invitation emails on our behalf to people who had followed a first-aid course between January 2014 and December 2018. Participants were asked to answer a set of 17 psychometric questions based on a 4-point Likert scale (“I don’t agree,” “I partially agree,” “I agree,” and “I totally agree”) designed to assess the three dimensions of the intention to perform resuscitation. The primary outcome was the difference in each of these dimensions between participants who had followed a first-aid course less than 6 months before taking the questionnaire and those who took the questionnaire more than 6 months and up to 5 years after following such a course. Secondary outcomes were the change in each dimension using cutoffs at 1 year and 2 years, and the change regarding each individual question using cutoffs at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Univariate and multivariable linear regression were used for analyses. RESULTS: A total of 204 surveys (76%) were analyzed. After adjustment, control beliefs was the only dimension that was significantly lower in participants who took the questionnaire more than 6 months after their last BLS course (P<.001). Resisting diffusion of responsibility, a key element of subjective normative beliefs, was also less likely in this group (P=.001). By contrast, members of this group were less afraid of disease transmission (P=.03). However, fear of legal action was higher in this group (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Control beliefs already show a significant decrease 6 months after the last first-aid course. Short interventions should be designed to restore this dimension to its immediate postcourse state. This could enhance the provision of BLS maneuvers in cases of OHCA.","Regard, Simon; Rosa, Django; Suppan, Mélanie; Giangaspero, Chiara; Larribau, Robert; Niquille, Marc; Sarasin, François; Suppan, Laurent",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252342/,401

Respiratory involvement is usually an upper tract infection or pneumonia but can also present as other forms of pulmonary disorders. A 3-year-old boy presented with cough, hoarseness, and stridor. He was treated with dexamethasone and nebulized adrenaline and a clinical diagnosis of croup was established. After treatment, his symptoms improved for a short time, but suddenly cough exacerbated and was accompanied by respiratory failure and seizures. He was then intubated and mechanically ventilated. Because of the coronavirus epidemic, Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was taken from the pharyngeal secretions and was positive. The child was isolated. Due to excessive respiratory secretions and worsening of the general condition, bronchoscopy was performed depicting an image compatible with bacterial tracheitis. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. Finally, after 4 weeks of treatment, the child was discharged in good general condition. Croup is one of the respiratory symptoms of novel coronavirus and can be a risk factor for bacterial tracheitis.

However, it is often hindered by low primary rescue success rates or yields, especially with field-derived viral strains. APPROACH: We investigated the possibility of enhancing influenza virus rescue by eliciting cell fusion to increase the chances of having all necessary plasmids expressed within the same polykaryon. To this end we used the Maedi-Visna Virus envelope protein which has potent fusion activity in cells from a wide range of different species. RESULTS: Co-transfecting cells with the eight plasmids necessary to rescue influenza virus plus a plasmid expressing the Maedi-Visna Virus envelope protein resulted in increased rescue efficiency. In addition, partial complements of the 8-plasmid rescue system could be transfected into two separate populations of cells, which upon fusion led to live virus rescue.

Furthermore, compared to healthy controls, young-adult people with schizophrenia differ in the relative importance they place on values, or guiding life principles, associated with educational and occupational success (openness to change), suggesting that changing motivations may contribute to SWB and the apparent motivational deficits commonly reported in this population. The current study sought to better understand these relationships in middle-aged people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=29) versus a relatively healthy group of community controls (n=23). Participants completed measures of SWB and values. They also completed a cognitive battery and interviews concerned with mental and physical health. Patients reported similar levels of SWB compared to controls in the context of significant cognitive, social and vocational difficulties. Moreover, living consistently with values (valued living) predicted SWB in both groups. Lastly, internalized mental illness stigma was negatively associated with openness to change in the patient group. While encouraging from an emotional resiliency perspective, SWB and valued living in people with schizophrenia may hinder motivation towards treatment goals that could otherwise improve functional outcomes in this population.","Krzyzanowski, Daniel; Agid, Ofer; Goghari, Vina; Remington, Gary",Schizophr Res Cogn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scog.2021.100205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258238/,401

617574,Impact of prone position on outcomes of COVID-19 patients with spontaneous breathing,2021-08-12,"Residents’ wellbeing in the present COVID-19 global health crisis requires a deeper understanding to determine appropriate management strategies to promote sustainable behaviors and contribute to human and planetary health. Residents’ behavior can have a profound influence in contributing to personal and global community’s health by responding effectively to emergency strategies in disease outbreaks such as the Coronavirus. It is evident that an understanding of residents’ behavior(s) pre COVID-19 across fields have relied on over-simplistic models, many of which will need to be revisited. Our interaction with people and nature while respecting social distancing has profound positive impacts on our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. The current health pandemic has called that people be confined in their homes across many nations as a means to control the spread of the virus and save lives. This calls for research exploring the mechanisms; this paper develops and proposes a conceptual framework suggesting that place confinement promotes pro-social and household pro-environmental behaviors which could become habitual and contribute further to our people’s and our planet’s health. The proposed model concerns socio-economically favored social sectors whose survival is not as threatened by the pandemic as the poor sectors where wellbeing (and mental health) are at high risk. Some evidence shows that human connectedness to place may contribute to engagement in desirable behaviors. Interaction with other members of the household can help create meanings leading to collective actions promoting psychological wellbeing. Promoting hygienic behaviors in the household (frequent hand washing) while at the same time being conscious not to keep the water flowing when not required would contribute to a range of benefits (health, financial, biospheric, altruistic) and promote wellbeing. Engaging in pro-social behaviors may result in positive effects on psychological wellbeing, reducing mental distress giving rise to a sense of attachment and belongingness, trust and overall life satisfaction. Engaging people in low-effort pro-environmental behavior to maintain some levels of physical activity and biological harmony with natural environmental settings (e.g., gardening) may help reduce anxiety and distress. This is the first study exploring the interplay of relationships between place confinement, pro-social behavior, household pro-environmental behaviors, place attachment as a multi-dimensional construct and presenting their relationships to residents’ wellbeing.

It is unknown if this is due to the virus itself or a side effect of treatment; however, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been shown to have a predilection for angiotensin-converting enzyme receptors that are present in the respiratory tract, oral mucosa, tongue, and salivary glands, causing alterations in taste and smell. Therefore, the objective of this review was to present the future challenges of Covid-19 and oral manifestations in daily dental practice through a literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific evidence in the databases Scopus and PubMed was searched using the Boolean operators. Articles published in Spanish and English between January and December 2020 were included. RESULTS: Of the 89 articles found in Scopus, 69 were of the open access type and 20 were in the “others” category; only 22 scientific articles were found in PubMed. CONCLUSION: It is important to take into account these clinical manifestations such as loss of taste and smell in order to detect the disease. Good oral hygiene is also recommended as a preventive measure to reduce viral load, which considerably reduces the probability of infecting other people who are in contact with the infected patient.","Riofrio, Grecia; Castillo, Stephanny; Salcedo, Gabriela; Alvitez-Temoche, Daniel; Watanabe, Romel; Mayta-Tovalino, Frank",J Int Soc Prev Community Dent,https://doi.org/10.4103/jispcd.jispcd_21_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268185/,401

Based on ethnographic and autoethnographic data, this article reflects on teaching about human-microbial relations in the context of the course “Anthropology of Food” and specifically at the start of the pandemic. Data demonstrate how students shifted from demystifying microbes to distrusting microbes to reacquainting with microbes through a hands-on experiment with fermentation. The article introduces a microbiopolitical perspective in interpreting students' learning trajectories and ultimate course outcomes. IMPORTANCE As evidenced by classroom experiences in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, microbes are “good to teach with” not only within microbiology and related fields but across a variety of academic disciplines. Thinking with microbes is not a neutral process but one shaped by social, political, and economic processes. Imploring students to contemplate how power dynamics and patterns of inequality are detectable at the microbial level may offer a unique opportunity for transforming one’s view of the world and our relatedness with both humans and nonhumans.","Carney, Megan A.",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00566-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313458/,401

The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents on COVID-19 in a large cohort of patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: The study was conducted in the arthritis outpatient clinic at two large academic hospitals in the COVID-19 most endemic area of Northern Italy (Lombardy). We circulated a cross-sectional survey exploring the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 nasopharyngeal swab positivity and the occurrence of acute respiratory illness (fever and/or cough and/or dyspnea), administered face-to-face or by phone to consecutive patients from 25 February to 20 April 2020. COVID-19 cases were defined as confirmed or highly suspicious according to the World Health Organization criteria. The impact of medications on COVID-19 development was evaluated. RESULTS: The study population included 2050 adults with chronic inflammatory arthritis receiving glucocorticoids, conventional-synthetic (cs), or targeted-synthetic/biological (ts/b) disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs). Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious infection were recorded in 1.1% and 1.4% of the population, respectively. Treatment with glucocorticoids was independently associated with increased risk of COVID-19 (adjusted OR [95% CI] ranging from 1.23 [1.04–1.44] to 3.20 [1.97–5.18] depending on the definition used). Conversely, patients treated with ts/bDMARDs were at reduced risk (adjusted OR ranging from 0.46 [0.18–1.21] to 0.47 [0.46–0.48]). No independent effects of csDMARDs, age, sex, and comorbidities were observed. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, treatment with immunomodulatory medications appears safe.

In addition to respiratory, fecal–oral, and sexual transmission, the transfer of pathogens via surfaces plays a vital role for human pathogenic infections—especially nosocomial pathogens. Therefore, information about the survival of pathogens on surfaces can have direct implications on clinical measures, including hygiene guidelines and disinfection strategies. In this review, we reviewed the existing literature regarding viral, bacterial, and fungal persistence on inanimate surfaces. In particular, the current knowledge of the survival time and conditions of clinically relevant pathogens is summarized. While many pathogens persist only for hours, common nosocomial pathogens can survive for days to weeks under laboratory conditions and thereby potentially form a continuous source of transmission if no adequate inactivation procedures are performed.","Wißmann, Jan Erik; Kirchhoff, Lisa; Brüggemann, Yannick; Todt, Daniel; Steinmann, Joerg; Steinmann, Eike",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9020343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572303/,401
623826,Pragmatic recommendations for intubating critically ill patients with suspected COVID‐19,2020-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an essential role in secondary brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been suggested to suppress neuroinflammation after central nervous system (CNS) damage in animal models. However, the role of ACEIs and ARBs in ICH patients with hypertension remains unresolved in clinic. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of ACEIs/ARBs on ICH patients with hypertension using a retrospective, single-center data analysis. METHODS: ICH patients diagnosed by computerized tomographic (CT) at Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University were included in the present research from January 2015 to December 2019. According to the medical history for the usage of antihypertensive drugs, patients were assigned into either ACEIs/ARBs group or non-ACEIs/ARBs group. Demographics, clinical baseline, radiological documents and treatments were collected and these data were statistically analyzed between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 635 ICH patients with hypertension were included and allocated into 2 groups according to the usage of antihypertensive drugs: 281 in the ACEIs/ARBs group and 354 in the non-ACEIs/ARBs group. The results presented that the 3-months mortality and prevalence of ICH-associated pneumonia were lower in ACEIs/ARBs group than that in non-ACEIs/ARBs group (5.0% vs 11.9%, p=0.002; 58.4% vs 66.7%, p=0.031). While, there was no significant difference in favorable outcome (40.2% vs 33.9%, p=0.101) between the two groups. Furthermore, patients in ACEIs/ARBs group exhibited significantly less perihematomal edema volume on days 3 (23.5 ± 14.4 versus 28.7 ± 20.1 mL, p=0.045) and 7 (21.0 ± 13.7 versus 25.7 ± 17.6 mL, p=0.044), compared to that in non- ACEIs/ARBs group. CONCLUSION: The usage of ACEIs/ARBs helps decrease mortality, perihematomal edema volume, and prevalence of ICH-associated pneumonia in ICH patients with hypertension.","Zhang, Chao; Zhong, Jun; Chen, Wei-Xiang; Zhang, Xu-Yang; Li, Yu-Hong; Zhou, Teng-Yuan; Zou, Yong-Jie; Lan, Chuan; Li, Lan; Lai, Zhao-Pan; Feng, Hua; Hu, Rong",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603374/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s291624,401

While COVID-19 is primarily associated with respiratory illnesses, an increasing number of clinical reports indicate that severely ill patients often develop thrombotic complications that are associated with increased mortality. As a consequence, treatment strategies that target COVID-associated thrombosis are of utmost clinical importance. An array of pharmacologically active compounds from natural products exhibit effects on blood coagulation pathways, and have generated interest for their potential therapeutic applications towards thrombotic diseases. In particular, a number of snake venom compounds exhibit high specificity on different blood coagulation factors and represent excellent tools that could be utilized to treat thrombosis. The aim of this review is to provide a brief summary of the current understanding of COVID-19 associated thrombosis, and highlight several snake venom compounds that could be utilized as antithrombotic agents to target this disease.","Kalita, Bhargab; Saviola, Anthony J.; Samuel, Stephen P.; Mukherjee, Ashis K.",Int J Biol Macromol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141813021021565?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141813021021565,401

626305,Addendum to vitamin D deficiency aggravates COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The majority of new HIV infections occur through mucosal transmission. The availability of readily applicable and accessible platforms for anti‐retroviral (ARV) delivery is critical for the prevention of HIV acquisition through sexual transmission in both women and men. There is a compelling need for developing new topical delivery systems that have advantages over the pills, gels and rings, which currently fail to guarantee protection against mucosal viral transmission in vulnerable populations due to lack of user compliance. The silk fibroin (SF) platform offers another option that may be better suited to individual circumstances and preferences to increase efficacy through user compliance. The objective of this study was to test safety and efficacy of SF for anti‐HIV drug delivery to mucosal sites and for viral prevention. METHODS: We formulated a potent HIV inhibitor Griffithsin (Grft) in a mucoadhesive silk fibroin (SF) drug delivery platform and tested the application in a non‐human primate model in vivo and a pre‐clinical human cervical and colorectal tissue explant model. Both vaginal and rectal compartments were assessed in rhesus macaques (Mucaca mulatta) that received SF (n = 4), no SF (n = 7) and SF‐Grft (n = 11). In this study, we evaluated the composition of local microbiota, inflammatory cytokine production, histopathological changes in the vaginal and rectal compartments and mucosal protection after ex vivo SHIV challenge. RESULTS: Effective Grft release and retention in mucosal tissues from the SF‐Grft platform resulted in protection against HIV in human cervical and colorectal tissue as well as against SHIV challenge in both rhesus macaque vaginal and rectal tissues. Mucoadhesion of SF‐Grft inserts did not cause any inflammatory responses or changes in local microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that in vivo delivery of SF‐Grft in rhesus macaques fully protects against SHIV challenge ex vivo after two hours of application and is safe to use in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. Our study provides support for the development of silk fibroin as a highly promising, user‐friendly HIV prevention modality to address the global disparity in HIV infection.","Crakes, Katti R; Herrera, Carolina; Morgan, Jessica L; Olstad, Katie; Hessell, Ann J; Ziprin, Paul; LiWang, Patricia J; Dandekar, Satya",J Int AIDS Soc,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073530/,401

Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.","Dowd, J. B.; Rotondi, V.; Adriano, L.; Brazel, D.

In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy on hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication and demonstrated anti-HCV effects of an autophagic proteolysis inhibitor, chloroquine. METHODS: Induction of autophagy was evaluated following the transfection of HCV replicon to Huh-7 cells. Next, we investigated the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in response to treatment with lysosomal protease inhibitors or pharmacological autophagy inhibitor. The effect on HCV replication was analyzed after transfection with siRNA of ATG5, ATG7 and light-chain (LC)-3 to replicon cells. The antiviral effect of chloroquine and/or interferon-α (IFNα) was evaluated. RESULTS: The transfection of HCV replicon increased the number of autophagosomes to about twofold over untransfected cells. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagic proteolysis significantly suppressed expression level of HCV replicon. Silencing of autophagy-related genes by siRNA transfection significantly blunted the replication of HCV replicon. Treatment of replicon cells with chloroquine suppressed the replication of the HCV replicon in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, combination treatment of chloroquine to IFNα enhanced the antiviral effect of IFNα and prevented re-propagation of HCV replicon. Protein kinase R was activated in cells treated with IFNα but not with chloroquine. Incubation with chloroquine decreased degradation of long-lived protein leucine. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the replication of HCV replicon utilizes machinery involving cellular autophagic proteolysis. The therapy targeted to autophagic proteolysis by using chloroquine may provide a new therapeutic option against chronic hepatitis C.","Mizui, Tomokazu; Yamashina, Shunhei; Tanida, Isei; Takei, Yoshiyuki; Ueno, Takashi; Sakamoto, Naoya; Ikejima, Kenichi; Kitamura, Tsuneo; Enomoto, Nobuyuki; Sakai, Tatsuo; Kominami, Eiki; Watanabe, Sumio",J Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-009-0132-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760134/,401

The objective of this study was to identify the influence of packaging film and lean trimming sources on fresh ground beef surface color during a simulated retail display period. There were no differences (p > 0.05) in surface color redness (a*), yellowness (b*), chroma, or hue angle regardless of packaging film or lean trimmings. However, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were greater (p < 0.05) for packages containing a greater percentage of CULL beef trimmings regardless of packaging film. In addition, pH values of ground beef packages did not differ (p > 0.05) among packaging film or lean trimming blends. Visual color did not differ (p > 0.05) throughout the simulated retail display period regardless of beef trimmings or packaging film. Microbial spoilage organisms were greater (p < 0.05) after the simulated display period.

630451,INCREASED INPATIENT MORTALITY FOR CARDIOVASCULAR PATIENTS DURING THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC IN NEW YORK,2021-05-11,"With the development of the Internet, social networking sites have empowered the public to directly express their views about social issues and hence contribute to social change. As a new type of voice behavior, public voice on social media has aroused wide concern among scholars. However, why public voice is expressed and how it influences social development and betterment in times of public health emergencies remains unstudied. A key point is whether governments can take effective countermeasures when faced with public health emergencies. In such situation, public voice is of great significance in the formulation and implementation of coping policies. This qualitive study uses China’s Health Code policy under COVID-19 to explore why the public performs voice behavior on social media and how this influences policy evolution and product innovation through cooperative governance. A stimulus-cognition-emotion-behavior model is established to explain public voice, indicating that it is influenced by cognitive processes and public emotions under policy stimulus. What is more, as a form of public participation in cooperative governance, public voice plays a significant role in promoting policy evolution and product innovation, and represents a useful form of cooperation with governments and enterprises to jointly maintain social stability under public health emergencies","Yang, Yang; Su, Yingying",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962172/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17186840,401

This is not the case with the report cards utilized in kidney transplantation. These report cards became more salient and binding, with additional oversight, in 2007 under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Conditions of Participation. This research investigates whether the additional oversight based on report card outcomes influences patient selection via waiting-list registrations at transplant centers that meet regulatory standards. Using data from a national registry of kidney transplant candidates from 2003 through 2010, we apply a before-and-after estimation strategy that isolates the impact of a binding report card. A sorting equilibrium model is employed to account for center-level heterogeneity and the presence of congestion/agglomeration effects and the results are compared to a conditional logit specification. Our results indicate that patient waiting-list registrations change in response to the quality information similarly on average if there is additional regulation or not. We also find evidence of congestion effects when spatial choice sets are smaller: new patient registrations are less likely to occur at a center with a long waiting list when fewer options are available.","Ouayogodé, Mariétou H.; Schnier, Kurt E.",Health Care Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417173/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-020-09530-4,401
632239,What is the role of bronchoalveolar lavage in the diagnosis of COVID-19?,2021-05-17,"PURPOSE: Microbial infection stimulates neutrophil/macrophage/monocyte extracellular trap formation, which leads to the release of citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) 2 and 4. Understanding these molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of septic shock will be an important next step for developing novel diagnostic and treatment modalities. We sought to determine the expression of CitH3 in patients with septic shock, and to correlate CitH3 levels with PAD2/PAD4 and clinically relevant outcomes. METHODS: Levels of CitH3 were measured in serum samples of 160 critically ill patients with septic and non-septic shock, and healthy volunteers. Analyses of clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were conducted. RESULTS: Levels of circulating CitH3 at enrollment were significantly increased in septic shock patients (n = 102) compared to patients hospitalized with non-infectious shock (NIC) (n = 32, p < 0.0001). The area under the curve (95% CI) for distinguishing septic shock from NIC using CitH3 was 0.76 (0.65–0.86). CitH3 was positively correlated with PAD2 and PAD4 concentrations and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores [total score (r = 0.36, p < 0.0001)]. The serum levels of CitH3 at 24 h (p < 0.01) and 48 h (p < 0.05) were significantly higher in the septic patients that did not survive. CONCLUSION: CitH3 is increased in patients with septic shock. Its serum concentrations correlate with disease severity and prognosis, which may yield vital insights into the pathophysiology of sepsis.

However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the impact of globally circulating variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 48 sera from BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients against pseudoviruses bearing spike proteins derived from 10 strains of SARS-CoV-2. While multiple strains exhibited vaccine-induced cross-neutralization comparable to wild-type pseudovirus, 5 strains harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was weak and comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.","Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Lam, Evan C.; St. Denis, Kerri; Nitido, Adam D.; Garcia, Zeidy H.; Hauser, Blake M.; Feldman, Jared; Pavlovic, Maia N.; Gregory, David J.; Poznansky, Mark C.; Sigal, Alex; Schmidt, Aaron G.; Iafrate, A.

636127,How the Workload and Outcome of Imaging Examinations Changed During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown,2020-11-10,"Understanding chest CT imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression. Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M [Formula: see text] UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M [Formula: see text] UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art methods.","He, Kelei; Zhao, Wei; Xie, Xingzhi; Ji, Wen; Liu, Mingxia; Tang, Zhenyu; Shi, Yinghuan; Shi, Feng; Gao, Yang; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Junfeng; Shen, Dinggang",Pattern Recognit,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321000157; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.107828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495661/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321000157,401

637392,Provision of holistic care after severe COVID-19 pneumonia – Authors' reply,2021-02-05,"Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis with multisystem involvement. Recently, the increasing incidence of a condition that closely resembles KD in many cases, named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has set off alarms amid the current worldwide coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Hence, the aim is to conduct a systematic review of the literature about KD in Colombia and contrast it with COVID-19-related MIS-C. Materials and methods: A search was carried out in both international and Latin American electronic databases for publications concerning patients with KD in the Colombian population. Records were then screened by titles and/or abstracts, assessed for eligibility, and reviewed. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The search included studies reporting MIS-C associated with COVID-19, and compared these patients with our findings of KD in Colombia. Results: Out of 36 publications retrieved, 17 were included, representing 120 individuals. Male to female ratio was 1.6, and most patients (90.4%) were aged 5 years or less. Among the main features of KD, fever was the most frequent (96.2% of the patients), while cervical lymphadenopathy was present in only 40.6%. Intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 91.4% cases and 6.2% were resistant. Cardiac involvement was found in around 30%, and 20% had coronary artery lesions. Comparison between MIS-C associated with COVID-19 and KD in Colombia indicates that patients affected by MIS-C were older (72.2% of MIS-C patients > 5 years), had higher rates of cardiac involvement, and required critical care more often. Conclusions: Our findings of KD in Colombia are consistent with the available descriptions of KD in the scientific literature. Given the increasing rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Colombia and Latin America, our study raises awareness about MIS-C in paediatric patients with COVID-19 and its relationship with KD.","Llinás-Caballero, Kevin; Rodríguez, Yhojan; Fernández-Sarmiento, Jaime; Rodríguez-Jiménez, Mónica; Anaya, Juan-Manuel",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0121812321000086; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0121812321000086?v=s5,401

The current study evaluates of anti-chikungunya activities of Psidium guajava leaves extract and their green synthesized silver nanoparticles. Green synthesized nanoparticles were well characterized for their size and stability by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their functional groups were analyzed by FTIR. Maximum non-toxic doses (MNTD) of extracts and nanoparticles were analysed by using Vero cell-lines. Anti-chikungunya activities of extracts and nano-particles were determined on Vero cells and their effects on cell viability were measured by MTT assay. The P. guajava nano-particles and extracts revealed the anti-chikungunya activities in the Vero cell. The cells viability was increased by 40% and 60% as compared to the virus control, when these cells were treated with MNTD of P. guajava nano-particles and extracts, respectively. To know the reason for antiviral activity, molecular docking of phytochemicals was done against a replication essential cysteine protease (nsP2) of Chikungunya. It was found that phytochemicals; Longifollen and Quercetin showed the minimum binding energy with nsP2. P. guajava extracts can be exploited to develop an effective anti-chikungunya agent.

Using COVID-19 as a case study, we developed a query-bot information retrieval system with user-feedback to allow clinicians to ask natural questions to retrieve data from patient notes. Materials and Methods We applied clinicalBERT, a pre-trained contextual language model, to our dataset of patient notes to obtain sentence embeddings, using K-Means to reduce computation time for real-time interaction. Rocchio algorithm was then employed to incorporate user-feedback and improve retrieval performance. Results In an iterative feedback loop experiment, MAP for final iteration was 0.93/0.94 as compared to initial MAP of 0.66/0.52 for generic and 1./1. compared to 0.79/0.83 for COVID-19 specific queries confirming that contextual model handles the ambiguity in natural language queries and feedback helps to improve retrieval performance. User-in-loop experiment also outperformed the automated pseudo relevance feedback method. Moreover, the null hypothesis which assumes identical precision between initial retrieval and relevance feedback was rejected with high statistical significance (p ≪ 0.05). Compared to Word2Vec, TF-IDF and bioBERT models, clinicalBERT works optimally considering the balance between response precision and user-feedback. Discussion Our model works well for generic as well as COVID-19 specific queries. However, some generic queries are not answered as well as others because clustering reduces query performance and vague relations between queries and sentences are considered non-relevant. We also tested our model for queries with the same meaning but different expressions and demonstrated that these query variations yielded similar performance after incorporation of user-feedback. Conclusion In conclusion, we develop an NLP-based query-bot that handles synonyms and natural language ambiguity in order to retrieve relevant information from the patient chart.

Methods Using open data repository with daily infected, recovered and death cases in the period between March 2020 and April 2021, a descriptive analysis was performed. The susceptible-exposed-infected-recovery model was used to estimate the effective productive number (R t ). The duration taken from R t > 1 to R t < 1 and case load were first modelled by using the compound Poisson method. Machine learning analysis using the K-means clustering method was further adopted to classify patterns of community-acquired outbreaks worldwide. Results The global estimated R t declined after the first surge of COVID-19 pandemic but there were still two major surges of epidemics occurring in September 2020 and March 2021, respectively, and numerous episodes due to various extents of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Unsupervised machine learning identified five patterns as “controlled epidemic”, “mutant propagated epidemic”, “propagated epidemic”, “persistent epidemic” and “long persistent epidemic” with the corresponding duration and the logarithm of case load from the lowest (18.6±11.7;3.4±1.8)) to the highest (258.2±31.9;11.9±2.4). Countries like Taiwan outside five clusters were classified as no community-acquired outbreak. Conclusion Data-driven models for the new classification of community-acquired outbreaks are useful for global surveillance of uninterrupted COVID-19 pandemic and provide a timely decision support for the distribution of vaccine and the optimal NPIs from global to local community.","Wang, Wei-Chun; Lin, Ting-Yu; Chiu, Sherry Yueh-Hsia; Chen, Chiung-Nien; Sarakarn, Pongdech; Ibrahim, Mohd; Chen, Sam Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Yeh, Yeh-Po",J Formos Med Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664621002230; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664621002230?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2021.05.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083090/,401

Mindfulness-based interventions are becoming an increasingly popular treatment for individuals experiencing depression and chronic levels of stress. The app (Serene) draws from scholarly evidence on the efficacy of mindfulness meditations and builds on the pre-existing apps by incorporating techniques that are used in some therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a 4-week mindfulness and self-compassion-based cognitive smartphone intervention (Serene) or a wait-list control group. They were instructed to engage in self-compassion and mindfulness practices and a cognitive restructuring task. They also completed measures that evaluated their levels of depression, stress, anxiety, self-compassion, wisdom, psychological well-being, and subjective well-being. The intervention group was also instructed to track their weekly engagement with the app. Standardized effect sizes for between-group differences were calculated using Cohen's d for complete case analyses. Results: Complete case analyses from baseline to the end of this randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant moderate between-group differences for depressive symptoms (d = −0.43) and decisiveness (d = 0.34). Moderate between-group differences were also found for self-compassion (d = 0.6) such that significant improvements in self-kindness, common humanity, mindfulness and decreases in self-judgement, isolation, and overidentification were observed. A small between-group difference was found for emotional regulation (d = 0.28). Moreover, a significant moderate within-group decrease in stress (d = −0.52) and anxiety symptoms (d = −0.47) was also observed in the intervention group. Conclusions: Serene is an effective intervention that promotes increased levels of self-compassion and emotional regulation. Engaging with Serene may help reduce depressive symptoms through mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive restructuring which help reduce overidentification with one's negative emotions. As individuals rebalance their thinking through cognitive restructuring, they can identify the varying stressors in their life, develop action plans and engage in adaptive coping strategies to address them. Serene may promote greater self-understanding which may provide one with a more balanced perspective on their current upsetting situations to positively transform their challenges during the pandemic.","Al-Refae, Mohamed; Al-Refae, Amr; Munroe, Melanie; Sardella, Nicole A.; Ferrari, Michel",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828514/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648087,401

In this study, we flushed and collected samples from showers in buildings that had been unoccupied for approximately two months and quantified Legionella pneumophila using a commercial cultivation-based assay. In addition, all bacteria, Legionella spp., L. pneumophila, L. pneumophila serogroup 1, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were analyzed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Despite low or negligible total chlorine in the stagnant pre-flush water samples, L. pneumophila were not detected by either method; Legionella spp., NTM, and MAC, however, were widespread. Using quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), estimated risks of clinical illness from exposure to legionella and MAC via showering were generally low, but the risk of subclinical infection via Legionella spp. could exceed a 10-7 daily risk threshold if just a small fraction ([≥]0.1 %) of those legionellae detected by qPCR are highly infectious. Flushing cold and hot water lines rapidly restored a total chlorine (as chloramine) residual and decreased all bacterial gene targets to building inlet water levels within 30 min. Following flushing, the chlorine residual rapidly dissipated and bacterial gene targets rebounded, approaching pre-flush concentrations after 6 to 7 days of stagnation. These results suggest that stagnant water in premise plumbing may contain elevated levels of opportunistic pathogens; flushing, however, can rapidly improve water quality and reduce the health risk but the improvement will be short-lived if building disuse persists.","Hozalski, R.

Nevertheless, some layers are interdependent or structurally similar in the multilayer network. In this paper, we present a maximum a posteriori estimation based model to reconstruct a specific layer in the multilayer network. The SimHash algorithm is used to compute the similarities between various layers. And the layers with similar structures are used to determine the parameters of the conjugate prior. With this model, we can also predict missing links and direct experiments for finding potential links. We test the method through two real multilayer networks, and the results show that the maximum a posteriori estimation is promising in reconstructing the layer of interest even with a large number of missing links.","Kuang, Junyao; Scoglio, Caterina",Physical review.

642003,Does Adding of Hydroxychloroquine to the Standard Care Provide any Benefit in Reducing the Mortality among COVID-19 Patients?: a Systematic Review,2020-06-09,"SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, leading to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike–ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.","Conceicao, Carina; Thakur, Nazia; Human, Stacey; Kelly, James T.; Logan, Leanne; Bialy, Dagmara; Bhat, Sushant; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Zagrajek, Adrian K.; Hollinghurst, Philippa; Varga, Michal; Tsirigoti, Christina; Tully, Matthew; Chiu, Chris; Moffat, Katy; Silesian, Adrian Paul; Hammond, John A.; Maier, Helena J.; Bickerton, Erica; Shelton, Holly; Dietrich, Isabelle; Graham, Stephen C.; Bailey, Dalan",PLoS Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347434/,401
642632,Drug treatments for covid-19: living systematic review and network meta-analysis,2020-07-31,"Background: Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease that has spread rapidly across the world. Many studies have already evaluated the clinical features of COVID-19, but how it compares with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative community-acquired pneumonia (SN-CAP) is still unclear. Moreover, COVID-19 mortality is correlated with disease severity, but indicators for severity grading have not been specified. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with SN-CAP and find indicators for disease severity in COVID-19. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SN-CAP were enrolled. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The numbers of COVID-19 and SN-CAP patients enrolled were 304 and 138, respectively. The age of the patients was not significantly different between the groups. Compared with SN-CAP, COVID-19 patients had more symptoms of fever and dyspnea; and showed significant difference in blood count results. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients showed patchy ground-glass opacities that correlated with disease severity, whereas the CT imaging of SN-CAP patients showed patchy high-density shadows. COVID-19 patients were classified into moderate, severe, and critically severe groups. The severe and critically severe groups had elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, platelets, C-reaction protein (CRP), lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), troponin-I, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). However, they had decreased levels of lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, and albumin. Compared with the younger patients, the older COVID-19 individuals had more chronic diseases and significantly elevated levels of WBC, neutrophil, and CRP levels. Conclusion: SN-CAP showed more inflammatory reaction than COVID-19. Old people with chronic diseases are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high likelihood of developing severe and critically severe infection. Levels of WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CRP, NLR, PLR, troponin-I, creatinine, and BUN are important indicators for severity grading in COVID-19.","Zhou, Yutian; Guo, Shujin; He, Ye; Zuo, Qiunan; Liu, Danju; Xiao, Meng; Fan, Jinxiu; Li, Xiaohui",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612961/,401

Forty-eight mature male rats were randomly distributed into six groups: Group1 (negative control); Groups 2 and 3 (positive control I and II, wherein the animals were treated with 10 and 30 mg ZnO NPs/kg BW, respectively); Group 4 (B[a]P group; treated with 150 mg B[a]P/kg BW); and Groups 5 and 6 (subjected to B[a]P treatment co-administered with different concentrations of ZnO NPs). We investigated oxidative stress biomarkers; cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) gene expression; testosterone levels; and histopathology of the liver, kidney, and testicles. The B[a]P-treated group showed significant deterioration in all reproductive parameters and displayed induced oxidative stress. ZnO NPs remarkably reduced oxidative stress, effectively upregulated the mRNA levels of CY11A1, StAR, and 3β-HSD, and improved the histological pictures in the examined organs. At their investigated doses and given their NPs properties, ZnO NPs demonstrated a marked ameliorative effect against the reproductive toxic effects of B[a]P.

However, these strategies rely on community understanding and motivation to engage to ensure appropriate compliance and impact. To support current activities for COVID-19, the objectives of this narrative review was to identify the key determinants impacting on engagement. METHODS: An integrative narrative literature review focused on NPIs. We aimed to identify published peer-reviewed articles that focused on the general community (excluding healthcare workers), NPIs (including school closure, quarantine, isolation, physical distancing and hygiene behaviours), and factors/characteristics (including social, physical, psychological, capacity, motivation, economic and demographic) that impact on engagement. RESULTS: The results revealed that there are a range of demographic, social and psychological factors underpinning engagement with quarantine, school closures, and personal protective behaviours. Aside from the factors impacting on acceptance and compliance, there are several key community concerns about their use that need to be addressed including the potential for economic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is important that we acknowledge that these strategies will have an impact on an individual and the community. By understanding the barriers, we can identify what strategies need to be adopted to motivate individuals and improve community compliance. Using a behavioural framework to plan interventions based on these key barriers, will also ensure countries implement appropriate and targeted responses.","Seale, Holly; Dyer, Clare E.

However, the mechanism of PF related to COVID (COVID-PF) is unknown. This study aimed to explore the key targets in the development of COVID-PF and the mechanism of d-limonene in the COVID-PF treatment. The differentially expressed genes of COVID-PF were downloaded from the GeneCards database, and their pathways were analyzed. d-Limonene was molecularly docked with related proteins to screen its pharmacological targets, and a rat lung fibrosis model was established to verify d-limonene's effect on COVID-PF-related targets. The results showed that the imbalance between collagen breakdown and metabolism, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis are the core processes of COVID-PF; and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are the key targets of the treatment of COVID-PF. The ability of d-limonene to protect against PF induced by bleomycin in rats was reported. The mechanism is related to the binding of PI3K and NF-κB p65, and the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/IKK-α/NF-κB p65 signaling pathway expression and phosphorylation. These results confirmed the relationship between the PI3K–Akt signaling pathway and COVID-PF, showing that d-limonene has a potential therapeutic value for COVID-PF.","Yang, Fan; Chen, Ru; Li, Wan-yang; Zhu, Hao-yue; Chen, Xiao-xuan; Hou, Zhen-feng; Cao, Ren-shuang; Zang, GuoDong; Li, Yu-xuan; Zhang, Wei",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.591830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33768100/,401

As reported, the body mass index (BMI) may play an important role in COVID-19; however, this still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of science were systematically searched until August 2020. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect of covariates were analyzed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 16 observational studies involving 109,881 patients with COVID-19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that patients with a BMI≥30kg/m(2) had a 2.35-fold risk(OR = 2.35, 95%CI = 1.64 − 3.38, P < 0.001) for critical COVID-19 and a 2.68-fold risk for COVID-19 mortality (OR = 2.68, 95%CI = 1.65 −4.37, P < 0.001 ) compared with patients with a BMI <30kg/m(2). Subgroup analysis results showed that patients with obesity and age > 60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19(OR = 3.11, 95%CI = 1.73 − 5.61, P < 0.001) and COVID-19 mortality(OR = 3.93, 95%CI = 2.18 − 7.09, P < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age had a significant influence on the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality(Coef.=0.036, p=0.048). Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both critical COVID-19(P(non-linearity) = 0.242) and mortality (P(non-linearity) = 0.116). The risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality increased by 9%(OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.04 −1.14, P < 0.001) and 6%(OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02 −1.10, P = 0.002) for each 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that a linear dose-response association between BMI and both COVID-19 severity and mortality. Further, obesity(BMI≥30kg/m(2)) was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Du, Yanbin; Lv, Yuan; Zha, Wenting; Zhou, Nan; Hong, Xiuqin",Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154373; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520302377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32949592/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520302377?v=s5,401

To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the aforementioned determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable causal effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy), and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects of public mobility in retail and recreational areas, awareness measured by searches for ""corona"" in Google, and higher rainfall, leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases. This comprehensive causal analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","Steiger, E.; Mussgnug, T.; Kroll, L.

However, monitoring these patients is critical to improving the chances of survival, and therefore, a prioritization strategy for these patients is warranted. This study developed a monitoring algorithm for COVID-19 patients for the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MOH). Methods: This work included 1) a literature review, 2) consultations with MOH and National Institute of Health officials, and 3) data analysis of all positive COVID-19 cases and their outcomes. We used clinical and socioeconomic variables to develop a set of risk categories to identify severe cases of COVID-19. Results: This tool provided four different risk categories for COVID-19 patients. As soon as the time of diagnosis, this tool can identify 91% of all severe and fatal COVID-19 cases within the first two risk categories. Conclusion: This tool is a low-cost strategy to prioritize patients at higher risk of experiencing severe COVID-19. This tool was developed so public health teams can focus their scarce monitoring resources on individuals at higher mortality risk. This tool can be easily adapted to the context of other lower and middle-income countries.

To do this, they must involve citizens and experts, a novel arrangement that will benefit both cohorts. For the former, a more inclusive form of deliberation will offer an opportunity to contribute to political discussion and be listened to by people with political or policy‐based authority. For the latter, it will provide a venue through which expertise can be brought to bear on democratic decision making without risk of scapegoating or politicisation. More broadly, deliberation that prioritises dialogue (over, say, opinion change) affirms the principle that political decisions reflect value judgements rather than technically ‘right’ or technically ‘wrong’ answers—judgements that are legitimate if arrived at through discussion involving the people due to be affected by the resultant policy.

Therefore, we used fuzzy logic to develop fuzzy mathematical model for control of transmission and spreading of COVID19. The fuzzy control of early transmission and spreading of coronavirus by fuzzy mathematical model will be very effective. The proposed research work is on fuzzy mathematical model of intelligent decision systems under the spherical fuzzy information. In the proposed work, we will develop a newly and generalized technique for COVID19 based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) methods under spherical fuzzy environment. Finally, an illustrative the emergency situation of COVID-19 is given for demonstrating the effectiveness of the suggested method, along with a sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, showing the feasibility and reliability of its results.","Ashraf, Shahzaib; Abdullah, Saleem; Almagrabi, Alaa O.",Soft comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024412/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-020-05287-8,401

Despite the progress made in the development of the vaccine, there is an urge need for the discovery of antivirals that may better work at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. The main protease (M(pro)) of the SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial therapeutic target due to its critical function in virus replication. The α-ketoamide derivatives represent an important class of inhibitors against the M(pro) of the SARS-CoV. While there is 99% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, anti-SARS-CoV compounds may have a huge demonstration's prospect of their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied various computational approaches to investigate the inhibition potency of novel designed α-ketoamide-based compounds. In this regard, a set of 21 α-ketoamides was employed to construct a QSAR model, using the genetic algorithm-multiple linear regression (GA-MLR), as well as a pharmacophore fit model. Based on the GA-MLR model, 713 new designed molecules were reduced to 150 promising hits, which were later subject to the established pharmacophore fit model. Among the 150 compounds, the best selected compounds (3 hits) with greater pharmacophore fit score were further studied via molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations along with the Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analysis. Our approach revealed that the three hit compounds could serve as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) target.","Oubahmane, Mehdi; Hdoufane, Ismail; Bjij, Imane; Jerves, Carola; Villemin, Didier; Cherqaoui, Driss",J Mol Struct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022286021010309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149065/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.130897; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286021010309?v=s5,401

Countries around the world introduced severe social restrictions, and significant changes to health service provision in the first wave of the pandemic to suppress the spread of the virus and prioritize healthcare for those who contracted it. This study interviewed 48 hospital doctors who worked in Ireland during the first wave of the pandemic and investigated their conceptualizations of their own well-being during that time (March–May 2020). Doctors were interviewed via Zoom™ or telephone. Interview transcripts were analyzed using structured thematic analysis. Five composite narratives are presented which have been crafted to illustrate themes and experiences emerging from the data. This study found that despite the risks of contracting COVID-19, many doctors saw some improvements to their physical well-being in the first wave of the pandemic. However, most also experienced a decline in their mental well-being due to anxiety, emotional exhaustion, guilt, isolation and poor support. These findings shed light on doctor well-being during COVID-19, and the ways in which they have been affected by the pandemic, both professionally and personally. The paper concludes by highlighting how doctors’ work life and well-being can be better supported during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Creese, Jennifer; Byrne, John-Paul; Conway, Edel; Barrett, Elizabeth; Prihodova, Lucia; Humphries, Niamh",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669828/,401

651116,Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir or ravidasvir in patients with COVID‐19: A randomized controlled trial,2021-08-24,"[Image: see text] Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host cellular receptor that locks onto the surface spike protein of the 2002 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and of the novel, highly transmissible and deadly 2019 SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. One strategy to avoid the virus infection is to design peptides by extracting the human ACE2 peptidase domain α(1)-helix, which would bind to the coronavirus surface protein, preventing the virus entry into the host cells. The natural α(1)-helix peptide has a stronger affinity to SARS-CoV-2 than to SARS-CoV-1. Another peptide was designed by joining α(1) with the second portion of ACE2 that is far in the peptidase sequence yet grafted in the spike protein interface with ACE2. Previous studies have shown that, among several α(1)-based peptides, the hybrid peptidic scaffold is the one with the highest/strongest affinity for SARS-CoV-1, which is comparable to the full-length ACE2 affinity. In this work, binding and folding dynamics of the natural and designed ACE2-based peptides were simulated by the well-known coarse-grained structure-based model, with the computed thermodynamic quantities correlating with the experimental binding affinity data. Furthermore, theoretical kinetic analysis of native contact formation revealed the distinction between these processes in the presence of the different binding partners SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike domains. Additionally, our results indicate the existence of a two-state folding mechanism for the designed peptide en route to bind to the spike proteins, in contrast to a downhill mechanism for the natural α(1)-helix peptides. The presented low-cost simulation protocol demonstrated its efficiency in evaluating binding affinities and identifying the mechanisms involved in the neutralization of spike-ACE2 interaction by designed peptides. Finally, the protocol can be used as a computer-based screening of more potent designed peptides by experimentalists searching for new therapeutics against COVID-19.","Freitas, Frederico Campos; Ferreira, Paulo Henrique Borges; Favaro, Denize Cristina; Oliveira, Ronaldo Junio de",J Chem Inf Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619962/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01320,401

652994,HEART FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION RATE REDUCTION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC,2021-05-11,"The membrane proximal external region (MPER) is a highly conserved membrane-active region located at the juxtamembrane positions within class I viral fusion glycoproteins and essential for membrane fusion events during viral entry. The MPER in the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) envelope protein (Env) interacts with the lipid bilayers through a cluster of tryptophan (Trp) residues and a C-terminal cholesterol-interacting motif. The inclusion of the MPER N-terminal sequence contributes to the membrane reactivity and anti-viral efficacy of the first two anti-HIV peptidyl fusion inhibitors T20 and T1249. As a type I transmembrane protein, Env also interacts with the cellular membranes during its biosynthesis and trafficking. Here we investigated the roles of MPER membrane-active sequences during both viral entry and assembly, specifically, their roles in the design of peptidyl fusion inhibitors and the biosynthesis of viral structural proteins. We found that elimination of the membrane-active elements in MPER peptides, namely, penta Trp→alanine (Ala) substitutions and the disruption of the C-terminal cholesterol-interacting motif through deletion inhibited the anti-viral effect against the pseudotyped HIV-1. Furthermore, as compared to C-terminal dimerization, N-terminal dimerization of MPER peptides and N-terminal extension with five helix-forming residues enhanced their anti-viral efficacy substantially. The secondary structure study revealed that the penta-Trp→Ala substitutions also increased the helical content in the MPER sequence, which prompted us to study the biological relevance of such mutations in pre-fusion Env. We observed that Ala mutations of Trp664, Trp668 and Trp670 in MPER moderately lowered the intracellular and intraviral contents of Env while significantly elevating the content of another viral structural protein, p55/Gag and its derivative p24/capsid. The data suggest a role of the gp41 MPER in the membrane-reactive events during both viral entry and budding, and provide insights into the future development of anti-viral therapeutics.","Zhang, Si Min; Jejcic, Alenka; Tam, James P.; Vahlne, Anders",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0134851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26230322/,401

Methods: From March 17, 2020 - May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta with MIS-C (n=10), symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (n=10), KD (n=5), and hospitalized controls (n=4). With IRB approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) IgM and IgG binding antibodies by quantitative ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies by live-virus focus reduction neutralization assay. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed correlation analyses using linear regression. Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (R2=0.512, P<0.046) and with hospital and ICU lengths of stay (R2=0.590, P=0.010). Conclusion: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody titers may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from other similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","Rostad, Christina A.; Chahroudi, Ann; Mantus, Grace; Lapp, Stacey A.; Teherani, Mehgan; Macoy, Lisa; Rostad, Bradley S.; Milla, Sarah S.; Tarquinio, Keiko M.; Basu, Rajit K.; Kao, Carol; Linam, W.

AIM: To summarize the findings of a multinational observational cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort of consecutive adults evaluated in the emergency department and/or admitted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across 31 hospitals in four countries (1 February 2020–16 June 2020). The primary outcome was the incidence rate of cerebrovascular events, inclusive of acute ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhages (ICH), and cortical vein and/or sinus thrombosis (CVST). RESULTS: Of the 14,483 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 172 were diagnosed with an acute cerebrovascular event (1.13% of cohort; 1130/100,000 patients, 95%CI 970–1320/100,000), 68/171 (40.5%) were female and 96/172 (55.8%) were between the ages 60 and 79 years. Of these, 156 had acute ischemic stroke (1.08%; 1080/100,000 95%CI 920–1260/100,000), 28 ICH (0.19%; 190/100,000 95%CI 130–280/100,000), and 3 with CVST (0.02%; 20/100,000, 95%CI 4–60/100,000). The in-hospital mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2-associated stroke was 38.1% and for ICH 58.3%. After adjusting for clustering by site and age, baseline stroke severity, and all predictors of in-hospital mortality found in univariate regression (p < 0.1: male sex, tobacco use, arrival by emergency medical services, lower platelet and lymphocyte counts, and intracranial occlusion), cryptogenic stroke mechanism (aOR 5.01, 95%CI 1.63–15.44, p < 0.01), older age (aOR 1.78, 95%CI 1.07–2.94, p = 0.03), and lower lymphocyte count on admission (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34–0.98, p = 0.04) were the only independent predictors of mortality among patients with stroke and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with a small but significant risk of clinically relevant cerebrovascular events, particularly ischemic stroke. The mortality rate is high for COVID-19-associated cerebrovascular complications; therefore, aggressive monitoring and early intervention should be pursued to mitigate poor outcomes.","Siegler, James E; Cardona, Pere; Arenillas, Juan F; Talavera, Blanca; Guillen, Ana N; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; de Lera, Mercedes; Khandelwal, Priyank; Bach, Ivo; Patel, Pratit; Singla, Amit; Requena, Manuel; Ribo, Marc; Jillella, Dinesh V; Rangaraju, Srikant; Nogueira, Raul G; Haussen, Diogo C; Vazquez, Alejandro R; Urra, Xabier; Chamorro, Ángel; Román, Luis S; Thon, Jesse M; Then, Ryna; Sanborn, Emma; de la Ossa, Natalia P; Millàn, Mònica; Ruiz, Isaac N; Mansour, Ossama Y; Megahed, Mohammed; Tiu, Cristina; Terecoasa, Elena O; Radu, Răzvan A; Nguyen, Thanh N; Curiale, Gioacchino; Kaliaev, Artem; Czap, Alexandra L; Sebaugh, Jacob; Zha, Alicia M; Liebeskind, David S; Ortega-Gutierrez, Santiago; Farooqui, Mudassir; Hassan, Ameer E; Preston, Laurie; Patterson, Mary S; Bushnaq, Saif; Zaidat, Osama; Jovin, Tudor G",Int J Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493020959216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852257/,401

S. workforce and 69 percent of graduates from an example technological university. Yet, university research and education have not followed suit. Clearly, services research and education deserve our critical attention and support since services — and services innovation — serve as an indispensable engine for global economic growth. The theme of this paper is that we can and should build services research and education on what has occurred in manufacturing research (especially in regard to customization and intellectual property) and education; indeed, services and manufactured goods become indistinguishable as they are jointly co-produced in real-time. Fortunately, inasmuch as manufacturing concepts, methodologies and technologies have been developed and refined over a long period of time (i.e., since the 1800s), the complementary set of concepts, methodologies and technologies for services are more obvious. However, while new technologies (e.g., the Internet) and globalization trends have served to enable, if not facilitate, services innovation, the same technologies (e.g., the Internet) and 21st Century realities (e.g., terrorism) are making services innovation a far more complex problem and, in fact, may be undermining previous innovations in both services and manufacturing.

In the current study, grab sampling of primary influent was performed every 2 hours over two different 24-hour periods at two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in northern Indiana, USA. In primary influent, uncorrected, recovery-corrected, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV)-normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations demonstrated ordinal agreement with increasing clinical COVID-19 positivity, but not COVID-19 cases. Primary influent SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations exhibited greater variation than PMMoV RNA concentrations as expected for lower shedding prevalence. The bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) process control recovery efficiency was low (mean: 0.91%) and highly variable (coefficient of variation: 51% - 206%) over the four sampling events with significant differences between the two WWTPs (p <0.0001).

Recovery-corrected SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations better reflected within-day changes in primary influent flow rate and fecal content, as indicated by PMMoV concentrations. These observations highlight the importance of assessing the process recovery efficiency, which is highly variable, using an appropriate process control.

This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and identify risk and protective factors during pregnancy. METHODS: Participants were 303 pregnant individuals from Ontario, Canada. Depression, anxiety and insomnia were measured using validated questionnaires. COVID-related experiences (i.e., financial difficulties, relationship conflict, social isolation) were assessed in relation to mental health. Social support and cognitive appraisal of the pandemic were examined as protective factors. RESULTS: 57% of the sample reported clinically elevated depression, >30% reported elevated worries, and 19% reported elevated insomnia. Depression (t = 25.14, p < .0001) and anxiety (t = 17.21, p < .0001) levels were higher than non-COVID pregnant samples. Social isolation, financial trouble, relationship difficulties and threat of COVID-19 were associated with mental health. Social support (r(range) −.24 to −.38, p <.01) was associated with lower mental health problems and negative cognitive appraisal (r(range) .20 to .33, p <.01) was linked to more mental health problems. Furthermore, social support and cognitive appraisal interacted (β = -.92, SE = .41, p < .05), such that higher social support acted as a protective factor, particularly for those who appraise the impact of COVID-19 to be more negative.

We report here the X-ray structures of the syn1 and syn2 transmembrane subunit ectodomains, featuring a 6-helix bundle (6HB) typical of the post-fusion state of gamma-retrovirus and filovirus fusion proteins. Contrary to the filoviruses, for which the fusion glycoprotein was crystallized both in the post-fusion and in the spring-loaded pre-fusion form, the highly unstable nature of the syncytins' prefusion form has precluded structural studies. We undertook a proline-scanning approach searching for regions in the syn1 6HB central helix that tolerate the introduction of helix-breaker residues and still fold correctly in the pre-fusion form. We found that there is indeed such a region, located two α-helical turns downstream a stutter in the central coiled-coil helix - precisely where the breaks of the spring-loaded helix of the filoviruses map. These mutants were fusion-inactive as they cannot form the 6HB, similar to the “SOSIP” mutant of HIV Env that allowed the high-resolution structural characterization of its labile pre-fusion form. These results now open a new window of opportunity to engineer more stable variants of the elusive pre-fusion trimer of the syncytins and other gamma-retroviruses envelope proteins for structural characterization.","Ruigrok, Katinka; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Buchrieser, Julian; Baquero, Eduard; Hellert, Jan; Baron, Bruno; England, Patrick; Schwartz, Olivier; Rey, Felix A.; Backovic, Marija",J Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283619306163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31711961/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283619306163; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.10.020,401
656778,Obesity is Associated with More Critical Illness in COVID-19,2020-07-02,"Covid-19 has caused worldwide devastation. IFIH1 is a pattern recognition receptor that senses coronavirus RNA and triggers interferon production as a first line of viral immune defense. The role of IFIH1 polymorphism, rs1990760 (C>T; aaA946T) in the epidemiology of viral infection is well studied, and the minor allele T resists viral infection. Knock-in mice with mutated IFIH1 protein (946T) for this allele have enhanced interferon production and protection from lethal viral infection. The minor allele frequency (Tmaf) varies widely from Africans (0.06 to 0.35) to Chinese (0.19 to 0.23) to Caucasians (0.56 to 0.69). During the initial days of infection when the social restrictions were not imposed, I show that the infection rate in Italy was lower as expected from its higher Tmaf (0.56) than that in China (Tmaf for southern China, 0.23). The infection rate in the USA and Spain was intermediate between those two countries despite higher Caucasian overall Tmaf (0.69), perhaps due to a more admixed African population in these countries. These analyses suggest that African-Americans and Chinese with low Tmaf of rs1990760 are more vulnerable to SARS-COV2 infection, apart from other genetic factors or socioeconomic conditions in these population. Taken together, an IFN-beta supplement might aid in preventing COVID-19 infection and help in development of herd immunity.","Maiti, Amit K.",Immunogenetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00251-020-01174-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32737579/,401
657851,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on Mental Illness Symptoms in Spain in the COVID-19 Crisis,2021-04-14,"Abstract The paper maps and evaluates the main economic, institutional, and behavioural barriers to the implementation of energy efficiency in final uses. Barriers prevent the achievement of targets of energy efficiency policies and measures. Assessing the relevance of barriers can lead to their consideration in goal-setting by policy-makers either by reducing ambition or by incorporating solutions to mitigate barriers, We consider three main categories of barriers: economic, institutional, and behavioural ones, in buildings and transport sectors. In order to assess the relevance of each specific barrier in these categories, a survey to experts in eight Countries (Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Estonia, United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium and Serbia) has been performed. The relevance of barriers is assessed by two levels of analysis: 1. their impact on policies and measures, and 2. their impact on the diffusion of key clean technologies and interventions in the two sectors. In the building sector, we find that the most relevant barriers relate to economic and behavioural categories. In the transport sector, we find that the most relevant barriers relate to institutional and economic categories. Economic barriers are also the most relevant in limiting the diffusion of technologies and interventions in both sectors. Results highlight the relevance of identifying and assessing barriers in order to improve policy design.","Bagaini, Annamaria; Colelli, Francesco; Croci, Edoardo; Molteni, Tania",The Electricity Journal,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619020301123; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1040619020301123,401

We aim to describe rates and pathogens involved in co-infection or subsequent infections and their impact on clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods Incidence of and pathogens associated with co-infections, or subsequent infections, were analyzed in a multicenter observational cohort. Clinical outcomes were compared between patients with a bacterial respiratory co-infection (BRC) and those without. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed evaluating survival. Results A total of 289 patients were included, 48 (16.6%) had any co-infection and 25 (8.7%) had a BRC. No significant differences in comorbidities were observed between patients with co-infection and those without. Compared to those without, patients with a BRC had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interleukin-6 levels. ICU admission (84.0 vs 31.8%), mechanical ventilation (72.0 vs 23.9%) and in-hospital mortality (45.0 vs 9.8%) were more common in patients with BRC compared to those without a co-infection. In Cox proportional hazards regression, following adjustment for age, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroid administration, and pre-existing comorbidities, patients with BRC had an increased risk for in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.39 to 8.16; P = 0.007). Subsequent infections were uncommon, with 21 infections occurring in 16 (5.5%) patients. Conclusions Co-infections are uncommon among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, however, when BRC occurs it is associated with worse clinical outcomes including higher mortality.","Crotty, M.

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to summarize the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of heart transplant recipients with COVID‐19. We searched electronic databases from inception to January 11, 2021. Thirty‐nine articles (22 case reports and 17 cohorts) involving 415 patients were included. The mean age was 59.9 ± 15.7 years and 77% of patients were men. In cohort studies including outpatients and inpatients, the hospitalization rate was 77%. The most common symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (67%). Inflammatory biomarkers (C‐reactive protein and procalcitonin) were above the normal range. Forty‐eight percent of patients presented with severe or critical COVID‐19. Hydroxychloroquine (54%), azithromycin (14%), and lopinavir/ritonavir (14%) were the most commonly used drugs. Forty‐nine percent of patients discontinued the baseline regimen of antimetabolites. In contrast, 59% and 73% continued the same regimen of calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids, respectively. Short‐term mortality among cohorts limited to inpatients was 25%. Our review suggests that heart transplant recipients with COVID‐19 exhibited similar demographic and clinical features to the general population.

METHODS A cross-sectional study of 12 566 pregnant and postpartum women (obstetric group) and 90 025 nonpregnant women (nonobstetric group) aged 15-49 years reported with severe ARDS in 2020. The Brazilian ARDS Surveillance System was used to compare the outcome (death or cure) between the groups, considering age, race, or comorbidities. RESULTS The mortality rate related to ARDS/COVID-19 in the obstetric group was 7.8% (377/4853) compared with 13.9% (5946/42 915) in the nonobstetric group. Comorbidity was associated with increased fatality cases for both groups, but higher in the nonobstetric group (22.8% vs 13.3%). In the obstetric group, deaths related to COVID-19 were concentrated in the third trimester or postpartum period. If comorbidity was present, deaths by COVID-19 were 4.4 times higher than ARDS due to other etiologies, and twice higher in women who self-reported as black (13.7%) than white women (6.7%). Considering ADRS etiology, deaths by COVID-19 were 3.4-6.7 times higher than any other etiology. CONCLUSION ARDS related to COVID-19 in obstetric patients was an important factor for worse clinical outcomes, with 3-6 times higher death rates than other ARDS etiologies. Pregnant and postpartum women with severe ARDS related to COVID-19 had a lower fatality rate than nonpregnant women, even with associated comorbidity.","Scheler, Carlos A; Discacciati, Michelle G; Vale, Diama B; Lajos, Giuliane J; de Castro Surita, Fernanda; Teixeira, Julio C",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185314/,401

Key questions are whether hospital clinicians have experienced more stress in the care of COVID-19 patients and whether patient safety and quality of care have changed. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using an online survey with clinicians in German hospitals on working conditions and quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing clinicians with (MmK) vs. without direct contact (MoK) to COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: In total, 2122 clinicians participated. Most clinicians were physicians (15.4%, n = 301) or nurses (77.0%, n = 1505) working in major acute care hospitals (46.0%, n = 899). Every second respondent stated that they worked more than usual (46.4%, n = 907) and took on additional activities (47.7%, n = 932). A quarter of the participants did not receive any training or get instructions in devices (21.5%, n = 421). Only 51.5% (n = 1006) of the respondents were provided with sufficient personal protective equipment. More than 30% (32.7%, n = 639) were more satisfied than usual. The comparing clinicans with vs. without direkt contact to Covid-19 patients worked more shifts than usual (> 2 shifts: 24.1%, n = 306 vs. 13.7%, n = 63, p < 0.001) and without instruction (27.9%, n = 364 vs. 17.1%), n = 57, p < 0.001). In terms of patient safety, there were more deficiencies in the care, mechanical ventilation and nursing (all p < 0.001).

Here, using a recombinant reporter virus-based compound screening approach, we identified several small-molecule inhibitors that potently block the replication of the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Two compounds, nitazoxanide and JIB-04 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC(50) of 4.90 μM and 0.69 μM, respectively, with specificity indices of greater than 150. Both inhibitors had in vitro antiviral activity in multiple cell types against some DNA and RNA viruses, including porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. In an in vivo porcine model of coronavirus infection, administration of JIB-04 reduced virus infection and associated tissue pathology, which resulted in improved body weight gain and survival.

Nodules were surgically removed and each time histopathological diagnosis was fat necrosis and fibrosing to pyogranulomatous panniculitis. After the second surgery the alpha (α)‐tocopherol concentration in serum of the cat was examined and the result (21 mg/L) exceeded the upper limit of the reference interval (3–11 mg/L). Vitamin E amount in diet fed solely in the past was checked as studies have shown that vitamin E amounts in food significantly influence vitamin E concentrations in serum. For comparative purposes, α‐tocopherol concentrations were determined in sera of healthy control cats. Additionally, vitamin E amount in wet food from different manufacturers was analysed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC‐MS). The results showed that the diet did not have higher vitamin E amounts compared to other diets. All control cats had similar high serum α‐tocopherol concentrations.

664687,Awake Prone Positioning Strategy for Nonintubated Hypoxic Patients with COVID-19: A Pilot Trial with Embedded Implementation Evaluation,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although adenovirus (ADV) infection occurs steadily all year round in Korea and the identification of respiratory viral coinfections has been increasing following the introduction of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction tests, the clinical impact of viral coinfection in children with ADV infection has rarely been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of children diagnosed with ADV infection were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled children were divided into two groups based on the identified respiratory viruses: ADV group and coinfection group. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In total, 105 children (60 males and 45 females) with a median age of 29 months (range: 0-131 months) diagnosed with an ADV infection were enrolled. Fever (99.0%) was by far the most frequent symptom, followed by respiratory (82.9%), and gastrointestinal (22.9%) symptoms. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were diagnosed in 56 (53.3%), and 32 (30.5%) children, respectively. Five (4.8%) children received oxygen therapy, and no child died due to ADV infection. Coinfection was diagnosed in 32 (30.5%) children, with rhinovirus (46.9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (21.9%) being the most frequent. The proportions of children younger than 24 months (P <0.001), with underlying medical conditions (P = 0.020), and diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (P = 0.011) were significantly higher in the coinfection group than in the ADV group. In a multivariate analysis, only the younger age was significantly associated with coinfection (P <0.001). Although more children in the coinfection group received oxygen therapy (P = 0.029), the duration of fever and hospitalization was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral coinfection with ADV occurred more frequently in children younger than 24 months of age compared with children aged 24 months or older. Respiratory viral coinfection may increase the severity of ADV infection, however, appropriate therapy prevented prolonged hospitalization and poor prognosis due to coinfection.","Lee, Hyun Jun; Seo, Young Eun; Han, Seung Beom; Jeong, Dae Chul; Kang, Jin Han",Infect Chemother,https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2016.48.4.309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27883373/,401

However, whether vapers are more susceptible to COVID-19 is unknown. Using integrated data in each US state from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), United States Census Bureauand the 1Point3Acres.com website, generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with negative binomial distribution assumption and log link functions were used to examine the association of statewide e-cigarette use prevalence with number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US on a state level from January 21, 2020 to April 25, 2020. The weighted proportion of vapers who used e-cigarettes every day or some days ranged from 2.86% to 6.42% for US states. Statistically significant associations were observed between the weighted proportion of vapers and number of COVID-19 cases as well as COVID-19 deaths in the US after adjusting for the weighted proportion of smokers and other significant covariates in the GEE models. With every one percent increase in weighted proportion of vapers in each state, the number of COVID-19 cases increase by 0.3139 (95% CI: 0.0554 – 0.5723) and the number of COVID-19 deaths increase by 0.3730 (95% CI: 0.0815 – 0.6646) in log scale in each US state. The positive associations between the proportion of vapers and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each US state in this ecological study suggest an increased susceptibility of vapers to COVID-19 on a state level and warrants further investigation.","Li, Dongmei; Croft, Daniel P.; Ossip, Deborah J.; Xie, Zidian",Prev Med Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335520302126?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257909/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211335520302126,401

667149,Guillan barre syndrome in post Covid-19 infection in children,2021-06-20,"A COVID-19 vaccine with capability to induce early protection is needed to efficiently eliminate viral spread. Here, we demonstrate the development of a nanoparticle vaccine candidate, REVC-128, in which multiple trimeric spike ectodomain subunits with glycine (G) at position 614 were multimerized onto a nanoparticle. In-vitro characterization of this vaccine confirms its structural and antigenic integrity. In-vivo immunogenicity evaluation in mice indicates that a single dose of this vaccine induces potent serum neutralizing antibody titer at two weeks post immunization, which is significantly higher than titer induced by trimeric spike protein without nanoparticle presentation. The comparison of serum binding to spike subunits between animals immunized by spike with and without nanoparticle presentation indicates that nanoparticle prefers the display of spike RBD (Receptor-Binding Domain) over S2 subunit, likely resulting in a more neutralizing but less cross-reactive antibody response. Moreover, a Syrian golden hamster in-vivo model for SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge was implemented at two weeks post a single dose of REVC-128 immunization. The results show that vaccination protects hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge with evidence of steady body weight, suppressed viral loads and alleviation of tissue damage (lung and nares) for protected animals, compared with ~10% weight loss, higher viral loads and tissue damage in unprotected animals. Furthermore, the data show that vaccine REVC-128 is thermostable at up to 37°C for at least 4 weeks. These findings, along with a long history of safety for protein vaccines, suggest that the REVC-128 is a safe, stable and efficacious single-shot vaccine candidate to induce the earliest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gu, Maggie; Torres, Jonathan L.; Greenhouse, Jack; Wallace, Shannon; Chiang, Chi-I; Jackson, Abigail M.; Porto, Maciel; Kar, Swagata; Li, Yuxing; Ward, Andrew B.; Wang, Yimeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.438218,401

Children have been excluded from the vaccination programmes owing to their lower vulnerability to COVID-19 and to the special protections that apply to children’s exposure to new biological products. WHO guidelines and national laws focus on medical safety in the process of vaccine approval, and on national security in the process of emergency authorisation. Because children suffer much from social distancing, it is argued that the harms from containment measures should be factored in a broader perspective on the good of the child. Considering the available knowledge on the disease, vaccine, and coping strategies, the decision about vaccine access to children is a public responsibility. The ultimate choice is a matter of paediatric informed consent. Moreover, jurisdictions that permit non-participation in established childhood vaccination programmes should also permit choice of vaccines outside of the approved programmes. Even if vaccine supply is too short to cover the paediatric population, the a priori exclusion of children is unjust. It may also exacerbate local and global inequalities. The second part of the paper delineates a prudent and ethical scheme for gradual incorporation of minors in vaccination programmes that includes a rigorous postvaccination monitoring. This is a theoretical paper in ethics that uses the Pfizer vaccine as a stock example, without discussing possible differences among existing vaccines. The key purpose is reflection on the good of the child in emergencies and vaccine policymaking.","Brusa, Margherita; Barilan, Yechiel Michael",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117126/,401
671667,Antihypertensive drugs and risk of COVID-19?,2020-03-26,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects the central nervous system (CNS) white matter, and for which no effective cure exists. Indeed, whether the primary event in MS pathology affects myelin or axons of the CNS remains unclear. Animal models are necessary to identify the immunopathological mechanisms involved in MS and to develop novel therapeutic and reparative approaches. Specifically, viral models of chronic demyelination and axonal damage have been used to study the contribution of viruses in human MS, and they have led to important breakthroughs in our understanding of MS pathology. The Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model is one of the most commonly used MS models, although other viral models are also used, including neurotropic strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that induce chronic inflammatory demyelination with similar histological features to those observed in MS. This review will discuss the immunopathological mechanisms involved in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). The TMEV model reproduces a chronic progressive disease due to the persistence of the virus for the entire lifespan in susceptible mice. The evolution and significance of the axonal damage and neuroinflammation, the importance of epitope spread from viral to myelin epitopes, the presence of abortive remyelination and the existence of a brain pathology in addition to the classical spinal cord demyelination, are some of the findings that will be discussed in the context of this TMEV-IDD model. Despite their limitations, viral models remain an important tool to study the etiology of MS, and to understand the clinical and pathological variability associated with this disease.","Mecha, Miriam; Carrillo-Salinas, Francisco J.; Mestre, Leyre; Feliú, Ana; Guaza, Carmen",Prog Neurobiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2012.11.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301008212001712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23201558/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008212001712,401

METHODS: We evaluated a publicly available DCNN-based bone age application. The DCNN was trained on 12,612 pediatric hand radiographs and won the 2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge (concordance of 0.991 with radiologist ground-truth). We used the application to analyze 50 left-hand radiographs (appropriate data inputs) and seven classes of inappropriate data inputs in radiological (i.e., chest radiographs) and non-radiological (i.e., image of street numbers) domains. For each image, we noted if (1) the application distinguished between appropriate and inappropriate data inputs and (2) inference time per image. Mean inference times were compared using ANOVA. RESULTS: The 16Bit Bone Age application calculated bone age for all pediatric hand radiographs with mean inference time of 1.1 s. The application did not distinguish between pediatric hand radiographs and inappropriate image types, including radiological and non-radiological domains. The application inappropriately calculated bone age for all inappropriate image types, with mean inference time of 1.1 s for all categories (p = 1). CONCLUSION: A publicly available DCNN-based bone age application failed to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate data inputs and calculated bone age for inappropriate images. The awareness of inappropriate outputs based on inappropriate DCNN input is important if tasks such as bone age determination are automated, emphasizing the need for appropriate oversight at the data input and verification stage to avoid unrecognized erroneous results.","Yi, Paul H.; Arun, Anirudh; Hafezi-Nejad, Nima; Choy, Garry; Sair, Haris I.; Hui, Ferdinand K.; Fritz, Jan",Skeletal Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351456/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-021-03880-y,401

Students returning to university campuses may exacerbate COVID-19 dynamics in the surrounding community. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in a mid-sized city currently experiencing a low infection rate. We evaluated the impact of 20,000 university students arriving on September 1 in terms of cumulative COVID-19 infections, time to peak infections, and the timing and peak level of critical care occupancy. We also considered how these impacts might be mitigated through screening interventions targeted to students. RESULTS: If arriving students reduce their contacts by 40% compared to pre-COVID levels, the total number of infections in the community increases by 115% (from 3,515 to 7,551), with 70% of the incremental infections occurring in the general population, and an incremental 19 COVID-19 deaths. Screening students every 5 days reduces the number of infections attributable to the student population by 42% and the total COVID-19 deaths by 8. One-time mass screening of students prevents fewer infections than 5-day screening, but is more efficient, requiring 196 tests needed to avert one infection instead of 237.

672913,Electrocardiographic Findings and In-Hospital Mortality of COVID-19 Patients; a Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-06-12,"Coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs) can act as proteases that process virus-encoded large replicase polyproteins and also as deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. Like the PLPs of other coronaviruses (CoVs), the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) PLP catalyzes proteolysis of Gly-Gly dipeptide bonds to release mature cleavage products. However, the other functions of the IBV PLP are not well understood. In this study, we found that IBV exhibits strong global DUB activity with significant reductions of the levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-, K48-, and K63-conjugated proteins. The DUB activity exhibited a clear time dependence, with stronger DUB activity in the early stage of viral infection. Furthermore, the IBV replicase-encoded PLP, including the downstream transmembrane (TM) domain, is a DUB enzyme and dramatically reduced the level of Ub-conjugated proteins, while processing both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, PLP did not cause any reduction of haemagglutinin (HA)-Ub-conjugated proteins. In addition, mutations of the catalytic residues of PLP-TM, Cys1274Ser and His1437Lys, reduced DUB activity against Ub-, K48- and K63- conjugated proteins, indicating that the DUB activity of the PLP-TM wild-type protein is not completely dependent on its catalytic activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that the IBV-encoded PLP-TM functions as a DUB enzyme and suggest that IBV may interfere with the activation of host antiviral signaling pathway by degrading polyubiquitin-associated proteins.","Yu, Liping; Zhang, Xiaorong; Wu, Tianqi; Wang, Yuyang; Meng, Jie; Liu, Qian; Niu, Xiaosai; Wu, Yantao",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28316013/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3328-y,401

677588,The Prevalence of Psychological Status During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021-05-04,"ABSTRACT: Vaccination is an effective intervention against epidemics. Previous work has demonstrated that psychological cognition affects individual behavior. However, perceptual differences between individuals, as well as the dynamics of perceptual evolution, are not taken into account. In order to explore how these realistic characteristics of psychological cognition influence collective vaccination behavior, we propose a prospect theory based evolutionary vaccination game model, where the evolution of reference points is used to characterize changes in perception. We compare the fractions of vaccinated individuals and infected individuals under variable reference points with those under the expected utility theory and the fixed reference point, and highlight the role of evolving perception in promoting vaccination and contributing to epidemic control. We find that the epidemic size under variable reference point is always less than that under the expected utility theory. Finding that there exists a vaccination cost threshold for the cognitive effect, we develop a novel mixed-reference-point mechanism by combining individual psychological characteristics with network topological feature. The effectiveness of this mechanism in controlling the network epidemics is verified with numerical simulations. Compared with pure reference points, the mixed-reference-point mechanism can effectively reduce the final epidemic size, especially at a large vaccination cost.

We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. First, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-2-S) reached higher levels in pseudoparticles when produced at 33°C instead of 37°C. Even stronger preference for the upper airway temperature of 33°C was evident for the S protein of HCoV-229E, a common cold coronavirus. In contrast, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV favored 37°C, in accordance with their preference for the lower airways. Next, SARS-2-S proved efficiently activated by TMPRSS13, besides the previously identified host cell protease TMPRSS2, which may broaden the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS13 was found to be an effective spike activator for the virulent coronaviruses but not the common cold HCoV-229E virus. Activation by these proteases requires pre-cleavage of the SARS-2-S S1/S2 cleavage loop, and both its furin motif and extended loop length proved critical to achieve virus entry into airway epithelial cells. Finally, we show that the D614G mutation in SARS-2-S increases S protein stability and expression at 37°C, and promotes virus entry via cathepsin B/L activation. These spike properties might promote virus spread, potentially explaining why the G614 variant is currently predominating worldwide. Collectively, our findings indicate how the coronavirus spike protein is fine-tuned towards the temperature and protease conditions of the airways, to enhance virus transmission and pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is related to abundant replication in the upper airways, which is not observed for other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. We here reveal features of the coronavirus spike (S) protein, which optimize the virus towards different parts of the respiratory tract. Coronavirus spikes exhibit distinct temperature preference to precisely match the upper (~33°C) or lower (37°C) airways. We identified airway proteases that activate the spike for virus entry into cells, including one protease that may mediate coronavirus virulence. Also, a link was seen between spike stability and entry via endosomal proteases. This mechanism of spike fine-tuning could explain why the SARS-CoV-2 spike-D614G mutant is more transmissible and therefore globally predominant.","Laporte, Manon; Stevaert, Annelies; Raeymaekers, Valerie; Van Berwaer, Ria; Martens, Katleen; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Naesens, Lieve",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.374603,401
679123,Are women with asthma at increased risk for severe COVID-19?,2021-01-12,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 1% of the world population has now been infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With cases still rising and vaccines just beginning to rollout, we are still several months away from seeing reductions in daily case numbers, hospitalisations, and mortality. Therefore, there is a still an urgent need to control the disease spread by repurposing existing therapeutics. Owing to antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and cardioprotective actions, statin therapy has been considered as a plausible approach to improve COVID-19 outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of statins on 3 COVID-19 outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, tracheal intubation, and death. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases using keywords related to our aims up to November 2, 2020. All published observational studies and randomised clinical trials on COVID-19 and statins were retrieved. Statistical analysis with random effects modelling was performed using STATA16 software. RESULTS: The final selected studies (n = 24 studies; 32,715 patients) showed significant reductions in ICU admission (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.58–1.06; n = 10; I(2) = 58.5%) and death (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55–0.88; n = 21; I(2) = 82.5%) outcomes, with no significant effect on tracheal intubation (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57–1.11; n = 7; I(2)= 89.0%). Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that death was reduced further by in-hospital application of stains (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22–0.73, n = 3; I(2) = 82.5%), compared with pre-hospital use (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60–0.98, n = 18; I(2) = 81.8%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings call attention to the need for systematic clinical studies to assess both pre- and in-hospital use of statins as a potential means of reducing COVID-19 disease severity, particularly in terms of reduction of ICU admission and total mortality reduction.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mohammadi, Seyede Momeneh; Heidari Beni, Farshad; Banach, Maciej; Guest, Paul C.; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Arch Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms/132950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025827/,401

679156,Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Physical and Psychological Wellbeing in Cardiovascular Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND. More than one million infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been confirmed. While PCR-based assays are used for diagnosis, high through-put serologic methods are needed to detect antibodies for seroserveillance and for identification of seroconversion, potential plasma donors, and the nature of the immune response to this pathogen. METHODS. A Luminex binding assay was used to assess the presence of antibodies in human sera from COVID-19-infected and -uninfected individuals specific for two recombinant proteins of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS. Fluorochrome-labeled beads were coated with a recombinant soluble stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain or its central portion, the receptor binding domain (RBD). Coated beads were incubated with sera, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-human total Ig antibodies and phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled streptavidin. Readout using a Luminex analyzer clearly differentiated between sera of the infected and uninfected subjects, delineating a wide range of serum antibody levels in infected subjects. INTERPRETATION. Antibody assays of sera can identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have seroconverted, as well as subjects who have been infected and recovered. The use of the Luminex binding Ab assay has the advantage that it can be run in approximately 2.5 hours, uses very little antigen, and permits a high through-put of samples/day. FUNDING.

The results of previous transmission studies suggested that the aetiological agent of WPD is most likely a virus. However, the identity of the presumed viral agent had not been elucidated. In the current report, we describe identification of a novel virus from tissues of WPD-affected possums using a combination of next generation sequencing and traditional molecular methods. The proportion of possums positive for the novel virus by PCR was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) among animals with WPD than clinically healthy possums, strongly suggesting an aetiological involvement of the virus in WPD. Analysis of the partial genomic sequence of the putative WPD virus indicated that it is a novel nidovirus, most closely related to the current members of the family Arteriviridae.","Dunowska, M.; Biggs, P.J.; Zheng, T.; Perrott, M.R.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113511006043; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22153843/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113511006043,401

Here, we report the X-ray structure of a previously characterized HR1/HR2 complex of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. As expected, the HR1 and HR2 segments are organized in antiparallel orientations within a rod-like molecule. The HR1 helices form an exceptionally long (120 Å) internal coiled coil stabilized by hydrophobic and polar interactions. A striking arrangement of conserved asparagine and glutamine residues of HR1 propagates from two central chloride ions, providing hydrogen-bonding “zippers” that strongly constrain the path of the HR2 main chain, forcing it to adopt an extended conformation at either end of a short HR2 α-helix.","Duquerroy, Stéphane; Vigouroux, Armelle; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Rey, Félix A.; Jan Bosch, Berend",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15840526/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682205001200; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682205001200,401
679630,Invasive strategy for COVID patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome: The first multicenter Italian experience,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk stratification in individuals with dysmetabolism is a major unmet need. Genetic predisposition contributes to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to exploit robust polygenic risk scores (PRS) that can be evaluated in the clinic to gain insight into the causal relationship between NAFLD and HCC, and to improve HCC risk stratification. METHODS: We examined at-risk individuals (NAFLD cohort, n = 2,566; 226 with HCC; and a replication cohort of 427 German patients with NAFLD) and the general population (UK Biobank [UKBB] cohort, n = 364,048; 202 with HCC). Variants in PNPLA3-TM6SF2-GCKR-MBOAT7 were combined in a hepatic fat PRS (PRS-HFC), and then adjusted for HSD17B13 (PRS-5). RESULTS: In the NAFLD cohort, the adjusted impact of genetic risk variants on HCC was proportional to the predisposition to fatty liver (p = 0.002) with some heterogeneity in the effect. PRS predicted HCC more robustly than single variants (p <10(-13)). The association between PRS and HCC was mainly mediated through severe fibrosis, but was independent of fibrosis in clinically relevant subgroups, and was also observed in those without severe fibrosis (p <0.05). In the UKBB cohort, PRS predicted HCC independently of classical risk factors and cirrhosis (p <10(-7)). In the NAFLD cohort, we identified high PRS cut-offs (≥0.532/0.495 for PRS-HFC/PRS-5) that in the UKBB cohort detected HCC with ~90% specificity but limited sensitivity; PRS predicted HCC both in individuals with (p <10(-5)) and without cirrhosis (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a causal relationship between hepatic fat and HCC. PRS improved the accuracy of HCC detection and may help stratify HCC risk in individuals with dysmetabolism, including those without severe liver fibrosis. Further studies are needed to validate our findings. LAY SUMMARY: By analyzing variations in genes that contribute to fatty liver disease, we developed two risk scores to help predict liver cancer in individuals with obesity-related metabolic complications. These risk scores can be easily tested in the clinic. We showed that the risk scores helped to identify the risk of liver cancer both in high-risk individuals and in the general population.","Bianco, Cristiana; Jamialahmadi, Oveis; Pelusi, Serena; Baselli, Guido; Dongiovanni, Paola; Zanoni, Irene; Santoro, Luigi; Maier, Silvia; Liguori, Antonio; Meroni, Marica; Borroni, Vittorio; D’Ambrosio, Roberta; Spagnuolo, Rocco; Alisi, Anna; Federico, Alessandro; Bugianesi, Elisabetta; Petta, Salvatore; Miele, Luca; Vespasiani-Gentilucci, Umberto; Anstee, Quentin M.; Stickel, Felix; Hampe, Jochen; Fischer, Janett; Berg, Thomas; Fracanzani, Anna Ludovica; Soardo, Giorgio; Reeves, Helen; Prati, Daniele; Romeo, Stefano; Valenti, Luca",J Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2020.11.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33248170/,401

Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu(TM) database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau (τ) using the formula t=τ/2u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.","Yu, Wen-Bin; Tang, Guang-Da; Zhang, Li; Corlett, Richard T.",Zool Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351056/; https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2020.022,401

Implementation assessment during disrupted operational norms (“business not as usual”) distills challenges solved by prioritization from those requiring solutions that address more fundamental barriers to change. This commentary retrospectively analyzes health system implementation of a clinical practice guideline intended to support COVID-19 treatment. We use the QUERI roadmap to reflect upon implementation strategy within the context of a nascent LHS framework. In doing so, we identify aspects of implementation that were facilitated by the COVID-19-altered environment, enduring implementation challenges with respect to fidelity and sustainability, and key areas of necessary continued investment to strengthen a responsive system for learning and improvement. Moving forward, COVID-19 response highlighted key investments that bridge learning health system structures to implementation practices. This includes structures that (1) accelerate ideas that emerge from the front lines, (2) promote “living” care guidelines that are supported by continuous review of emergent evidence, and (3) enhance analytic capacity that supports organizational learning. COVID-19 response has offered opportunities for “new norm” thinking around what’s possible to build out a learning health system. Strategic application of implementation frameworks to learning health system infrastructure has highlighted necessary investments that build and sustain a more responsive, improvement-oriented organization.","Cross, Dori A.; Pestka, Deborah L.; White, Katie M.; Shah, Surbhi",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454821001351?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542454821001351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568766/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2021.09.002,401

An online survey was conducted in September 2020 involving 10,000 Japanese survey monitors, selected according to population distribution. During the stay-at-home request, 34% participants extended their at-home hours. More respondents in the group with extended at-home hours experienced an increase or decrease in total physical activity, snacking, food intake, alcohol drinking, and body weight than those in the group with nonextended at-home hours. Some of these changes had a trend according to age. The prevalence of most of these changes decreased when at-home hours returned to normal after the stay-at-home request period; however, increased alcohol consumption and increased or decreased body weight persisted.

Currently there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We compared the effectiveness of three scoring systems: the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS) systems, for predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used for these assessments, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify the cumulative risk for 28-day mortality according to the NEWS stratification. RESULTS: For predicting 28-day mortality, NEWS was superior to qSOFA (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.779, P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between NEWS and SIRS (AUROC, 0.867 vs. 0.639, P = 0.100). For predicting critical outcomes, NEWS was superior to both SIRS (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.744, P = 0.032) and qSOFA (AUROC, 0.918 vs. 0.760, P = 0.012). Survival time was significantly shorter for patients with NEWS ≥ 7 than for patients with NEWS < 7.

Minimal literature is available to guide best practices. APPROACH The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) implemented a completely virtual interview (VI) process in April/May 2020. Large-group sessions for applicants, interviews with applicants, and ISMMS Admission Committee meetings occurred via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc., San Jose, California). Large-group sessions and committee meetings occurred via communal conference calls, while one-on-one, semi-structured interviews occurred in individual breakout rooms. ISMMS offered live, virtual question-and-answer sessions with students and faculty, plus digital resources describing program features. After the interview day, applicants and interviewers were invited to complete anonymous surveys regarding their experiences with and perspectives of VI. OUTCOMES Of 125 applicants and 20 interviewers, 99 (79%) and 18 (90%), respectively, completed at least part of the survey. Of the applicants, 85/95 (89%) agreed VI met or exceeded expectations, many praising the day's organization and convenience, and 71/95 (75%) agreed they received a sufficient sense of the student body. A minority (n = 39/95, [41%]) felt limited in their ability to learn about the institution (commonly related to their inability to tour campus), and a majority (n =74/91, [81%]) would have preferred an in-person interview. Most interviewers felt comfortable assessing applicants' verbal communication skills (n = 13/16, [81%]), and most (n = 12/17, [71%]) felt VI should be an option for future applicants. NEXT STEPS VI, likely to be a temporary-but-universal fixture of upcoming application cycles, may benefit applicants and interviewers alike by saving resources and diversifying those involved. Next steps are developing programming that will permit applicants to virtually explore the institution and connect more with current students. Future research should evaluate potential bias in VI to ensure an equitable application process for all.","Garden, Evan; Loebel, Emma; Sanky, Charles; Chudow, Jacquelyn; Fallar, Robert; Parkas, Valerie",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951676/,401

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on emergency services of the largest medical center in Taiwan by comparing emergency department (ED) usage, turnover, and admission rates before the COVID-19 outbreak with those during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the ED of the largest tertiary medical center in Taiwan. Trends of adult, non-trauma patients who visited the ED during February–April 2019 were compared with those during February–April 2020. The number of visits, their dispositions, crowding parameters, and turnover rates were analyzed. The primary outcome was the change in ED attendance between the two periods. The secondary outcomes were changes in hospital admission rates, crowding parameters, and turnover rates. RESULTS: During the outbreak, there were decreased non-trauma ED visits by 33.45% (p < 0.001) and proportion of Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale (TTAS) 3 patients (p=0.02), with increased admission rates by 4.7% (p < 0.001). Crowding parameters and turnover rate showed significant improvements. CONCLUSION: Comparison of periods before and during the COVID-19 outbreak showed an obvious decline in adult, non-trauma ED visits.

Early nurturing care can lay the foundation for human capital accumulation with lifelong benefits. Conversely, early adversity undermines brain development, learning and future earning. Slums are among the most challenging places to spend those early years and are difficult places to care for a child. Shifting family and work structures mean that paid, largely informal, childcare seems to be becoming the ‘new normal’ for many preschool children growing up in rapidly urbanising Africa. However, little is known about the quality of this childcare. AIMS: To build a rigorous understanding what childcare strategies are used and why in a typical Nairobi slum, with a particular focus on provision and quality of paid childcare. Through this, to inform evaluation of quality and design and implementation of interventions with the potential to reach some of the most vulnerable children at the most critical time in the life course. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed methods will be employed. Qualitative research (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) with parents/carers will explore need for and decision-making about childcare. A household survey (of 480 households) will estimate the use of different childcare strategies by parents/carers and associated parent/carer characteristics. Subsequently, childcare providers will be mapped and surveyed to document and assess quality of current paid childcare. Semistructured observations will augment self-reported quality with observable characteristics/practices. Finally, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with childcare providers will explore their behaviours and motivations. Qualitative data will be analysed through thematic analysis and triangulation across methods. Quantitative and spatial data will be analysed through epidemiological methods (random effects regression modelling and spatial statistics). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted in the UK and Kenya. Findings will be disseminated through journal publications, community and government stakeholder workshops, policy briefs and social media content.","Hughes, Robert C; Kitsao-Wekulo, Patricia; Bhopal, Sunil; Kimani-Murage, Elizabeth W; Hill, Zelee; Kirkwood, Betty R",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344785/,401

Early detection of emotional feelings and their trends help implement timely intervention strategies. Given the limitations of medical diagnosis of early emotional change signs during the quarantine period, artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early signs, symptoms and escalating trends. Novelty of the approach presented herein is a multitask methodological framework of text data processing, implemented as a pipeline for meaningful emotion detection and analysis, based on the Plutchik/Ekman approach to emotion detection and trend detection. We present an evaluation of the framework and a pilot system. Results of confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework for topic trends and emotion detection of COVID-19 tweets. Our findings revealed Stay-At-Home restrictions result in people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics. Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and quarantined life increased in some days. These findings have potential to impact public health policy decisions through monitoring trends of emotional feelings of those who are quarantined. The framework presented here has potential to assist in such monitoring by using as an online emotion detection tool kit.","Jelodar, H.; Orji, R.; Matwin, S.; Weerasinghe, S.; Oyebode, O.; Wang, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.16.21249943; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.16.21249943v1?rss=1,401

690536,Thrombotic complications of patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 at a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom,2020-04-25,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate by means of regression models the relationships between baseline clinical and laboratory data and lung involvement on baseline chest CT and to quantify the thoracic disease using an artificial intelligence tool and a visual scoring system to predict prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 103 (41 women and 62 men; 68.8 years of mean age—range, 29–93 years) with suspicious COVID-19 viral infection evaluated by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All patients underwent CT examinations at the time of admission in addition to clinical and laboratory findings recording. All chest CT examinations were reviewed using a structured report. Moreover, using an artificial intelligence tool we performed an automatic segmentation on CT images based on Hounsfield unit to calculate residual healthy lung parenchyma, ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidations and emphysema volumes for both right and left lungs. Two expert radiologists, in consensus, attributed at the CT pulmonary disease involvement a severity score using a scale of 5 levels; the score was attributed for GGO and consolidation for each lung, and then, an overall radiological severity visual score was obtained summing the single score. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Symptoms and comorbidities did not show differences statistically significant in terms of patient outcome. Instead, SpO2 was significantly lower in patients hospitalized in critical conditions or died while age, HS CRP, leukocyte count, neutrophils, LDH, d-dimer, troponin, creatinine and azotemia, ALT, AST and bilirubin values were significantly higher. GGO and consolidations were the main CT patterns (a variable combination of GGO and consolidations was found in 87.8% of patients). CT COVID-19 disease was prevalently bilateral (77.6%) with peripheral distribution (74.5%) and multiple lobes localizations (52.0%). Consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma volumes showed statistically significant differences in the three groups of patients based on outcome (patients discharged at home, patients hospitalized in stable conditions and patient hospitalized in critical conditions or died) while GGO volume did not affect the patient's outcome. Moreover, the overall radiological severity visual score (cutoff ≥ 8) was a predictor of patient outcome. The highest value of R-squared (R(2) = 0.93) was obtained by the model that combines clinical/laboratory findings at CT volumes. The highest accuracy was obtained by clinical/laboratory and CT findings model with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively, of 88%, 78% and 81% to predict discharged/stable patients versus critical/died patients. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both CT visual score and computerized software-based quantification of the consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma on chest CT images were independent predictors of outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Salvatore, Cappabianca; Roberta, Fusco; Angela, de Lisio; Cesare, Paura; Alfredo, Clemente; Giuliano, Gagliardi; Giulio, Lombardi; Giuliana, Giacobbe; Maria, Russo Gaetano; Paola, Belfiore Maria; Fabrizio, Urraro; Roberta, Grassi; Beatrice, Feragalli; Vittorio, Miele",Radiol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047295/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01293-w,401
690592,Antimicrobial Stewardship: A Review for Internal Medicine Physicians,2021-04-09,"Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are often refractory to compression therapy, and their prevalence is increasing. An autologous homologous skin construct (AHSC) that uses the endogenous regenerative capacity of healthy skin has been developed to treat cutaneous defects, with a single application. The ability of AHSC to close VLUs with a single treatment was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm feasibility study to test the hypothesis that AHSC treatment will result in wound closure by providing healthy autologous tissue to the wound bed. METHODS: Ten VLUs were treated with a single application of AHSC. A 1.5 cm(2) full-thickness skin harvest from the proximal calf was collected and sent to a Food and Drug Administration–registered facility, where it was processed into AHSC and returned to the provider within 48 hours. AHSC was spread evenly across the wound and dressed with silicone. The primary endpoint was wound closure rate at 12 weeks. Wound closure was followed with 3-dimensional planimetry, and closure was confirmed by a panel of plastic surgeons. Additional endpoints followed for 12 weeks included graft take, harvest site closure, adverse event rate, complications, and patient-reported pain. RESULTS: All 10 VLUs demonstrated successful graft take as evidenced by graft persisting in wound and harvest site closure. Eight VLUs exhibited complete closure within 12 weeks. One VLU that failed to heal with a prior split thickness skin graft closed within 13.5 weeks with AHSC. The mean time of closure was 34 days (95% confidence interval, 14–53). Pain improved by closure confirmation visit. There was 1 serious adverse event unrelated to the product or procedure. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated that AHSC may be a viable single-application topical intervention for VLUs and warrants further investigation in larger, controlled studies.","Armstrong, David G.; Orgill, Dennis P.; Galiano, Robert D.; Glat, Paul M.; Carter, Marissa J.; Zelen, Charles M.",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.
