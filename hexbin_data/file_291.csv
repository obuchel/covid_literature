1394,1394,1394,One-year mortality and predictors of death among hospital survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome,17.130983,13.014991,2014-01-17,"PURPOSE: Advances in supportive care and ventilator management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have resulted in declines in short-term mortality, but risks of death after survival to hospital discharge have not been well described. Our objective was to quantify the difference between short-term and long-term mortality in ARDS and to identify risk factors for death and causes of death at 1 year among hospital survivors. METHODS: This multi-intensive care unit, prospective cohort included patients with ARDS enrolled between January 2006 and February 2010. We determined the clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital and 1-year mortality among hospital survivors and utilized death certificate data to identify causes of death. RESULTS: Of 646 patients hospitalized with ARDS, mortality at 1 year was substantially higher (41 %, 95 % CI 37–45 %) than in-hospital mortality (24 %, 95 % CI 21–27 %), P < 0.0001. Among 493 patients who survived to hospital discharge, the 110 (22 %) who died in the subsequent year were older (P < 0.001) and more likely to have been discharged to a nursing home, other hospital, or hospice compared to patients alive at 1 year (P < 0.001). Important predictors of death among hospital survivors were comorbidities present at the time of ARDS, and not living at home prior to admission. ARDS-related measures of severity of illness did not emerge as independent predictors of mortality in hospital survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements in short-term ARDS outcomes, 1-year mortality is high, mostly because of the large burden of comorbidities, which are prevalent in patients with ARDS.

1506,1506,1506,Clinical and biological role of secretory phospholipase A2 in acute respiratory distress syndrome infants,17.049616,13.01052,2013-07-24,"INTRODUCTION: Secretory phospholipase A2 is supposed to play a role in acute lung injury but no data are available for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is not clear which enzyme subtypes are secreted and what the relationships are between enzyme activity, biophysical and biochemical parameters, and clinical outcomes. We aimed to measure the enzyme and identify its subtypes and to study its biochemical and biophysical effect. The secondary aim was to correlate enzyme activity with clinical outcome. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 24 infants with ARDS and 14 controls with no lung disease. Samples were assayed for secretory phospholipase A2 and molecules related to its activity and expression. Western blotting and captive bubble surfactometry were also performed. Clinical data were real time downloaded. RESULTS: Tumor necrosis factor-α (814 (506-2,499) vs. 287 (111-1,315) pg/mL; P = 0.04), enzyme activity (430 (253-600) vs. 149 (61-387) IU/mL; P = 0.01), free fatty acids (4.3 (2.8-8.6) vs. 2 (0.8-4.6) mM; P = 0.026), and minimum surface tension (25.6 ± 6.1 vs. 18 ± 1.8 mN/m; P = 0.006) were higher in ARDS than in controls. Phospholipids are lower in ARDS than in controls (76.5 (54-100) vs. 1,094 (536-2,907) μg/mL; P = 0.0001). Three enzyme subtypes were identified (-IIA, -V, -X), although in lower quantities in controls; another subtype (-IB) was mainly detected in ARDS. Significant correlations exist between enzyme activity, free fatty acids (ρ = 0.823; P < 0.001), and surface tension (ρ = 0.55; P < 0.028). Correlations also exist with intensive care stay (ρ = 0.54; P = 0.001), PRISM-III(24 )(ρ = 0.79; P< 0.001), duration of ventilation (ρ = 0.53; P = 0.002), and oxygen therapy (ρ = 0.54; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Secretory phospholipase A2 activity is raised in pediatric ARDS and constituted of four subtypes. Enzyme correlates with some inflammatory mediators, surface tension, and major clinical outcomes. Secretory phospholipase A2 may be a clinically relevant target in pediatric ARDS.","De Luca, Daniele; Lopez-Rodriguez, Elena; Minucci, Angelo; Vendittelli, Francesca; Gentile, Leonarda; Stival, Eleonora; Conti, Giorgio; Piastra, Marco; Antonelli, Massimo; Echaide, Mercedes; Perez-Gil, Jesus; Capoluongo, Ettore D",Crit Care,291,9

CASE REPORT: A 25 year old male with no significant past medical history had been admitted to a local hospital due to dyspnea and fever. His pulmonary function subsequently failed necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and introduction of ECMO support. The patient was transported for 300 km by road on ECMO to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis of ARDS, HIV infection and MDR bacterial and fungal VAP was made. Patient was successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), anti-infective agents and 58 days of veno-venous ECMO support, with complete resolution of the respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: HIV infected patients with ARDS and MDR bacterial VAP whose HIV replication is controlled by ART could be successfully managed with ECMO.","Samalavicius, Robertas; Serpytis, Mindaugas; Ringaitiene, Donata; Grazulyte, Daiva; Bertasiute, Ruta; Rimkus, Bernardas; Matulionyte, Raimonda; Ambrazaitiene, Ruta; Sipylaite, Jurate; Kacergius, Tomas; Griskevicius, Laimonas",AIDS Res Ther,291,9
1839,1839,1839,Diffuse alveolar damage associated mortality in selected acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with open lung biopsy,17.057922,12.973452,2015-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the pathological hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however, the presence of DAD in the clinical criteria of ARDS patients by Berlin definition is little known. This study is designed to investigate the role of DAD in ARDS patients who underwent open lung biopsy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who met the Berlin definition and underwent open lung biopsy from January 1999 to January 2014 in a referred medical center. DAD is characterized by hyaline membrane formation, lung edema, inflammation, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial cell injury. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, severity of ARDS, clinical and pathological diagnoses, and survival outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1838 patients with ARDS were identified and open lung biopsies were performed on 101 patients (5.5 %) during the study period. Of these 101 patients, the severity of ARDS on diagnosis was mild of 16.8 %, moderate of 56.5 % and severe of 26.7 %. The hospital mortality rate was not significant difference between the three groups (64.7 % vs 61.4 % vs 55.6 %, p = 0.81). Of the 101 clinical ARDS patients with open lung biopsies, 56.4 % (57/101) patients had DAD according to biopsy results. The proportion of DAD were 76.5 % (13/17) in mild, 56.1 % (32/57) in moderate and 44.4 % (12/27) in severe ARDS and there is no significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.113). Pathological findings of DAD patients had a higher hospital mortality rate than non-DAD patients (71.9 % vs 45.5 %, p = 0.007). Pathological findings of DAD (odds ratio: 3.554, 95 % CI, 1.385–9.12; p = 0.008) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on the biopsy day (odds ratio: 1.424, 95 % CI, 1.187–1.707; p<0.001) were significantly and independently associated with hospital mortality. The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were not significantly different between DAD and non-DAD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation of pathological findings of DAD and ARDS diagnosed by Berlin definition is modest. A pathological finding of DAD in ARDS patients is associated with hospital mortality and there are no clinical characteristics that could identify DAD patients before open lung biopsy.","Kao, Kuo-Chin; Hu, Han-Chung; Chang, Chih-Hao; Hung, Chen-Yiu; Chiu, Li-Chung; Li, Shih-Hong; Lin, Shih-Wei; Chuang, Li-Pang; Wang, Chih-Wei; Li, Li-Fu; Chen, Ning-Hung; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Huang, Chung-Chi; Tsai, Ying-Huang",Crit Care,291,9

The activities of public health are complex, performed by multiple professionals, and range from the innocuous to the intrusive. Ethical analyses in public health reflect some of this complexity and fragmentation, with no one approach able to capture the full range of ethical considerations raised by public health activities. There are however, good reasons why we should pursue such analyses. Providing a robust ethical framework for public health may promote the identity and function of public health, address some of the shortcomings of utilitarianism, and help to combat the threat that public health faces through lack of political will in many parts of the world. In this paper I argue that Alasdair MacIntyre’s account of practices and virtues can make a valuable contribution to public health ethics. The first part of the paper argues that public health may properly be described as the type of practice that provides an arena for the exercise of virtues. This is followed by an analysis of the three virtues of honesty, courage and justice in public health practice. Using virtue theory captures morally important elements of public health and helps to maintain awareness of significant moral values in the practice of public health. Such awareness is crucial in maintaining and defending the integrity of public health.","Rogers, Wendy A.",Monash Bioeth Rev,291,9

In 2012, data from the International Register of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization revealed that more than 5,000 children had undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with an increase in the number of annual cases since the epidemics of 2009. The survival rate (56%) is stable while the number of children with comorbidities increases due to the improvements in the equipment. Although there are no randomized studies, results encourage considering ECMO in pediatric ARDS. If veno-venous ECMO should be preferred in respiratory diseases, veno-arterial ECMO may be necessary and is still used frequently in children (50% of cases). In pediatrics, the technical features are first related to the physiological characteristics of the child and secondly to the technical limitations of the available equipment in the different ages. ECMO is a technique requiring specific expertise and specialized pediatric teams due to children’s particularities.","Renolleau, S.",Reanimation,291,9

Therefore, potential therapeutic targets need to be discovered for these patients. Proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase gene (PSMC) family members are well reported to be involved in protein degradation. However, their roles in breast cancer are still unknown and need to be comprehensively researched. Leveraging publicly available databases, such as cBioPortal and Oncomine, for high-throughput transcriptomic profiling to provide evidence-based targets for breast cancer is a rapid and robust approach. By integrating the aforementioned databases with the Kaplan–Meier plotter database, we investigated potential roles of six PSMC family members in breast cancer at the messenger RNA level and their correlations with patient survival. The present findings showed significantly higher expression profiles of PSMC2, PSMC3, PSMC4, PSMC5, and PSMC6 in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissues. Besides, positive correlations were also revealed between PSMC family genes and ubiquinone metabolism, cell cycle, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Meanwhile, we discovered that high levels of PSMC1, PSMC3, PSMC4, PSMC5, and PSMC6 transcripts were positively correlated with poor survival, which likely shows their importance in breast cancer development. Collectively, PSMC family members have the potential to be novel and essential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer development.","Kao, Tzu-Jen; Wu, Chung-Che; Phan, Nam Nhut; Liu, Yen-Hsi; Ta, Hoang Dang Khoa; Anuraga, Gangga; Wu, Yung-Fu; Lee, Kuen-Haur; Chuang, Jian-Ying; Wang, Chih-Yang",Aging (Albany NY),291,12

There are studies that have evaluated the feasibility and safety of EUS-guided parenchymal liver biopsy (EUS-LB), however, factors that can influence specimen quality are yet to be determined. Our aim was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-LB and evaluate factors associated with specimen quality. METHODS We performed a detailed search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science™ databases to identify studies in which results of EUS-guided liver parenchymal biopsies were reported published up to July 2020. A random effects model was used to estimate pooled values (mean ± SE) for total specimen length (TSL) and complete portal tracts (CPT). Subgroup analyses were applied to find out the procedural factors associated with better specimen quality using Cochran's Q test. A total of 10 meta-analyses were done focusing on international studies. Total of 1326 patients who underwent EUS-LB. EUS-LBs performed for suspicion of parenchymal liver disease. Pooled mean values for TSL and CPT with subgroup analyses. RESULTS Twenty-three studies with a total of 1326 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Overall pooled mean TSL and CPT were 45.3 ± 4.6 mm and 15.8 ± 1.5, respectively. In subgroup analysis, core biopsy needles proved to better in terms of CPT than fine-needle aspiration needles (18.4 vs 10.99, p = 0.003). FNB with slow-pull or suction technique provided a similar TSL (44.3 vs 53.9 mm, p = 0.40), however, slow-pull technique was better in terms of CPT (30 vs 14.6, p < 0.001). Heterogeneity was present among the studies. Another limitation is the low number randomized control trials. CONCLUSION EUS-guided parenchymal liver biopsy is a good alternative to other methods of liver sampling. Using FNB needles with a slow-pull technique can provide better results.","Baran, Bulent; Kale, Santosh; Patil, Prithvi; Kannadath, Bijun; Ramireddy, Srinivas; Badillo, Ricardo; DaVee, Roy Tomas; Thosani, Nirav",Surgical endoscopy,291,33

Utilizing heat and pressure applied for a specified time, a bond can be formed between adjacent tissues. The success or failure of tissue fusion is contingent upon the strength of the bond it creates between opposing tissues, yet little characterization has been done to measure the strength of this interface as a function of the input parameters, such as heat and pressure. Previous studies have examined the strength of tissue fusion using clinically relevant outcomes such as bursting pressure or tearing strength, but none have explored metrics more appropriate for determining the mechanics of the actual bond such as peel or shear strengths. The goal of this study is to establish methodology for T-peel and lap shear testing of fused tissues and measure the fusion bonding strength as a function of temperature and time using the ConMed Altrus(®) laparoscopic thermal fusion device. Across five temperatures (120, 140, 150, 160, 170°C) and four time durations (500, 1000, 1800, 3000ms) the mean peeling strength, ultimate shear strength, and bursting pressure of fused porcine splenic arteries were measured. The shear strength increased with increasing temperature and time with an ultimate shear strength at 160°C and 3000ms equal to 290 ± 99Pa. No trend was observed between the input parameters of time and applied temperature and the mean peeling force, although there were significant differences between groups. The bursting pressure increased significantly with increasing durations, but no trend was noted between temperature and bursting pressure. The shear strength data suggest there is some physical or chemical reaction which occurs in the tissue between 120°C and 150°C which provides a stronger bond. The shear and peel results also reveal that the fusion bond undergoes brittle failure. This study suggests that the tissue fusion bond is maximized at temperatures over 150°C and at a time of 3000ms using the ConMed Altrus(®) and that input parameters can be tuned to optimize the strength of the bonded region.","Cezo, James D; Passernig, Anna C; Ferguson, Virginia L; Taylor, Kenneth D; Rentschler, Mark E",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,291,5

While it is a clinically rich area, resource constraints and service requirements have meant that it has perhaps contributed a little below its weight in academic terms. This review, although far from exhaustive, seeks to present some themes of recent research in this fascinating discipline. RECENT FINDINGS The need to demonstrate the utility, and ensure the funding, of a service that is all too often regarded as 'non-core' by both mental health services and general hospitals remains constant. Useful work is being done in streamlining data collection, accurately measuring disability and improving outcomes for these complex and resource-intensive patients. Recent reviews have helped to clarify our understanding of medication-induced depression, the treatment options in self-harm, the place of psychosocial interventions in oncology, and the relationship between depression and heart disease among other areas. SUMMARY Consultation-liaison psychiatry is a fascinating and underresearched field. Important work remains to be done in service delivery, diagnosis, treatment and outcome, as well as medical ethics and systems research. Although our knowledge is progressing, many existing studies are underpowered and multisite collaborations are necessary. Our patients carry an enormous burden of ill health and require the services of skilled clinicians, advocates and treatment brokers.","Ilchef, Ralf",Current opinion in psychiatry,291,33

In our renal service we reduced HD frequency from thrice to twice-weekly in selected patients with the primary aim of reducing COVID 19 exposure and transmission between HD patients. METHODS: Dialysis unit nephrologists identified 166 suitable patients (38.4% of our HD population) to temporarily convert to twice-weekly haemodialysis immediately prior to the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in our area. Changes in pre-dialysis weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and biochemistry were recorded weekly throughout the 4-week project. Hyperkalaemic patients (serum potassium > 6.0 mmol/L) were treated with a potassium binder, sodium bicarbonate and received responsive dietary advice. RESULTS: There were 12 deaths (5 due to COVID-19) in the HD population, 6 of which were in the twice weekly HD group; no deaths were definitively associated with change of dialysis protocol. A further 19 patients were either hospitalised and/or developed COVID-19 and thus transferred back to thrice weekly dialysis as per protocol. 113 (68.1%) were still receiving twice-weekly HD by the end of the 4-week project. Indications for transfer back to thrice weekly were; fluid overload (19), persistent hyperkalaemia (4), patient request (4) and compliance (1). There were statistically significant increases in SBP and pre-dialysis potassium during the project. CONCLUSIONS: Short term conversion of a large but selected HD population to twice-weekly dialysis sessions was possible and safe. This approach could help mitigate COVID-19 transmission amongst dialysis patients in centres with similar organisational pressures.","Lodge, Michelle Da Silva; Abeygunaratne, Thilini; Alderson, Helen; Ali, Ibrahim; Brown, Nina; Chrysochou, Constantina; Donne, Rosie; Erekosima, Ibi; Evans, Philip; Flanagan, Emma; Gray, Simon; Green, Darren; Hegarty, Janet; Hyde, Audrey; Kalra, Philip A; Lamerton, Elizabeth; Lewis, David; Middleton, Rachel; New, David; Nipah, Robert; O039,; Donoghue, Donal; Riordan, Edmond; Poulikakos, Dimitrios; Rainone, Francesco; Raman, Maharajan; Ritchie, James; Sinha, Smeeta; Wood, Grahame; Tollitt, J",BMC Nephrol,291,19

METHODS: We sought a representative sample of Connecticut residents, ages &#8805;18 years and residing in noncongregate settings, who completed a survey between June 4 and June 23, 2020, and underwent serology testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies between June 10 and July 29, 2020. We also oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations. We estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies and the prevalence of symptomatic illness and self-reported adherence to risk-mitigation behaviors among this population. RESULTS: Of the 567 respondents (mean age 50 [± 17] years; 53% women; 75% non-Hispanic white individuals) included at the state level, 23 respondents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, resulting in weighted seroprevalence of 4.0 (90% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-6.0). The weighted seroprevalence for the oversampled non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations was 6.4% (90% CI 0.9-11.9) and 19.9% (90% CI 13.2-26.6), respectively. The majority of respondents at the state level reported following risk-mitigation behaviors: 73% avoided public places, 75% avoided gatherings of families or friends, and 97% wore a facemask, at least part of the time.

Initially intended to improve health care for patients in remote settings, telemedicine now has a broad clinical scope with the general purpose of providing convenient, safe, and time- and cost-efficient care. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has created marked nationwide changes in health care access and delivery. Elective appointments and procedures have been canceled or delayed, and multiple states still have some degree of shelter-in-place orders. Many institutions are now relying more heavily on telehealth services to continue to provide medical care to individuals while also preserving the safety of health care professionals and patients. Telemedicine can also help reduce the surge in health care needs and visits as restrictions are lifted. In recent weeks, there has been a significant amount of information and advice on how to best approach telemedicine visits.

All of these viruses, which are responsible for causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), are highly contagious in nature and/or have caused high mortalities. The recently emerged COVID-19 disease is a highly transmittable viral infection caused by another zoonotic novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Similar to the other two coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also likely to have originated from bats, which have been serving as established reservoirs for various pathogenic coronaviruses. Although, it is still unknown how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from bats to humans, the rapid human-to-human transmission has been confirmed widely. The disease first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread across the globe, infected 48,539,872 people, and caused 1,232,791 deaths in 215 countries, and the infection is still spreading at the time of manuscript preparation. So far, there is no definite line of treatment which has been approved or vaccine which is available. However, different types of potential vaccines and therapeutics have been evaluated and/or are under clinical trials against COVID-19. In this review, we summarize different types of acute respiratory diseases and briefly discuss earlier outbreaks of coronaviruses and compare their occurrence and pathogenicity with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Various epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 such as mode of spread, death rate, doubling time, etc., have been discussed in detail. Apart from this, different technical issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic including use of masks and other socio-economic problems associated with the pandemic have also been summarized. Additionally, we have reviewed various aspects of patient management strategies including mechanism of action, available diagnostic tools, etc., and also discussed different strategies for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutic combinations to deal with this viral outbreak. Overall, by the inclusion of various references, this review covers, in detail, the most important aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khan, Mujeeb; Adil, Syed F; Alkhathlan, Hamad Z; Tahir, Muhammad N; Saif, Sadia; Khan, Merajuddin; Khan, Shams T",Molecules (Basel),291,21

An anonymous 22-question online survey was created and distributed to 323 LOA members. Of the 323 recipients of the survey, 99 (30.7%) responded. As a part of a multiple response set, in which respondents could choose more than one answer, the majority reported delayed care for routine orthopedic injuries (81 of 97, 83.5%). Almost every surgeon (n=95, 96.0%) reported stopping or delaying elective surgery because of COVID-19 and an increase in pain/disability/deformity in patients due to delay in elective procedures (73 of 97, 75.3%) and delay in seeking care (66 of 97, 68.0%). The majority reported an increased use of telehealth visits (68 of 97, 70.1%), a decrease in patient volume (88 of 97, 90.7%), and a reduction in income (79 of 98, 80.6%) during the past 6 months. A majority of surgeons (58 of 98, 59.2%) reported that they had applied for government assistance or took out loans. Via a multiple response set, respondents indicated that as a result of the pandemic, telehealth will become more widespread (64 of 98, 65.3%) and hospitals will exert a stronger influence over health care (64 of 98, 65.3%). The COVID-19 pandemic has had lasting effects on orthopedic surgeons in Louisiana and their practices, with a substantial decrease in the number of patients treated (90.5%), surgical volume, and revenue (80.6%). Orthopedic surgeons affected by the pandemic could use these data to further understand future challenges with patient care and changing orthopedic practice dynamics during this unique time.

On short timescales, superspreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, whereas long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in both the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through reparameterization. We derive a nonlinear dependence of the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] on the susceptible population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of long-lasting herd immunity: Subsequent waves may emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven by, for example, seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic and from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest hit areas, such as New York City, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.","Tkachenko, Alexei V; Maslov, Sergei; Elbanna, Ahmed; Wong, George N; Weiner, Zachary J; Goldenfeld, Nigel",Proc.

However, the small body of applied psychology literature on large-scale disruptive events has paid insufficient attention to this important topic. Further, different from acute events (e.g., disasters), the ongoing pandemic poses an additional challenge for organizations as they seek to effectively protect employees' job engagement from health and safety threats in the workplace. To address these gaps, we drew from job reattachment research and investigated it as an important antecedent of job engagement for employees returning to work. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a moderator that can strengthen the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing job engagement. We further linked engagement to work withdrawal, use of personal protective equipment (e.g., wearing a mask), and task performance to underscore the downstream implications of job reattachment. To test our research model, we collected multiwave, multisource data from the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic-Wuhan, China-where many employees were returning to work. The results provide strong support for our model. In addition to extending research on large-scale disruptive events, the current study has important implications for organizations and employees in the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, they also had psychological and economic impacts on people's lives, which should not be neglected as they may reduce citizens' trust and compliance with future health mandates. Engaging citizens in their own health management and in the collaboration with health care professionals and authorities via the adoption of a collaborative approach to health policy development is fundamental to fostering such measures' effectiveness. Psychosocial analysis of citizens' concerns and emotional reactions to preventive policies is important in order to plan personalized health communication campaigns. CONTEXT: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, between February 23 and March 8, 2020, some areas of Italy were declared ""red zones,"" with citizens asked to stay home and avoid unnecessary interpersonal contacts. Such measures were then extended, between March 10 and May 4, 2020, to the whole country. However, compliance with such behaviors had an important impact on citizens' personal, psychological, and economic well-being. This could result in reduced trust in authorities and lowered compliance. Keeping citizens engaged in their own health and in preventive behaviors is thus a key strategy for the success of such measures. This paper presents the results from a study conducted in Italy to monitor levels of people's health engagement, sentiment, trust in authorities, and perception of risk at two different time points. METHODS: Two independent samples (n = 968 and n = 1,004), weighted to be representative of the adult Italian population, were recruited in two waves corresponding to crucial moments of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic: between February 28 and March 4 (beginning of ""phase 1,"" after the first regional lockdowns), and between May 12 and May 18 (beginning of ""phase 2,"" after the national lockdown was partially dismissed). Respondents were asked to complete an online survey with a series of both validated measures and ad hoc items.

FINDINGS: Although sense of self and social responsibility increased between the two waves, and trust toward authorities remained substantially the same, trust in science, consumer sentiment, and health engagement decreased. Our results showed that while both the level of general concern for the emergency and the perceived risk of infection increased between the two waves, in the second wave our participants reported being more concerned for the economic consequences of the pandemic than the health risk.

Secondary: Analyze maternal intent after ongoing pregnancy and investigate hemorrhage after mifepristone alone. Methods: Adverse Event Reports (AERs) for mifepristone used as an abortifacient, submitted to the FDA from September 2000 to February 2019, were analyzed using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv3). Results: The FDA provided 6158 pages of AERs. Duplicates, non-US, or AERs previously published (Gary, 2006) were excluded. Of the remaining, there were 3197 unique, US-only AERs of which there were 537 (16.80%) with insufficient information to determine clinical severity, leaving 2660 (83.20%) Codable US AERs. (Figure 1). Of these, 20 were Deaths, 529 were Life-threatening, 1957 were Severe, 151 were Moderate, and 3 were Mild. The deaths included: 9 (45.00%) sepsis, 4 (20.00%) drug toxicity/overdose, 1 (5.00%) ruptured ectopic pregnancy, 1 (5.00%) hemorrhage, 3 (15.00%) possible homicides, 1 (5.00%) suicide, 1 (5.00%) unknown. (Table 1). Retained products of conception and hemorrhage caused most morbidity. There were 75 ectopic pregnancies, including 26 ruptured ectopics (includes one death). There were 2243 surgeries including 2146 (95.68%) D&Cs of which only 853 (39.75%) were performed by abortion providers. Of 452 patients with ongoing pregnancies, 102 (22.57%) chose to keep their baby, 148 (32.74%) had terminations, 1 (0.22%) miscarried, and 201 (44.47%) had unknown outcomes. Hemorrhage occurred more often in those who took mifepristone and misoprostol (51.44%) than in those who took mifepristone alone (22.41%). Conclusions: Significant morbidity and mortality have occurred following the use of mifepristone as an abortifacient. A pre-abortion ultrasound should be required to rule out ectopic pregnancy and confirm gestational age. The FDA AER system is inadequate and significantly underestimates the adverse events from mifepristone. A mandatory registry of ongoing pregnancies is essential considering the number of ongoing pregnancies especially considering the known teratogenicity of misoprostol. The decision to prevent the FDA from enforcing REMS during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be reversed and REMS must be strengthened.","Aultman, K.; Cirucci, C. A.; Harrison, D. J.; Beran, B.

People have lost their lives due to the virus and the lack of counter measures in place. Given the increasing caseload and uncertainty of spread, there is an urgent need to develop machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID-19. Prediction of the spread can allow counter measures and actions to be implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a deep learning technique, called Deep Sequential Prediction Model (DSPM) and machine learning based Non-parametric Regression Model (NRM) to predict the spread of COVID-19. Our proposed models were trained and tested on novel coronavirus 2019 dataset, which contains 19.53 Million confirmed cases of COVID-19. Our proposed models were evaluated by using Mean Absolute Error and compared with baseline method. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrate the superior prediction performance of the proposed models.","Ayris, Devante; Horbury, Kye; Williams, Blake; Blackney, Mitchell; See, Celine Shi Hui; Shah, Syed Afaq Ali",,291,23

To address concerns over infection, we gathered and analyzed experiences with tracheostomy in the COVID-19 patient population from all over Japan. METHODS: The data for health-care workers involved in tracheostomies for COVID-19-infected patients were gathered from academic medical centers or their affiliated hospitals from all over Japan. RESULTS: Tracheostomies have been performed in 35 COVID-19 patients with a total of 91 surgeons, 49 anesthesiologists, and 49 surgical staff members involved. Twenty-eight (80%) patients underwent surgery more than 22 days after the development of COVID-19-related symptoms (11: 22-28 days and 17: &#8805;29 days). Thirty (85.7%) patients underwent surgery &#8805; 15 days after intubation (14: 15-21 days, 6: 22-28 days, and 10: &#8805;29 days). Among the total of 189 health-care workers involved in the tracheostomy procedures, 25 used a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and 164 used a N95 mask and eye protection. As a result, no transmission to staff occurred during the 2 weeks of follow-up after surgery. CONCLUSION: No one involved in tracheostomy procedures were found to have been infected with COVID-19 in this Japanese study. The reason is thought to be that the timing of the surgery was quite late after the infections, and the surgery was performed using appropriate PPE and surgical procedure. The indications for and timing of tracheostomy for severe COVID-19 patients should be decided through multidisciplinary discussion.","Yokokawa, Taizo; Ariizumi, Yosuke; Hiramatsu, Mariko; Kato, Yujin; Endo, Kazuhira; Obata, Kazufumi; Kawashima, Kayoko; Sakata, Toshifumi; Hirano, Shigeru; Nakashima, Torahiko; Sekine, Tatsurou; Kiyuna, Asanori; Uemura, Saeko; Okubo, Keisuke; Sugimoto, Taro; Tateya, Ichiro; Fujimoto, Yasushi; Horii, Arata; Kimura, Yurika; Hyodo, Masamitsu; Homma, Akihiro",Auris nasus larynx,291,24

Moreover, evaluating and treating HF patients with comorbid COVID-19 represents a formidable clinical challenge as symptoms of both conditions may overlap and they may potentiate each other. Limited data exist regarding comprehensive management of HF patients with concomitant COVID-19. Since these issues pose serious new challenges for clinicians worldwide, HF specialists must develop a structured approach to the care of patients with COVID-19 and be included early in the care of these patients. Therefore, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology and the Chinese Heart Failure Association & National Heart Failure Committee conducted web-based meetings to discuss these unique clinical challenges and reach a consensus opinion to help providers worldwide deliver better patient care.

This commentary aims to provide an early snapshot of the experiences of pediatric postdoctoral fellows in academic medical settings; specifically, we will explore the impact of the pandemic on developing mastery within several competencies (e.g., research, professional development, clinical, interdisciplinary). These competencies are critical elements to fellowship to prepare for independent practice. Several models of training competencies for professional psychology and pediatric psychology exist, which focus on trainee skill development. Measures taken to minimize the spread of COVID-19 have directly impacted hospital systems and training, requiring programs to adapt competencies in various domains, such as increased familiarity with telehealth and virtual supervision. Additionally, fellows experienced an impact of the pandemic on securing employment following fellowship, conducting research and program development activities, and on cognitive flexibility and self-care. Governing bodies, such as the APA and Council of Chairs of Training Councils, have released statements and guidelines on addressing training of postdoctoral fellows including increasing flexibility of training methods, limiting in-person contact, and adjusting educational and licensing requirements. This paper offers informed commentary and diverse perspectives from current postdoctoral fellows engaged in a variety of clinical and research responsibilities regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their training.

Panic in population triggered by COVID-19 has caused a shortage of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants in many cities of Brazil. Despite the governmental reaction against the outbreak, a risk of shortage of disinfectants still exists. The objective of this research is to investigate an alternative method for the fast deployment of alcohol-based disinfectants to protect the population against COVID-19. Methods and results: This research highlights the feasibility of disinfectant production from common ethanol available in Brazilian gas stations, as a last resort. A four-by-one (4:1) ratio of common alcohol diluted in water meets the minimum requirements set by health agencies for the alcoholic concentration of disinfectants. Risks factors on alcohol dilution process are associated with corresponding measures of risk mitigation for public health and safety. Conclusions and perspectives: This research proposes a process for the production and deployment of ethanol-based disinfectant from gas stations. However, the implementation is not timely possible for the COVID-19 pandemic due to complexities in the productive process. For the post-COVID-19 period, the authors give three perspectives: (a) future investigation of human dermal toxicity of common ethanol, (b) establishment of a program for the ethanol decontamination, and (c) countries such as the US, Sweden, Thailand, and Colombia to rethink their energy policy for the adoption of biofuel E100 (ethanol and water) instead of E85 (blend of ethanol, gasoline, and water), as part of their biodefense strategy.","Itiki, Rodney; Roy Chowdhury, Prithwiraj",,291,12

A cohort of serum samples were collected from cats in Wuhan, including 102 sampled after COVID-19 outbreak, and 39 prior to the outbreak. Fifteen sera collected after the outbreak were positive for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 by indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Among them, 11 had SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies with a titer ranging from 1/20 to 1/1080. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between SARS-CoV-2 and type I or II feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). In addition, we continuously monitored serum antibody dynamics of two positive cats every 10 days over 130 days. Their serum antibodies reached the peak at 10 days after first sampling, and declined to the limit of detection within 110 days.

However, sensitive information can be derived from movement patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable encryption overhead to a level that is practical in a computing environment with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.","Ghinita, Gabriel; Nguyen, Kien; Maruseac, Mihai; Shahabi, Cyrus",Geoinformatica,291,1

It is argued that these events adopted visual techniques drawn from television gameshows and popular cinema culture to create a distinctive screen-based reality for the transaction of art assets. Much of the rhetoric employed by the auction houses to publicise online auctions suggested a utopian conception of technology capable of encouraging artistic innovation and broadening access to art markets. In contrast to the idea that these online formats constitute democratic change in the artworld, this article argues that the control of new technological infrastructures represents an extension of institutional power and maintains the socio-cultural elitism of urban centres in which physical art auctions at the top end of the market have traditionally been conducted.

Healthcare settings have the potential to become reservoirs of infectivity, and therefore many hospital trusts are beginning to carry out routine screening of staff and patients. This could promote the effective cohorting of patients and reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. However, for various reasons, some individuals may refuse this testing. Here we highlight this as an emergent ethicolegal issue which we expect to become increasingly relevant as testing becomes ubiquitous. We explore this position from an ethical and legal perspective, determining whether refusal of testing is acceptable under UK law.

Authors' reply,17.187626,13.096059,2020,"COVID-19 has had a severe impact globally, and the recovery can be characterized as a tug of war between fast economic recovery and firm control of further virus-spread. To be prepared for future pandemics, public health policy makers should put effort into fully understanding any complex psychological tensions that inherently arise between opposing human factors such as free enjoyment versus self-restriction. As the COVID-19 crisis is an unusual and complex problem, combinations of diverse factors such as health risk perception, knowledge, norms and beliefs, attitudes and behaviors are closely associated with individuals' intention to enjoy the experience economy but also their concerns that the experience economy will trigger further spread of the infectious diseases. Our aim is to try identifying what factors are associated with their concerns about the spread of the infectious disease caused by the local experience economy. Hence, we have chosen a ""data-driven"" explanatory approach, ""Probabilistic Structural Equational Modeling,"" based on the principle of Bayesian networks to analyze data collected from the following four countries with indicated sample sizes: Denmark (1,005), Italy (1,005), China (1,013), and Japan (1,091). Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the contextual differences in relations between the target variable and factors such as personal value priority and knowledge. These factors affect the target variable differently depending on the local severity-level of the infections. Relations between pleasure-seeking via the experience economy and individuals' anxiety-level about an infectious hotspot seem to differ between East Asians and Europeans who are known to prioritize so-called interpersonal- and independent self-schemes, respectively. Our study also indicates the heterogeneity in the populations, i.e., these relations differ within the respective populations.

In this paper, we track long-term trends in family income inequalities in college enrollment and completion (""collegiate inequalities"") using all available nationally representative datasets for cohorts born between 1908 and 1995. We show that the trends in collegiate inequalities moved in lockstep with the trend in income inequality over the past century. There is one exception to this general finding: For cohorts at risk for serving in the Vietnam War, collegiate inequalities were high, while income inequality was low. During this period, inequality in college enrollment and completion was significantly higher for men than for women, suggesting a bona fide ""Vietnam War"" effect. Aside from this singular confounding event, a century of evidence establishes a strong association between income and collegiate inequality, providing support for the view that rising income inequality is fundamentally changing the distribution of life chances.","Jackson, Michelle; Holzman, Brian",Proc.

METHODS: We performed this prospective study over a two-month period during the initial surge of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in a busy urban ED of patients presenting with respiratory symptoms who were admitted for in-patient care. Per protocol, each patient received assessment consisting of five clinical parameters: presence of fever; hypoxia; cough; shortness of breath/dyspnea; and performance of a chest radiograph to assess for bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. All patients received nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR testing. RESULTS: Of 283 patients studied, 221 (78%) were PCR+ and 62 (22%) PCR-. Chest radiograph revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 85%, which was significantly more common in PCR+ (94%) vs PCR- (52%) patients (P < 0.0001). The rate of manifesting all five positive clinical parameters was significantly greater in PCR+ (63%) vs PCR- (6.5%) patients (P < 0.0001). For PCR+ outcome, the presence of all five positive clinical parameters had a specificity of 94%, positive predictive value of 98%, and positive likelihood ratio of 10. CONCLUSIONS: Using an ED protocol to rapidly assess five clinical parameters accurately distinguishes likelihood of COVID-19 infection prior to PCR test results, and can be used to augment early patient cohorting decisions.","Bonadio, William; Jackson, Kaedrea; Gottlieb, Lindsey; Legome, Eric",West J Emerg Med,291,1

Uncertainty, in deep learning models, is often measured for classification problems. However, deep learning models in autonomous driving are often multi-output regression models. Hence, we propose a novel method called PURE (Prediction sURface uncErtainty) for measuring prediction uncertainty of such regression models. We formulate the object recognition problem as a regression model with more than one outputs for finding object locations in a 2-dimensional camera view. For evaluation, we modified three widely-applied object recognition models (i.e., YoLo, SSD300 and SSD512) and used the KITTI, Stanford Cars, Berkeley DeepDrive, and NEXET datasets. Results showed the statistically significant negative correlation between prediction surface uncertainty and prediction accuracy suggesting that uncertainty significantly impacts the decisions made by autonomous driving.","Catak, Ferhat Ozgur; Yue, Tao; Ali, Shaukat",,291,14

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of this infection among individuals with polyhandicap. METHOD: This was a retrospective observational study. Polyhandicap was defined by the combination of motor deficiency, profound mental retardation, and age at onset of cerebral lesion younger than 6 years. A positive COVID-19 status was considered for patients with a positive COVID-19 laboratory test result, or patients presenting with compatible symptoms and living in an institution or at home with other patients or relatives who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Data collection included sociodemographic data, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, as well as the management and treatment for COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We collected 98 cases, with a sex ratio of 0.98 and a mean age of 38.5 years (3 months to 73 years). COVID-19 infection was paucisymptomatic in 46% of patients, 20.6% of patients presented with dyspnea, while the most frequent extra-respiratory symptoms were digestive (26.5%) and neurological changes (24.5%); 18 patients required hospital admission, four adults died. The mean duration of infection was longer for adults than for children, and the proportion of taste and smell disorders was higher in older patients. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PLH persons often develop paucisymptomatic forms of COVID-19 infection, although they may also experience severe outcomes, including death. Clinicians should be aware that COVID-19 symptoms in PLH persons are often extra-respiratory signs, mostly digestive and neurologic, which may help in the earlier identification of COVID-19 infection in this particular population of patients.","Rousseau, M-C; Hully, M; Milh, M; Juzeau, D; Pollez, B; Peudenier, S; Bahi Buisson, N; Gautheron, V; Chabrol, B; Billette de Villemeur, T",Arch Pediatr,291,24

OBJECTIVES: We report a series of 68 patients assessed at a Regional Infection Unit in the UK. METHODS: Between 29 January 2020 and 24 February 2020, demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We compared clinical features between patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. RESULTS: Patients assessed were aged from 0 to 76 years; 36/68 were female. Peaks of clinical assessments coincided with updates to the case definition for suspected COVID-19. Microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2, mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, non-SARS/MERS coronaviruses and rhinovirus/enterovirus. Nine of sixty-eight received antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted, 5 due to inability to self-isolate. Patients requiring admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were more likely to have fever or raised respiratory rate compared to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients had mild illness, which did not require clinical intervention. This finding supports a community testing approach, supported by clinicians able to review more unwell patients. Extensions of the epidemiological criteria for the case definition of suspected COVID-19 lead to increased screening intensity; strategies must be in place to accommodate this in time for forthcoming changes as the epidemic develops.","Easom, Nicholas; Moss, Peter; Barlow, Gavin; Samson, Anda; Taynton, Thomas; Adams, Kate; Ivan, Monica; Burns, Phillipa; Gajee, Kavitha; Eastick, Kirstine; Lillie, Patrick J",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,291,26

Yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. This article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. We make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints.

Local government initiatives, such as the City of Johannesburg’s (CoJ) Expanded Social Package (ESP) ‘Siyasizana’ [we help each other], have been established to enhance food security amongst the city’s most vulnerable based on their level of income. Aim: This article analysed the extent to which the ESP was effective in addressing food insecurity in the wake of COVID-19. Setting: This research was descriptive and explanatory in nature that played an important role in obtaining an in-depth interpretation of the challenges of the implementation of ESP in mitigating food insecurity in the CoJ. Methods: This article utilised a qualitative case study design with the aid of existing literature, municipal documents and authoritative internet sources in order to analyse the extent to which the ESP is effective in addressing food insecurity in the wake of COVID-19. Results: This article found out that the ESP did not expressly address the COVID-19-induced food insecurity because of numerous challenges, namely awareness, stigmatisation, qualification and hidden costs. Conclusion: The CoJ should bring in private players to finance the programme as COVID-19 has increased the number of beneficiaries, relax the requirement for in-person application to allow for online registration, increase the ESP poverty threshold of R6100 to cater for those on the border of poverty and diversify its means testing to include other criteria such as Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF), which will provide much needed relief to those who might have lost income.","Mazenda, Adrino Matjane Koketso Maleka Mahlomola S.; Mushayanyama, Tinashe Masiya Tyanai",Africa&#039;s Public Service Delivery and Performance Review,291,1

As such, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been proposed including distancing requirements, surveillance testing, and updating ventilation systems. Unfortunately, there is limited guidance for which policy or set of policies are most effective for a specific school system. We develop a novel approach to model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 quanta in a closed classroom environment that extends traditional transmission models that assume uniform mixing through air recirculation by including the local spread of quanta from a contagious source. In addition, the behavior of students with respect to guideline compliance was modeled through an agent-based simulation. Estimated infection rates were on average lower using traditional transmission models compared to our approach. Further, we found that although ventilation changes were effective at reducing mean transmission risk, it had much less impact than distancing practices. Duration of the class was an important factor in determining the transmission risk. For the same total number of semester hours for a class, delivering lectures more frequently for shorter durations was preferable to less frequently with longer durations. Finally, as expected, as the contact tracing level increased, more infectious students were identified and removed from the environment and the spread slowed, though there were diminishing returns. These findings can help provide guidance as to which school-based policies would be most effective at reducing risk and can be used in a cost/comparative effectiveness estimation study given local costs and constraints.","Zafarnejad, Reyhaneh; Griffin, Paul M.",Comput Biol Med,291,14

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present Bayesian methods for estimating force of infection using serological surveys of infections which produce a lasting immune response, accounting for imperfections of the test, and uncertainty in such imperfections. In this estimation, the sensitivity and specificity can either be fixed, or belief distributions of their values can be elicited to allow for uncertainty. We analyse data from two published serological studies of dengue, one in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with a single survey and one in Medellin, Colombia, with repeated surveys in the same individuals. For the Colombo study, we illustrate how the inferred force of infection increases as the sensitivity decreases, and the reverse for specificity. When 100% sensitivity and specificity are assumed, the results are very similar to those from a standard analysis with binomial regression. For the Medellin study, the elicited distribution for sensitivity had a lower mean and higher variance than the one for specificity. Consequently, taking uncertainty in sensitivity into account resulted in a wide credible interval for the force of infection. CONCLUSIONS: These methods can make more realistic estimates of force of infection, and help inform the choice of serological tests for future serosurveys.","Alexander, Neal; Carabali, Mabel; Lim, Jacqueline K.",PLoS One,291,11

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association of metabolic risk factors and risk of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was designed according to PRISMA guidelines. Two independent researchers searched for the relevant studies using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The search terms developed focusing on two main roots of “Covid-19” and “metabolic risk factors”. All relevant observational, analytical studies, review articles, and a meta-analysis on the adult population were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effect model for pooling proportions to address heterogeneity among studies. Data were analyzed using STATA package version 11.2, (StataCorp, USA). RESULTS: Through a comprehensive systematic search in the targeted databases we found 1124 papers, after running the proses of refining, 13 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of obesity in Covid-19 patients was 29% (95% CI: 14–47%). For Diabetes and Hypertension, these were 22% (95% CI: 12% 33%) and 32% (95% CI: 12% 56%), respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of the three pooled prevalence without any significant small-study effects. Such warning points, to some extent, guide physicians and clinicians to better understand the importance of controlling co-morbid risk factors in prioritizing resource allocation and interventions. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed that hypertension is more prevalent than obesity and diabetes in patients with Covid-19 disease. The prevalence of co-morbid metabolic risk factors must be adopted for better management and priority settings of public health vaccination and other required interventions. The results may help to improve services delivery in COVID-19 patients, while helping to develop better policies for prevention and response to COVID-19 and its critical outcomes.","Moazzami, Bahram; Chaichian, Shahla; Kasaeian, Amir; Djalalinia, Shirin; Akhlaghdoust, Meisam; Eslami, Masoud; Broumand, Behrooz",PLoS One,291,24

Yet, poorer segments of the population cannot afford to stay at home and must continue to work. In this paper, we test whether work-related mobility is effectively influenced by the local intensity of poverty. To do so, we exploit poverty data and Google mobility data for 242 regions of nine Latin American and African countries. We find that the drop in work-related mobility during the first lockdown period was indeed significantly lower in high-poverty regions compared to other regions. We also illustrate how higher poverty has induced a faster spread of the virus. The policy implication is that social protection measures in the form of food or cash transfers must be complementary to physical distancing measures. Further research must evaluate how such transfers, when implemented, have attenuated the difference between poor and non-poor regions in terms of exposure to the virus.","Bargain, Olivier; Aminjonov, Ulugbek",World Dev,291,1

Typically, tracheostomy is considered in patients who remain ventilator dependent beyond 2 weeks. However, in the setting of this novel respiratory virus, the safety and benefits of tracheostomy are not well-defined. Our aim is to describe our experience with percutaneous tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a single center retrospective descriptive study. We reviewed comorbidities and outcomes in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy at our institution from April 2020 to September 2020. In addition, we provide details of our attempt to minimize aerosolization by using a modified protocol with brief periods of planned apnea. RESULTS A total of 24 patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy during the study. The average body mass index was 33.0±10.0. At 30 days posttracheostomy 17 (71%) patients still had the tracheostomy tube and 14 (58%) remained ventilator dependent. There were 3 (13%) who died within 30 days. At the time of data analysis in November 2020, 9 (38%) patients had died and 7 (29%) had been decannulated. None of the providers who participated in the procedure experienced signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION Percutaneous tracheostomy in prolonged respiratory failure due to COVID-19 appears to be safe to perform at the bedside for both the patient and health care providers in the appropriate clinical context. Morbid obesity did not limit the ability to perform percutaneous tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients.","Cohen, Samuel E; Lopez, Angelena R; Ng, Philip K; Friedman, Oren A; Chaux, George E",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,291,24

All serotype of DV were transfected with all synthesized siRNA in vitro, using BHK-21 cell lines. Culture fluid from test and control was tested by Real time PCR for CT value comparison in siRNA treated cell line (test) and untreated cell line (controls).

A Review of Guidelines for Safe Cancer Care in the Wake of the Pandemic,17.03779,13.021831,2020-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the overexpression of inflammatory genes. Controlling CRS is essential for improving the therapeutic effects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cells. However, current treatment options are limited given the complexity of cytokine interactions so it is important to seek a mild strategy with broad-spectrum inhibition to overcome this challenge. METHODS: Using THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), we demonstrated the transcriptional suppression of inflammatory genes in activated macrophages. RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing were conducted to identify the key target genes of the inflammatory response. Pathogen- and CAR T cell-induced CRS models were also established to assess the efficacy and safety of targeting CDK7. RESULTS: CDK7 blockade attenuated cytokine release, mitigated hyperinflammatory states and rescued mice from lethal CRS. Targeting CDK7 preferentially suppressed a set of inflammatory genes, of which STAT1 and IL1 were the key targets associated with super enhancers. Furthermore, we confirmed the potent efficacy of THZ1 in alleviating the CRS induced by CAR T cell infusion without causing tissue injury or impairing antitumor effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates the CDK7-dependent transcription addiction of inflammatory genes. Targeting CDK7 is a promising strategy for treating CRS by inhibiting multiple cytokines.

OBJECTIVE: Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQW) was selected as an example to discuss the feasibility of a bioassay for quality control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology was used to screen potential targets in LHQW with respect to its anti-inflammatory effects. An in vitro cell model was used to validate the prediction. An anti-inflammatory bioassay was established for the quality evaluation of LHQW in 40 batches of marketed products and three batches of destructed samples. RESULTS: The tumor necrosis factor/interleukin-6 (TNF/IL-6) pathway via macrophage was selected as the potential target of LHQW. The IC(50) value of LHQW on RAW 264.7 was 799.8 μg/mL. LHQW had significant inhibitory effects on the expression of IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). The anti-inflammatory biopotency of LHQW was calculated based on the inhibitory bioactivity on IL-6. The biopotency of 40 marketed samples ranged from 404 U/μg to 2171 U/μg, with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 37.91%. By contrast, the contents of forsythin indicated lower CV (28.05%) than the value of biopotency. Moreover, the biopotencies of destructed samples declined approximate 50%, while the contents of forsythin did not change. This newly established bioassay revealed a better ability to discriminate the quality variations of LHQW as compared to the routine chemical determination. CONCLUSIONS: A well-established bioassay may have promising ability to reveal the variance in quality of TCM.","Chen, Shuaishuai; Yang, Xiaojuan; Wei, Ziying; Zhang, Yanru; Huang, Ying; Shi, Zhuo; Zhang, Ziteng; Wang, Jiabo; Zhang, Haizhu; Ma, Jianli; Xiao, Xiaohe; Niu, Ming",Pharmaceutical biology,291,28

They serve as receptors on cell membranes and interact with extracellular ligands to mediate intracellular molecular signals. One of the least-studied members of the integrin family is integrin-α9β1, which is widely distributed in various human tissues and organs. Integrin-α9β1 regulates the physiological state of cells through a variety of complex signaling pathways to participate in the specific pathological processes of some intractable diseases. In recent years, an increasing amount of research has focused on the role of α9β1 in the molecular mechanisms of different refractory diseases and its promising potential as a therapeutic target. Accordingly, this review introduces and summarizes recent research related to integrin-α9β1, describes the synergistic functions of α9β1 and its corresponding ligands in cancer, autoimmune diseases, nerve injury and thrombosis and, more importantly, highlights the potential of α9β1 as a distinctive target for the treatment of these intractable diseases.","Xu, Shihan; Zhang, Tingwei; Cao, Zhengguo; Zhong, Wenjie; Zhang, Chuangwei; Li, Han; Song, Jinlin",Front Immunol,291,26

These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Kissler, Stephen M; Tedijanto, Christine; Goldstein, Edward; Grad, Yonatan H.; Lipsitch, Marc",,291,16

In susceptible BALB/c, H-2Kd was downregulated, while H-2Dd was upregulated following infection by MHV-4. In contrast, H-2K and H-2D antigens were both upregulated in either MHV-4-susceptible B10.S and (BALB/c × SJL) F1, or MHV-4-resistant SJL-derived cerebral endothelial cells following infection with this virus. Class II antigen expression was unchanged following MHV-4 infection. Virus-induced MHC class I modulation is genetically regulated, and may influence virus clearance by class I-dependent CTL.","Joseph, J.; Knobler, R. L.; Lubli, F. D.; Hart, M.

Although much has been discovered about COVID-19 and its pathogenesis, the WHO has identified an immediate need to increase the levels of testing for COVID-19 and identify the stages of the disease accurately for appropriate action to be taken by clinicians and emergency care units. Harnessing technology for accurate diagnosis and staging will improve patient outcomes and minimize serious consequences of false-positive test results. Point-of-care technologies aim to intervene at every stage of the disease to quickly identify infected patients and asymptomatic carriers and stratify them for timely treatment. This requires the tests to be rapid, accurate, sensitive, simple to use and compatible with many body fluids. Mobile platforms are optimal for remote, small-scale deployment, whereas facility-based platforms at hospital centers and laboratory settings offer higher throughput. Here we review evidence-based point-of-care technologies in the context of the entire continuum of COVID-19, from early screening to treatment, and discuss their impact on improving patient outcomes.","Parupudi, Tejasvi; Panchagnula, Neha; Muthukumar, Sriram; Prasad, Shalini",BioTechniques,291,23

Disturbances in its composition can lead to a variety of symptoms that can extend to other organs. Likewise, acute or chronic conditions in other organs can affect the composition and physiology of the gut microbiome. Here, we discuss interorgan communication along the gut–lung axis, as well as interactions between lung and coronary heart diseases and between cardiovascular disease and the gut microbiome. This triangle of organs, which also affects the clinical outcome of COVID-19 infections, is connected by means of numerous receptors and effectors, including immune cells and immune-modulating factors such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and trimethlamine–N–oxide (TMAO). The gut microbiome plays an important role in each of these, thus affecting the health of the lungs and the heart, and this interplay occurs in both directions. The gut microbiome can be influenced by the oral uptake of probiotics. With an improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for interorgan communication, we can start to define what requirements an ‘ideal’ probiotic should have and its role in this triangle.","Wassenaar, Trudy M.; Juncos, Valentina A.; Zimmermann, Kurt",Int J Mol Sci,291,26
