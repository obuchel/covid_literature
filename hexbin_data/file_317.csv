Participants included 660 college students who consented to complete a questionnaire. The results showed significant differences between students who perceived that they were at risk for type 2 diabetes onset and those who thought their peers were the ones at risk. A higher prevalence of participants thought their peers were the ones at risk for type 2 diabetes. Women were more likely than men to report a higher risk perception, indicating that their peers were at lower risk for diabetes onset.","Reyes-Velázquez, Wanda; Sealey-Potts, Claudia",Diabetes Spectr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334082/,317

2900,Hepatitis A Virus: Essential Knowledge and a Novel Identify-Isolate-Inform Tool for Frontline Healthcare Providers,2017-10-18,"Infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes a highly contagious illness that can lead to serious morbidity and occasional mortality. Although the overall incidence of HAV has been declining since the introduction of the HAV vaccine, there have been an increasing number of outbreaks within the United States and elsewhere between 2016 and 2017. These outbreaks have had far-reaching consequences, with a large number of patients requiring hospitalization and several deaths. Accordingly, HAV is proving to present a renewed public health challenge. Through use of the “Identify-Isolate-Inform” tool as adapted for HAV, emergency physicians can become more familiar with the identification and management of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with exposure, infection, or risk of contracting disease. While it can be asymptomatic, HAV typically presents with a prodrome of fever, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain followed by jaundice. Healthcare providers should maintain strict standard precautions for all patients suspected of having HAV infection as well as contact precautions in special cases. Hand hygiene with soap and warm water should be emphasized, and affected patients should be counseled to avoid food preparation and close contact with vulnerable populations. Additionally, ED providers should offer post-exposure prophylaxis to exposed contacts and encourage vaccination as well as other preventive measures for at-risk individuals. ED personnel should inform local public health departments of any suspected case.","Koenig, Kristi L.; Shastry, Siri; Burns, Michael J.",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5654866/,317
3636,Identification of Potential Type II Diabetes in a Chinese Population with a Sensitive Decision Tree Approach,2019-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with a steadfast increase in prevalence. Due to the chronic course of the disease combining with devastating complications, this disorder could easily carry a financial burden. The early diagnosis of diabetes remains as one of the major challenges medical providers are facing, and the satisfactory screening tools or methods are still required, especially a population- or community-based tool. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 15,323 subjects who underwent the annual check-up in the Department of Family Medicine of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from January 2017 to June 2017. With a strict data filtration, 10,436 records from the eligible participants were utilized to develop a prediction model using the J48 decision tree algorithm. Nine variables, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease or stroke, family history of diabetes, physical activity, work-related stress, and salty food preference, were considered. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for identifying potential diabetes were 94.2%, 94.0%, 94.2%, and 94.8%, respectively. The structure of the decision tree shows that age is the most significant feature. The decision tree demonstrated that among those participants with age ≤ 49, 5497 participants (97%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic, while age > 49, 771 participants (50%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. In the subgroup where people were 34 < age ≤ 49 and BMI ≥ 25, when with positive family history of diabetes, 89 (92%) out of 97 individuals were identified as diabetic and, when without family history of diabetes, 576 (58%) of the individuals were identified as nondiabetic. Work-related stress was identified as being associated with diabetes. In individuals with 34 < age ≤ 49 and BMI ≥ 25 and without family history of diabetes, 22 (51%) of the individuals with high work-related stress were identified as nondiabetic while 349 (88%) of the individuals with low or moderate work-related stress were identified as not having diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed a classifier based on a decision tree which used nine features of patients which are easily obtained and noninvasive as predictor variables to identify potential incidents of diabetes. The classifier indicates that a decision tree analysis can be successfully applied to screen diabetes, which will support clinical practitioners for rapid diabetes identification. The model provides a means to target the prevention of diabetes which could reduce the burden on the health system through effective case management.","Pei, Dongmei; Zhang, Chengpu; Quan, Yu; Guo, Qiyong",J Diabetes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6362481/,317

The stresses were rehousing with the addition of ilt-free contact birds, corticosteroid treatment and the onset of lay. The contact birds were also monitored for transmission of the virus from the carrier birds. Rehousing with unfamiliar birds induced ilt virus shedding in one of five birds and there was evidence of transmission from this bird to its mate. The onset of lay had a significant effect on the overall shedding rates of the carrier birds. Nine of 10 birds shed virus after onset of lay compared with only two in the three-and-a-half weeks before, and there was a highly significant increase (P<0·001) in the overall number of virus isolations during this period. Corticosteroid treatment did not affect virus shedding. These results may explain some of the apparently spontaneous outbreaks of ilt which occur in the field.","HUGHES, C.S.; GASKELL, R.M.; JONES, R.C.; BRADBURY, J.M.; JORDAN, F.T.W.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126566/,317

Developing improved vaccines that elicit broader immunity remains a public health priority. Immune responses to current vaccines focus on the haemagglutinin head domain, whereas next-generation vaccines target less variable virus structures, including the haemagglutinin stem. Strategies employed to improve vaccine efficacy involve using structure-based design and nanoparticle display to optimize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of target antigens; increasing the antigen dose; using novel adjuvants; stimulating cellular immunity; and targeting other viral proteins, including neuraminidase, matrix protein 2 or nucleoprotein.

14202,Myofunctional Therapy App for Severe Apnea–Hypopnea Sleep Obstructive Syndrome: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,2020-11-09,"PURPOSE: The definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has often been modified with Berlin criteria being the most recent. ARDS is divided into three categories based on the degree of hypoxemia using PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio. Radiological findings are standardized with bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates present on chest imaging. This study investigated whether chest imaging is relevant in diagnosing ARDS in polytrauma patients. METHODS: The 5-year prospective study included consecutive trauma patients admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU. Demographics, ISS, physiologic parameters, resuscitation parameters, and ARDS data were prospectively collected. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) was categorized as Berlin criteria without bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on imaging. Data are presented as median (IQR), p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: 267 patients were included. Median age was 45 (26–59) years, 199 (75%) males, ISS was 29 (22–35), 258 (97%) patients had blunt injuries. Thirty-five (13%) patients died. 192 (72%) patients developed AHRF. AHRF patients were older, more often male, had higher ISS, needed more crystalloids and blood products than patients without AHRF. They developed more pulmonary complications, stayed longer on the ventilator, in ICU and in hospital, and died more often. Fifteen (6%) patients developed ARDS. There was no difference in outcome between ARDS and AHRF patients. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients developed AHRF and only a few ARDS. Patients with similar hypoxemia without bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates had comparable outcome as ARDS patients. Chest imaging did not influence the outcome. Large-scale multicenter validation of ARDS criteria is warranted to investigate whether diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging could be omitted as a mandatory part of the definition of ARDS in polytrauma patients.

Much less is known regarding the association between reduction in cigarettes per day (CPD) and mortality. The primary aim of this systematic review is to compare the mortality risk between smokers achieving a sustained reduction of CPD and smokers maintaining their smoking rate. The secondary aims are to compare the mortality risk between smokers achieving complete, sustained smoking cessation and (1) smokers maintaining their smoking rate and (2) smokers who achieved a sustained reduction in smoking rate. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEDLINE, Web of Sciences and Embase will be searched using a prespecified search strategy, up to 23 November 2020, and will be limited to studies published in English and in French. Longitudinal observational studies using individual data including smokers with at least two distant CPD assessments and a follow-up period of systematic mortality data recording will be included. The main outcome will be the all-cause mortality. The secondary outcome will be specific mortality. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to assess the risk of bias of individual studies. Outcomes will be analysed using HRs. All other outcomes’ effect size reported in included studies will be converted in HRs using validated methods. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We intend to publish the results of our review in a peer-reviewed journal and to present the findings at national and international meetings and conferences.

16092,Feasibility and acceptability of a multi-domain intervention to increase Mediterranean diet adherence and physical activity in older UK adults at risk of dementia: protocol for the MedEx-UK randomised controlled trial,2021-02-05,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) play an essential role in osteogenesis and bone metabolism and have already been recognized as one of the most popular seed cells for bone tissue engineering for bone diseases. However, high-glucose (HG) conditions in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) exert deleterious effects on BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Semaphorin 3B (Sema3B) increases osteoblast differentiation in bone metabolism. Here, we determined the role of Sema3B in the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in the HG microenvironment. The HG microenvironment decreased Sema3B expression in BMSCs. Moreover, HG inhibited BMSC proliferation. Furthermore, HG inhibited osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs by decreasing the expression of bone formation markers, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineralization. However, the administration of recombinant Sema3B reversed all of these effects. Moreover, our study found that Sema3B could activate the Akt pathway in BMSCs. Sema3B rescues defects in BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in the HG microenvironment by activating the Akt pathway. These effects were significantly reduced by treatment with an Akt inhibitor. Together, these findings demonstrate that Sema3B promotes the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via the Akt pathway under HG conditions. Our study provides new insights into the potential ability of Sema3B to ameliorate BMSC proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in an HG microenvironment.","Xing, Quan; Feng, Jingyi; Zhang, Xiaolei",Stem Cells Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935575/,317
17195,Combining a Hudl App With Telehealth to Increase Home Exercise Program Adherence in People With Chronic Diseases Experiencing Financial Distress: Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: Addressing the modifiable health behaviors of cancer survivors is important in rural communities that are disproportionately impacted by cancer (eg, those in Central Appalachia). However, such efforts are limited, and existing interventions may not meet the needs of rural communities. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the development and proof-of-concept testing of weSurvive, a behavioral intervention for rural Appalachian cancer survivors. METHODS: The Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, a systematic model for designing behavioral interventions, informed the study design. An advisory team (n=10) of community stakeholders and researchers engaged in a participatory process to identify desirable features for interventions targeting rural cancer survivors. The resulting multimodal, 13-week weSurvive intervention was delivered to 12 participants across the two cohorts. Intervention components included in-person group classes and group and individualized telehealth calls. Indicators reflecting five feasibility domains (acceptability, demand, practicality, implementation, and limited efficacy) were measured using concurrent mixed methods. Pre-post changes and effect sizes were assessed for limited efficacy data. Descriptive statistics and content analysis were used to summarize data for other domains. RESULTS: Participants reported high program satisfaction (acceptability). Indicators of demand included enrollment of cancer survivors with various cancer types and attrition (1/12, 8%), recruitment (12/41, 30%), and attendance (median 62%) rates. Dietary (7/12, 59%) and physical activity (PA; 10/12, 83%) behaviors were the most frequently chosen behavioral targets. However, the findings indicate that participants did not fully engage in action planning activities, including setting specific goals. Implementation indicators showed 100% researcher fidelity to delivery and retention protocols, whereas practicality indicators highlighted participation barriers. Pre-post changes in limited efficacy outcomes regarding cancer-specific beliefs and knowledge and behavior-specific self-efficacy, intentions, and behaviors were in desired directions and demonstrated small and moderate effect sizes. Regarding dietary and PA behaviors, effect sizes for fruit and vegetable intake, snacks, dietary fat, and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity were small (Cohen d=0.00 to 0.32), whereas the effect sizes for change in PA were small to medium (Cohen d=0.22 to 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: weSurvive has the potential to be a feasible intervention for rural Appalachian cancer survivors. It will be refined and further tested based on the study findings, which also provide recommendations for other behavioral interventions targeting rural cancer survivors. Recommendations included adding additional recruitment and engagement strategies to increase demand and practicality as well as increasing accountability and motivation for participant involvement in self-monitoring activities through the use of technology (eg, text messaging). Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of using a systematic model (eg, the ORBIT framework) and small-scale proof-of-concept studies when adapting or developing behavioral interventions, as doing so identifies the intervention’s potential for feasibility and areas that need improvement before time- and resource-intensive efficacy trials. This could support a more efficient translation into practice.","Porter, Kathleen J; Moon, Katherine E; LeBaron, Virginia T; Zoellner, Jamie M",JMIR Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8076984/,317

However, climate policies could impose a financial burden on the global poor through increased energy and food prices. Here, we project poverty rates until 2050 and assess how they are influenced by mitigation policies consistent with the 1.5 °C target. A continuation of historical trends will leave 350 million people globally in extreme poverty by 2030. Without progressive redistribution, climate policies would push an additional 50 million people into poverty. However, redistributing the national carbon pricing revenues domestically as an equal-per-capita climate dividend compensates this policy side effect, even leading to a small net reduction of the global poverty headcount (−6 million). An additional international climate finance scheme enables a substantial poverty reduction globally and also in Sub-Saharan Africa. Combining national redistribution with international climate finance thus provides an important entry point to climate policy in developing countries.","Soergel, Bjoern; Kriegler, Elmar; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon; Bauer, Nico; Leimbach, Marian; Popp, Alexander",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079366/,317

20919,Impact of PCSK9 Immunization on Glycemic Indices in Diabetic Rats,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 34 weeks of gestation complicates 1% of pregnancies and accounts for one-third of preterm births. International guidelines recommend expectant management, along with antenatal steroids before 34 weeks and antibiotics. Up-to-date evidence about the risks and benefits of administering tocolysis after PPROM, however, is lacking. In theory, reducing uterine contractility could delay delivery and reduce the risks of prematurity and its adverse short- and long-term consequences, but it might also prolong fetal exposure to inflammation, infection, and acute obstetric complications, potentially associated with neonatal death or long-term sequelae. The primary objective of this study is to assess whether short-term (48 h) tocolysis reduces perinatal mortality/morbidity in PPROM at 22 to 33 completed weeks of gestation. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial will be performed in 29 French maternity units. Women with PPROM between 22(0/7) and 33(6/7) weeks of gestation, a singleton pregnancy, and no condition contraindicating expectant management will be randomized to receive a 48-hour oral treatment by either nifedipine or placebo (1:1 ratio). The primary outcome will be the occurrence of perinatal mortality/morbidity, a composite outcome including fetal death, neonatal death, or severe neonatal morbidity before discharge. If we assume an alpha-risk of 0.05 and beta-risk of 0.20 (i.e., a statistical power of 80%), 702 women (351 per arm) are required to show a reduction of the primary endpoint from 35% (placebo group) to 25% (nifedipine group). We plan to increase the required number of subjects by 20%, to replace any patients who leave the study early. The total number of subjects required is thus 850. Data will be analyzed by the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: This trial will inform practices and policies worldwide. Optimized prenatal management to improve the prognosis of infants born preterm could benefit about 50,000 women in the European Union and 40,000 in the United States each year.

23741,Emerging Respiratory Pandemics,2016-02-22,"Current diagnostic methods allow microbial identification in 50% of patients admitted with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Guidelines derived from epidemiological data help physicians to start empirical antimicrobial therapy. Definitive microbial diagnosis is useful to guide further pathogen-directed therapy. Blood cultures, cultures of respiratory specimens and urine antigen tests are recommended to determine the causative bacterial pathogen. Positive blood cultures range from 15 to 25% of CAP patients according to severity. Whether sputum specimens represent or not lower respiratory secretions determines its accuracy in CAP microbial diagnosis. In intubated patients, endotracheal aspirates are often of interest. Detection of positive pneumococcal or legionella urinary antigen is often associated with CAP severity. The sensitivity of this test is not decreased in patients who have received antibiotics prior to sampling. Viral pneumonia account for 10 to 40% of severe CAP. Nasal swabs are recommended for influenza identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to deliver oseltamivir treatment. In the emergency department, atypical pneumonia serology is less useful than respiratory specimens obtained using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Serum PCR to diagnose bacterial CAP is not superior to the other usual methods.","Thellier, D.; Georges, H.; Leroy, O.",Reanimation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117809/,317

Specifically, our research aims at abstracting the process mechanisms that enabled such an initiative. The unearthed mechanisms would inform future research on the modalities for orchestrating such an initiative.

44279,"Pilot Randomised Evaluation of Singing in Dementia (PRESIDE): protocol for a two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled feasibility study with waiting-list control",2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: The first US cases occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic in Jan. 2020. Initially, some states required patients be screened for other respiratory pathogens before COVID-19. Information on COVID-19 coinfections with other respiratory pathogens is limited. We investigated prevalence of COVID-19 coinfections with other respiratory pathogens in VA. METHODS: Molecular and viral culture test results from 9/29/2019-5/31/2020 for respiratory pathogens (Adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis/parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, COVID-19 and other Coronaviruses, Influenza, human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Rhino-Enterovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)) were identified from VA data sources. COVID-19 tested patients were evaluated within 7 days for respiratory pathogen coinfections from 2/1/2020–5/31/2020. Patient demographics were obtained for patients with coinfections. RESULTS: A total of 825,282 respiratory pathogen tests (including COVID-19) were performed from Sept. 2019 with percent positive shown in Figure 1. Of these, 617,541 tests were performed starting in Feb. 2020 (Table 1). There were 14,839 (6.5%) positive COVID-19 tests (10,223 unique patients) of 227,111 tests performed (174,747 unique patients). 30,066/174,747 (17%) of patients with COVID-19 were tested for another respiratory pathogen. Fifty-six (0.55%) unique COVID-19 patients were detected with coinfection including 3 COVID-19 positive patients with > 1 other respiratory pathogen (2 with Coronavirus and Adenovirus and 1 with Coronavirus and Rhino-Enterovirus). Other coinfections included 18 Rhino-Enterovirus, 15 Influenza, 10 with another Coronavirus, 4 RSV, 3 hMPV, 2 HPIV, and 1 C. pneumoniae. Demographics of coinfected patients are shown in Table 2.

Detection was limited since not all COVID-19 patients were tested for other respiratory pathogens and respiratory pathogens were declining when COVID-19 emerged. Coinfections were detected with different respiratory pathogens. Further comparisons of coinfected vs. non-coinfected patients to assess outcome or actionable results will be important as we enter the next influenza season.

We sought to evaluate the utility of e-consults to triage and provide rapid ID recommendations to providers. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study reviewing ID e-consults in three institutions in the North Texas region: Clements University Hospital (CUH), Parkland Hospital and Health System (PHHS), and the VA North Texas Health Care System (VA) from March 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Variables collected include age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, time to completion, reason for consult and outcome of consult (initiation or removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and recommendation to test or retest for COVID-19). RESULTS: We performed all analysis using R studio (Version 1.3.959). Characteristics of 198 patients included: 112(57%) male, 86(43%) female, 86(43%) Caucasian, 71(36%) Hispanic, 42(21%) African American, 6(3%) Asian and mean(sd) age of 55.1(15.9). Patient comorbidities included: 89(45%) with a heart condition, 77(39%) diabetes, 30(15%) asthma and 14(7%) liver disease. Median time to completion for all hospitals was 4 hours(h); ((CUH (4h) vs PHHS (2h), p< 0.05; VA (5.5h) vs PHHS (2h) p< 0.05)). Most common reasons for e-consult included: (63)32% regarding re-testing ((CUH 14(21%) vs PHHS 43(50%), p< 0.05; CUH vs VA 14(27%), p< 0.05; PHHS vs VA, p< 0.05)), (61)31% testing ((CUH 25(37%) vs PHHS 39(45%), p< 0.05; CUH vs VA 7(16%), p< 0.05; PHHS vs VA, p< 0.05)) and 61(31%) infection prevention (IP). Based on the e-consult recommendation, 53(27%) of patients were tested ((CUH 31(45%) vs PHHS 11(13%), p< 0.05, CUH vs VA 11(25%), PHHS vs VA, p< 0.05)), 45(23%) were re-tested, 44(22%) of patients had PPE started on and 19% had PPE removed ((CUH 0(0%) vs PHHS 16(19%), p< 0.05; CUH vs VA 21(48%), p< 0.05; PHHS vs VA, p< 0.05)).

The standardized international HBSC research protocol was used. The study population was the nationally representative sample of 3267 students of V and VII grades of primary and I grade of secondary schools in Serbia. Potential predictors for the probability of occurrence vs. non-occurrence of cyberbullying exposure at least once and multiple times were identified among 24 explanatory variables, including the individual characteristics and family context. The cyberbullying exposure was more prevalent among girls than among boys of school-age, i.e., over one in seven girls and one in ten boys were exposed to cyberbullying. Over one in seven students at age 13 years and almost every seventh student at grade I of the gymnasium were exposed to cyberbullying. There were more students exposed to at least one cyberbullying than to multiple cyberbullying. Potential predictors of exposure to cyberbullying are gender, opinion of the family’s affluence status, fathers’ employment, communication with father, and family support. The study compensates for the evidence of cyberbullying in Serbia, which could help raise awareness, inform national and international stakeholders in the region and enable their efforts and strengthen cooperation in ending cyberbullying. This study’s findings could inform the development of an intervention program aimed at families and various professionals involved in protecting and improving school-age children’s health and well-being.","Rakic, Ljiljana; Santric-Milicevic, Milena; Nikolic, Dejan; Vasic, Milena; Babic, Uros; Todorovic, Jovana; Terzic-Supic, Zorica; Milenkovic, Sanja",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8306492/,317
56413,Research Forum Special Edition: COVID Educational Program 2021,2021-08-04,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a diffuse, acute, inflammatory lung disease characterized by a severe respiratory failure. Recognizing and promptly treating ARDS is critical to combat the high mortality associated with the disease. Despite a significant progress in the treatment of ARDS, our ability to identify early patients and predict outcomes remains limited. The development of novel biomarkers is crucial. In this study, we profiled microRNA (miRNA) expression of plasma-derived exosomes in ARDS disease by small RNA sequencing. Sequencing of 8 ARDS patients and 10 healthy subjects (HSs) allowed to identify 12 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs (adjusted p < 0.05). Pathway analysis of their predicted targets revealed enrichment in several biological processes in agreement with ARDS pathophysiology, such as inflammation, immune cell activation, and fibrosis. By quantitative RT-PCR, we validated the alteration of nine exosomal miRNAs in an independent cohort of 15 ARDS patients and 20 HSs, among which seven present high capability in discriminating ARDS patients from HSs (area under the curve > 0.8) (miR-130a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-24-3p, miR-98-3p, Let-7d-3p, miR-1273a, and miR-193a-5p). These findings highlight exosomal miRNA dysregulation in the plasma of ARDS patients which provide promising diagnostic biomarkers and open new perspectives for the development of therapeutics.","Parzibut, Gilles; Henket, Monique; Moermans, Catherine; Struman, Ingrid; Louis, Edouard; Malaise, Michel; Louis, Renaud; Misset, Benoît; Njock, Makon-Sébastien; Guiot, Julien",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319727/,317
56789,Adherence to Antidiabetic Medications among Women with Gestational Diabetes,2021-08-06,"We compare responses from an online survey among 700 customers of transportation network companies (TNC) in Boston and Philadelphia to investigate TNC’s impact on vehicle ownership, trip making, and mode choice. We first use a qualitative comparative analysis to examine changes in respondents’ travel behavior and vehicle ownership after adopting TNC. We then use a random parameter logit regression analysis to investigate customers’ preferences between transit and TNC based on a choice experiment. We find that in both cities, TNC allows customers, including those who currently do not own a car, to either delay purchasing a car or forgo a car altogether. TNC enables customers across income levels to take trips that they otherwise would not have taken. Meanwhile, TNC substitutes for more than complementing transit. The random parameter logit analysis indicates that when choosing between TNC and transit, individuals in both cities consider waiting time and overall travel time for transit to be more burdensome than those for TNC. Bostonians perceive the time spent walking to and from transit to be less burdensome, and the time spent traveling in vehicle to be more burdensome than do Philadelphians. Differences in built environment, mode share within transit systems, and income likely contribute to respondents’ different values of time between the two cities. Our paper is the first to compare individual trade-off between transit and TNC in two cities with different urban settings and transit services. The findings have implications on transit service planning, station area improvements, parking regulations, and traffic management.

58410,β2-adrenergic receptor expression and the effects of norepinephrine and propranolol on various head and neck cancer subtypes,2021-09-23,"[Image: see text] Several Lewis and Bronsted acid catalysts were tested for the synthesis of some targeted diamides with anticancer activity from dicarboxylic acids and amines under the same reaction condition. Among those catalysts, Nb(2)O(5) showed the highest catalytic activity to the corresponding diamides. Nb(2)O(5) shows water- and base-tolerant properties for which it gives the highest yield of the synthesized products. Here, we present a novel and sustainable method for the direct synthesis of diamides with anticancer activity using a reusable heterogeneous catalyst Nb(2)O(5). A molecular docking study was performed for all of the synthesized compounds with various therapeutical targets of cancer and found that the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) has shown a significant dock score for our synthesized products. After obtaining the best pose from molecular docking, the complex is used for molecular dynamics study by running simulations for 10 ns. The root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of α carbon atoms of all systems are analyzed to detect their stability. This method is effective for the direct synthesis of diamides as anticancer agents from dicarboxylic acids and amines using Nb(2)O(5) as a base-tolerant heterogeneous catalyst.","Ali, Md.

60189,Evaluation for Disparities in Experience With Internet-Based Health Care Among US Patients With Chronic Eye Diseases.,2020-08-27,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has revolutionized our understanding of the neural underpinnings of alcohol teratogenesis. This technique can detect alterations in white matter in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Using Prisma guidelines, we identified 23 DTI studies conducted on individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). These studies confirm the widespread nature of brain damage in PAE by reporting diffusivity alterations in commissural, association, and projection fibers; and in relation to increasing cognitive impairment. Reduced integrity in terms of lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) is reported more consistently in the corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, cingulum, and longitudinal fasciculi connecting frontal and temporoparietal regions. Although these interesting results provide insight into FASD neuropathology, it is important to investigate the clinical diversity of this disorder for better treatment options and prediction of progression. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of different patterns of neural structure between PAE and typically developed individuals. We further discuss the association of alterations in diffusivity with demographic features and symptomatology of PAE. With the accumulated knowledge of the neural correlates of FASD presenting symptoms, a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity in FASD will potentially improve the disease management and will highlight the diagnostic challenges and potential areas of future research avenues, where neural markers may be beneficial.","Ghazi Sherbaf, Farzaneh; Aarabi, Mohammad Hadi; Hosein Yazdi, Meisam; Haghshomar, Maryam",Human brain mapping,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30289588/,317

However, owing to the rare nature of these fractures, clinical trials on this subject are lacking. Thus, biomechanical studies form a viable source of information on this subject. With our systematic review of biomechanical studies, we aimed to provide an overview of all the techniques available and guide clinicians in their choice of method of fracture fixation. A literature search was conducted using 3 online databases to find biomechanical studies investigating methods of fixation for calcaneal fractures. A total of 14 studies investigating 237 specimens were identified. Large diversity was found in the tested fixation methods and in the test setups used. None of the studies found a significant difference in favor of any of the fixation methods. All tested methods provided a biomechanically stable fixation. All the investigated methods of fixation for calcaneal fractures seem to be biomechanically sufficient. No clear benefit was found for locking plates in the fixation of calcaneal fractures; however, a subtle mechanical superiority might exist compared with nonlocking plates in the case of fractures in osteoporotic bone. Several of the techniques tested would be suitable for a minimal invasive approach.

It has several significant advantages over the tension-free open repair now in use. In this report we summarize our laparoscopic hernia repair results and recommendations. METHODS The transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) procedures for groin hernias performed between January 2003 and January 2008 at a single center were analyzed retrospectively. Individual surgeon performances were compared to determine whether the rates of complications were related to the level of surgeon experience. RESULTS A total of 312 TAPP procedures were reviewed, and 284 (91%) of the patients were followed retrospectively. There were 266 (85.25%) males and 46 (14.75%) females. The average age was 57.4 years. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.1 days. The mean duration of surgery was 35 min. Six (1.92%) intraoperative and seven (2.24%) postoperative complications were noted. Two recurrences occurred (0.70%). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair has proven to be an efficient method for the treatment of groin hernias at our institution. Most patients can be treated as day-cases, namely they are hospitalized for 1 day, and they demonstrate a low recurrence rate (0.70%). Such low morbidity makes TAPP an attractive method for the routine treatment of groin hernias.","Perko, Zdravko; Rakić, Mislav; Pogorelić, Zenon; Družijanić, Nikica; Kraljević, Jasenka",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-010-4266-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264757/,317

There is an abundance of literature relating to the preventative nature of breastmilk and breastfeeding against many infectious diseases and chronic conditions. However, despite medically complex infants and children being a group that could benefit most from continued breastfeeding, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity are lower among more complex paediatric populations. The reasons for this are not well known, and there is a paucity of data relating to supporting infants who have acute or chronic illness, disability or congenital anomaly to breastfeed. This systematic review aimed to understand the challenges of breast/chestfeeding the medically complex child and to establish the gaps in healthcare provision that act as barriers to optimal infant and young child feeding. The search was limited to studies published in English, focused on breastfed sick infants in hospital, with no date limits as there is no previous systematic review. Of 786 papers retrieved, 11 studies were included for review, and seven themes identified. Themes included practical and psychological challenges of continuing to breastfeed in a hospital setting, complications of the condition making breastfeeding difficult, lack of specialist breastfeeding support from hospital staff and a lack of availability of specialist equipment to support complex breastfeeding. The findings affirm the lack of consistent high-quality care for lactation support in paediatric settings and reinforce the need for further focused research in this area.","Hookway, Lyndsey; Lewis, Jan; Brown, Amy",Maternal & child nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955145/,317

79769,Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff.,2016,"COVID-19 is a very smash and apprehensive health issue in the current world which broke the medical system of whole earth originated in the wholesale sea market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China on December 12, 2019. One key technique as lockdown has been followed by almost every country to protect the transmission of the virus. Comprehensive research is needed to explore the techniques for preventing the virus besides the innovation of vaccines and medicine. This study explores the awareness and quarantine strategy whether the technique is effective or not to monitor the affecting rate of COVID-19. In addition to explore the awareness and quarantine, the effectiveness of knowledge regarding the symptoms of SARS CoV-2 to reducing the affecting rate is also examined. A total of 264 samples were used by a self-administered questionnaire. The findings of the study indicate that cough, fever, diarrhea and weakness are the common symptoms of the disease which knowledge on them significantly influences to control the affecting rate of COVID-19. The study also indicates that awareness and quarantine mediate the significant positive relationship between the symptoms of the disease and its affecting rate. The results of the study could contribute as a guideline for the patient, community, decision-maker of a particular country to monitoring the affecting rate and for a researcher as an opportunity for further study.","Kalam, Abul; Alamgir Hossain, Md",SSRN,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3624017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714124/,317

83363,Preparing for the Maximum Emergency with a Simulation: A Table-Top Test to Evaluate Bed Surge Capacity and Staff Compliance with Training.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS Several reports have demonstrated the safety of pure natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (P-NOTES) using transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and embryonic NOTES (E-NOTES; laparoscopic surgery through the umbilicus). This study was performed to compare the safety and applicability of NOTES rectosigmoidectomy between E-NOTES and P-NOTES in a swine model. PATIENTS AND METHODS E-NOTES was conducted through a single port using laparoscopic instruments (n = 11). P-NOTES was performed using TEM with transgastric endoscopic assistance (n = 11). Gastrotomies were created using a needle knife and the balloon dilatation technique, and closed using T-anchors. Blood samples were collected to evaluate changes in systemic cytokine levels during the preoperative and postoperative periods; operative outcomes were also evaluated and compared between the groups. The necropsy findings were recorded after sacrifice at 1 week after the procedure. RESULTS The mean operative time for P-NOTES was significantly longer than that for E-NOTES (239 vs. 103 minutes, P < 0.001). The mean distance from the anal verge to colorectal anastomosis in the P-NOTES group was significantly less than that in the E-NOTES group (2.9 vs. 17.6 cm, P < 0.001). On necropsy, the complication rate of P-NOTES was higher than that of E-NOTES, but without statistical significance (54.5 % vs. 18.2 %, P = 0.091). The differences in changes in TNF-α, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β between P-NOTES and E-NOTES were not significant. CONCLUSIONS E-NOTES rectosigmoidectomy in the swine model is safe, but remains challenging for use in pelvic dissection. P-NOTES rectosigmoidectomy using TEM may be a promising tool for pelvic dissection, but the transgastric approach involves a high degree of risk.","Sohn, D K; Jeong, S-Y; Park, J W; Kim, J S; Hwang, J H; Kim, D-W; Kang, S-B; Oh, J H",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1256239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21425040/,317
83435,Application of decision rules on diagnosis and prognosis of renal colic: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To compare the mode of failure, load at yield, ultimate load to failure and stiffness of non-barbed polydioxanone, non-barbed polyglyconate and barbed glycolide-trimethylene carbonate (GTC) suture in canine cadaveric fascia. STUDY DESIGN Ex vivo biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION 18 fascia lata specimens from 9 canine cadavers. METHODS 6 fascia lata specimens were sutured with polydioxanone, 6 with polyglyconate, and 6 with barbed GTC suture. Load at yield, stiffness, ultimate load to failure were measured using tensile strength testing. Statistical analysis was used to compare outcomes between suture materials. The mode of failure was recorded and described. RESULTS The load at yield and ultimate load to failure were significantly greater for polydioxanone than barbed GTC (P=.045 and P=.016, respectively). The load at yield and ultimate load to failure was not significantly different between polydioxanone and polyglyconate (P=.687 and P=.586, respectively). The load at yield and the ultimate load to failure was not significantly different between polyglyconate and barbed GTC (P=.194 and P=.109, respectively). Stiffness was not different between constructs (P=.103). Polydioxanone and polyglyconate failed by suture breakage and suture pullout. Barbed GTC failed by suture slippage and suture breakage. CONCLUSION Our results showed that under the conditions of this study, 4-0 monofilament polydioxanone had a greater load at yield and load to failure than similarly sized, barbed copolymer suture in the fascia lata. This finding may help direct suture choice for fascial closure.","Shimizu, Naomi; Tarlton, John; Friend, Ed; Doran, Ivan; Parsons, Kevin",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27906473/,317

This study aims to assess the association between SSB consumption and dental caries and erosion. METHODS Systematic review of observational studies. Search strategy applied to Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, SciELO, LILACS, OpenGrey and HMIC. The risk of bias was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cross-Sectional Studies and evidence certainty using Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Evaluation. Relationships between SSB consumption and caries and erosion were estimated using random-effects model meta- and dose-response analyses. RESULTS A total of 38 cross-sectional studies were included, of which 26 were rated as high quality. Comparing moderate-to-low consumption, there was significantly increased risk of both caries [OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.28-1.92; decayed, missing and filled teeth weighted mean differences (DMFT WMD) = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.38-1.26] and erosion (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.01-2.03). Comparing high-to-moderate consumption, there was further increased risk of caries (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.17-1.99; DMFT WMD = 1.16, 95% CI: -0.59-2.91) and erosion (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.37-6.97). A dose-response gradient and high certainty of evidence was observed for caries. CONCLUSIONS Increasing SSB consumption is associated with increased risk of dental caries and erosion. Studies were cross-sectional, hence temporality could not be established, but the positive dose-response suggests this relationship is likely to be causal. These findings illustrate the potential benefits to oral health of policies that reduce SSB consumption, including sugar taxation.","Valenzuela, Maria Josefina; Waterhouse, Beverley; Aggarwal, Vishal R; Bloor, Karen; Doran, Tim",European journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830237/,317

However, the function on wheat mature embryo culture has not been reported. Here, we used the mature embryo of wheat genotypes including CB037, Fielder, and Chinese Spring (CS) as materials to analyze the effects of different concentrations of trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB) on plant regeneration efficiency. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the induction rates of embryogenic callus and green shoot were significantly increased with the addition of 0.5 µM TSA, while they were reduced under treatment of 2.5 µM TSA on wheat mature embryo. With the respective addition of 200 µM and 1000 µM SB, regeneration frequency of three genotypes was enhanced, especially in Fielder, which reached significant difference compared with the control group. Unfortunately, 0.5 µM TSA and 200 µM SB combination had no apparent effect on wheat regeneration frequency. The results indicated that TSA and SB increase plant regeneration in common wheat. In addition, TSA had a common effect and SB had different effect among genotypes on wheat regeneration frequency. The mechanism of action needs further investigation.","Bie, Xiao Min; Dong, Luhao; Li, Xiao Hui; Wang, He; Gao, Xi-Qi; Li, Xing Guo",Plant signaling & behavior,https://doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2020.1820681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962515/,317

METHODS We analyzed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images of 35 retinitis pigmentosa patients and 40 healthy individuals. We measured macular and ganglion cell complex thicknesses. We took choroidal thickness measurements in the subfoveal region and 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mm from the foveal center. RESULTS Patients with retinitis pigmentosa had significantly thinner macular thicknesses and choroidal thicknesses in all measurements, and their individual ganglion cell complex thickness measurements were lower than those in healthy individuals. The mean ganglion cell complex thickness was significantly lower in patients with retinitis pigmentosa than that in controls. The mean macular thickness was significantly correlated with the mean choroidal and mean ganglion cell complex thicknesses. (We found no correlation between the mean choroidal thickness and the mean ganglion cell complex thickness). CONCLUSIONS The choroid was mildly affected in our patients with early retinitis pigmentosa.

100044,#ENT: Otolaryngology Residency Programs Create Social Media Platforms to Connect With Applicants During COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-23,"The giant, single-celled organism Stentor coeruleus has a long history as a model system for studying pattern formation and regeneration in single cells. Stentor [1, 2] is a heterotrichous ciliate distantly related to familiar ciliate models, such as Tetrahymena or Paramecium. The primary distinguishing feature of Stentor is its incredible size: a single cell is 1 mm long. Early developmental biologists, including T.H. Morgan [3], were attracted to the system because of its regenerative abilities-if large portions of a cell are surgically removed, the remnant reorganizes into a normal-looking but smaller cell with correct proportionality [2, 3]. These biologists were also drawn to Stentor because it exhibits a rich repertoire of behaviors, including light avoidance, mechanosensitive contraction, food selection, and even the ability to habituate to touch, a simple form of learning usually seen in higher organisms [4]. While early microsurgical approaches demonstrated a startling array of regenerative and morphogenetic processes in this single-celled organism, Stentor was never developed as a molecular model system. We report the sequencing of the Stentor coeruleus macronuclear genome and reveal key features of the genome. First, we find that Stentor uses the standard genetic code, suggesting that ciliate-specific genetic codes arose after Stentor branched from other ciliates. We also discover that ploidy correlates with Stentor's cell size. Finally, in the Stentor genome, we discover the smallest spliceosomal introns reported for any species. The sequenced genome opens the door to molecular analysis of single-cell regeneration in Stentor.","Slabodnick, Mark M; Ruby, J Graham; Reiff, Sarah B; Swart, Estienne C; Gosai, Sager; Prabakaran, Sudhakaran; Witkowska, Ewa; Larue, Graham E; Fisher, Susan; Freeman, Robert M; Gunawardena, Jeremy; Chu, William; Stover, Naomi A; Gregory, Brian D; Nowacki, Mariusz; Derisi, Joseph; Roy, Scott W; Marshall, Wallace F; Sood, Pranidhi",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28190732/,317

MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective case-matched control study in 132 patients. Group A (a 40 French orogastric tube was used to calibrate the gastric pouch) was compared to group B (no orogastric tube was used). All other surgical steps were identical in both groups. Postoperative %EWL and %TWL were recorded at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were similar for both groups; a mean age of 43.6 years, 84% of the patients were female and mean initial BMI was 44 kg/m2. At 24 months, 9% of the patients were lost to follow-up. At 1-year follow-up, %EWL and %TWL were 80% and 33.3% in group A versus 70% and 28.6% in group B with p = 0.013 and p = 0.007 respectively. At 2 years, EWL% and %TWL were 79.5% and 32.8% in group A and 67.18% and 28.1% in group B with a p value of 0.019 and 0.001 respectively. The use of a calibration tube, initial BMI, and age predicted the %TWL best with R squared at 30.7%. CONCLUSION The use of a calibration tube for creating the gastric pouch may lead to a higher %EWL and %TWL at 2-year follow-up.

Thus, screening the severe/critical cases before symptom occurs effectively saves medical resources. METHODS AND MATERIALS In this study, all 336 cases of patients infected COVID-19 in Shanghai to March 12th, were retrospectively enrolled, and divided in to training and test datasets. In addition, 220 clinical and laboratory observations/records were also collected. Clinical indicators were associated with severe/critical symptoms were identified and a model for severe/critical symptom prediction was developed. RESULTS Totally, 36 clinical indicators significantly associated with severe/critical symptom were identified. The clinical indicators are mainly thyroxine, immune related cells and products. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and optimized combination of age, GSH, CD3 ratio and total protein has a good performance in discriminating the mild and severe/critical cases. The area under receiving operating curve (AUROC) reached 0.9996 and 0.9757 in the training and testing dataset, respectively. When the using cut-off value as 0.0667, the recall rate was 93.33 % and 100 % in the training and testing datasets, separately. Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators.

However, it remains unclear how the quality of corridors influences the dispersal process, and how it interacts with corridor length and width. Here we investigate these factors using a small-scale laboratory system where we track the dispersal of the model organism Collembola Folsomia candida. Using this system, we study the effects of corridor length, width, and quality on the probability of dispersal, net movement, body size of dispersers, and the rate of change in population size after colonization. We show that corridor quality positively affected dispersal probability, net movement, and the rate of change in population size in colonised patches. Moreover, corridor quality significantly affected the size of dispersers, with only larger individuals dispersing through poor quality corridors. The length and width of corridors affected both the rate at which populations increased in colonised patches and the net number of individuals which dispersed, suggesting that these physical properties may be important in maintaining the flow of individuals in space. Our results thus suggest that corridor quality can have an important role in determining not only the probability of dispersal occurs but also the phenotypes of the individuals which disperse, with concomitant effects on the net movement of individuals and the rate of change in population size in the colonised patches.","Li, Dongbo; Clements, Christopher F; Shan, Isobel L G; Memmott, Jane",Oecologia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04834-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423105/,317

Here, based on month-level records of suicides covering the entire Japanese population in 1,848 administrative units, we assessed whether suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. Using difference-in-difference estimation, we found that monthly suicide rates declined by 14% during the first 5 months of the pandemic (February to June 2020). This could be due to a number of complex reasons, including the government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure. By contrast, monthly suicide rates increased by 16% during the second wave (July to October 2020), with a larger increase among females (37%) and children and adolescents (49%). Although adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain in the long term, its modifiers (such as government subsidies) may not be sustained. Thus, effective suicide prevention-particularly among vulnerable populations-should be an important public health consideration.","Tanaka, Takanao; Okamoto, Shohei",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-01042-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452498/,317
103646,Metabolic consequences of obesity and type 2 diabetes: balancing genes and environment for personalized care.,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND Mechanical catheter dysfunction caused by omentum entrapment remains a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of omentum folding at the time of primary open catheter insertion. METHODS From March 2008 to December 2012, a total of 67 PD subjects were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either regular open insertion (ROI group, n = 33) or open insertion with omentum folding (OIOF group, n = 34). The primary outcome was defined as PD catheter tip migration with dysfunction. A systematic review was performed to analyze the outcomes of omentum management in PD catheter implantation, based on published data from 1990 to 2013. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in baseline patient characteristics between the ROI and OIOF groups. Nine (27.3%) patients in the ROI group presented with catheter malposition in the late stage (>60 days) of the study, significantly more than in the OIOF group (two; 5.9%) (P = 0.049). Significant differences in catheter survival rate between the two groups were observed in the late stage (P = 0.030) and over the entire study period (P = 0.028). A higher incidence of irreversible catheter dysfunction was shown in the ROI group (15.2%), whereas none occurred in the OIOF group (P = 0.031). No statistical difference was determined in other catheter-related complications or patient survival rate. There were no statistical differences in peritoneal transport characteristics or dialysis adequacy between the two groups upon evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months. Systemic review of current publications suggested that PD catheter placement with omentum management could lead to less irreversible catheter dysfunction and improved outcome of catheter survival. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that omentum folding at the initial time of open catheter placement can significantly reduce the risk of catheter tip migration with dysfunction and improve the outcome of the PD technique.","Chen, Guochun; Wang, Puzhang; Liu, Hong; Zhou, Linshan; Cheng, Meichu; Liu, Yinghong; Zhang, Hongqing; Li, Jun; Sun, Lin; Peng, Youming; Liu, Fuyou","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gft357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24084323/,317

Yet, the explosion of nonstandardized reporting of high-performing algorithms are rendered useless without robust and streamlined implementation guidelines. The development of protocols and checklists will accelerate the translation of research publications to impact on patient care. RECENT FINDINGS Beyond technological scepticism, we lack uniformity in analysing algorithmic performance generalizability, and benchmarking impacts across clinical settings. No regulatory guardrails have been set to minimize bias or optimize interpretability; no consensus clinical acceptability thresholds or systematized postdeployment monitoring has been set. Moreover, stakeholders with misaligned incentives deepen the landscape complexity especially when it comes to the requisite data integration and harmonization to advance the field. Therefore, despite increasing algorithmic accuracy and commoditization, the infamous 'implementation gap' persists. Open clinical data repositories have been shown to rapidly accelerate research, minimize redundancies and disseminate the expertise and knowledge required to overcome existing barriers. Drawing upon the longstanding success of existing governance frameworks and robust data use and sharing agreements, the ophthalmic community has tremendous opportunity in ushering artificial intelligence into medicine. By collaboratively building a powerful resource of open, anonymized multimodal ophthalmic data, the next generation of clinicians can advance data-driven eye care in unprecedented ways. SUMMARY This piece demonstrates that with readily accessible data, immense progress can be achieved clinically and methodologically to realize artificial intelligence's impact on clinical care. Exponentially progressive network effects can be seen by consolidating, curating and distributing data amongst both clinicians and data scientists.","Kras, Ashley; Celi, Leo A; Miller, John B",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740059/,317
108251,Reply to Chand et al. regarding letter to the Editor regarding the article: 'Increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes during lockdown for the COVID19 pandemic in India: A cohort analysis (Ghoshal et al.)'.,2020,"OBJECTIVE Digital Technology has become a pervasive, even ubiquitous part of our daily lives, affecting almost every aspect of our lives. Although the uptake of digital technology in health care has lagged behind other sectors, today, digital health is already becoming a cornerstone of developed health systems all over the world. Hence, the question is not whether we should adopt digital technology in health care, but how to do it most effectively. Digitally enabled remote care, or telemedicine has been available for many years but large-scale adoption has been slow. COVID-19 has caused a quantum leap in this area and particularly in the area of chronic disease and cancer care. The objective of this article is to briefly review the literature on the use of digitally enabled remote health care, in general and in cancer care specifically, with a focus on nursing practice, and to define the questions that need to be asked to guide effective implementation. DATA SOURCES Review of the literature and the experience of the authors. CONCLUSION There is increasing uptake of digitally enabled remote care. A growing body of evidence suggests that care delivered via telemedicine can be both safe and effective, in some cases with better outcomes than conventional face-to-face care. However, tele-oncology has not yet become standard practice. Digital health solutions need to be integrated into the patient pathway and in health care team practices for optimal supportive care in oncology in line with appropriate guidelines. Training education and formative evaluation are required to guide effective implementation. Formulating the right questions to ask is a critical starting point. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE There is very little debate today about the centrality of the role of the oncology nurse in coordinating care, guiding the patient, and providing ongoing support. Mobile technology provides an opportunity for monitoring and support through a minimally burdensome, maximally accessible approach. Moreover, smartphones and applications allow for repeated evaluation of adherence and symptoms in real time, ideally enhancing care for patients. However, even with the growing acceptance of ""nursing telepractice"", there are challenges and barriers to overcome to mainstream digital health into oncology nursing practice. Telemedicine services go much further than simply digitizing traditionally analogue health care processes and services, they fundamentally reorganize processes, procedures, and services. Thus, in addition to training and education, nursing tele-oncology demands a service transformation.","Kaye, Rachelle; Rosen-Zvi, Miriam; Ron, Reut",Seminars in oncology nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soncn.2020.151091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223410/,317

112999,"Type 1 diabetes glycemic management: Insulin therapy, glucose monitoring, and automation.",2021-07-30,"There is emerging evidence to suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Conversely, vitamin D supplementation protects against an initial alveolar diffuse damage of COVID-19 becoming progressively worse. The mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency exacerbates COVID-19 pneumonia remain poorly understood. In this review we describe the rationale of the putative role of endothelial dysfunction in this event. Herein, we will briefly review (1) anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects of vitamin D, (2) vitamin D receptor and vitamin D receptor ligand, (3) protective role of vitamin D against endothelial dysfunction, (4) risk of vitamin D deficiency, (5) vitamin D deficiency in association with endothelial dysfunction, (6) the characteristics of vitamin D relevant to COVID-19, (7) the role of vitamin D on innate and adaptive response, (8) biomarkers of endothelial cell activation contributing to cytokine storm, and (9) the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and homeostasis. Finally, we hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction relevant to vitamin D deficiency results from decreased binding of the vitamin D receptor with its ligand on the vascular endothelium and that it may be immune-mediated via increased interferon 1 α. A possible sequence of events may be described as (1) angiotensin II converting enzyme-related initial endothelial injury followed by vitamin D receptor-related endothelial dysfunction, (2) endothelial lesions deteriorating to endothelialitis, coagulopathy and thrombosis, and (3) vascular damage exacerbating pulmonary pathology and making patients with vitamin D deficiency vulnerable to death.","Zhang, Jun; McCullough, Peter A; Tecson, Kristen M",Reviews in cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm.2020.03.131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070539/,317
114717,Estimating the global cost of vision impairment and its major causes: protocol for a systematic review.,2020-09-06,"OBJECTIVE Diabetes is one of the most distinct comorbidities of COVID-19. Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 has been confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms), and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used in order to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin. ACEI/ARB use showed no significant impact on patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.","Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Dong; Cheng, Biao; Chen, Jian; Peng, Anlin; Yang, Chen; Liu, Chong; Xiong, Mingrui; Deng, Aiping; Zhang, Yu; Zheng, Ling; Huang, Kun",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409498/,317

Left lung allotransplantation was performed from Brown-Norway to Fischer-F344 rats. Gene transfer into skeletal muscle was enhanced by electroporation. Three groups were studied: group I animals (n = 5) received 2.5 μg pCIK-hIL-10 (hIL-10/CMV [cytomegalovirus] early promoter enhancer) on day -1 and 80 μg pCIK-HGF (HGF/CMV early promoter enhancer) on day 5. Group II animals (n = 4) received 2.5 μg pCIK-hIL-10 and pUbC-hIL-10 (hIL-10/pUbC promoter) on day -1. Control group III animals (n = 4) were treated by sham electroporation on days -1 and 5. All animals received daily nontherapeutic intraperitoneal dose of cyclosporin A (2.5 mg/kg) and were sacrificed on day 15. Graft oxygenation and allograft rejection were evaluated. Significant differences were found between study groups in graft oxygenation (Pao(2)) (P = .0028; group I vs. groups II and III, P < .01 each). Pao(2) was low in group II (31 ± 1 mm Hg) and in group III controls (34 ± 10 mm Hg), without statistically significant difference between these 2 groups (P = .54). In contrast, in group I, Pao(2) of recipients sequentially transduced with IL-10 and HGF plasmids was much improved, with 112 ± 39 mm Hg (vs. groups II and III; P < .01 each), paralleled by reduced vascular and bronchial rejection (group I vs. groups II and III, P < .021 each). Sequential overexpression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, followed by sequential and overlapping HGF overexpression on day 5, preserves lung function and reduces acute lung allograft rejection up to day 15 post transplant as compared to prolonged IL-10 overexpression alone.","Fakin, Richard; Hamacher, Jürg; Gugger, Mathias; Gazdhar, Amiq; Moser, Helen; Schmid, Ralph Alexander",Experimental lung research,https://doi.org/10.3109/01902148.2011.601785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21895445/,317

Whether the effects of hemoglobin levels on thrombotic and bleeding risk are independent of platelet reactivity on clopidogrel, however, remains unknown. Patients from the Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents study were categorized by the presence of anemia at baseline, defined according the World Health Organization criteria. Platelet reactivity was measured with VerifyNow assay; high platelet reactivity (HPR) on clopidogrel was defined as platelet reactive units value >208. Of 8,413 patients included in the study cohort, 1,816 (21.6%) had anemia. HPR was more prevalent in patients with anemia (58.3% vs 38.4%; p <0.001), an association that persisted after multivariate adjustment (adjusted odds ratio: 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82 to 2.29; p <0.0001). Patients with anemia had higher 2-year rates of major adverse cardiac events (9.5% vs 5.6%; p <0.0001), major bleeding (11.8% vs 7.7%; p <0.0001), and all-cause mortality (4.0% vs 1.4%; p <0.0001); however, after adjustment for baseline clinical confounders, including HPR, anemia was no longer significantly associated with major adverse cardiac events but was still independently associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.12; p <0.0001) and major bleeding (adjusted HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.68; p <0.0001). The effect of HPR on clinical outcomes was uniform according to anemia status, without evidence of interaction. In conclusion, anemia independently correlated with HPR. After percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents, anemia at baseline was significantly associated with higher 2-year hemorrhagic and mortality risk; conversely, its association with ischemic risk was attenuated after multivariate adjustment, including HPR.","Giustino, Gennaro; Kirtane, Ajay J; Baber, Usman; Généreux, Philippe; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Weisz, Giora; Maehara, Akiko; Rinaldi, Michael J; Metzger, Christopher; Henry, Timothy D; Cox, David A; Duffy, Peter L; Mazzaferri, Ernest L; Brodie, Bruce R; Stuckey, Thomas D; Gurbel, Paul A; Dangas, George D; Francese, Dominic P; Ozan, Ozgu; Mehran, Roxana; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.03.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131611/,317
124001,Study protocol for the systematic review and meta-analyses of the association between schizophrenia and bone fragility.,2020-12-12,"Despite considerable progress over the years, tuberculosis (TB) still remains the top cause of death among the infectious diseases and has devastating socio-economic consequences for people in low- and middle-income countries. To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","Kumar, Ajay Mv; Harries, Anthony D; Satyanarayana, Srinath; Thekkur, Pruthu; Shewade, Hemant D; Zachariah, Rony",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.11.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33308668/,317
129108,"Rift Valley fever virus epidemic in Kenya, 2006/2007: the entomologic investigations.",2010,"BACKGROUND Reverse triggering is a delayed asynchronous contraction of the diaphragm triggered by passive insufflation by the ventilator in sedated mechanically ventilated patients. The incidence of reverse triggering is unknown. This study aimed at determining the incidence of reverse triggering in critically ill patients under controlled ventilation. METHODS In this ancillary study, patients were continuously monitored with a catheter measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm. A method for automatic detection of reverse triggering using electrical activity of the diaphragm was developed in a derivation sample and validated in a subsequent sample. The authors assessed the predictive value of the software. In 39 recently intubated patients under assist-control ventilation, a 1-h recording obtained 24 h after intubation was used to determine the primary outcome of the study. The authors also compared patients' demographics, sedation depth, ventilation settings, and time to transition to assisted ventilation or extubation according to the median rate of reverse triggering. RESULTS The positive and negative predictive value of the software for detecting reverse triggering were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98). Using a threshold of 1 μV of electrical activity to define diaphragm activation, median reverse triggering rate was 8% (range, 0.1 to 75), with 44% (17 of 39) of patients having greater than or equal to 10% of breaths with reverse triggering. Using a threshold of 3 μV, 26% (10 of 39) of patients had greater than or equal to 10% reverse triggering. Patients with more reverse triggering were more likely to progress to an assisted mode or extubation within the following 24 h (12 of 39 [68%]) vs. 7 of 20 [35%]; P = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS Reverse triggering detection based on electrical activity of the diaphragm suggests that this asynchrony is highly prevalent at 24 h after intubation under assist-control ventilation. Reverse triggering seems to occur during the transition phase between deep sedation and the onset of patient triggering.

Whereas the photobioanode can collect electrons from sugar oxidation at rather low potential, the photobiocathode shows reduction currents at rather high potential. The electrodes can be arranged sandwich-like due to the semi-transparent nature of BiFeO 3 , which also guarantees a simultaneous excitation of the photobioanode when illuminated via the cathode side.

Discriminating the radiological appearances secondary to anastomotic configuration from those caused by actual anastomotic dehiscence is a common problem and may be made worse with the advent of laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study is to identify potential novel appearances of the water-soluble contrast enema (WSCE) images of rectal anastomosis following laparoscopic low anterior resection to radiologists and surgeons. METHODS We enrolled 45 patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection with proximal de-functioning loop ileostomy within a specialized colorectal unit. The water-soluble contrast enema reports were reviewed. Two blinded colorectal radiologists independently reviewed the images of patients suspected of anastomotic leak. All of these patients also underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy to confirm or exclude anastomotic leak before reversal of loop ileostomy. Inter-observer concordance was calculated. RESULTS Seven out of eighteen patients (38.9%) were found to have true anastomotic leaks on flexible sigmoidoscopy (15% overall leak rate). In the remaining eleven patients the image appearances were attributed to the appearance of the anastomotic 'dog-ear effect', created by the anastomotic configuration due to multiple firing of the intra-corporeal laparoscopic stapling device. Radiologist inter-observer concordance was 83%. Sensitivity was 100%, specificity 71%, positive-predictive value (38.9%) and negative-predictive value (100%). CONCLUSIONS The novel appearances of laparoscopic-stapled rectal anastomoses in WSCE can be mistaken for anastomotic leak. To avoid delay in reversal of ileostomy, a flexible sigmoidoscopy can be used to confirm or exclude a leak.","Katory, Mark; McLean, Ross; Osman, Khalid; Ahmad, Mukhtar; Hughes, Tracey; Newby, Mike; Dennison, Christopher; O'Loughlin, Paul",Abdominal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00261-016-0885-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595575/,317

Cellular functional investigations confirmed that the up-regulation of AMOTL2 dramatically decreased the proliferation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-β1 in ASM cells. In contrast, the depletion of AMOTL2 exacerbated TGF-β1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Further research revealed that the overexpression of AMOTL2 restrained the activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in TGF-β1-stimulated ASM cells. Moreover, the reactivation of YAP1 markedly reversed AMOTL2-mediated suppression of TGF-β1-induced ASM cell proliferation and ECM deposition. Together, these findings suggest that AMOTL2 restrains TGF-β1-induced proliferation and ECM deposition of ASM cells by down-regulating YAP1 activation.","Fang, Ping; Deng, Wen-Jing; Fan, Na; Shi, Jie; Shi, Hong-Yang; Ou, Ling; Pan, Jian-Li; Yang, Shuan-Ying",Environmental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1002/tox.23336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323359/,317
135019,Multicenter Study of Albuterol Use Among Infants Hospitalized with Bronchiolitis.,2018,"The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work's main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application.","Ferreira, Célio Márcio Soares; Garrocho, Charles Tim Batista; Oliveira, Ricardo Augusto Rabelo; Silva, Jorge Sá; Cavalcanti, Carlos Frederico Marcelo da Cunha",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668415/,317
135995,The formation and design of the TRIAGE study--baseline data on 6005 consecutive patients admitted to hospital from the emergency department.,2015,"PURPOSE To investigate the current state and quality of compassion education interventions offered to health care providers during training or practice, determine how the components of each education intervention map onto the domains of an empirically based clinical model of compassion, and identify the most common approaches to compassion education. METHOD The MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science, ERIC, and Education Research Complete databases were searched from inception to March 2020 in this systematic review. Studies that evaluated a compassion education intervention for health care providers or those in training to enhance compassion toward patients and/or families were included. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was performed. The components of each intervention were mapped onto the domains of compassion described in the Patient Compassion Model. RESULTS One hundred eight peer-reviewed publications describing 103 interventions were included. Modalities ranged from establishing curricula and interventions in clinical settings to programs that used humanities-based reflective practices, clinical simulation, role modeling, and contemplative practices, with many education interventions adopting a multimodal approach. Most interventions mapped to the virtuous response domain of the Patient Compassion Model; very few mapped to the other domains of this model. CONCLUSIONS Most interventions were limited as they focused on a single domain of compassion; did not adequately define compassion; were assessed exclusively by self-report; were devoid of a comparator/control group; and did not evaluate retention, sustainability, and translation to clinical practice over time. The authors suggest that compassion education interventions be grounded in an empirically based definition of compassion; use a competency-based approach; employ multimodal teaching methods that address the requisite attitudes, skills, behaviors, and knowledge within the multiple domains of compassion; evaluate learning over time; and incorporate patient, preceptor, and peer evaluations.","Sinclair, Shane; Kondejewski, Jane; Jaggi, Priya; Dennett, Liz; L Roze des Ordons, Amanda; Hack, Thomas F",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830949/,317
136684,Microbe-associated metabolites as targets for incident type 2 diabetes.,2020-10-02,"More than 20 years ago, Pories et al. published a seminal article, ""Who Would Have Thought It? An Operation Proves to Be the Most Effective Therapy for Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus."" This was based on their observation that bariatric surgery rapidly normalized blood glucose levels in obese people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 10 years later, almost 90% remained diabetes free. Pories et al. suggested that caloric restriction played a key role and that the relative contributions of proximal intestinal nutrient exclusion, rapid distal gut nutrient delivery, and the role of gut hormones required further investigation. These findings of T2DM improvement/remission after bariatric surgery have been widely replicated, together with the observation that bariatric surgery prevents or delays incident T2DM. Over the ensuing two decades, important glucoregulatory roles of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been firmly established. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial glycemic effects of bariatric surgery remain incompletely understood. In addition to the mechanisms proposed by Pories et al., changes in bile acid metabolism, GI tract nutrient sensing and glucose utilization, incretins, possible anti-incretin(s), and the intestinal microbiome are implicated. These changes, acting through peripheral and/or central pathways, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, increased tissue glucose uptake, improved insulin sensitivity, and enhanced β-cell function. A constellation of factors, rather than a single overarching mechanism, likely mediate postoperative glycemic improvement, with the contributing factors varying according to the surgical procedure. Thus, different bariatric/metabolic procedures provide us with experimental tools to probe GI tract physiology. Embracing this approach through the application of detailed phenotyping, genomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiome studies will enhance our understanding of metabolic regulation and help identify novel therapeutic targets.","Batterham, Rachel L; Cummings, David E",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-0145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27222547/,317

Among STATs, STAT2 is classically known to dimerize with STAT1 and together with IRF9 forms the ISGF3 transcription factor complex that has long been considered a hallmark of activation by type I and type III interferons. However, accumulating evidence reveal distinct facets of STAT2 and IRF9 activity mediated by the segregation in alternative STAT1-independent complexes/pathways that are thought to trigger different transcriptional programs.

Results The majority of participants did not wear hearing aids despite reporting that they had at least a little trouble hearing. Most participants reported that their hearing health was important and indicated that they were likely to visit their audiologist for an in-person or virtual visit during the pandemic.

METHODS The authors used electronic medical record data along with chi-squared or t tests to compare patients' demographic characteristics. Generalized estimating equations for estimating the odds of primary and secondary outcomes were used, controlling for demographic characteristics. RESULTS During COVID-19, the odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit (N=26,715) were 6.68 times the odds of completing an in-person visit (N=11,094). The odds of completing a telepsychiatry visit during COVID-19 were 3.00 times the odds of completing an in-person visit during the pre-COVID-19 reference period (N=40,318). CONCLUSIONS In this cross-sectional study, outpatient adult mental health clinic telepsychiatry appointments, largely by telephone, were strongly associated with a higher rate of visit completion compared with in-person visits during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulators should consider permanently enabling reimbursement for telephone-only telepsychiatry visits.","Avalone, Lynsey; Barron, Charles; King, Carla; Linn-Walton, Rebecca; Lau, Jen; McQuistion, Hunter L; Popiel, Maryann; Balasubramaniam, Meera; Freeman, Richard; Fattal, Omar",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730881/,317

145377,Error in Byline.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Although recent studies suggest that measuring coronary artery calcification (CAC) may be superior to indirect atherosclerotic markers in predicting cardiac risk, there are limited data evaluating imaging-based biomarkers that directly quantify atherosclerosis in different vascular beds performed in a single cohort. OBJECTIVES The BioImage Study (A Clinical Study of Burden of Atherosclerotic Disease in an At-Risk Population) sought to identify imaging biomarkers that predict near-term (3-year) atherothrombotic events. METHODS The BioImage Study enrolled 5,808 asymptomatic U.S. adults (mean age: 69 years, 56.5% female) in a prospective cohort evaluating the role of vascular imaging on cardiovascular risk prediction. All patients were evaluated by CAC and novel 3-dimensional carotid ultrasound. Plaque areas from both carotid arteries were summed as the carotid plaque burden (cPB). The primary endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke). A broader secondary MACE endpoint also included all-cause death, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization. RESULTS Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, MACE occurred in 216 patients (4.2%), of which 82 (1.5%) were primary events. After adjustment for risk factors, and compared with individuals without any cPB, hazard ratios for MACE were 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 1.91), 1.45 (95% CI: 0.67 to 3.14), and 2.36 (95% CI: 1.13 to 4.92) with increasing cPB tertile, with similar results for CAC. Net reclassification significantly improved with either cPB (0.23) or CAC (0.25). MACE rates increased simultaneously with higher levels of both cPB and CAC. CONCLUSIONS Detection of subclinical carotid or coronary atherosclerosis improves risk predictions and reclassification compared with conventional risk factors, with comparable results for either modality. Cost-effective analyses are warranted to define the optimal roles of these complementary techniques.

145504,Validation of the N-PASS.,2008,"PURPOSE To investigate the efficacy of percutaneous thermal ablation combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) versus TACE monotherapy in treating primary liver cancer with hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT), and to identify potential factors of overall survival after combination therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with primary liver cancer and HVTT from 2011 to 2016 at our institute were retrospectively identified. They were divided into two groups (group A and group B). Patients in group A underwent TACE with subsequent percutaneous thermal ablation, while patients in group B who were unsuitable for ablation received TACE monotherapy. Characteristics and survival data of the two groups were analyzed and compared. Relevant factors for overall survival (OS) of group A were explored by univariate analysis. RESULTS Twenty-six patients were included and analyzed. The median OS for group A (n = 13) was 18 months, while the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates were 58.6%, 46.9% and 46.9%, respectively. The median OS for group B (n = 13) was 6.5 months and the 1-year survival rate was 10.9%. The survival of group A was significantly better than group B (P = 0.02). The following factors were related with overall survival of group A: ablation technique, complete response of tumor and HVTT, Child-pugh grade, pre-operative extrahepatic metastases and lymph node metastases. In group A, patients who achieved complete response had the longest average survival time (42.1 months). CONCLUSION For patients with primary liver cancer and HVTT, percutaneous thermal ablation and TACE present better efficacy than TACE monotherapy. Long-term survival could be achieved in selected patients.","Wang, Yang; Ma, Liang; Yuan, Zhuhui; Zheng, Jiasheng; Li, Wei",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30063737/,317

145750,Safety and efficacy of drug-induced sleep endoscopy using a probability ramp propofol infusion system in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea.,2014,"Targeting different members of the Akt pathways is a promising therapeutic chance in solid tumors including breast cancer. The variable expression levels of Akt isoforms with opposite effects on tumor growth and metastasis, however, make it difficult to select the inhibitors to be used for specific breast tumor subtypes. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrated here that Vav1, ectopically expressed in invasive breast tumors derived cells, downmodulates Akt acting at expression and/or activation levels depending on tumor subtype. The decreased p-Akt1 (Ser473) levels are a common effect of Vav1 upmodulation, suggesting that, in breast tumor-derived cells and independently of their phenotype, Vav1 interferes with signaling pathways ended to specifically recruit Akt1. Only in ER-negative cell lines, the silencing of Vav1 induced the expression but not the activation of Akt2. A retrospective analysis of early invasive breast tumors allowed to establish the prognostic significance of the p-Akt/Vav1 relationship. In particular, low Vav1 levels negatively influence the follow-up of patients with low p-Akt in their primary tumors and subjected to adjuvant chemotherapy. As the use of specific or pan Akt inhibitors may not be sufficient or may even be detrimental, increasing the levels of Vav1 could be a new approach to improve breast cancer outcomes. This might be particularly relevant for tumors with a triple-negative phenotype, for which target-based therapies are not currently available.","Grassilli, Silvia; Brugnoli, Federica; Lattanzio, Rossano; Marchisio, Marco; Perracchio, Letizia; Piantelli, Mauro; Bavelloni, Alberto; Capitani, Silvano; Bertagnolo, Valeria",Molecular oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/1878-0261.12203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658179/,317

Protocol for systematic review.,2020-03-24,"PURPOSE Although clinical data suggest the similar performance of collagen-based biological prosthetic materials to some polymer materials, the use of a biomesh for abdominal hernia repair in a setting of infection is controversial. This in vitro study compares the adhesion of two Staphylococcus strains to polymer and biological meshes. METHODS Sterile fragments of Optilene(®) (Op), Surgipro™ (Surg), Preclude(®) (Precl), TIGR(®) (TIGR), Bio-A(®) (BioA), Permacol™ (Perm), Surgisis(®) (SIS), and Tutomesh(®) (Tuto) were inoculated with 10(6) CFU of S. aureus (Sa) or S. epidermidis (Se) (n = 18 per strain per mesh). The first five meshes are polymer materials while Perm, SIS and Tuto are biomeshes. After 24/48 h of incubation, bacterial adhesion was examined by sonication, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. RESULTS Sa and Se showed a high affinity for the absorbable meshes (TIGR, BioA, Perm, SIS, Tuto) (p < 0.001). Precl yielded the lowest bacterial loads (p < 0.001). Surg, Precl and BioA underwent no substantial change over time, while Op (p < 0.001) and TIGR (p < 0.05) showed decreasing bacterial loads during incubation. The Sa-contaminated biomeshes behaved similarly while biomeshes inoculated with Se returned higher bacterial yields at 48 h, especially SIS (p < 0.001). SEM and light microscopy observations revealed planktonic bacteria and biofilms on the polymer surface and bacterial niches in biomesh pores. CONCLUSIONS Within 48 h of contamination, the absorbable polymer and biological meshes exhibited high bacterial loads. Given their lower affinity for both bacterial strains, the conventional non-absorbable polymer materials could be better candidates for use in contaminated surgical fields.","Pérez-Köhler, B; Sotomayor, S; Rodríguez, M; Gegúndez, M I; Pascual, G; Bellón, J M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1378-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862028/,317

Respiratory complications, particularly lipoid pneumonia, have been reported as early as 2012. An outbreak of pulmonary injury in 2019 has been reported in patients using vaping products. Research Question To describe a rural Appalachian tertiary center's experience of EVALI and to identify novel mechanisms of pulmonary injury patterns. Study Design and Methods We present a consecutive case series of 17 patients admitted to our rural, academic, tertiary care institution with EVALI from August 2019 to March 2020. Demographics, baseline characteristics, co-morbidities, vaping behavior, and hospital course were recorded. Broncho-alveolar lavage specimens were assessed for lipid-laden macrophages and hemosiderin-laden macrophages with stains for Oil-Red-O (n=15) and Prussian Blue (n=14) respectively. Patient volunteered e-liquid materials (n=6), and vapors were analyzed using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) to describe the chemical profile. Post-discharge interviews were conducted. Results The most common CT finding was bilateral ground glass opacities with predilection for lower lung zones. The most frequent pulmonary injury pattern was lipoid pneumonia. The majority of EVALI patients were critically ill requiring ventilation or ECMO. The most severely ill patients were noted to be positive for iron stains in macrophages and showed higher volatile organic compound (VOC) levels in chemical analysis. Interpretation Based on our experience, EVALI in rural Appalachia presents with relatively severe respiratory failure. Worse outcomes appear to be correlated to high levels of VOCs, iron deposition in lungs, and concomitant infection.","Sangani, Rahul; Rojas, Edward; Forte, Michael; Zulfikar, Rafia; Prince, Nicole; Tasoglou, Antonios; Goldsmith, Travis; Casuccio, Gary; Boyd, Jonathan; Olfert, I Mark; Flanagan, Melina; Sharma, Sunil",Hospital practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2020.1843282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136442/,317

Patients in non-severe group had fewer white blood cells (WBC) (WMD = -0.85 [109/L], 95% CI = [-1.54, -0.16], P = 0.02) and neutrophils (WMD = -1.57 [109/L], 95% CI = [-2.60, -0.54], P = 0.003), more lymphocytes (WMD = 0.29 [109/L], 95% CI = [0.22, 0.36], P < 0.001) and platelets (WMD = 19.05 [109/L], 95% CI = [3.04, 35.06], P = 0.02), and lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) level (WMD = -2.48, 95% CI = [-3.81, -1.15], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group. There was no statistical difference in monocytes (WMD = 0.01 [109/L], 95% CI = [-0.01, 0.03], P = 0.029) between these two groups. Sensitivity analysis and meta-analysis based on standard mean difference (SMD) did not change the conclusions about neutrophils, lymphocytes and NLR while the results were inconsistent in WBC and platelets. CONCLUSIONS Severe patients had more neutrophils, higher NLR level, and fewer lymphocytes than non-severe patients with COVID-19. Measurement of these markers might assist clinicians to monitor and predict the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","Zeng, Furong; Li, Linfeng; Zeng, Jiling; Deng, Yuhao; Huang, Huining; Chen, Bin; Deng, Guangtong",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356642/,317

Previous studies have demonstrated >70% sensitivity and high specificity compared with reverse transcriptase real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in symptomatic individuals, but test performance for asymptomatic individuals is unknown. METHODS Test performance of the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) was compared with RT-PCR in a longitudinal cohort study of asymptomatic football players and staff members of professional football clubs. Based on timing of symptoms and prior and subsequent test results, positive RT-PCR tests were categorised as presymptomatic, early or late infection, or persistent RNA shedding. FINDINGS 2425 tests were performed in 824 individuals, of which 52 (6.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive based on RT-PCR. There were 2406 paired sets from asymptomatic subjects for analysis. Sixteen Panbio tests were inconclusive, for which sensitivity analyses were performed (considering results as either positive or negative or being excluded). Sensitivity of Panbio for screening of asymptomatic individuals ranged from 80.0% (61.4-92.3) to 86.67% (69.2-96.2) and specificity from 99.53% (95% CI 99.2 to 99.8) to 100% (95% CI 99.8 to 100). Sensitivity of Panbio to detect subjects with presymptomatic/early infection (n=42) ranged from 81.82% (95% CI 67.3 to 91.8) to 90.91% (95% CI 78.3 to 97.5) with specificity always above 99%. INTERPRETATION The Panbio COVID-19 Ag rapid test identifies 81%-90% of presymptomatic and early asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections with high specificity. This test may therefore be adopted in testing strategies such as targeted screening of specific populations where prevalence is low.","Winkel, Beatrice; Schram, Emma; Gremmels, Hendrik; Debast, Sylvia; Schuurman, Rob; Wensing, Annemarie; Bonten, Marc; Goedhart, Edwin; Hofstra, Marije",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645658/,317
155458,Comparing lignocaine-adrenaline-tetracaine gel with lignocaine infiltration for anesthesia during repair of lacerations: A randomized trial.,2013,"In retroviruses and the double-stranded RNA totiviruses, the efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for ensuring the proper ratios of upstream-encoded capsid proteins to downstream-encoded replicase enzymes. The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the -1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by >4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a ""golden mean"" model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.","Plant, Ewan P; Rakauskaite, Rasa; Taylor, Deborah R; Dinman, Jonathan D",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02480-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164235/,317

Bline identification and quantification can be a challenging skill for novice ultrasound users, and experienced users could benefit from a more objective measure of quantification. We sought to develop and test a deep learning (DL) algorithm to quantify the assessment of B-lines in lung ultrasound. We utilized ultrasound clips (n=400) from an existing database of ED patients to provide training and test sets to develop and test the DL algorithm based on deep convolutional neural networks. Interpretations of the images by algorithm were compared to expert human interpretations on binary and severity (scale of 0 to 4) classifications. Our model yielded sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 81%-98%) and specificity 96(95% CI 84%-99%) for presence or absence of B-lines compared to expert read, with kappa of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79-0.97). Model to expert agreement for severity classification yielded a weighted kappa of 0.65 (95% CI 0.56-074). Overall, the DL algorithm performed well and could be integrated into an ultrasound system in order to help diagnose and track B-line severity. The algorithm is better at distinguishing presence from absence of B-lines but can also be successfully used to distinguish between B-line severity. Such methods could decrease variability and provide a standardized method for improved diagnosis and outcome.","Cristiana, Baloescu; Grzegorz, Toporek; Seungsoo, Kim; Katelyn, McNamara; Rachel, Liu; Shaw, Melissa; McNamara, Robert L; Balasundar, Raju; Moore, Christopher L","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",https://doi.org/10.1109/tuffc.2020.3002249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746183/,317
161675,"Acute wound management: revisiting the approach to assessment, irrigation, and closure considerations.",2010,"BACKGROUND Avulsion of the abductor muscles of the hip may cause severe limp and pain. Limited literature is available on treatment approaches for this problem, and each has shortcomings. This study describes a muscle transfer technique to treat complete irreparable avulsion of the hip abductor muscles and tendons. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE Ten adult cadaver specimens were dissected to determine nerve and blood supply point of entry in the gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata (TFL) and evaluate the feasibility and safety of transferring these muscles to substitute for the gluteus medius and minimus. In this technique, the anterior portion of the gluteus maximus and the entire TFL are mobilized and transferred to the greater trochanter such that the muscle fiber direction of the transferred muscles closely matches that of the gluteus medius and minimus. METHODS Five patients (five hips) were treated for primary irreparable disruption of the hip abductor muscles using this technique between January 2008 and April 2011. All patients had severe or moderate pain, severe abductor limp, and positive Trendelenburg sign. Patients were evaluated for pain and function at a mean of 28 months (range, 18-60 months) after surgery. RESULTS All patients could actively abduct 3 months postoperatively. At 1 year postoperatively, three patients had no hip pain, two had mild pain that did not limit their activity, three had no limp, and one had mild limp. One patient fell, fractured his greater trochanter, and has persistent limp and abduction weakness. CONCLUSIONS The anterior portion of the gluteus maximus and the TFL can be transferred to the greater trochanter to substitute for abductor deficiency. In this small series, the surgical procedure was reproducible and effective; further studies with more patients and longer followup are needed to confirm this.","Whiteside, Leo A",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-013-3161-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23955258/,317

In particular, in the domain of digital journalism, chatbots provide a new channel for audiences to engage with news. However, most chatbots operated by news organizations have so far failed to achieve business growth. In this paper, we have conducted a qualitative user study to better understand users' attitudes towards news chatbots. Specifically, 15 participants were asked to interact with several news chatbots implemented on Facebook Messenger by large international news organizations (e.g., ABC News, NBC News, and BBC News), by issuing a set of 22 sample questions covering various search and recommendation goals related to COVID-19. Then the participants expressed their expectations of news chatbots and the advantages/disadvantages perceived in using them.

171411,COVID-19-induced Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Rare Complication of SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021,"In our large, academic health system one of the most significant perioperative challenges is safely recovering patients once the primary recovery area is fully occupied. In 2019 we had over 21,000 minutes of Operating Room/Procedural Area (ORPA) holds where patients were recovered in the procedural areas. Recovering patients in the Operating Room (OR) has financial implications, since there is loss of revenue when the room is not being utilized for a scheduled procedure. In addition to the financial cost of delayed OR start times, dissatisfaction of the patients, surgery staff, and surgeons was also evident. The goal was to streamline, coordinate, and optimize patient recovery in a value focused environment while also assigning post procedural/surgical patients to the appropriate level of recovery. Our goal was a 40% decrease in the time delays associated with ORPA holds over the course of 6 months. We identified a multitude of causes and developed a process where Anesthesia recovers patients in the recovery room as opposed to the procedural areas, which we call the Anesthesia Recovery Program (ARP). Our ARP plan is triggered whenever an ORPA hold will exceed 10 minutes. The anesthesia team is directed to move the patient to a recovery room slot that is not staffed by RNs. The anesthesia provider monitors the patient in the recovery area until an RN-staffed slot becomes available. Additionally, a decision tree was created with guidelines in place in order to stratify recovery area assignments by optimizing the recovery workflow. The initial results showed an 85% decrease in ORPA holds. Having patients recovered by anesthesia providers improved turnover times and increased elective cases during business hours. Further work on this projected was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The interprofessional team developed a model for dealing with potentially costly delays. Through cross disciplinary efforts significant cost benefits can be appreciated while maintaining optimal patient safety.","Doubleday, Team Leader Amber Gaspard Team Members Susan Stipe LaQuniya McNeely Tracy Bennett Jaimie Hart Stuart Viteri Xavier Thibodeaux Andrea",Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2021.06.044,317

Does it helps to reduce distress in hazardous work environment with extremely high uncertainty level – like in healthcare professionals’ work at the beginning COVID-19 pandemic? Data showed the lover level of proactive coping in healthcare professionals in comparison with non-medical group (Pearman, Hughes, Smith & Neupert, 2020). The acute issue is to investigate proactive coping among medical professionals with different stress level.ObjectivesSpecialists of Moscow public dispensaries (doctors, n=209;nurses, n=131) were checked during pandemic breakout (April 2020) - in order to compare proactive coping and job stressors’ subjective evaluation in groups with high and low chronic states.MethodsThe diagnostic set included: the job stress survey (Spielberger, 1994);the proactive coping inventory (Greenglass, 2002);the chronic stress and fatigues inventories (Leonova, 2012).ResultsCluster analysis by combination of stress-fatigue scores extracted equal 22% of professionals in risk subgroups. Surprisingly no proactive coping differences were found in nurses;among doctors preventive coping is significantly lower in risk subgroup (t=7.05;p=0.009). Revealed job stressors in risk groups for nurses are quite typical;but for doctors they are unusual: extreme workload (t=33.97;p<0.001), low coworkers support (t=48.94;p<0.001), lack of positive feedback (t=62.29;p<0.001).ConclusionsDespite the undeniable workload increase, well-to-do professionals perceived no high job stressors. In risk subgroup with lack of preventive coping, perceived stressors are likely connected with inability to predict strain increase and to minimize the impact of its negative effects (Moore, 2017).","Kuznetsova, A.; Gushchin, M.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.842,317

Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n=14,376). Inverse-probability weighting was used to estimate confounder-adjusted population-average effects of centre and non-centre-based childcare (compared to parental care only) between ages 26-31 months on (age 3): internalising and externalising symptoms, pro-social behaviour, independence, emotional dysregulation, vocabulary, school readiness, and body mass index. To assess impacts on inequalities, controlled direct effects of low parental education and lone parenthood on all outcomes were estimated under two hypothetical scenarios: 1) universal take-up of centre-based childcare; and 2) parental care only. On average, non-centre based childcare improved vocabulary and centre-based care improved school readiness, with little evidence of other benefits. However, socio-economic inequalities were observed for all outcomes and were attenuated in scenario 1 (universal take-up). For example, inequalities in externalising symptoms (according to low parental education) were reduced from a confounder-adjusted standard deviation difference of 7.8 (95% confidence intervals: 6.7, 8.8), to 1.7 (0.6, 2.7). Inequalities by parental education in scenario 2 (parental care only) were wider than in scenario 1 for externalising symptoms (at 3.4 (2.4, 4.4)), and for emotional dysregulation and school readiness. Inequalities by lone parenthood, which were smaller, fell in scenario 1, and fell further in scenario 2. Universal access to centre-based pre-school care may alleviate inequalities, while restricted access (e.g. during lockdown for a pandemic such as Covid-19) may widen some inequalities in socioemotional and cognitive development.","Green, M.

183002,"Dividing the Emergency Department into Red, Yellow, and Green Zones to Control COVID-19 Infection; a Letter to Editor",2020-05-31,"Background: In spite of the large number of anti-corruption reforms implemented in different countries, there has been little research that empirically and systematically assesses the impact of these efforts. Objectives: The main objective of this review is to identify what works in curbing corruption in the public sector, by meta-analyzing the findings of published and unpublished evaluations of different types of anti-corruption interventions in different countries. The focus of this review is administrative corruption, namely corrupt acts involving civil servants in their dealings with their superiors, during the implementation of public policies, or while interacting with the public for service delivery. Political corruption (in the adoption of laws, regulations, and policies), and private-to-private corruption (involving only private actors) are excluded from this review. Search methods: The literature search was conducted by querying three widely recognized electronic databases: RePEc, SSRN, and Web of Science. These databases are considered the most comprehensive in the socio-economic field of research. The main grey literature repositories were also queried. Both published and unpublished studies were searched on the basis of specific combinations of keywords. The terms used to define queries were based on the “types of corruption”, “types of interventions/policies/reforms” and “study design” search strings. Specific conventions were used to “explode” or “truncate” keywords as appropriate. Screening of the references (i.e., snowballing) of the identified studies was also performed, and a reverse snowballing approach on Google Scholar was used. In order to ensure replicability, all searches were stored into Covidence, an online software developed by the Cochrane community for screening studies and extracting data for systematic reviews. Selection criteria: Any study that included experimental evaluations (randomized controlled trials) of interventions developed for use in the public sector (e.g., public administration, education, health, etc.) to curb administrative corruption has been included in this review without any geographical or temporal limitations. Only studies written in or translated into English have been considered. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors read the titles and abstracts of identified studies in order to determine their eligibility against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. When a title or abstract could not be included or rejected with certainty, the full text of the article was reviewed. In case of disagreement about whether or not a study should be included, the lead author (Giulia Mugellini), together with Martin Killias acted as arbitrator. The relevant information from identified studies was extracted independently by two review authors, following the guidelines of the Campbell Collaboration. The studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias checklist as a basis. The effect size selected for the analysis was the Fisher's z-score transformation of the partial correlation coefficient. For the meta-analysis, random effect(s) models were estimated. Meta-regression analysis models were then used to investigate the determinants behind the observed between- and within-study heterogeneity. Ten different covariates were included in the meta-regression models in order to control for the type of intervention, the type of corruption, the level of national income, the quality of the study and the type of participants involved in laboratory experiments. Results: The initial literature search led to the identification of 70 studies. Approximately one-third of the studies were excluded at the title/abstract stage because they either did not evaluate any anti-corruption intervention but simply assessed the relationship between corruption and other phenomena, or because the study design was not based on randomized controlled trials. Another 14 studies were excluded only after a full-text assessment. At this stage, the main reasons for exclusion were related to an unsuitable type of corruption (e.g., when the focus of the paper was political corruption, or private-to-private corruption instead of administrative corruption), the lack of regression output, or an unsuitable study design. At the end of the selection process, 29 studies resulted as eligible for inclusion. All the selected studies were written in English. The publication years ranged from 2007 to 2018. The majority of the selected studies (20) investigates the effect of anti-corruption interventions in high- and upper-middle income countries (Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Nine studies focused on low- and low-middle income countries (Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Uganda). All of them were randomized experiments. Twenty-five of these experiments were conducted in a laboratory, while four of them were field experiments. As to the type of outcome, the majority (18) of the selected studies addressed bribery (either active or passive), while 11 studies considered misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement). In terms of anti-corruption interventions, 19 studies tested the effect of deterrence interventions, while 10 studies focused on policies based on organizational and cultural change. Overall, the meta-analysis’ findings indicate that the identified interventions decrease the level of corruption. Results are statistically significant (p < 0.01) and robust to different heterogeneity estimators—that is, (restricted) maximum likelihood and method of moment estimators. The observed high level of heterogeneity— (Formula presented.) is equal to 92.36%, of which 43.78% is due to between-study heterogeneity and 48.57% to within-study heterogeneity—albeit in line with other meta-analyses in economics, suggests the need for meta-regression analyses. To investigate the determinants behind the between- and within-study heterogeneity of the observed effect, both a random effect model and a multilevel model were adopted. The results of the multilevel model show that:. 1) Control and deterrence interventions are more effective than organizational and cultural reforms in reducing corruption in the public sector. 2) Combining different interventions reduces corruption more than single interventions. 3) Interventions are more effective in preventing misappropriation of public resources (embezzlement) than passive or active bribery. Finally, the Funnel Asymmetry Test (FAT), conducted with both additive and multiplicative dispersion terms, shows no evidence of a strong publication bias in the literature. Authors’ conclusions: The results of this systematic review, based on a combination of laboratory and field experiments, demonstrate that increasing the expected monetary costs (e.g., sanctions) of corruption or the probability of detection (e.g., audit risk) is more effective than organizational, cultural and educational interventions in curbing administrative corruption, at least in the short term. However, this result might be due to the fact that the majority of selected studies are based on lab-experiments, where the assessment of the intervention is almost concurrent to its development. Short-term evaluations might fail to identify the effect of organizational and cultural interventions. Indeed, these interventions are based on structural changes in the organization of the system and the ethical and cultural education of public officials and might, thus, entail long periods to display their results on the level of corruption. Nevertheless, a combination of different interventions proves to be more effective than single interventions. For example, policies guaranteeing impunity to officials or citizens who report corrupt practices (principal witness/leniency treatment) are more effective if associated with a high probability of audit than leniency alone. A low probability of detection can be compensated by the threat of high fines in reducing both the amount and the likelihoo of bribe demands. To the contrary, a high probability of detection had no effect in the absence of severe sanction threats. The importance of the organizational and cultural environment in which the intervention is implemented clearly emerged in the literature. When possible, the characteristics of the settings where the interventions were developed were included in the meta-regression analysis (such as the level of income of the countries). When it was not possible to measure contextual factors and their interaction with the main intervention, a qualitative analysis was performed to reveal the complexities of these interactions. This additional analysis shows that the impact of the interventions was found to be affected by the likelihood of the continued interactions between bribe takers and givers, the amount and probability of fines, and the size of the bribe, among others. For example, reporting mechanisms and leniency policies increase their potential in combination with interventions that limit agent's exposure to one another – such as staff rotation. The success of audit risk on corruption is strongly dependent on the seriousness of the potential sanction and the probability that a sanction is applied. Some differences also emerge between high- and low-corruption countries regarding the effectiveness of anti-corruption interventions. For example, measures tending to increase social blame of corrupt practices work in low-corruption countries. Adding punishments in environments where actors’ behavior is tightly monitored increases compliance, but more so in environments where corruption is the exception rather than the rule. In terms of implications for research, the fact that control and deterrence turns out to be more effective thanorganizational and cultural interventions in curbing administrative corruption confirms the importance of economic theories (and cost-benefit analysis). However, the meta-analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of combining different types of interventions. This is true not only when combining policies reinforcing control and deterrence (monitoring frequency, detection probability and amount of fines), but also when policies based on organizational and cultural change are added (e.g., staff rotation and leniency). In particular, the role of moral levers in preventing corruption emerges, and especially the importance of strengthening professional identity and values in order to avoid conflicts between an individual's private interests and his/her public role. These results highlight the importance of going beyond economic models for explaining corruption, and considering the moral and cultural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. It also emerges the need to understand how different forms of corruption operate in practice at macro- (cross-country), meso- (country/nation-state) and micro- (individual) level. In particular, individual-level factors, such as the strive for power, low self-control, loss aversion and risk acceptance would need to be addressed. It would be interesting to distinguish, when more experimental studies will be available, between top-down (from supervisors to officials) and bottom-up (from citizens to officials) interventions. From a methodological point of view, it could be tested whether the results change according to the types of games used as a basis for the corruption experiments (e.g., behavioral game theory, trust game, etc.) and according to the setting in which the experiment was conducted (e.g., context-free versus in-context presentation of experimental tasks). Considering the effect of sensitization messages in reducing bribery demand, we would encourage researchers to develop other corruption experiments that explore the impact of interventions in fostering professional self-identity, as well as the impact of organizational family culture on corruption. Furthermore, this review highlights the need for a comprehensive classification of anti-corruption policies that distinguishes interventions by type of corruption, risk factors, type of poli y tool and administrative sector. © 2021 The Authors.

183045,Utilizing Telemedicine for Group Visit Provider Encounters: A Feasibility and Acceptability Study,2020-08-02,"The pandemic COVID-19 is still requiring several countermeasures to adopted in order to decrease the virus spread. Among others, face masks have shown their potentiality to reduce the person-to-person transmission. For this reason, several research groups and/or industries focused their supply chain in the production of innovative materials for the face mask design. Considering the surgical mask, several parameters have to be checked before their commercialization, as for example the breathability. This study aims at evaluating the repeatability and reproducibility of the breathability measurement in surgical masks, and at assessing the effects induced by the selected measurement points on the mask. Three samples for each type I, II and IIR masks were tested within the experimental protocol. Breathability was measured by following the UNI EN 14683:2019. Fifteen measurement points were identified for each mask and the measure was repeated five times per each point. Standard deviation across the repeated measures on the single point and across the different tested areas were used to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the procedure, respectively. The measurement uncertainty was also computed. In addition, in order to verify the effects induced by the selection of five points out the available fifteen, as requested by the UNI EN 14683:2019, all combinations of points were tested. Results showed a high value of reproducibility error, leading to the consideration that different areas of the same mask are characterized by different values of breathability. Thus, the selection of the five measurement points to perform the breathability measurement according to the standard is a crucial aspect that can influence the result of mask compliance. The results of the present paper could provide useful information for the standardization of the breathability measurement. © 2021 IEEE.","Taborri, J.; Stocchi, B.; Calabro, G.; Rossi, S.","2021 IEEE International Symposium on Medical Measurements and Applications, MeMeA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/memea52024.2021.9478732,317

183825,Exposure to human respiratory viruses among urban performing monkeys in Indonesia.,2006,"During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been burgeoning efforts to develop and deploy smartphone apps to expedite contact tracing and risk notification. Unfortunately, the success of these apps has been limited, partly owing to poor interoperability with manual contact tracing, low adoption rates, and a societally sensitive trade-off between utility and privacy. In this work, we introduce a new privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that aims to address the above limitations. Rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones as done by existing apps, our system captures encounters between inexpensive, zero-maintenance, small devices carried by users, and beacons placed in strategic locations where infection clusters are most likely to originate. Epidemiological simulations using an agent-based model demonstrate several beneficial properties of our system. By achieving bidirectional interoperability with manual contact tracing, our system can help control disease spread already at low adoption. By utilizing the location and environmental information provided by the beacons, our system can provide significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing app-based systems. In addition, our simulations also suggest that it is sufficient to deploy beacons in a small fraction of strategic locations for our system to achieve high utility.","Barthe, G.; De Viti, R.; Druschel, P.; Garg, D.; Gomez Rodriguez, M.; Ingo, P.; Kremer, H.; Lentz, M.; Lorch, L.; Mehta, A.; Schoelkopf, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.21.21250209v1?rss=1,317

Increased attention has been attributed to human integration;however, as M&A are multifaceted complex phenomena, this paper presents a literature review on the strategic management school, the organizational behavior school, and the process school in order to provide an integrative perspective on post-merger integration. By exemplifying interrelationships in human resource management (HRM) in each school of thought, as well as in intricacies of human matters, we provide suggestions for research. First, human integration and its consequences for HRM need to be considered in a context-dependent manner. Second, human integration is not a static event, as employees evolve from the integration process, where changes need to be analyzed over time to develop an understanding for implications in HRM. Third, research needs to consider new methods or combinations of methods in order to overcome the de-naturalization of humans in M&A.","Dao, Mai Anh Bauer Florian",Human Resource Management Review,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrmr.2020.100746,317

184533,Tracking the emergence of pandemic Influenza A/H1N1/2009 and its interaction with seasonal influenza viruses in Singapore.,2010,"Abstract Micromilling is a machining process defined by its low dimensions. In general, it is defined by the cutting tool diameter that must vary between 1 µm and 1000 µm. This process is used mostly in molds, medical applications and Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), where high quality parts are required in terms of geometry, which are absent of defects and possess smooth surfaces. However, there exist hurdles that need to be crossed in order to achieve these high-quality parts, most frequently surface roughness and the presence of burrs. For such phenomena, one common solution is the appliance of cutting fluids. To this end, some research studies have been developed, these have placed their focus upon the different composition of cutting fluid, which is applied with different pressures and at different rates. The application of cutting fluid can be made through pulses, as this is a common configuration for the MQL fluid supplier. The frequency of pulses defines the volume of cutting fluid applied and consequently affects the results. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the frequency of cutting fluid application over the final part of the cutting process. The results demonstrated that for the difficult to cut Inconel 718, if a low frequency of fluid, delivered by MQL, is applied, the final piece will not be homogeneous, as well as leaving parts with a low surface quality and higher burr formation.","de Oliveira, Déborah; Gomes, Milla Caroline; da Silva, Márcio Bacci",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315341,317

We present evidence that the viral mRNAs form a 3'-coterminal nested set and contain a common leader sequence of 208 nucleotides which is encoded by the 5'-end of the genome. The leader is joined to the bodies of mRNA 5 and 6 at positions defined by the sequence 5' UCAAC 3'. The part of the leader sequence flanking the UCAAC motif is very similar to the 5'-splice site of the Tetrahymena pre-rRNA. A possible internal guide sequence has been identified 43 nucleotides downstream of the leader sequence on the genome. Hybridization analysis shows that all EAV intracellular RNAs contain the leader sequence. These data imply that the viral subgenomic mRNAs are composed of leader and body sequences which are non-contiguous on the genome.,"de Vries, A A; Chirnside, E D; Bredenbeek, P J; Gravestein, L A; Horzinek, M C; Spaan, W J",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC330929/,317

Forty five IB viruses (IBV) were isolated from poultry in Malaysia during 2014-2016. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike glycoprotein 1 (S1) gene revealed that all isolates were clustered into five distinct groups. The predominant type of IBV isolated was QX strains (47%), second was 4/91 type (27%), followed by Malaysian strain MH5365/95 (13%), Massachusetts type (11%) and finally Taiwanese strains (2%). Four types of S1 protein cleavage recognition motifs were found among the isolates which includes HRRRR, RRSRR, RRFRR and RRVRR. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the motif RRVRR and are unique to Malaysian strains. Six IBVs were grouped in Malaysian MH5365/95 strains. Among these, one isolate was different from others where it only shared 82% identity with MH5365/95 and to others. It formed its own branch in the Malaysian cluster suggesting it may be a variant unique to Malaysia. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that point mutations, insertions and deletions contribute to the divergence of IB variants. This study indicated at least five groups of IBV are circulating in Malaysia with most of the isolates belonged to QX strains. As new IBV variants continue to emerge, further study need to be carried out to determine whether the current available vaccine is able to give protection against the circulating virus.","Leow, B L; Syamsiah Aini, S; Faizul Fikri, M Y; Muhammad Redzwan, S; Khoo, C K; Ong, G H; Basirah, M A; Norazura, B; Mazaitul, Z; Mohd Khairil, A; Mohd Jihan, R; Sohayati, A R; Chandrawathani, P",Tropical biomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601856/,317

In a surveillance study for CoV in noncaged animals from the wild areas of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region, we identified a CoV closely related to SARS-CoV (bat-SARS-CoV) from 23 (39%) of 59 anal swabs of wild Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) by using RT-PCR. Sequencing and analysis of three bat-SARS-CoV genomes from samples collected at different dates showed that bat-SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV from humans and civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-SARS-CoV formed a distinct cluster with SARS-CoV as group 2b CoV, distantly related to known group 2 CoV. Most differences between the bat-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV genomes were observed in the spike genes, ORF 3 and ORF 8, which are the regions where most variations also were observed between human and civet SARS-CoV genomes. In addition, the presence of a 29-bp insertion in ORF 8 of bat-SARS-CoV genome, not in most human SARS-CoV genomes, suggests that it has a common ancestor with civet SARS-CoV. Antibody against recombinant bat-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was detected in 84% of Chinese horseshoe bats by using an enzyme immunoassay. Neutralizing antibody to human SARS-CoV also was detected in bats with lower viral loads. Precautions should be exercised in the handling of these animals.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Huang, Yi; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Wong, Beatrice H L; Wong, Samson S Y; Leung, Suet-Yi; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16169905/,317

195448,Mass Suicide of COVID-19 Patient's Survivors; a Clinical Experience.,2021,"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), a small enveloped virus containing a positive-strand RNA genome, possesses at least three major structural proteins designated N, M, and E. The N protein is considered as the major component of the nucleocapsid, whereas M and E are membrane-associated. Previous studies using peptide-specific antibodies assigned these proteins to ORFs 7, 6, and 5, respectively. In the present report, monospecific antisera raised against Escherichia coli-expressed ORFs 5, 6, and 7 products were used to study the synthesis and processing of PRRSV structural proteins in the highly permissive MARC-145 cell line. Treatment of viral proteins with various glycosidases showed that only E was modified by N-linked glycans. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that intracellular transport of the major envelope glycoprotein was delayed in the premedial Golgi compartment. During the first 30 min of chase, E undergoes a gradual downward shift of its apparent molecular weight, thought to result from trimming of the mannose-rich glycan structures. Once E is transported to the medial Golgi or proximal elements, some molecules undergo complete processing of all their high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides to complex type, while in other molecules only a fraction of N-linked glycans are terminally glycosylated. These two differentially glycosylated forms of E were found to be incorporated into extracellular virions. In cells and virions, both M and E were shown to occur in heterodimeric complexes linked by disulfide bonds. The oligomerization process, as analyzed from pulse-chase experiments, showed that M and E are incorporated into M-E complexes with different kinetics and efficiencies, in a fashion similar to their counterparts in equine arteritis virus. Apparently, all steps of E protein N-glycans processing proceed after its association with M which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the infected cells, E and M appear highly membrane-associated, while N is predominantly cytosolic.","Mardassi, H; Massie, B; Dea, S",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8661418/,317

This study describes the morphologic features of granulomatous vasculitis in FIP as well as its development in the course of monocyte-associated feline CoV (FCoV) viremia in five naturally infected Domestic Shorthair cats with FIP. Monocyte-associated FCoV viremia was demonstrated by immunohistology, RNA in situ hybridization, and electron micropscopy. Granulomatous phlebitis at different stages of development was observed. Vasculitic processes ranged from attachment and emigration of FCoV-infected monocytes to vascular/perivascular granulomatous infiltrates with destruction of the vascular basal lamina. Monocytes as well as perivascular macrophages were activated because they were strongly positive for CD18 and expressed cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta) and matrix metalloproteinase-9. In addition, general activation of endothelial cells, represented by major histocompatibility complex II upregulation, was observed in all cases. These results confirm FIP as a monocyte-triggered systemic disease and demonstrate the central role of activated monocytes in FIP vasculitis.","Kipar, A; May, H; Menger, S; Weber, M; Leukert, W; Reinacher, M",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15872378/,317

The Minister of Health set up a daily reporting mechanism to obtain timeous details of COVID-19 deaths from the provinces to track mortality patterns. OBJECTIVES To provide an epidemiological analysis of the first COVID-19 deaths in SA. METHODS Provincial deaths data from 28 March to 3 July 2020 were cleaned, information on comorbidities was standardised, and data were aggregated into a single data set. Analysis was performed by age, sex, province, date of death and comorbidities. RESULTS SA reported 3 088 deaths from COVID-19, i.e. an age-standardised death rate of 64.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 62.3 - 66.8) deaths per million population. Most deaths occurred in Western Cape (65.5%) followed by Eastern Cape (16.8%) and Gauteng (11.3%). The median age of death was 61 years (interquartile range 52 - 71). Males had a 1.5 times higher death rate compared with females. Individuals with two or more comorbidities accounted for 58.6% (95% CI 56.6 - 60.5) of deaths. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities reported, and HIV and tuberculosis were more common in individuals aged <50 years. CONCLUSIONS Data collection for COVID-19 deaths in provinces must be standardised. Even though the data had limitations, these findings can be used by the SA government to manage the pandemic and identify individuals who are at high risk of dying from COVID-19.","Pillay-van Wyk, V; Bradshaw, D; Groenewald, P; Seocharan, I; Manda, S; Roomaney, R A; Awotiwon, O; Nkwenika, T; Gray, G; Buthelezi, S S; Mkhize, Z L",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403985/,317

STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in at least 1 published systematic review comparing the use of masks with a control group, either in community or health care settings, on the risk of viral respiratory infections. SYNTHESIS In total, 11 systematic reviews were included and 18 RCTs of 26 444 participants were found, 12 in the community and 6 in health care workers. Included studies had limitations and were deemed at high risk of bias. Overall, the use of masks in the community did not reduce the risk of influenza, confirmed viral respiratory infection, influenzalike illness, or any clinical respiratory infection. However, in the 2 trials that most closely aligned with mask use in real-life community settings, there was a significant risk reduction in influenzalike illness (risk ratio [RR] = 0.83; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). The use of masks in households with a sick contact was not associated with a significant infection risk reduction in any analysis, no matter if masks were used by the sick individual, the healthy family members, or both. In health care workers, surgical masks were superior to cloth masks for preventing influenzalike illness (RR = 0.12; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.98), and N95 masks were likely superior to surgical masks for preventing influenzalike illness (RR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.00) and any clinical respiratory infections (RR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00). CONCLUSION This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections. In the community setting, a possible reduced risk of influenzalike illness was found among mask users. In health care workers, the results show no difference between N95 masks and surgical masks on the risk of confirmed influenza or other confirmed viral respiratory infections, although possible benefits from N95 masks were found for preventing influenzalike illness or other clinical respiratory infections. Surgical masks might be superior to cloth masks but data are limited to 1 trial.","Dugré, Nicolas; Ton, Joey; Perry, Danielle; Garrison, Scott; Falk, Jamie; McCormack, James; Moe, Samantha; Korownyk, Christina S; Lindblad, Adrienne J; Kolber, Michael R; Thomas, Betsy; Train, Anthony; Allan, G Michael",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32675098/,317

202074,Ivermectin in COVID-19: What do we know?,2020,"UNLABELLED Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is primarily transmitted by bio-aerosol droplets or direct personal contacts. This paper presents a detailed study of environmental evidence of possible airborne transmission in a hospital ward during the largest nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003. Retrospective on-site inspections and measurements of the ventilation design and air distribution system were carried out on July 17, 2003. Limited on-site measurements of bio-aerosol dispersion were also carried out on July 22. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bio-aerosol dispersion in the hospital ward. We attempted to predict the air distribution during the time of measurement in July 2003 and the time of exposure in March 2003. The predicted bio-aerosol concentration distribution in the ward seemed to agree fairly well with the spatial infection pattern of SARS cases. Possible improvement to air distribution in the hospital ward was also considered. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our study revealed the need for the development of improved ventilation and air-conditioning systems in an isolation ward or a general hospital ward for infectious respiratory diseases. The outbreak in Ward 8A, which was in a general hospital and could house nearly 40 patients, demonstrated the cross-infection risks of respiratory infectious diseases in hospitals if a potential highly infectious patient was not identified and isolated. Our example simulation, which extended the SARS Busters' design for an isolation room to Ward 8A, demonstrated that there was room for improvement to minimize cross-infection in large general hospital wards.","Li, Y; Huang, X; Yu, I T S; Wong, T W; Qian, H",Indoor air,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15737151/,317
202283,"Epidemiological, otolaryngological, olfactory and gustatory outcomes according to the severity of COVID-19: a study of 2579 patients",2021,"There is currently debate about human coronavirus (HCoV) seasonality and pathogenicity, as epidemiological data are scarce. Here, we provide epidemiological and clinical features of HCoV patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) examined in primary care general practice. We also describe HCoV seasonality over six influenza surveillance seasons (week 40 to 15 of each season) from the period 2014/2015 to 2019/2020 in Corsica (France). A sample of patients of all ages presenting for consultation for influenza-like illness (ILI) or ARI was included by physicians of the French Sentinelles Network during this period. Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for the presence of 21 respiratory pathogens by real-time RT-PCR. Among the 1389 ILI/ARI patients, 105 were positive for at least one HCoV (7.5%). On an annual basis, HCoVs circulated from week 48 (November) to weeks 14-15 (May) and peaked in week 6 (February). Overall, among the HCoV-positive patients detected in this study, HCoV-OC43 was the most commonly detected virus, followed by HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E. The HCoV detection rates varied significantly with age (p = 0.00005), with the age group 0-14 years accounting for 28.6% (n = 30) of HCoV-positive patients. Fever and malaise were less frequent in HCoV patients than in influenza patients, while sore throat, dyspnoea, rhinorrhoea, and conjunctivitis were more associated with HCoV positivity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that HCoV subtypes appear in ARI/ILI patients seen in general practice, with characteristic outbreak patterns primarily in winter. This study also identified symptoms associated with HCoVs in patients with ARI/ILI. Further studies with representative samples should be conducted to provide additional insights into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoVs.","Masse, Shirley; Capai, Lisandru; Villechenaud, Natacha; Blanchon, Thierry; Charrel, Rémi; Falchi, Alessandra",Viruses,,317

Itaconate has a vital role in regulating inflammatory activation in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of itaconate in the progression of AAA is unknown. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of itaconate on AAA formation and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to determine Irg1 and downstream Nrf2 expression in human and mouse AAA samples. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed to measure the abundance of itaconate. OI treatment and Irg1 knockdown were performed to study the role of OI in AAA formation. Nrf2 intervention in vivo was performed to detect the critical role of Nrf2 in the beneficial effect of OI on AAA. FINDINGS: We found that itaconate suppressed the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice, while Irg1 deficiency exerted the opposite effect. Mechanistically, itaconate inhibited vascular inflammation by enabling Nrf2 to function as a transcriptional repressor of downstream inflammatory genes via alkylation of Keap1. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency significantly aggravated inflammatory factor expression and promoted AAA formation. In addition, Keap1 overexpression significantly promoted Ang II-induced AAA formation, which was inhibited by itaconate. INTERPRETATION: Itaconate inhibited AAA formation by suppressing vascular inflammation, and therapeutic approaches to increase itaconate are potentially beneficial for preventing AAA formation.

Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe and critical illness, spurred on by excessive inflammation that can lead to respiratory or multiorgan failure. Numerous studies have established the unique array of cytoprotective properties of the dietary amino acid ergothioneine. Based on studies in a range of in vitro and in vivo models, ergothioneine has exhibited the ability to modulate inflammation, scavenge free radicals, protect against acute respiratory distress syndrome, prevent endothelial dysfunction, protect against ischemia and reperfusion injury, protect against neuronal damage, counteract iron dysregulation, hinder lung and liver fibrosis, and mitigate damage to the lungs, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and testis, amongst many others. When compiled, this evidence suggests that ergothioneine has a potential application in the treatment of the underlying pathology of COVID-19. We propose that ergothioneine could be used as a therapeutic to reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19, especially in the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. This review presents evidence to support that proposal.","Cheah, Irwin K.; Halliwell, Barry",Antioxidants,,317

OBJECTIVES: To delineate clinical features of COVID-19 patients with different severities and prognoses and clarify the risk factors for disease progression and death at an early stage. METHODS: Medical history, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome data from 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Eastern Campus of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University in China were collected from 30 January 2020 to 20 February 2020, and risk factors associated with clinical deterioration and death were analysed. The final date of follow-up was 21 March 2020. RESULTS: Age, comorbidities, higher neutrophil cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts and subsets, impairment of liver, renal, heart, coagulation systems, systematic inflammation and clinical scores at admission were significantly associated with disease severity. Ten (16.1%) moderate and 45 (47.9%) severe patients experienced deterioration after admission, and median time from illness onset to clinical deterioration was 14.7 (IQR 11.3-18.5) and 14.5 days (IQR 11.8-20.0), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed increased Hazards Ratio of disease progression associated with older age, lymphocyte count <1.1 × 109/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)> 9.5 mmol/L, lactate dehydrogenase >250 U/L and procalcitonin >0.1 ng/mL at admission. These factors were also associated with the risk of death except for BUN. Prediction models in terms of nomogram for clinical deterioration and death were established to illustrate the probability.

225268,Balancing patients' fears of recurrence and fears of COVID-19 when considering their preference for review consultations,2021,"Objective: This study investigates the association of preventive measures with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seropositivity. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Kharian Medical College, Pakistan, in September 2020. A total of 442 participants from three different strata (faculty, students, and administration/technical staff) were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique. A rapid antibody testing method was used to detect antibodies. The Ichroma&#8482; COVID-19 Ab test is an in vitro diagnostic device that helps in the rapid identification of COVID-19 by measuring the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the blood. An automated fluorescent immunoassay system (AFIAS-6), with a clinical sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 96.7%, was used for qualitative analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Results: In total, 442 participants were included in the study: 40 (9%) faculty members, 299 (67%) students, and 103 (23.3%) administrative/technical staff. As many as 14.9% of the participants were symptomatic; 32.4% always used masks, and 14% never wore masks. Furthermore, 69.7% of participants frequently washed their hands for 20 s, and 75.6% were aware of social distancing. A total of 16.96% of participants tested positive for IgG antibodies. Moreover, most of the administration/technical staff who tested positive for IgG were asymptomatic (68.42%). A significant association (p < 0.001) was found between following the safety guidelines (wearing masks, handwashing, and social distancing) and the occurrence of COVID-19. Conclusion: This study showed a higher seroprevalence rate than other studies as it was conducted toward the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are still far from achieving herd immunity. Furthermore, strict compliance with preventive measures is the only way to ensure safety until an effective vaccine is developed.","Naiyar, I; Anjum, A F; Khalid, A M; Noor, I; Abdullah, M S; Anwar, M Z",,,317

SARS-CoV-2 is known to preferentially target older subjects and those with pre-existing conditions, but the reason for this age dependence is unclear. Here, we found that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 grows exponentially with age in all countries tested, with the doubling time approaching that of all-cause human mortality. In addition, men and those with multiple age-related diseases are characterized by increased mortality. Moreover, similar mortality patterns were found for all-cause pneumonia. We further report that the gene expression of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, grows in the lung with age, except for subjects on a ventilator. Together, our findings establish COVID-19 as an emergent disease of aging, and age and age-related diseases as its major risk factors. In turn, this suggests that COVID-19, and deadly respiratory diseases in general, may be targeted, in addition to antiviral approaches, by approaches that target the aging process.","Santesmasses, Didac; Castro, José Pedro; Zenin, Aleksandr A; Shindyapina, Anastasia V; Gerashchenko, Maxim V; Zhang, Bohan; Kerepesi, Csaba; Yim, Sun Hee; Fedichev, Peter O; Gladyshev, Vadim N",Aging Cell,,317

Community pharmacists are responsible for dispensing appropriate medications and products in addition to counseling, informing and educating the public, and promoting disease prevention and infection control. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess community pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate behavior changes and safety measures. METHODS: An anonymous and standardized online questionnaire in English was disseminated via social media platforms to Lebanese community pharmacists. The questionnaire consisted of 95 items designed as Likert-scales and multiple-choice questions divided into four different sections: socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge-based, attitude-based, and pharmacy practice questions. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to summarize the demographic characteristics, and indices were created for knowledge, attitude, and practice by computing the correct answers for each section. RESULTS: A total of 310 questionnaires were completed. Around 61% have expressed their fear of getting infected with COVID-19 due to occupational exposure. The respondents were able to answer 80-90% of the knowledge-based questions of the survey. A more careful/anxious attitude, but not knowledge, was associated with overall better practice (p = 0.03). Also, respondents stated that they are dispensing protective equipment items such as masks (87%), gloves (60%), and sanitizers (77%) in small quantities due to limited availability. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed an adequate level of knowledge and good practice towards COVID-19 among Lebanese community pharmacists. Their fears of contracting the virus and compromising the safety of those around them are justified. However, their supply of protective equipment is limited.","Zeenny, Rony M; Dimassi, Ahmad; Sacre, Hala; El Khoury, Ghada; Hajj, Aline; Farah, Rita; Hajj, Hind; Lahoud, Nathalie; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Souheil; Salameh, Pascale",J Pharm Policy Pract,,317

The ED plays an important part in detecting an increasing number of new contagious diseases, which could potentially lead to an epidemic or pandemic.During a pandemic, the ED's main task is to detect infected individuals. These patients then need to be isolated and an adequate treatment is required. The ED must be prepared in order to perform well in such a situation. One major part for readiness is communication in an open manner to all partners within the department, as well as with emergency medical services and other departments of the hospital.The ED must be restructured to withstand the rising number of infected patients. These patients must be separated from other critically ill patients. Strategies for a diagnostic workup depending on the kind of infection have to be put in place. Pathways for the outpatient and inpatient management must be defined to avoid overcrowding in the ED. Depending on the number of patients, escalation and de-escalation strategies have to be set up within the hospital.Over the whole course of the pandemic, all staff members are the key resources for the ED and the entire hospital. The ED can only cope with a pandemic situation if staff are working together as a whole. This implies several important steps to get the staff prepared: Recurring, open conversations about fears, problems, and successes are critical for staff morale. Training must be continually provided, and protection strategies implemented. In the chronic phase of the pandemic the focus should shift more towards strategies on how to create possibilities for recuperation, domestic support measures, and mental health care for staff.","Schmid, Bonaventura; Lang, Corinna N; Danner, Timo; Kramer, Katharina; Hans, Felix P; Busch, Hans-Jörg",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,317
236315,Communication With Older Adults in Times of a Pandemic: Practical Suggestions for the Health Care Professionals,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), a member of TLR family, plays an important role in the induction and regulation of immune/inflammation. TLR2 gene knockout (TLR2KO) mice have been widely used for animal models of neurological diseases. Since there is close relationship between immune system and neurobehavioral functions, it is important to clarify the exact role of TLR2 defect itself in neurobehavioral functions. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of TLR2KO on neurobehavioral functions in mice and the mechanisms underlying the observed changes. METHODS: Male TLR2KO and wild type (WT) mice aged 3, 7, and 12 months were used for neurobehavioral testing and detection of protein expression by Western blot. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrophysiological recording, and Evans blue (EB) assay were applied to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), synaptic function, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in 12-month-old TLR2KO and age-matched WT mice. RESULTS: Compared to WT mice, TLR2KO mice showed decreased cognitive function and locomotor activity, as well as increased anxiety, which developed from middle age (before 7-month-old) to old age. In addition, significantly reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), inhibited long-term potentiation (LTP), and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were observed in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice. Furthermore, compared with age-matched WT mice, significant reduction in protein levels of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin5) and increased neurofilament protein (SMI32) were observed in 7 and 12-month-old TLR2KO mice, and that myelin basic protein (MBP) decreased in 12-month-old TLR2KO mice. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that TLR2 defect resulted in significantly observable neurobehavioral dysfunctions in mice starting from middle age, as well as multiple abnormalities in brain structure, function, and molecular metabolism.","Hu, Yuting; Sun, Xiaoyu; Wang, Shang; Zhou, Chao; Lin, Li; Ding, Xiaohui; Han, Jingjing; Zhou, Yan; Jin, Guoliang; Wang, Yuqiao; Zhang, Wei; Shi, Hongjuan; Zhang, Zuohui; Yang, Xinxin; Hua, Fang",Brain behav. immun,,317
236978,Haemoglobin A1c is a predictor of COVID-19 severity in patients with diabetes,2020,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease associated with thrombotic outcomes with coagulation and endothelial disorders. Based on that, several anticoagulation guidelines have been proposed. We aimed to determine whether anticoagulation therapy modifies the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Methods and Results Patients with COVID-19 initially admitted in medical wards of 24 French hospitals were included prospectively from February 26 to April 20, 2020. We used a Poisson regression model, Cox proportional hazard model, and matched propensity score to assess the effect of anticoagulation on outcomes (intensive care unit admission or in-hospital mortality). The study enrolled 2878 patients with COVID-19, among whom 382 (13.2%) were treated with oral anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization. After adjustment, anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.55-0.88). Analyses performed using propensity score matching confirmed that anticoagulation therapy before hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29-0.63) for intensive care unit admission and adjusted hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61-0.98) for composite criteria intensive care unit admission or death. In contrast, therapeutic or prophylactic low- or high-dose anticoagulation started during hospitalization were not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions Anticoagulation therapy used before hospitalization in medical wards was associated with a better prognosis in contrast with anticoagulation initiated during hospitalization. Anticoagulation therapy introduced in early disease could better prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endotheliopathy, and lead to a better prognosis.","Chocron, Richard; Galand, Vincent; Cellier, Joffrey; Gendron, Nicolas; Pommier, Thibaut; Bory, Olivier; Khider, Lina; Trimaille, Antonin; Goudot, Guillaume; Weizman, Orianne; Alsac, Jean Marc; Geneste, Laura; Schmeltz, Armand; Panagides, Vassili; Philippe, Aurélien; Marsou, Wassima; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; Deney, Antoine; El Batti, Salma; Attou, Sabir; Juvin, Philippe; Delmotte, Thomas; Messas, Emmanuel; Pezel, Théo; Planquette, Benjamin; Duceau, Baptiste; Gaussem, Pascale; Sutter, Willy; Sanchez, Olivier; Waldman, Victor; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Smadja, David M",J Am Heart Assoc,,317

Epidemiologic studies suggest a potential benefit of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes. Differential past BCG vaccination policies between the former East and West German states provides a unique natural experiment to assess the potential effect of prior BCG vaccination on COVID-19. We estimated a 5% heterologous vaccine efficacy in the highly vaccinated former East Germany using the COVID-19 International Modeling (CoMo) Consortium model. A comparable BCG vaccination campaign undertaken prior to the pandemic in former West Germany, instituted along with known country-wide transmission reduction measures, is associated with a 37% decrease in projected mortality by mid-summer, 2020. These findings support a combined heterologous vaccine and non-pharmaceutical interventions (HVI+NPI) approach to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic until SARS-CoV-2 specific vaccines are widely distributed.","Marín-Hernández, Daniela; Nixon, Douglas F; Hupert, Nathaniel",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,317
246011,Transitional care from skilled nursing facilities to home: study protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial,2021,"Azithromycin has rapidly been adopted as a repurposed drug for the treatment of COVID-19, despite the lack of high-quality evidence. In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase. Safety data warrant monitoring of drug-drug interactions and subsequent cardiac adverse events, especially with hydroxychloroquine. More prospective data of large randomised controlled studies are expected and much-needed. Uniform reporting of results should be strongly encouraged to facilitate data pooling with the many ongoing initiatives.","Gyselinck, Iwein; Janssens, Wim; Verhamme, Peter; Vos, Robin",,,317

Understanding the airborne route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is essential for infection prevention and control. In this study, a total of 107 indoor air samples (45 SARS-CoV-2, 62 bacteria, and fungi) were collected from different wards of the Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord, Iran. Simultaneously, bacterial and fungal samples were also collected from the ambient air of hospital yard. Overall, 6 positive air samples were detected in the infectious 1 and infectious 2 wards, intensive care unit (ICU), computed tomography (CT) scan, respiratory patients' clinic, and personal protective equipment (PPE) room. Also, airborne bacteria and fungi were simultaneously detected in the various wards of the hospital with concentrations ranging from 14 to 106 CFU m-3 and 18 to 141 CFU m-3, respectively. The highest mean concentrations of bacteria and fungi were observed in respiratory patients' clinics and ICU wards, respectively. Significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between airborne bacterial concentration and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, while no significant correlation was found between fungi concentration and the virus presence. This study provided an additional evidence about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the indoor air of a hospital that admitted COVID-19 patients. Moreover, it was revealed that the monitoring of microbial quality of indoor air in such hospitals is very important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, for controlling the nosocomial infections.","Hemati, Sara; Mobini, Gholam Reza; Heidari, Mohsen; Rahmani, Fereidoun; Soleymani Babadi, Akbar; Farhadkhani, Marzieh; Nourmoradi, Heshmatollah; Raeisi, Ahmad; Ahmadi, Ali; Khodabakhshi, Abbas; Sadeghi, Mehraban; Bagheri, Milad; Validi, Majid; Taghipour, Simin; Mohammadi-Moghadam, Fazel",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R0 is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.","Hilton, Joe; Keeling, Matt J",PLoS Comput Biol,,317

In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations with regular visits at ambulatory clinic of implantable devices and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during times of limited face­to­face contact. METHODS: Teleconsultations in the clinic were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control of cardiac implantable electronic devices. Prior to planned visits, physicians phoned patients and interviewed them about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available medical records. RESULTS: Teleconsultations were carried out over 3.5 weeks (March 13 to April 1, 2020). Out of 400 patients who had visits planned at the clinic, 349 were consulted by phone. A total of 299 patients confirmed stable health status, 14 reported some symptoms, and 4 were hospitalized; 2 patients changed their primary clinic and were no longer under our care, 1 was undergoing quarantine, 15 required additional intervention, and 15 had died prior to contact. In general, patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconsultations are a much­needed option during the SARS­CoV­2 pandemic. They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the ambulatory visit plan, which may otherwise put an overwhelming burden on the clinic.","Paskudzka, Diana; Kolodzinska, Agnieszka; Cacko, Andrzej; Stolarz, Przemyslaw; Lyzwinski, Lukasz; Opolski, Grzegorz; Grabowski, Marcin",Kardiol Pol,,317

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 58±16 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia. Clinical Impact: Recognized challenges in diagnosing COVID-19 by CT are furthered by our observed strong overlap between CT appearances of COVID-19 and OP.

258382,Otolaryngology in the COVID-19 pandemic era: the impact on our clinical practice,2020,"Observational studies, from multiple countries, repeatedly demonstrate an association between obesity and severe COVID-19, which is defined as need for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. Meta-analysis of studies from China, USA, and France show odds ratio (OR) of 2.31 (95% CI 1.3-4.1) for obesity and severe COVID-19. Other studies show OR of 12.1 (95% CI 3.25-45.1) for mortality and OR of 7.36 (95% CI 1.63-33.14) for need for IMV for patients with body mass index (BMI) &#8805; 35 kg/m2. Obesity is the only modifiable risk factor that is not routinely treated but treatment can lead to improvement in visceral adiposity, insulin sensitivity, and mortality risk. Increasing the awareness of the association between obesity and COVID-19 risk in the general population and medical community may serve as the impetus to make obesity identification and management a higher priority.","Dutta, Nirjhar; Ingraham, Nicholas E; Usher, Michael G; Fox, Claudia; Tignanelli, Christopher J; Bramante, Carolyn T",J Prim Care Community Health,,317

259074,Protecting the Prehospital Professional First Aid Teams from Airborne Viral Particles in the Case of Out-of-Hospital Pediatric Cardiac Arrest during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Artifacts caused by respiratory motion or ventilation-induced chest movements are a major problem for thoracic MRI, as they can obscure important anatomical structures such as lymph node metastases. We compared image quality of routine breathhold with intermittent apnea during controlled mechanical ventilation of patients under general anesthesia as the ideal situation without respiratory motion in the detection and characterization of regional lymph nodes in esophageal cancer. METHODS: In this prospective study, 10 patients treated for esophageal cancer underwent ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) enhanced MRI scans. Before neoadjuvant therapy, MRI scans were acquired with a routine breathhold technique. After neoadjuvant therapy, patients were scanned under general anesthesia immediately prior to surgery with controlled mechanical ventilation. The image quality was compared using a Likert scale questionnaire based on visibility of anatomical structures and image artifacts. RESULTS: MRI with controlled mechanical ventilation and prolonged controlled apnea of 4â¯min was safe and feasible. All cardio-respiratory monitoring parameters remained stable during the apnea phases. Mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes down to 2â¯mm in size could be visualized with all sequences. All image quality criteria, including visibility of thoracic structures and regional lymph nodes were scored higher using the controlled ventilation sequences compared to the routine breathhold phase. CONCLUSION: USPIO-enhanced MRI with controlled mechanical ventilation is superior to routine breathhold MRI in visualizing lymph nodes, which warrants new motion reduction techniques to use MRI for the detection of lymph node metastases in patients with esophageal cancer.","de Gouw, D J J M; Maas, M C; Slagt, C; Mühling, J; Nakamoto, A; Klarenbeek, B R; Rosman, C; Hermans, J J; Scheenen, T W J",Magn. reson. imaging,,317
259928,"Singularities of AED implementation in occupational setting and COVID-19 pandemic: In response to ""Use and Coverage of Automated External Defibrillators According to Location in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest""",2021,"BACKGROUND: Provision of contraception to women in the immediate postnatal period has been endorsed by professional bodies, to reduce the incidence of short inter-pregnancy intervals. This study examined the views of postnatal women and practising midwives regarding provision of contraceptive advice and contraceptive methods by midwives, in a region of the United Kingdom. METHODS: A mixed-method approach using qualitative interviews with midwives, and a postnatal survey followed by qualitative interviews with postnatal women, in five hospitals in the East of England. Twenty-one practising midwives and ten women were interviewed. Two hundred and twenty-seven women returned a survey. Survey data was analysed descriptively, augmented by Student's t-tests and Chi-squared tests to examine associations within the data. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed guided by the phases of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Midwives and women supported the concept of increased midwifery provision of contraceptive advice, and provision of contraceptive methods in the postnatal period. Convenience and an established trusting relationship were reasons for preferring midwifery provision over visiting a doctor for contraception. The best time for detailed discussion was reported to be antenatal and community visits. The Progesterone-only-pill (POP) was the method, in which women indicated most interest postnatally. Concerns for midwives included the need for increased education on contraceptive methods and training in supplying these. Structural barriers to such provision were time pressures, low prioritisation of contraceptive training and disputes over funding. CONCLUSIONS: Women reported interest in midwives supplying contraceptive methods and expressed the view that this would be convenient and highly acceptable. Midwives are supportive of the concept of providing enhanced contraceptive advice and methods to women in their care, and believe that it would be advantageous for women. Institutional support is required to overcome structural barriers such as poor access to continuous professional development, and to allow contraceptive provision to be fully recognised as integral to the midwifery role, rather than a marginalised addition.","Walker, Susan H; Hooks, Claire; Blake, Diane",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,317

The pandemic apparently started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since affected many countries worldwide, turning into a major global threat. Chinese researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be classified into two major variants. They suggest that investigating the variations and characteristics of these variants might help assess risks and develop better treatment and prevention strategies. The two variants were named L-type and S-type, in which L-type was prevailed in an initial outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, and S-type was phylogenetically older than L-type and less prevalent at an early stage, but with a later increase in frequency in Wuhan. There were 149 mutations in 103 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, 83 of which were nonsynonymous, leading to alteration in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Much effort is currently being devoted to elucidate whether or not these mutations affect viral transmissibility and virulence. In this review, we summarize the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of virus evolution and discuss the significance of the gene alterations in infections.","Awadasseid, Annoor; Wu, Yanling; Tanaka, Yoshimasa; Zhang, Wen",Int J Biol Sci,,317

Although tape strips show promise as a minimally invasive technique in these common diseases, a comprehensive molecular profiling characterizing and differentiating the 2 diseases in tape strips is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to construct a global transcriptome of tape strips from lesional and nonlesional skin of adults with moderate-to-severe AD and psoriasis. METHODS: A total of 20 tape strips were obtained from lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with AD and psoriasis and skin from controls (n = 20 each); the strips were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with quantitative RT-PCR validation of immune and barrier biomarkers. RESULTS: We detected RNA-seq profiles in 96 of 100 of samples (96%), with 4123 and 5390 genes differentially expressed in AD and psoriasis lesions versus in controls, respectively (fold change &#8805; 2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Nonlesional tape-stripped skin from patients with AD was more similar to lesional skin than to nonlesional skin of patients with psoriasis, which showed larger differentiation from lesions. AD and psoriasis tissues shared increases in levels of dendritic cell and T-cell markers (CD3, ITGAX/CD11c, and CD83), but AD tissues showed preferential TH2 skewing (IL-13, CCL17/TARC, and CCL18), whereas psoriasis was characterized by higher levels of expression of TH17-related (IL-17A/F and IL-36A/IL-36G), TH1-related (IFN-Î³ and CXCL9/CXCL10), and innate immunity-related (nitric oxide synthase 2/inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-17C) products (FDR < 0.05). Terminal differentiation (FLG2 and LCE5A), tight junction (CLDN8), and lipid biosynthesis and metabolism (FA2H and ALOXE3) products were significantly downregulated in both AD and psoriasis (FDR < 0.05). Nitric oxide synthase 2/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (determined by quantitative PCR) differentiated AD and psoriasis with 100% accuracy. CONCLUSION: RNA-seq tape strip profiling detected distinct immune and barrier signatures in lesional and nonlesional AD and psoriasis skin, suggesting their utility as a minimally invasive alternative to biopsies for detecting disease biomarkers.","He, Helen; Bissonnette, Robert; Wu, Jianni; Diaz, Aisleen; Saint-Cyr Proulx, Etienne; Maari, Catherine; Jack, Carolyn; Louis, Maudeline; Estrada, Yeriel; Krueger, James G; Zhang, Ning; Pavel, Ana B; Guttman-Yassky, Emma",J. allergy clin. immunol,,317

275276,COVID-19 and mortality in doctors,2020,"Background: The University of Cincinnati Stroke Team provides acute stroke care to the southwest Ohio, northern Kentucky, and southeast Indiana catchment area of ∼2 million people and 30 healthcare facilities. We previously published a significant decline in stroke activations and reperfusion treatment (IV thrombolysis and EVT) rates following state announcements of COVID-19 mitigation measures. Here, we update these trends after state reopening guidelines. Methods: We compared Stroke Team activations and reperfusion treatments logged in a prospectively collected database, comparing the same period in 2020 versus 2019. Kentucky and Ohio announced school and restaurant closures on March 12 and 13, respectively, followed by Indiana. A stepwise reopening of our tristate area started on May 1, 2020. We also compared trends in activations and treatment rates before (Weeks 1-10), during (Weeks 11-17), and after (Weeks 18- 26) the lifting of COVID-19 mitigation efforts using the Poisson test, and graphically with segmented regression analysis. Results: Compared to 2019, stroke team activations declined by 12% in 2020 (95% CI 7 - 16%;p&lt;0.01). During 2020, an initial decline in stroke activations following COVID-19 mitigation announcements was followed by a 28% increase in activations after reopening (Weeks 18-26: 95% CI 15 - 42%;p&lt;0.01). In contrast, compared to 2019, treatment rates were unchanged (0%, 95% CI -15 - 18%;p=1.00), including specifically IV thrombolysis and thrombectomy rates. Similarly, an initial decline in reperfusion treatments was followed by a 24% nonsignificant increase after reopening (95% CI -10 - 71%;p=0.19) in 2020. Conclusion: The initial decline in stroke team activations during COVID-19 mitigation efforts was followed by an increase in activations after reopening. Hospital capacity and 911 services remained fully intact, suggesting that the reduction in activations were related to reduced presentation by patients for emergent stroke care.(Figure Presented).","Sayles, E.; Hsiao, J.; Sucharew, H.; Antzoulatos, E.; Stanton, R.

Our objective was to evaluate the difference in D-dimer values of subjects infected with COVID-19 in those with PE and those without and to analyze the predictive value of D-dimer for PE in these subjects based on the day of D-dimer determination. This was an observational, retrospective study, conducted at a tertiary hospital. All subjects with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection requiring hospital admission at our institution between the months of March and April 2020 were included in the study. We compared D-dimer levels in subjects who went on to develop a PE and those who did not. We then created a model to predict the subsequent development of a PE with the current D-dimer levels of the subject. D-dimer levels changed over time from COVID-19 diagnosis, but were always higher in subjects who went on to develop a PE. Regarding the predictive model created, the area under the curve of the ROC analyses of the cross-validation predictions was 0.72. The risk of pulmonary embolism for the same D-dimer levels varied depending on the number of days elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and D-dimer determination. To conclude, D-dimer levels were elevated in subjects with a COVID-19 infection, especially in those with PE. D-dimer levels increased during the first 10 days after the diagnosis of the infection and can be used to predict the risk of PE in COVID-19 subjects.","Garcia-Olivé, Ignasi; Sintes, Helena; Radua, Joaquim; Deportos, Jordi; Nogueira, Isabel; Morales-Indiano, Cristian; Abad Capa, Jorge; Rosell, Antoni",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,317

This study aims to identify specific lab markers, complications, and treatments that may be associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. This study is retrospective in nature; it included 217 COVID-19 positive patients who were admitted to a ProMedica Health System hospital in Northwest Ohio, United States, between March 25 and June 16, 2020. We collected various laboratory values, complications, and treatment courses. T test and &#967;2 analyses were used to predict mortality. COVID-19 test was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction. Of 217 patients included in the study, the mean age of the population was 63.13 (SD, 17.8), of which 194 (89.4%, mean age 61.7 years) survived while 23 (10.6%, mean age 74.6 years) died. Among them, 53% were females and 47% male. Laboratory values that were associated with mortality were low hemoglobin (p = .0046), elevated INR (p = .0005), low platelets (p = .0246) and elevated procalcitonin (p = .0472). Marginally significant laboratory values included elevated troponin (p = .0661), and elevated creatinine (p = .0741). Treatment with either antibiotic, antifungals, antivirals, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation were all statistically significant for mortality. COVID-19 related complications with either ARDS, myocarditis, elevated INR, septic shock, or age greater than 63 were significant predictors of mortality. Low hemoglobin, elevated INR, Low platelet, elevated procalcitonin, treated with either antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, blood transfusion, steroids, and intubation are associated with high mortality related to COVID-19 infection. Healthcare professionals must be aware of these predictors.","Merugu, Ganesh Prasad; Neishwat, Zeid; Balla, Mamtha; Patel, Mitra; Fatima, Rawish; Sheikh, Taha; Kotturi, Vinay; Bommana, Venugopala; Pulagam, Gautham; Kaminski, Brian",J. med. virol,,317

OBJECTIVES: We assess the prevalence of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with seasonal respiratory viruses, document the respiratory viruses detected among individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, and describe characteristics of individuals with respiratory virus co-infection detected. METHODS: Specimens included in this study were submitted as part of routine clinical testing to Public Health Ontario Laboratory from individuals requiring testing for SARS-CoV-2 and/or seasonal respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Co-infection was detected in a smaller proportion (2.5%) of individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 than those with seasonal respiratory viruses (4.3%); this difference was not significant. Individuals with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to be younger than 65 years of age and male than those with single infection. Those with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection manifested mostly mild respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study may not support routine testing for seasonal respiratory viruses among all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, as they were rare during the study period nor associated with severe disease. However, testing for seasonal respiratory viruses should be performed in severely ill individuals, in which detection of other viruses may assist with patient management.","Peci, Adriana; Tran, Vanessa; Guthrie, Jennifer L; Li, Ye; Nelson, Paul; Schwartz, Kevin L; Eshaghi, AliReza; Buchan, Sarah A; Gubbay, Jonathan B",Viruses,,317

This article provides a critical review and synthesis of scientific knowledge on the number concentrations, size distributions, composition, mixing state, and related properties of respiratory particles emitted upon breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing. We derive and present a parameterization of respiratory particle size distributions based on five lognormal modes related to different origins in the respiratory tract, which can be used to trace and localize the sources of infectious particles. This approach may support the medical treatment as well as the risk assessment for aerosol and droplet transmission of infectious diseases. It was applied to analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of specific pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

282598,"Caring for critically ill adults in paediatric intensive care units in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: planning, implementation and lessons for the future",2021,"A self-administered validated (Cronbach's alpha=0.077) questionnaire was used to assess knowledge, attitude and practice among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Pakistan regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Findings showed that HCWs have good knowledge (93.2%, N=386), a positive attitude [mean 8.43 (standard deviation 1.78)] and good practice (88.7%, N=367) regarding COVID-19. HCWs perceived that limited infection control material (50.7%, N=210) and poor knowledge regarding transmission (40.6%, N=168) were the major barriers to infection control. Regression analysis indicated that pharmacists were more likely to demonstrate good practice than other HCWs (odds ratio 2.247, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.55, P=0.025). This study found that HCWs in Pakistan have good knowledge, but there are gaps in specific aspects of knowledge and practice that warrant attention.","Saqlain, M; Munir, M M; Rehman, S U; Gulzar, A; Naz, S; Ahmed, Z; Tahir, A H; Mashhood, M",J Hosp Infect,,317

In this context, the present study employed an in silico approach to assess the inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals obtained from GC-MS analysis of twelve Clerodendrum species against the imperative spike protein, main protease enzyme Mpro and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive molecular docking investigation of the phytocompounds at the active binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed promising inhibitory potential of the phytochemicals taraxerol, friedelin and stigmasterol. Decent physicochemical attributes of the compounds in accordance with Lipinski's rule of five and Veber's rule further established them as potential therapeutic candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding free energy estimation revealed that taraxerol was the most promising candidate displaying the highest binding efficacy with all the concerned SARS-CoV-2 proteins included in the present analysis. Our observations were supported by robust molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of the viral proteins with taraxerol for a timescale of 40 nanoseconds. It was striking to note that taraxerol exhibited better binding energy scores with the concerned viral proteins than the drugs that are specifically targeted against them. The present results promise to provide new avenues to further evaluate the potential of the phytocompound taraxerol in vitro and in vivo towards its successful deployment as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor and combat the catastrophic COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AIM: To explore health and social care professionals' experiences of providing end of life care during the COVID-19 pandemic to help inform current/future clinical practice and policy. DESIGN: A qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen health and social care professionals working across a range of clinical settings in supporting dying patients during the first wave (March-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Participants reported emotional and practical challenges to providing end of life care during the pandemic, including increases in patient numbers, reduced staffing levels and relying on virtual platforms for sensitive, emotive conversations with relatives. Participants were central to promoting connections between patients and their families at end of life and creating opportunities for a final contact before the death. However, the provision of support varied as a consequence of the pressures of the pandemic. Results are discussed under two themes: (1) challenges and facilitators to providing end of life care, and (2) support needs of relatives when a family member was dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a need for flexible visiting arrangements at end of life during a pandemic. A systems-level approach is necessary to promote the wellbeing of health and social care professionals providing end of life care during and after a pandemic.","Hanna, Jeffrey R; Rapa, Elizabeth; Dalton, Louise J; Hughes, Rosemary; Quarmby, Louise M; McGlinchey, Tamsin; Donnellan, Warren J; Bennett, Kate M; Mayland, Catriona R; Mason, Stephen R",Palliat Med,,317

299652,On the Front Lines of Pediatric Complex Care: Are We Preparing Emergency Medicine Residents?,2020,"ABSTRACT: Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, considerable attention has been paid on its epidemiology and clinical characteristics in children patients. However, it is also crucial for clinicians to summarize and investigate the co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 in children.We retrospectively reviewed the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients in co-infection group (CI, nâ=â27) and single infection group (SI, nâ=â54). Samples were tested for multiple pathogens.A high incidence (27/81, 33%) of co-infection in children with COVID-19 was revealed. The most frequent co-infected pathogen was mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP, 20/81, 25%), followed by virus (6/81, 7%), and bacteria (4/81, 5%). No significant difference in clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, or hospital stay was observed between the patients with co-infections and those with monomicrobial, only lower in white blood cell counts (CI: 5.54â±â0.36 vs SI: 7.38â±â0.37, Pâ=â.002), neutrophil counts (CI: 2.20â±â0.20 vs SI: 2.92â±â0.23, Pâ=â.024) and lymphocyte counts (CI: 2.72â±â0.024 vs SI: 3.87â±â0.28, Pâ=â.006). Compared with the patients with monomicrobial, chest imaging of those with co-infections showed consolidation in more cases (CI: 29.6% vs SI: 11.1%, Pâ=â.038) and duration of positive in nucleic acid was shorter (CI: 6.69â±â0.82 vs SI: 9.69â±â0.74, Pâ=â.015).Co-infection was relatively common in children with COVID-19, almost 1/3 had co-infection, most commonly caused by MP. Co-infection did not cause a significant exacerbation in clinical manifestations.","Li, Ying; Wang, Haizhou; Wang, Fan; Lu, Xiaoxia; Du, Hui; Xu, Jiali; Han, Feng; Zhang, Liqiong; Zhang, Maorong",Medicine (Baltimore),,317
300078,Short term follow-up of patients presenting with acute onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis during an episode of COVID-19,2020,"Being a typical ground-breeding bird of the agricultural landscape in Germany, the pheasant has experienced a strong and persistent population decline with a hitherto unexplained cause Contributing factors to the ongoing negative trend, such as the effects of pesticides, diseases, predation, increase in traffic and reduced fallow periods, are currently being controversially discussed In the present study, 62 free-ranging pheasant chicks were caught within a two-year period in three federal states of Germany;Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein The pheasant chicks were divided into three age groups to detect differences in their development and physical constitution In addition, pathomorphological, parasitological, virological, bacteriological and toxicological investigations were performed The younger chicks were emaciated, while the older chicks were of moderate to good nutritional status However, the latter age group was limited to a maximum of three chicks per hen, while the youngest age class comprised up to ten chicks The majority of chicks suffered from dermatitis of the periocular and caudal region of the head (57-94%) of unknown origin In addition, intestinal enteritis (100%), pneumonia (26%), hepatitis (24%), perineuritis (6%), tracheitis (24%), muscle degeneration (1%) and myositis (1%) were found In 78% of the cases, various Mycoplasma spp were isolated Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) was not detected using an MG-specific PCR Parasitic infections included Philopteridae (55%), Coccidia (48%), Heterakis/Ascaridia spp (8%) and Syngamus trachea (13%) A total of 8% of the chicks were Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) positive using RT-PCR, 16% positive for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) using RT-PCR, and 2% positive for haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) using PCR All samples tested for avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) or infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were negative The pool samples of the ten chicks were negative for all acid, alkaline-free and derivative substances, while two out of three samples tested were positive for the herbicide glyphosate Pheasant chick deaths may often have been triggered by poor nutritional status, probably in association with inflammatory changes in various tissues and organs as well as bacterial and parasitic pathogens Theses impacts may have played a major role in the decline in pheasant populations","Liebing, J.; Volker, I.; Curland, N.; Wohlsein, P.; Baumgartner, W.; Braune, S.; Runge, M.; Moss, A.; Rautenschlein, S.; Jung, A.; Ryll, M.; Raue, K.; Strube, C.; Schulz, J.; Heffels-Redmann, U.; Fischer, L.; Gethoffer, F.; Voigt, U.; Lierz, M.; Siebert, U.",PLoS ONE,,317

As of 11 August 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases worldwide had reached 19 million, with 700,000 reported deaths, indicating this pandemic's significant global impact. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the application of rehabilitation therapy in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Springer, CNKI, and Wanfang Data of database up to 1 August 2020. The search terms included the English terms and their Chinese equivalents: 'COVID-19,' 'ARDS,' 'rehabilitation,' 'critically ill patients,' 'physiotherapy,' 'respiratory rehabilitation,' 'traditional Chinese medicine,' and 'psychotherapy.' EXPERT OPINION: Rehabilitation research concerning patients with COVID-19 remains ongoing. Rehabilitation guidance for such patients with COVID-19 is based on previous experience. However, as different patients have differing degrees of dysfunction, personalized plans need to be designed according to the patients' age, sex, lifestyle, hobbies, occupation, and physical conditions. The rapid development of remote devices that can monitor patients' real-time physical conditions post-discharge may encourage better adherence to rehabilitation training.","Sun, Tiantian; Guo, Liyun; Tian, Fei; Dai, Tiantian; Xing, Xiaohong; Zhao, Junqing; Li, Qiang",Expert Rev Respir Med,,317

METHOD: it consists of a qualitative study, whose data collection was done through interviews with nurses who represent the management of health care network in the region. The analysis technique used was the Discourse of the Collective Subject (DCS). RESULTS: the legacy of Florence Nightingale to contemporary nursing practice; the weaknesses and the technical operational capacity with which nursing faces in the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS); the strategies for strengthening the Unified Health System and qualification of nursing practices; and the potentialities identified in the pandemic scenario were the main ideas that emerged. In the bicentennial year of Florence Nightingale, nurses recognize her legacy to public health practice and management. Several variables interfere in professional practice, such as epidemiological aspects, working conditions, and care management in a pandemic. CONCLUSION: the pandemic scenario has taken nursing to a position of practical and scientific protagonism as a result of its proactivity and leadership in the search for knowledge based on scientific evidence.","Geremia, Daniela Savi; Vendruscolo, Carine; Celuppi, Ianka Cristina; Adamy, Edlamar Kátia; Toso, Beatriz Rosana Gonçalves de Oliveira; Souza, Jeane Barros de",Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,,317

309318,Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on glycaemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes: the glycalock study,2021,"According to WHO statistics, there are more than 204,617,027 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 4,323,247 deaths worldwide till August 12, 2021. During the coronavirus epidemic, almost everyone wears a facial mask. Traditionally, face recognition approaches process mostly non-occluded faces, which include primary facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Removing the mask for authentication in airports or laboratories will increase the risk of virus infection, posing a huge challenge to current face recognition systems. Due to the sudden outbreak of the epidemic, there are yet no publicly available real-world masked face recognition (MFR) benchmark. To cope with the above-mentioned issue, we organize the Face Bio-metrics under COVID Workshop and Masked Face Recognition Challenge in ICCV 2021. Enabled by the ultra-large-scale WebFace260M benchmark and the Face Recognition Under Inference Time conStraint (FRUITS) protocol, this challenge (WebFace260M Track) aims to push the frontiers of practical MFR. Since public evaluation sets are mostly saturated or contain noise, a new test set is gathered consisting of elaborated 2,478 celebrities and 60,926 faces. Meanwhile, we collect the world-largest real-world masked test set. In the first phase of WebFace260M Track, 69 teams (total 833 solutions) participate in the challenge and 49 teams exceed the performance of our baseline. There are second phase of the challenge till October 1, 2021 and on-going leaderboard.

Social scientists have rarely studied face mask wearing, leaving little guidance for methods to encourage these behaviours. In the current article, we provide an approach to address this issue by developing the 32-item and 8-dimension Face Mask Perceptions Scale (FMPS). We begin by developing an over-representative item list in a qualitative study, wherein participants' responses are used to develop items to ensure content relevance. This item list is then reduced via exploratory factor analysis in a second study, and the eight dimensions of the scale are supported. We also support the validity of the FMPS, as the scale significantly relates to both face mask wearing and health perceptions. We lastly confirm the factor structure of the FMPS in a third study via confirmatory factor analysis. From these efforts, we identify an avenue that social scientists can aid in preventing coronavirus and illness more broadly - by studying face mask perceptions and behaviours.","Howard, Matt C",Br J Health Psychol,,317

As for governments and security agencies, the extent of the outbreak is a major concern regarding possible usage of bioweapons. As a result, a reflection on the existing forensic tools forms the basis of further research on the issue. Hence, an improvements on the application of bioinformatics in forensic investigations is a major area of concern for many medical and forensic researchers. This paper explores the advancements in bioinformatics as a forensic tool amid the developments in current novel coronavirus outbreak. Considering that there is limited resources to conduct a primary research on the novel coronavirus and the Covid-19 disease, a systematic review of the existing research is best suited for the research. Therefore, the research involves a review of the past research on bioinformatics and forensic investigations and its relations to the ongoing research on the novel coronavirus. © 2020, Journal of Indian Academy of Forensic Medicine.

It is obvious to healthcare workers and policymakers alike that an effective critical care surge response must be nested within the overall care delivery model. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted key elements of emergency preparedness. These include having national or regional strategic reserves of personal protective equipment, intensive care unit (ICU) devices, consumables and pharmaceuticals, as well as effective supply chains and efficient utilization protocols. ICUs must also be prepared to accommodate surges of patients and ICU staffing models should allow for fluctuations in demand. Pre-existing ICU triage and end-of-life care principles should be established, implemented and updated. Daily workflow processes should be restructured to include remote connection with multidisciplinary healthcare workers and frequent communication with relatives. The pandemic has also demonstrated the benefits of digital transformation and the value of remote monitoring technologies, such as wireless monitoring. Finally, the pandemic has highlighted the value of pre-existing epidemiological registries and agile randomized controlled platform trials in generating fast, reliable data.

We assessed our compliance with 'BOAST COVID-19 standards', whether it is possible to run a safe and effective paediatric orthopaedic service. Method: We performed a prospective audit of clinic and theatre data (16th March to 30th April 2020), from the paediatric orthopaedic department at the BRCH against the 'BOAST COVID-19 standards'. We also performed a retrospective audit. Results: Patients booked into acute fracture clinic (AFC) and fracture clinic follow-up (FFO) reduced by 40% and 48% respectively from 2019 to 2020. A virtual fracture clinic (VFC) was implemented with an increasing trend seen. The number of patient initiated follow-up appointments increased in AFC and FFO from 16% to 75% and 12% to 35% respectively. Radiography was reduced;only 17% and 39% of AFC and FFO patients respectively required radiographs. On-call referrals and trauma cases dropped by 50% with similar case mix year-on-year. All elective operating was cancelled in 2020. Conclusions: By reducing clinic admissions and theatre throughput, it was possible to run an effective paediatric orthopaedic service in a busy tertiary referral centre. Our aim now is to determine the longterm efficacy, cost, and sustainability of our COVID-19 service.","Benning, M.

318269,Patterns of repeated diagnostic testing for COVID19 in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes,2020,"This paper describes a patient who developed diffuse and symmetrical muscle weakness after a long stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The patient underwent a neurophysiological protocol, including nerve conduction studies, concentric needle electromyography (EMG) of the proximal and distal muscles, and direct muscle stimulation (DMS). Nerve conduction studies showed normal sensory conduction and low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). EMG revealed signs of myopathy, which were more pronounced in the lower limbs. The post-DMS CMAP was absent in the quadriceps and of reduced amplitude in the tibialis anterior muscle. Based on these clinical and neurophysiological findings, a diagnosis of critical illness myopathy was made according to the current diagnostic criteria. Given the large number of patients with COVID-19 who require long ICU stays, many are very likely to develop ICU-acquired weakness, as did the patient described here. Health systems must plan to provide adequate access to rehabilitative facilities for both pulmonary and motor rehabilitative treatment after COVID-19.","Bagnato, Sergio; Boccagni, Cristina; Marino, Giorgio; Prestandrea, Caterina; D039,; Agostino, Tiziana; Rubino, Francesca",Int J Infect Dis,,317

We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY: In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Melita, Helen",Curr Opin Cardiol,,317

Therefore, whether the burden of COVID-19 is falling disproportionately on the shoulders of particular demographic groups is relatively unknown. In this article, we first provide an overview of the available geographic and demographic data related to COVID-19. We then make creative use of these existing data to fill the vacuum and identify key demographic risk factors for COVID-19 across Canada's health regions. Drawing on COVID-19 counts and tabular census data, we examine the association between communities' demographic composition and the number of COVID-19 infections. COVID-19 infections are higher in communities with larger shares of Black and low-income residents. Our approach offers a way for researchers and policymakers to use existing data to identify communities nationwide that are vulnerable to the pandemic in the absence of more detailed demographic and more granular geographic data.","Choi, Kate H; Denice, Patrick; Haan, Michael; Zajacova, Anna",Can. rev. sociol.

321573,Masks Reduce Viral Inoculum of SARS-CoV2,2021,"Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Formulation of a polysaccharide-based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;-carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS-CoV-2.","Moakes, Richard J A; Davies, Scott P; Stamataki, Zania; Grover, Liam M",Adv Mater,,317

336425,Of Masks and Methods,2021,"ObjectivesTo determine the prevalence and predictors of self-reported access to appropriate personal protective equipment (aPPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) during the first UK national COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020) and at the time of questionnaire response (December 2020 - February 2021). DesignTwo cross sectional analyses using data from a questionnaire-based cohort study. SettingNationwide questionnaire from 4th December 2020 to 28th February 2021. ParticipantsA representative sample of HCWs or ancillary workers in a UK healthcare setting aged 16 or over, registered with one of seven main UK healthcare regulatory bodies. Main outcome measureBinary measure of self-reported aPPE (access all of the time vs access most of the time or less frequently) at two timepoints: the first national lockdown in the UK (primary analysis) and at the time of questionnaire response (secondary analysis). Results10,508 HCWs were included in the primary analysis, and 12,252 in the secondary analysis. 3702 (35.2%) of HCWs reported aPPE at all times in the primary analysis; 6806 (83.9%) reported aPPE at all times in the secondary analysis. After adjustment (for age, sex, ethnicity, migration status, occupation, aerosol generating procedure exposure, work sector, work region, working hours, night shift frequency and trust in employing organisation), older HCWs (per decade increase in age: aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16-1.26, p<0.001) and those working in Intensive Care Units (1.61, 1.38 - 1.89, p<0.001) were more likely to report aPPE at all times. Those from Asian ethnic groups compared to White (0.77, 0.67-0.89, p<0.001), those in allied health professional (AHPs) and dental roles (vs those in medical roles; AHPs: 0.77, 0.68 - 0.87, p<0.001; dental: 0.63, 0.49-0.81, p<0.001), and those who saw a higher number of COVID-19 patients compared to those who saw none ([≥]21 patients 0.74, 0.61-0.90, p=0.003) were less likely to report aPPE at all times in the primary analysis. aPPE at all times was also not uniform across UK regions (reported access being better in South West and North East England than London). Those who trusted their employing organisation to deal with concerns about unsafe clinical practice, compared to those who did not, were twice as likely to report aPPE at all times (2.18, 1.97-2.40, p<0.001). With the exception of occupation, these factors were also significantly associated with aPPE at all times in the secondary analysis. ConclusionsWe found that only a third of HCWs in the UK reported aPPE at all times during the period of the first lockdown and that aPPE had improved later in the pandemic. We also identified key sociodemographic and occupational determinants of aPPE during the first UK lockdown, the majority of which have persisted since lockdown was eased. These findings have important public health implications for HCWs, particularly as cases of infection and long-COVID continue to rise in the UK. Trial registrationISRCTN 11811602 What is already known on this topicAccess to personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucial to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from infection. Limited data exist concerning the prevalence of, and factors relating to, PPE access for HCWs in the United Kingdom (UK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. What this study addsOnly a third of HCWs reported having access to appropriate PPE all of the time during the first UK national lockdown. Older HCWs, those working in Intensive Care Units and those who trusted their employing organisation to deal with concerns about unsafe clinical practice, were more likely to report access to adequate PPE.

336427,Of Masks and Methods,2020,"The brain undergoes extensive structural changes during adolescence, concurrent to puberty-related physical and hormonal changes. While animal research suggests these biological processes are related to one another, our knowledge of brain development in humans is largely based on age-related processes. Thus, the current study characterized puberty-related changes in human brain structure, by combining data from two longitudinal neuroimaging cohorts. Beyond normative changes in cortical thickness, we examined whether individual differences in the rate of pubertal maturation (or ""pubertal tempo"") was associated with variations in cortical trajectories. Participants (Nâ¯=â¯192; scansâ¯=â¯366) completed up to three waves of MRI assessments between 8.5 and 14.5 years of age, as well as questionnaire assessments of pubertal stage at each wave. Generalized additive mixture models were used to characterize trajectories of cortical development. Results revealed widespread linear puberty-related changes across much of the cortex. Many of these changes, particularly within the frontal and parietal cortices, were independent of age-related development. Males exhibiting faster pubertal tempo demonstrated greater thinning in the precuneus and frontal cortices than same-aged and -sex peers. Findings suggest that the unique influence of puberty on cortical development may be more extensive than previously identified, and also emphasize important individual differences in the coupling of these developmental processes.","Vijayakumar, Nandita; Youssef, George; Allen, Nicholas B; Anderson, Vicki; Efron, Daryl; Hazell, Philip; Mundy, Lisa; Nicholson, Jan M; Patton, George; Seal, Marc L; Simmons, Julian G; Whittle, Sarah; Silk, Tim",Neuroimage,,317

OBJECTIVE: Evaluate neighborhood-level deprivation and English language proficiency effect on disproportionate outcomes seen in racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Health records of 12 Midwest hospitals and 60 clinics in Minnesota between March 4, 2020, and August 19, 2020 PATIENTS: Polymerase chain reaction-positive COVID-19 patients EXPOSURES: Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and primary language MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity, using hospitalization within 45 days of diagnosis as a marker of severity. Logistic and competing-risk regression models assessed the effects of neighborhood-level deprivation (using the ADI) and primary language. Within race, effects of ADI and primary language were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 5577 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were included; 866 (n = 15.5%) were hospitalized within 45 days of diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (60.9 vs. 40.4 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be male (n = 425 [49.1%] vs. 2049 [43.5%], p = 0.002). Of those requiring hospitalization, 43.9% (n = 381), 19.9% (n = 172), 18.6% (n = 161), and 11.8% (n = 102) were White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic, respectively. Independent of ADI, minority race/ethnicity was associated with COVID-19 severity: Hispanic patients (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.72-5.30), Asians (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.74-3.29), and Blacks (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15-1.94). ADI was not associated with hospitalization. Non-English-speaking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.51-2.43) significantly increased odds of hospital admission across and within minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: Minority populations have increased odds of severe COVID-19 independent of neighborhood deprivation, a commonly suspected driver of disparate outcomes. Non-English-speaking accounts for differences across and within minority populations. These results support the ongoing need to determine the mechanisms that contribute to disparities during COVID-19 while also highlighting the underappreciated role primary language plays in COVID-19 severity among minority groups.","Ingraham, Nicholas E; Purcell, Laura N; Karam, Basil S; Dudley, R Adams; Usher, Michael G; Warlick, Christopher A; Allen, Michele L; Melton, Genevieve B; Charles, Anthony; Tignanelli, Christopher J",J. gen. intern. med,,317

We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in critically ill COVID-19 patients both at the acute and recovery phases of infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study including critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation discharged alive from a medical ICU of a university hospital. We collected demographic, anthropometric and ICU stay data (SAPS2, recourse to organ support and daily energy intake). Nutritional status and nutritional support were collected at one month after ICU discharge (M1) by phone interview and at 3 months after ICU discharge (M3) during a specialized and dedicated consultation conducted by a dietitian. Malnutrition diagnosis was based on weight loss and body mass index (BMI) criteria following the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition. Primary outcome was the prevalence of malnutrition at M3 and secondary outcomes were the evolution of nutritional status from ICU admission to M3 and factors associated with malnutrition at M3. RESULTS: From march 13th to may 15th, 2020, 38 patients were discharged alive from the ICU, median [IQR] age 66 [59-72] years, BMI 27.8 [25.5-30.7] kg/m2 and SAPS2 47 [35-55]. Thirty-three (86%) patients were followed up to M3. Prevalence of malnutrition increased during the ICU stay, from 18% at ICU admission to 79% at ICU discharge and then decreased to 71% at M1 and 53% at M3. Severe malnutrition prevailed at ICU discharge with a prevalence of 55% decreasing 32% at M3. At M3, the only factors associated with malnutrition in univariate analysis were the length of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay (28 [18-44] vs. 13 [11-24] days, P = 0.011 and 32 [22-48] vs. 17 [11-21] days, P = 0.006, respectively), while no ICU preadmission and admission factors, nor energy and protein intakes distinguished the two groups. Only 35% of undernourished patients at M3 had benefited from a nutritional support. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is frequent, protracted and probably underrecognized among critically ill Covid-19 patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation with more than half patients still being undernourished three months after ICU discharge. A particular attention should be paid to the nutritional status of these patients not only during their ICU stay but also following ICU discharge.","Rives-Lange, C; Zimmer, A; Merazka, A; Carette, C; Martins-Bexinga, A; Hauw-Berlemont, C; Guerot, E; Jannot, A S; Diehl, J L; Czernichow, S; Hermann, B",Clin. nutr.

348758,Metabolic consequences of obesity and type 2 diabetes: Balancing genes and environment for personalized care,2021,"BACKGROUND: Real-time surveillance in the field of health informatics has emerged as a growing domain of interest among worldwide researchers. Evolution in this field has helped in the introduction of various initiatives related to public health informatics. Surveillance systems in the area of health informatics utilizing social media information have been developed for early prediction of disease outbreaks and to monitor diseases. In the past few years, the availability of social media data, particularly Twitter data, enabled real-time syndromic surveillance that provides immediate analysis and instant feedback to those who are charged with follow-ups and investigation of potential outbreaks. In this paper, we review the recent work, trends, and machine learning(ML) text classification approaches used by surveillance systems seeking social media data in the healthcare domain. We also highlight the limitations and challenges followed by possible future directions that can be taken further in this domain. METHODS: To study the landscape of research in health informatics performing surveillance of the various health-related data posted on social media or web-based platforms, we present a bibliometric analysis of the 1240 publications indexed in multiple scientific databases (IEEE, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, PubMed) from the year 2010-2018. The papers were further reviewed based on the various machine learning algorithms used for analyzing health-related text posted on social media platforms. FINDINGS: Based on the corpus of 148 selected articles, the study finds the types of social media or web-based platforms used for surveillance in the healthcare domain, along with the health topic(s) studied by them. In the corpus of selected articles, we found 26 articles were using machine learning technique. These articles were studied to find commonly used ML techniques. The majority of studies (24%) focused on the surveillance of flu or influenza-like illness (ILI). Twitter (64%) is the most popular data source to perform surveillance research using social media text data, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (33%) being the most used ML algorithm for text classification. CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of online data in surveillance systems has improved the disease prediction ability over traditional syndromic surveillance systems. However, social media based surveillance systems have many limitations and challenges, including noise, demographic bias, privacy issues, etc. Our paper mentions future directions, which can be useful for researchers working in the area. Researchers can use this paper as a library for social media based surveillance systems in the healthcare domain and can expand such systems by incorporating the future works discussed in our paper.","Gupta, Aakansha; Katarya, Rahul",J Biomed Inform,,317

Although prion infections do not stimulate adaptive immune responses in infected individuals, the actions of certain immune cell populations can have a significant impact on disease pathogenesis. After infection, the targeting of peripherally-acquired prions to specific immune cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), such as the lymph nodes and spleen, is essential for the efficient transmission of disease to the brain. Once the prions reach the brain, interactions with other immune cell populations can provide either host protection or accelerate the neurodegeneration. In this review, we provide a detailed account of how factors such as inflammation, ageing and pathogen co-infection can affect prion disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. For example, we discuss how changes to the abundance, function and activation status of specific immune cell populations can affect the transmission of prion diseases by peripheral routes. We also describe how the effects of systemic inflammation on certain glial cell subsets in the brains of infected individuals can accelerate the neurodegeneration. A detailed understanding of the factors that affect prion disease transmission and pathogenesis is essential for the development of novel intervention strategies.","Mabbott, Neil A; Bradford, Barry M; Pal, Reiss; Young, Rachel; Donaldson, David S",Int. j. mol. sci.

ACE-2 is a type I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells, alveolar type 2 lung epithelial cells, renal tubular epithelium, Leydig cells in testes and gastrointestinal tract. ACE2 mediates the interaction between host cells and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. However, ACE2 is not only a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, but it has also an important homeostatic function regulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is pivotal for both the cardiovascular and immune systems. Therefore, ACE2 is the key link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and immune response. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 seems to be tightly associated with ACE2 availability, which in turn is determined by genetics, age, gender and comorbidities. Severe COVID-19 is due to an uncontrolled and excessive immune response, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. In spite of a lower ACE2 expression on cells surface, patients with CVDs have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate, which is likely driven by the imbalance between ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) protein (which is required for cleavage of ACE-2 ectodomain resulting in increased ACE2 shedding), and TMPRSS2 (which is required for spike glycoprotein priming).

We found that T cells, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, were significantly decreased in severe COVID-19 symptoms but not in mild symptoms, in comparison with healthy people. T cells remained at a low level after recovery from severe COVID-19. CD4+CD25+CD127low Treg-enriched cells were significantly increased in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, regardless of recovery or not. Moreover, in either mild or severe COVID-19 patients, Treg-enriched cells up-regulated CD25 and down-regulated CD127. After recovery, CD25 was partially down-regulated but still higher than the normal level, while CD127 returned to the normal level in mild patients but not severe patients. B cells were decreased in mild patients and further decreased in severe patients, and remained low after recovery. NK cells were decreased only in severe COVID-19, with a tendency to return to the normal level after recovery. Plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were both elevated in severe patients but not in mild patients. After recovery, IL-6 remained higher than its normal level, while IL-10 returned to the normal level. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that CD4+ T cells, B cells, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Therefore, these parameters are indicators of COVID-19 severity.

Recent findings from Uganda show that medical staff members have sufficient knowledge but poor attitudes toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness/practices of lecturers and students in the fight against COVID-19. Method: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 103 lecturers and students both men and women of age group 18 to 69 years in western Uganda. Data were obtained through a pretested questionnaire availed online. Results: Knowledge on COVID-19 symptoms was highest in this order: fever &gt; dry cough &gt; difficulty breathing &gt; fatigue &gt; headache with no significant differences between lecturers and students. Knowledge of participants on transmission of COVID-19 was highest in the order of cough drops &gt; contaminated surfaces &gt; person-to-person contact &gt; asymptomatic persons &gt; airborne &gt; zoonotic with no significant differences among lecturers and students. Lecturers and students were all willing to continue using personal protective equipment like masks, and personal practices such as covering the mouth while sneezing and coughing, no handshaking, and washing of hands with no significant differences in the responses. The positive attitudes that COVID-19 could kill, anyone can get COVID-19, and willing to abide by the set regulations against the pandemic showed personal concerns and desired efforts against COVID-19. Conclusion: The study identifies lecturers and students as potential stakeholders in the fight against community transmission of COVID-19.","Echoru, Isaac; Kasozi, Keneth Iceland; Usman, Ibe Michael; Mutuku, Irene Mukenya; Ssebuufu, Robinson; Ajambo, Patricia Decanar; Ssempijja, Fred; Mujinya, Regan; Matama, Kevin; Musoke, Grace Henry; Ayikobua, Emmanuel Tiyo; Ninsiima, Herbert Izo; Dare, Samuel Sunday; Eze, Ejike Daniel; Bukenya, Edmund Eriya; Keyune Nambatya, Grace; MacLeod, Ewan; Welburn, Susan Christina",Heal.

357579,Temporary changes in clinical guidelines of gestational diabetes screening and management during COVID-19 outbreak: A narrative review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was noted that males seemed to have higher case-fatality rates than females. We examined the magnitude and consistency of the sex differences in age-specific case-fatality rates (CFRs) in seven countries. METHODS: Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the national official agencies from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, Canada and Mexico. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the seven countries, for all age-groups. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the age and country contribution to differences. RESULTS: The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 1.71, 1.88, 2.11, 2.11, 1.84, 1.78 and 1.49, for ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+ respectively. In meta-regression, age group and country were associated with the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences in the age-specific CFRs are intriguing. Sex differences in the incidence and mortality have been found in many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the consistently greater case-fatality rates in males at all ages suggests that sex-related factors impact on the natural history of the disease. This could provide important clues as to the mechanisms underlying the severity of COVID-19 in some patients.","Green, Manfred S; Nitzan, Dorit; Schwartz, Naama; Niv, Yaron; Peer, Victoria",PLoS One,,317

359749,Recommendations and management of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,2020,"RATIONALE: Severe cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are frequently associated with the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) which can be complicated by the appearance of pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum (PaoP). This single-network, multi-hospital study examines PaoP in a retrospective COVID-19 cohort, including patient characteristics and overall incidence. In addition, risk factor determination is conducted using case-matched COVID-19 controls, hypothesizing that the need for mechanical ventilation and pulmonary comorbidities are associated with PaoP. METHODS: This is an IRB-exempt, retrospective case-control study involving patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction and admitted to the hospital network 03/01/2020-11/30/2020. A total of 25 patients who developed PaoP were matched to COVID-19 patients without PaoP in 1:4 ratio according to age, gender and APACHE 2 score. Detailed chart review included patient demographics, BRIXIA, MuLBSTA, supplemental oxygen use, mechanical ventilation, inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, IL-6), pulmonary comorbidities (asthma, COPD, OSA, tobacco use), nonpulmonary comorbidities (diabetes, morbid obesity, malignancy, cardiovascular and renal diseases), and hospitalization characteristics (hospital length of stay or HLOS, ICU admission). Univariate results (Table 1) with significance level of P&lt;0.20 were included in subsequent binary logistic regression to determine factors independently associated with PaoP.RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were evaluated (25 PaoP cases and 100 matched controls). Group characteristics included median age of 72 years [IQR 58-80];84% male sex;56% Caucasian;Median APACHE II 15.6 [6.8-41.0]. There were no significant differences in terms of CRP, ferritin, or IL-6 between the two groups. Patients with PaoP underwent chest tube placement in 76% cases and had significantly higher mortality (68% vs. 43%, p&lt;0.025). In our multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with PaoP included longer hospitalization (OR 1.047, 95%CI 1.001-1.096) and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.271, 95%CI 1.066-10.035). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that longer HLOS and the requirement for mechanical ventilation are independently associated with PaoP. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that pulmonary comorbidities (asthma, COPD, OSA, tobacco use) are significantly associated with PaoP. This, combined with the finding that the level of PEEP did not appear to be a significant risk factor for PaoP, highlights the need for better understanding of the underlying pulmonary pathology. The current series is among the largest studies of this important phenomenon in COVID-19 patients, and provides important insight into our understanding of this rare but prognostically important complication.","Ernst, E.

362573,Web Exclusive. Annals Graphic Medicine - The Social Impact of COVID-19,2021,"During crises (major events characterised by uncertainty, urgency and threat), society must make sense of rapidly unfolding events. This happens mainly through narrativising-depicting a setting, characters and a meaningful sequence of events and actions unfolding over time. In the early months of the pandemic, UK general practice shifted from face-to-face consultations to a remote-by-default model (telephone, video or e-consultation). This shift was initially widely accepted by press and public, but support waned after a politician declared that the change would be permanent. We invoke Burke's dramatistic pentad of act, scene, agent, agency and purpose to theorise findings from a detailed analysis of media coverage of the remote-by-default policy and reactions to it. We consider the 12 weeks from March to June 2020 (first lockdown, when remote-by-default services had just been introduced) and 1 week from late July 2020 (following the ministerial announcement). The initial introduction of remote consulting had strong narrative coherence in which all parts of the pentad were balanced: scene (a deadly virus threatening the country) aligned with act (lockdown, including avoiding face-to-face appointments unless essential), agents (the National Health Service and digital technology as heroic macro-actors), agency (general practitioners 'deployed') and purpose (to control the pandemic). The later period, however, was characterised by a mismatch between scene (a country emerging from lockdown and resuming normal life), act (imposition of the remote model), agent (a politician known for his enthusiasm for technology), agency (top-down directive) and purpose (modernisation). Whereas media narratives in the first period aligned with the genre of heroic adventure (suggesting a worthy battle, bravely fought), those of the second had characteristics of farce (something both comic and grotesque). We conclude that close reading of media narratives may surface potential misalignments between policy decisions and the context in which they must be implemented.","Mroz, Gilly; Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Greenhalgh, Trisha",Med. humanit,,317

367319,Information Diet in Covid-19 Crisis;a Commentary,2020,"BACKGROUND: In August 2016, Ethiopia endorsed a universal ""test and treat"" strategy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) based on World Health Organization recommendation. However, there is limited evidence on the routine application of the same-day ""test and treat"" recommendation in low-income settings. This study assessed the effect of same-day treatment initiation on individual-level retention at 6- and 12-months follow-up. METHODS: A multicenter facility-based retrospective cohort study was conducted to compare retention-in-care between PLHIV who started antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the same-day and those started ART > 7 days following HIV diagnoses. Participants were at least 15 years-old and were newly diagnosed and started on ART between October 2016 and July 2018 in 11 health facilities in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Multivariable logistic regression controlling for potential confounders and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to assess differences in outcomes between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 433 PLHIV started ART on the same-day of diagnosis and 555 PLHIV who started ART > 7 days after HIV diagnosis were included in the study. At 6-months, 82.0% (355) in the same-day group vs 89.4% (496) in the > 7 days group were retained-in-care (absolute risk difference (RD) = 7.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-11.8%). At 12-months, 75.8% (328) in the same-day group vs 82.0% (455) in the > 7 days group were retained-in-care (absolute RD = 6.2%; 95% CI: 1.1, 11.4%). The major drop in retention was in the first 30 days following ART initiation among same-day group. After adjusting for baseline and non-baseline covariates, the same-day group was less likely to be retained-in-care at 6- and 12-months (adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.90 and adjusted RR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced retention-in-care can threaten the benefit of the same-day ""test and treat"" policy. The policy needs to be implemented cautiously with greater emphasis on assessment and preparation of PLHIV for ART to ensure treatment readiness before starting them on same-day ART and close monitoring of patients during early follow-up periods.","Ahmed, Ismael; Demissie, Meaza; Worku, Alemayehu; Gugsa, Salem; Berhane, Yemane",BMC Public Health,,317

372628,"In inpatients with COVID-19, none of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, or interferon ß-1a differed from standard care for in-hospital mortality",2021,"Background: In addition to its physical health benefits, physical activity is increasingly recognized as a means to support mental health. Regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is associated with improved mental well-being, reduced likelihood of developing mental illness, and improved symptom management. Despite these benefits, most people fail to achieve minimum recommended levels of MVPA. Population levels of physical activity have further declined since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of public health measures (e.g., shelter-in-place protocols). The potential impact of this decline on mental heath outcomes warrants ongoing investigation. Purpose: To investigate associations between changes in MVPA and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and life satisfaction) in adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Research followed a cross-sectional design. English-speaking adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire. MVPA was assessed retrospectively (before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19) with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Mental health was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-Item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 7-Item (GAD-7), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Regression was used to assess relationships between MVPA and mental health. ANOVA with follow-up tests examined whether participants who differed in mental health status (e.g., no symptoms vs. severe symptoms) differed in their change in MVPA. T-tests were used to examine differences in mental health symptomatology between participants who were sufficiently (i.e., achieving MVPA guidelines of &#8805; 150 min/week) vs. insufficiently active. Results: Prior to COVID-19, 68.2% of participants were classified as being sufficiently active, vs. 60.6% during COVID-19. The majority of participants reported experiencing some level of depressive symptoms (62.0%) or anxiety symptoms (53.7%). After controlling for covariates, changes in MVPA accounted for significant variability in the PHQ-9 (7.7%), GAD-7 (2.5%), and SWLS (1.5 %). Participants with clinically significant mental health symptomatology reported greater declines in MVPA than those who reported no symptoms. Conversely, participants who were sufficiently active during COVID-19 reported significantly lower depression and anxiety, and higher life satisfaction. Conclusion: Participants who experienced the greatest declines in MVPA reported relatively greater psychological distress and lower life satisfaction. While preliminary, these findings suggest the importance of maintaining and promoting physical activity during a period of pandemic.","Gierc, Madelaine; Riazi, Negin A; Fagan, Matthew James; Di Sebastiano, Katie M; Kandola, Mahabhir; Priebe, Carly S; Weatherson, Katie A; Wunderlich, Kelly B; Faulkner, Guy",Front Public Health,,317

With much effort, STEM courses made this change in modality;however, many laboratory skills, such as measurement and handling equipment, are more difficult to teach in an online learning environment. A cohort of instructors who are part of the NSF RCN-UBE funded Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM (STEM)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Network (a working group of faculty from two community colleges and three 4-year universities) analyzed introductory biology and chemistry courses to identify essential laboratory skills that students will need in advanced courses. Seven essential laboratory proficiencies were derived from reviewing disciplinary guiding documents such as AAAS Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education, the American Society for Microbiology Recommended Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Microbiology Education, and the American Chemical Society Guidelines for Chemistry: data analysis, scientific writing, proper handling and disposal of laboratory materials, discipline-specific techniques, measurement, lab safety and personal protective equipment, and interpersonal and collaborative skills. Our analysis has determined that some of these skills are difficult to develop in a remote or online setting but could be recovered with appropriate interventions. Skill recovery procedures suggested include a skills ""boot camp,"" department or college coordinated club events, and a triage course. The authors recommend that one of these three recovery mechanisms be offered to bridge this skill gap and better prepare STEM students for upper-level science courses and the real world.","Sonbuchner, T.

377866,Informed Consent-We Can and Should Do Better,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receiving tracheal intubation. METHODS: We analyzed clinical characteristics of 18 severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheal intubation. The general demographic and clinical data of the patients including their age, gender, pre- intubation state of consciousness and the ventilation mode were recorded. The anesthesiologists performing the tracheal intubation procedure evaluated and recorded the tracheal intubation conditions of the patients. The changes in the vital signs of the patients before anesthesia induction and after intubation were recorded. RESULTS: The average ages of these patients were 70.39±8.02 years. Fifteen patients (83.33%) received non- invasive ventilation before tracheal intubation, and 13 patients (72.22%) were conscious before tracheal intubation. After induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure and heart rate of the patients decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Most of the patients (94.44%) were in excellent or good conditions for tracheal intubation, and the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation was 100%. Five patients died within 3 weeks following the intubation. Tracheotomy was performed in one patient. Twelve patients were still on endotracheal mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit, and one of them received ECMO treatment due to poor oxygenation. A total of 16 experienced anesthesiologists participated in tracheal intubation, all with third-level protection during the operation, and no medical staff infection has been detected so far. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe and critical COVID-19 and indications of tracheal intubation, we recommend early intubation with invasive respiratory support to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce the mortality. Anesthetic agents should be used carefully during tracheal intubation to ensure patients' safety. The medical staff should have a high-level protection during the intubation to maximally ensure their safety.","Wang, Jiafang; Lu, Fan; Zhou, Mingxing; Qi, Zhong; Chen, Zhijun",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,317

379528,Correlations between IL-6 serum level and olfactory dysfunction severity in COVID-19 patients: a preliminary study,2021,"Respiratory complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 have claimed tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care patients eligible for ECMO.","Zhou, Helen; Cheng, Cheng; Lipton, Zachary C.; Chen, George H.; Weiss, Jeremy C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01898v1.pdf,317

Although centers maintained telephone contact, it quickly became evident that parents needed more detailed advice and guidance. Staff from 30 daycare centers volunteered to take part in a two-month online support and training course for 336 caregivers of children with ASD of different ages. In addition to the provision of visual and written information, synchronous video sessions were used to coach parents on the learning goals devised for the children. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to understand the acceptability of using telepractice and the outcomes achieved. A low dropout rate and positive feedback from parents indicated that they perceived telepractice sessions to be useful. The factors contributing to parents' satisfaction were identified. Although the use of telepractice would be a good alternative for caregivers in any future lockdowns, it could also be used in conjunction with daycare center services to encourage greater parental participation, or with families living in areas with no day centers. Further studies are needed to compare telepractice to usual daycare face-to-face interventions, and to document its impact and cost-effectiveness for parents and children.","Samadi, Sayyed Ali; Bakhshalizadeh-Moradi, Shahnaz; Khandani, Fatemeh; Foladgar, Mehdi; Poursaid-Mohammad, Maryam; McConkey, Roy",,,317
380012,COVID-19-obduktionen: Harte fakten,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to identify which dental procedures generate droplets and aerosols with subsequent contamination, and for these, characterise their pattern, spread and settle. DATA RESOURCES: Medline(OVID), Embase(OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science and LILACS databases were searched for eligible studies from each database's inception to May 2020 (search updated 11/08/20). Studies investigating clinical dental activities that generate aerosol using duplicate independent screening. Data extraction by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias assessed through contamination measurement tool sensitivity assessment. STUDY SELECTION: A total eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: ultrasonic scaling (USS, nâ¯=â¯44), highspeed air-rotor (HSAR, nâ¯=â¯31); oral surgery (nâ¯=â¯11), slow-speed handpiece (nâ¯=â¯4); air-water (triple) syringe (nâ¯=â¯4), air-polishing (nâ¯=â¯4), prophylaxis (nâ¯=â¯2) and hand-scaling (nâ¯=â¯2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood-splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operator's torso, operator's arm and patient's body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe, air polishing, extractions using motorised handpieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling). CONCLUSION: Gaps in evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit conclusions around contamination for procedures. A hierarchy of contamination from procedures is proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript addresses uncertainty around aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) in dentistry. Findings indicate a continuum of procedure-related aerosol generation rather than the common binary AGP or non-AGP perspective. The findings inform discussion around AGPs and direct future research to support knowledge and decision making around COVID-19 and dental procedures.","Innes, N; Johnson, I G; Al-Yaseen, W; Harris, R; Jones, R; Kc, S; McGregor, S; Robertson, M; Wade, W G; Gallagher, J E",J Dent,,317

Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinical trial staff and clinical trial subjects were surveyed by questionnaire in this study. The results of interviews and questionnaire showed that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to many changes in the implementation of drug clinical trials, including: a variety of meetings being held online webinars using various platforms, telemedicine and follow-up by video, A large number of deviations from protocol and losses of follow-up, delivery of clinical trial drugs by express, additional workload caused by screening for coronavirus, and anxiety of subjects. These results suggest that the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has hindered the progress and damaged the quality of clinical trials.

Tobacco smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death world-wide and a major risk factor for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections and appears to be related to poorer outcomes among those with COVID-19. Non-smokers with second-hand smoke exposure also experience significant adverse respiratory effects. Smoking imposes enormous health- and non-health-related costs to societies. The benefits of smoking cessation, in both prevention and management of respiratory disease, have been known for decades and, to this day, cessation support remains one of the most important cost-effective interventions that health professionals can provide to people who smoke. Cessation at any age confers substantial health benefits, even in smokers with established morbidities. As other treatments for chronic respiratory disease advance and survival rates increase, smoking cessation treatment will become even more relevant. While smoking cessation interventions are available, the offer of these by clinicians and uptake by patients remain limited.","McRobbie, Hayden; Kwan, Benjamin",Addiction,,317

383465,Clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with Covid-19 in different regions of the world,2021,"PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that remote learning to teach clinicians manual wheelchair skills is efficacious. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A convenience sample of therapists (physical and occupational) and students were enrolled in pairs in a cohort study with pre- versus post-training comparisons. The intervention was a hybrid of self-study and hands-on practice paired with remote feedback for ten intermediate and advanced manual wheelchair skills. Participants practiced with self-selected frequency and duration, uploading a session log and video(s) to an online platform. A remote trainer provided asynchronous feedback prior to the next practice session. Capacity and confidence in completing the ten skills were evaluated using the Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-Q). Knowledge of wheelchair skills training and motor learning was assessed using a 62-item Knowledge Test. Secondary outcome measures included skill achievement, as confirmed by submitted video recordings, and participant feedback about the training. RESULTS: Across 41participants, scores were higher at follow-up compared to baseline for WST-Q capacity (73.9 ± 19.1 vs 16.8 ± 15.6, p < 0.001), WST-Q confidence (80.1 ± 12.2 vs 47.6 ± 18.2, p = 0.003) and knowledge (70.8 ± 7.5 vs 67.0 ± 5.4, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Remote learning can increase wheelchair skills capacity and confidence as well as knowledge about such training and assessment. This model should be further investigated as a delivery method for training rehabilitation professionals. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT01807728. Implications for rehabilitation Wheelchair skills training is one of the 8 steps of wheelchair provision as outlined by the World Health Organization. Wheelchair skills are not a core part of most clinical curriculums and many clinicians cite a lack of resources and uncertainty on how to implement wheelchair skills training into practice as major barriers to providing such training. Remote learning offers the benefits of structured wheelchair skills training with expert feedback on an individual's own schedule that is not afforded by one-day ""bootcamp""-type courses or on-the-job training, which are how many clinicians currently learn wheelchair skills. In a sample of physical and occupational therapists and students, remote learning was effective at increasing capacity and confidence to perform manual wheelchair skills as well as knowledge of wheelchair training.","Worobey, Lynn A; Kirby, R Lee; Cowan, Rachel E; Dyson-Hudson, Trevor A; Shea, Mary; Heinemann, Allen W; Pedersen, Jessica Presperin; Hibbs, Rachel; Boninger, Michael L",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,,317

This study aimed to determine whether new pulmonary lesions will develop after treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and investigate their CT features and outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included 56 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from January 20 to March 5, 2020. Their initial and follow-up CT images and clinical data were reviewed. The CT manifestations of primary and newly developed pulmonary lesions and their changes after treatment were mainly evaluated. Results: Among the 56 patients (mean age: 48±15 years, 35 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia, 42 (75.0%) patients developed new pulmonary lesions during treatment. All new lesions developed before the nucleic acid test turned negative. Patients with new lesions were more likely to have lymphopenia (P=0.041) or increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (P<0.001) than those without new lesions. Of the 42 patients, 30 (71.4%) patients developed new lesions once, and 12 (28.6%) twice or thrice, which usually appeared when primary lesions were progressing (37, 88.1%) and 1-15 days after treatment. The newly developed lesions were usually multiple (38, 90.5%), distributed in the previously involved (39, 92.9%) or uninvolved (27, 64.3%) lobes, and manifested as ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (23, 54.8%) or pure GGOs (19, 45.2%). After their occurrence, the new lesions in most patients (32, 76.2%) showed direct absorption, whereas those in some patients (10, 23.8%) progressed before absorption. Conclusion: During treatment, most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia will develop new pulmonary lesions, which usually manifest as multiple GGOs distributed around the primary lesions or in previously uninvolved lobes, and are subsequently absorbed directly.","Li, Wang Jia; Lv, Zhuo Ma; Lv, Fa Jin; Fu, BinJie; Hu, Liang Bo; Chu, Zhi Gang",Int J Med Sci,,317

We focus on impacts involving the informal food chains that incorporate the resilience-enhancing biodiversity of food and agriculture known as agrobiodiversity. Our analysis addresses how informal food chains and agrobiodiversity are impacted by policies and interventions amidst COVID-19 disruptions. Our methodology relies on research in Peru with a focus on the cites and surrounding areas of Lima, Arequipa, Cusco, Huancayo, and Huánuco. We extend these insights to similar challenges and opportunities across western South America and other word regions. We utilize the four-part Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework to guide our examination of agrobiodiversity-related processes that interconnect governance, nutrition, agroecology, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results detail three links of informal food chains that are being disrupted and yet can offer resilience. These are food retailing, logistics and transportation, and seed systems. Utilization of the Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework cuts through highly complex issues to elaborate key food-security difficulties facing informal systems and how they can be strengthened to provide more resilience. We identify the specific roles of agrobiodiversity in resilience-enhancing processes that need strategic policy and program support. Results identify ways to augment the resilience of informal food chains using agrobiodiversity and the empowerment of social groups and organizations in urban food systems and rural communities. We conclude that the disruptions triggered by the global COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need to use agrobiodiversity as an instrument for resilience in informal food chains.","Zimmerer, Karl S; de Haan, Stef",Food Secur,,317

An incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis and viral spread has resulted in evolving guidelines to reduce transmission from infected mothers to neonates. Fortunately, the risk of neonatal infection via perinatal/postnatal transmission is low when recommended precautions are followed. However, the psychosocial implications of these practices and racial/ethnic disparities highlighted by this pandemic must also be addressed when caring for mothers and their newborns. This review provides a comprehensive overview of neonatal-perinatal perspectives of COVID-19, ranging from the basic science of infection and recommendations for care of pregnant women and neonates to important psychosocial, ethical, and racial/ethnic topics emerging as a result of both the pandemic and the response of the healthcare community to the care of infected individuals.","Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Beam, Kristyn S; Bernardini, Laura B; Ramos, Erika G Cordova; Davenport, Patricia E; Duncan, Anna R; Fraiman, Yarden S; Frazer, Lauren C; Healy, Helen; Herzberg, Emily M; Keyes, Madeline L; Leeman, Kristen T; Leone, Kristin; Levin, Jonathan C; Lin, Matthew; Raju, Ravikiran M; Sullivan, Anne",J. perinatol,,317

397369,Glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using a hybrid closed loop system and followed by telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,2020,"AIMS: Arterial stiffness is an underlying risk factor and a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases. The endothelial cell (EC) glycocalyx is a glycan rich surface layer that plays a key role in protecting against EC dysfunction and vascular disease. However, the mechanisms by which arterial stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease are not fully understood, and whether the mechanism involves the protective endothelial glycocalyx is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx protects the endothelial cells lining the vascular wall from dysfunction and disease in response to arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) gels of substrate stiffness 10 kPa (mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of aged, unhealthy arteries) showed a significant inhibition of glycocalyx expression compared to cells cultured on softer PA gels (2.5 kPa, mimicking the subendothelial stiffness of young, healthy arteries). Specifically, gene and protein analyses revealed that a glycocalyx core protein Glypican 1 was inhibited in cells cultured on stiff PA gels. These cells had enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction as determined by enhanced cell inflammation (enhanced inflammatory gene expression, monocyte adhesion and inhibited nitric oxide expression), proliferation and EndMT. Removal of Glypican 1 using gene-specific silencing with siRNA or gene overexpression using a plasmid revealed that Glypican 1 is required to protect against stiffness-mediated endothelial cell dysfunction. Consistent with this, using a model of age-mediated stiffness, older mice exhibited a reduced expression of Glypican 1 and enhanced endothelial cell dysfunction compared to young mice. Glypican1 gene deletion in knockout mice (GPC1 -/-) exacerbated endothelial dysfunction in young mice, which normally had high endothelial expression, but not in old mice that normally expressed low levels.Endothelial cell dysfunction was exacerbated in young, but not aged, Glypican 1 knockout mice (GPC1 -/-). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness promotes EC dysfunction and vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1. Glypican 1 contributes to the protection against endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular disease in endothelial cells. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: This work reveals for the first time the effect of arterial stiffness on the glycocalyx protein Glypican 1 in endothelial cell function. Stiffness promotes endothelial cell dysfunction and subsequently vascular disease at least partly through the suppression of Glypican 1. Thus, Glypican 1 could be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment/reversal of arterial stiffness-mediated vascular disease.","Mahmoud, Marwa; Mayer, Mariya; Cancel, Limary M; Bartosch, Anne Marie; Mathews, Rick; Tarbell, John M",Cardiovasc. res,,317

Moreover, few studies have focused on COVD-19 deaths. We studied the association of average ambient temperature with subsequent COVID-19 mortality in the OECD countries and the individual United States (US), while accounting for other important meteorological and non-meteorological co-variates. The exposure of interest was average temperature and other weather conditions, measured at 25 days prior and 25 days after the first reported COVID-19 death was collected in the OECD countries and US states. The outcome of interest was cumulative COVID-19 mortality, assessed for each region at 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after the first reported death. Analyses were performed with negative binomial regression and adjusted for other weather conditions, particulate matter, sociodemographic factors, smoking, obesity, ICU beds, and social distancing. A 1 °C increase in ambient temperature was associated with 6% lower COVID-19 mortality at 30 days following the first reported death (multivariate-adjusted mortality rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.90, 0.99, p = 0.016). The results were robust for COVID-19 mortality at 25, 35 and 40 days after the first death, as well as other sensitivity analyses. The results provide consistent evidence across various models of an inverse association between higher average temperatures and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for other meteorological variables and predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection or death. This suggests potentially decreased viral transmission in warmer regions and during the summer season.","Christophi, Costas A; Sotos-Prieto, Mercedes; Lan, Fan-Yun; Delgado-Velandia, Mario; Efthymiou, Vasilis; Gaviola, Gabriel C; Hadjivasilis, Alexandros; Hsu, Yu-Tien; Kyprianou, Aikaterini; Lidoriki, Irene; Wei, Chih-Fu; Rodriguez-Artalejo, Fernando; Kales, Stefanos N",Sci Rep,,317

The pandemic has evoked widespread collateral damage to societies and economies, and has destabilized mental health and well-being. Early in 2020, unprecedented efforts went into the development of vaccines that generate effective antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Teams developing twelve candidate vaccines, based on four platforms (messenger RNA, non-replicating viral vector, protein/virus-like particle, and inactivated virus) had initiated or announced the Phase III clinical trial stage by early November 2020, with several having received emergency use authorization in less than a year. Vaccine rollout has proceeded around the globe. Previously, we and others had proposed a target product profile (TPP) for ideal/optimal and acceptable/minimal COVID-19 vaccines. How well do these candidate vaccines stack up to a harmonized TPP? Here, we perform a comparative analysis in several categories of these candidate vaccines based on the latest available trial data and highlight the early successes as well as the hurdles and barriers yet to be overcome for ending the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Funk, Colin D; Laferrière, Craig; Ardakani, Ali",Viruses,,317
402657,July Interns,2020,"Clinical relevance: In the last months, the whole world is dealing with an unprecedented public health crisis due to COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, many governments have implemented lockdowns on a national level, affecting, among others, ophthalmic surgical practice in a globe scale.Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of surgical theatre lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical performance of cataract surgeons.Methods: Intraoperative complications and surgical time of the first 160 cataract surgeries performed by eight consultants (20 cases each) after a two-month lockdown were recorded and analysed in a cross-sectional study. The results were plotted against the last 30 cases of each surgeon before the implementation of the lockdown (240 cases). Cataract surgeons were asked to rate their subjective perspective and difficulties faced after re-opening through a questionnaire.Results: The average duration of all surgeries after the lockdown was 19.1 ± 6.2 minutes showing a 14% increase compared to the one before the lockdown (16.8 ± 5.1 minutes, p = 0.0001). The complications rate was 2.09% (5/240 cases) before the abstention and 3.12% (5/160 cases) after the abstention not yielding any statistically significant difference (p = 0.74). When complicated surgeries were excluded from the analysis, surgical time was still higher after the lockdown (18.9 ± 5.9 minutes) than before (16.6 ± 5.0 minutes, p < 0.0001). 37.5% of consultants (3/8) stated that the two-month abstention from cataract surgeries has affected their surgical skills somewhat or a lot, while 62.5% (5/8) reported being more careful in their first cases after the lockdown. Most complications occurred in the hands of one surgeon who stated to be very anxious upon restart.Conclusion: The operating theatres' lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to affect the intraoperative complications rate in cataract surgery. A slight increase of surgical duration was noted, while most surgeons reported being more careful upon restart.","Tzamalis, Argyrios; Karafotaki, Kyriaki; Karipidi, Kalliopi; Diafas, Asterios; Mataftsi, Asimina; Tsinopoulos, Ioannis; Ziakas, Nikolaos",Clin Exp Optom,,317

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a relatively common condition affecting young females that could lead to permanent blindness if not properly treated. In this article, we provide some insight and recommendations regarding the management of IIH during the pandemic. METHODS: The diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment methods of IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic period are reviewed. COVID-19 as a mimic of IIH is also discussed. RESULTS: Diagnosis and follow-up of papilledema due to IIH during the COVID-19 pandemic can be facilitated by nonmydriatic fundus photography and optical coherence tomography. COVID-19 may mimic IIH by presenting as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, papillophlebitis, or meningoencephalitis, so a high index of suspicious is required in these cases. When surgical treatment is indicated, optic nerve sheath fenestration may be the primary procedure of choice during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: IIH is a serious vision threatening condition that could lead to permanent blindness and disability at a relatively young age if left untreated. It could be the first presentation of a COVID-19 infection. Certain precautions during the diagnosis and management of this condition could be taken that may allow appropriate care to be delivered to these patients while minimizing the risk of coronavirus infection.","Elnahry, Ayman G; Elnahry, Gehad A",Rev Recent Clin Trials,,317

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The impetus for strategic rescheduling of operations is multifactorial and includes our societal responsibility to minimize COVID-19 exposure risk and propagation among patients, the healthcare workforce, and our community at large. Strategic rescheduling is also driven by the need to preserve limited resources. As many states have already or are considering to re-open and relax stay-at-home orders, there remains a continued need for careful surgical scheduling because we must face the reality that we will need to co-exist with COVID-19 for months, if not years. METHODS: The quality officers, chairs, and leadership of the 9 surgical departments in our Division of Surgery provide specialty-specific approaches to appropriately triage patients. RESULTS: We present the strategic approach for surgical rescheduling during and immediately after the COVID-19 first wave for the 9 departments in the Division of Surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.

The aim of this study was to research how the situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has influenced the lives of patients with rare diseases regarding depression and anxiety. This Spanish study considered a heterogeneous population sample of 86 patients with confirmed diagnosis of different rare diseases. Participants took part in a cross-sectional online study by completing specific questionnaires on the study topic. Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used for evaluating anxiety. Data collection through an online questionnaire allowed for a greater population scope and therefore the inclusion patients of other nationalities in the study sample. Finally, as a general result, this study found that, in the face of the pandemic, anxiety and depression remained at a higher level in this group than in the general population, making these patients a vulnerable population group.","Sánchez-García, Juan Carlos; Cortés-Martín, Jonathan; Rodríguez-Blanque, Raquel; Marín-Jiménez, Ana Eugenia; Montiel-Troya, Maria; Díaz-Rodríguez, Lourdes",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,317

Respiratory allergy is associated with significant reductions in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is the entry receptor for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To observe COVID-19 susceptibility in patients with bronchial asthma, analyze the prevalence of asthma in a large cohort of consecutive outpatient subjects who were tested with the RT-PCR assay for COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using data from a large nationwide health maintenance organization in Israel. All health maintenance organization enrollees who had been tested for COVID-19 from February to June 2020 were included. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the subjects with negative and positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and between COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive subjects with and without asthma were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 37,469 subjects were tested for COVID-19 RT-PCR, and results for 2,266 (6.05%) of them were positive. A significantly higher proportion of smokers was observed in the COVID-19-negative group than in the COVID-19-positive group (4734 [13.45%] vs 103 [4.55%]; P < .001). Asthma was found in 153 (6.75 %) subjects of the COVID-19-positive group and in 3388 (9.62%) subjects of the COVID-19-negative group (P < .001).

416180,"COVID-19, diabetes mellitus and ACE2: The conundrum",2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically changed our habits and routines. Uncertainty, insecurity, instability for the present and future, and reduced autonomy and self-directedness, are common feelings at the time of COVID-19. These aspects are very important during emerging adulthood. In spite of the fact that medical reports suggest that youth are less prone to experience COVID-19 infections, emerging adults might be at higher risk for their psychological adjustment. Emerging adults showed higher concerns about their role as a possible asymptomatic carrier than being positive with COVID-19 themselves. Both worries and concerns about COVID-19 and psychological maladjustment may be related to cultural factors. Individualism, collectivism, equality, and hierarchy seem to be meaningful perspectives to take into account. A total of 1183 Italian emerging adults were asked to fill out an online survey during the second week of the national lockdown in Italy. Results showed they reported an accurate perceived knowledge about COVID-19. At the same time, they showed higher worries and concerns about COVID-19 for their relatives, followed by more general/social worries. The lowest score included worries about COVID-19 related to themselves. State anxiety and stress levels were above the normal cutoff, confirming the challenges that emerging adults are facing during the pandemic. On one hand, emerging adults' collectivistic orientation was related to higher perceived risks of infection; on the other hand, it predicted lower psychological maladjustment, controlling for socio-demographic variables. The study suggests that to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and decrease levels of psychological maladjustment in emerging adulthood, individuals' cultural orientation such as the wish of sharing common goals with others, interdependence, and sociability, have to be emphasized and promoted as protective factors.","Germani, Alessandro; Buratta, Livia; Delvecchio, Elisa; Mazzeschi, Claudia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,317

The disease was associated with Brazilian groundnut meal affected by Aspergillus flavus. The toxin was named Aspergillus flavus toxin-aflatoxin. From the point of view of agriculture, aflatoxins show the utmost importance. Until now, a total of 20 aflatoxins have been described, with B1, B2, G1, and G2 aflatoxins being the most significant. Contamination by aflatoxins is a global health problem. Aflatoxins pose acutely toxic, teratogenic, immunosuppressive, carcinogenic, and teratogenic effects. Besides food insecurity and human health, aflatoxins affect humanity at different levels, such as social, economical, and political. Great emphasis is placed on aflatoxin mitigation using biocontrol methods. Thus, this review is focused on aflatoxins in terms of historical development, the principal milestones of aflatoxin research, and recent data on their toxicity and different ways of mitigation.","Pickova, Darina; Ostry, Vladimir; Toman, Jakub; Malir, Frantisek",Toxins (Basel),,317

A worsening of clinical conditions appears before CFRD. It has been demonstrated a decline in pulmonary function and nutritional status also in patients with prediabetes. Few trials show that insulin may be beneficial in prediabetic CF patients, to date guidelines do not recommend for this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a patient treated with insulin glargine at 13 years, due to glycemic intolerance, and with Lumacaftor/Ivacaftor at 15 years. A reduction of pulmonary exacerbations was observed after glargine therapy, also confirmed after the starting of Lumacaftor/ Ivacaftor in this patient. Pulmonary function improved only after the first year of glargine therapy, then a deterioration appeared due to the natural history of CF lung damage. During the COVID-19 lockdown, poor adherence to care contributed to diabetes mellitus onset needing high insulin requirements. After two weeks the patient returned to prediabetic condition and his previous dose of glargine. CONCLUSIONS: our case highlights firstly that insulin glargine has contributed to preserve him from further clinical worsening due to prediabetes in the years before pandemic, secondly the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the clinical course of a chronic disease as CF.","Rosanio, Francesco Maria; Mozzillo, Enza; Cimbalo, Chiara; Casertano, Alberto; Sepe, Angela; Raia, Valeria; Franzese, Adriana; Tosco, Antonella",Ital J Pediatr,,317

METHODS: Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct effect of workstation characteristics, stress, and musculoskeletal symptoms to productivity and the indirect effect of psychological detachment to productivity. Data were gathered from a survey of employees working from home during the pandemic from different industries (n = 352). Multigroup analysis was also conducted to determine the effect of age, having a spouse, and having children less than 18 years old, to the model. RESULTS: Ergonomic suitability of the workstation (WES) has a significant effect on musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) (ß = -0.31, SE = 0.06; p < .001). Both workstation suitability (ß = -0.24, SE = 0.03; p < .001) and workstation ergonomic suitability (ß = -0.18, SE = 0.01; p < .01) inversely affect STR. Psychological detachment has a significant inverse effect on stress (ß = -0.31, SE = 0.07; p < .001) and stress has a significant negative effect on productivity (ß = -0.13, SE = 0.09; p = .03). Multigroup analyses showed that stress significantly affected the productivity of those without spouses and young employees. CONCLUSION: Workstation suitability helps improve the productivity of people working from home while stress negatively affects it. Workstation ergonomic suitability and musculoskeletal symptoms have no significant effect.","Seva, Rosemary R; Tejero, Lourdes Marie S; Fadrilan-Camacho, Vivien Fe F",J Occup Health,,317

Stigmas exist among healthcare professionals, and it is essential to educate the next generation of pharmacy technicians regarding opioid use disorder. The main objective of this study was to characterize the phenomenon of stigma through the pharmacy technician lens when taking care of patients who are using opioid medications. Grounded in Van Manen's phenomenological approach and the Link and Phelan stigmatization model, a qualitative study was conducted from February to June 2020 to understand pharmacy technicians' perceptions and attitudes towards patients using opioid medications. Focus groups (n = 46) with pharmacy technicians were conducted in-person and online over five months in 2020. Thematic analysis identified three themes that characterize the stigma and the relationship between pharmacy technicians and patients taking opioid medications: (1) pharmacy technician perspectives on stigma and patients with addictive opioid-use behavior; (2) current approaches of pharmacy technicians towards patients with addictive opioid-use behavior; (3) future approaches of pharmacy technicians towards patients with addictive opioid-use behavior. The findings highlight an ""ever-present"" negative connotation associated with the stigma that is formed from patient interaction. It is necessary to develop proper resources and educational materials to manage the stigma that exists in pharmacies throughout the nation. These resources will facilitate how to address and prevent the stigma among pharmacy technicians in the U.S.","Cernasev, Alina; Desselle, Shane; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Canedo, Joanne; Tran, Britney; Wheeler, James",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,317

While significant advances have been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the concept, a gap exists in the understanding of responsible leadership in emerging countries, specifically how leaders resolve prevalent moral dilemmas. Following Werhane (1999), we use moral imagination as an analytical approach to analyze a dilemmatic stakeholder conflict (between indigenous communities in rural India and an emerging market multinational enterprise headquartered in the same country) through the lense of different responsible leadership mindsets and in light of different ethical principles and moral background theories. Based on this analysis, we arrive at a tentative moral judgement, concluding that the instrumental approach is morally inferior and recommending the integrative approach as the morally superior choice. In the subsequent discussion-focussed on what ""could"" (instead of ""should"") be done, we apply the integrative script and use moral imagination as a pathway for generating morally justifiable solutions. Through this analysis, we provide novel insights on how to apply an integrative responsible leadership approach to a stakeholder conflict situation, using the single case study to expand the responsible leadership discussion to emerging markets.","Pless, Nicola M; Sengupta, Atri; Wheeler, Melissa A; Maak, Thomas",J Bus Ethics,,317

This article uses feminist theory to judge this legislation’s value, contrasting that with the insights of activists and policymakers interviewed for this purpose. Benefiting from the discussion between Nancy Fraser (1995) and Judith Butler (1997), the quality of trans legislation can be assessed by looking at both cultural recognition and economic redistribution. In addition, following Andrea Krizsan and Emanuela Lombardo (2013), I also analyze these laws through the lens of empowerment and transformation.

By leveraging edge computing with the 5G RAN, management of epidemic diseases such as COVID-19 can be conducted efficiently. Deploying a hierarchical edge computing architecture offers several benefits such as scalability, low latency, and privacy for the data and the training model, which enables analysis of COVID-19 by a local trusted edge server. However, existing deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial drawbacks: first, the training requires a large COVID-19 dataset on various dimensions, which is difficult for any local authority to manage. Second, the DL results require ethical approval and explanations from healthcare providers and other stakeholders in order to be accepted. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that supports COVID-19 diagnosis, leveraging the low-latency, high-bandwidth features of the 5G network at the edge. Our framework employs a distributed DL paradigm where each COVID-19 edge employs its own local DL framework and uses a three-phase reconciliation with the global DL framework. The local DL model runs on edge nodes while the global DL model runs on a cloud environment. The training of a local DL model is performed with the dataset available from the edge; it is applied to the global model after receiving approval from the subject matter experts at the edge. Our framework adds semantics to existing DL models so that human domain experts on COVID-19 can gain insight and semantic visualization of the key decision-making activities that take place within the deep learning ecosystem. We have implemented a subset of various COVID-19 scenarios using distributed DL at the edge and in the cloud. The test results are promising.","Rahman, Md. Abdur; Hossain, M.

We examined feature importance across 2,787 counties in the United States using a data-driven machine learning model. We trained random forest models using 23 features representing six key influencing factors affecting pandemic spread: social demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties, movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure. Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage. The study aims to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features evolves in different stages; (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varies across counties with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of COVID-19 across the 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features had the highest importance in county clusters with higher population densities; (3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social connectedness index), had higher importance in the models for counties with higher population densities. The results show that the data-driven machine learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and in different stages of a pandemic life cycle.","Li, Qingchun; Yang, Yang; Wang, Wangqiu; Lee, Sanghyeon; Xiao, Xin; Gao, Xinyu; Oztekin, Bora; Fan, Chao; Mostafavi, Ali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03458v2.pdf,317

446831,Comparison of Knowledge and Information-Seeking Behavior After General COVID-19 Public Health Messages and Messages Tailored for Black and Latinx Communities : A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021,"OBJECTIVES: There is uncertainty about when the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Spain. We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases. DESIGN: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, 2010-2020. SETTING: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: People registered in primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 clinically diagnosed in primary care. ANALYSES: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model expected case numbers with Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average models, overall and stratified by age. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases. RESULTS: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020, 8017 (95% CI: 1841 to 14 718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. The use of clinical codes could misrepresent the true occurrence of the disease. Serological or PCR testing should be used to confirm these findings. In future, this surveillance of excess influenza could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like pathogens, to initiate early public health responses.","Coma Redon, Ermengol; Mora, Nuria; Prats-Uribe, Albert; Fina Avilés, Francesc; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Medina, Manuel",BMJ Open,,317

METHODS: Thirty-five hypertensive older adults were included in this observational study. Accelerometer-based PA and SB measures were assessed before (January to March 2020) and during (June 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear mixed models were used to assess within-group changes in PA and SB measures, adjusted by accelerometer wear time. RESULTS: Before COVID-19 pandemic participants presented: 5809 steps/day (SE = 366), 303.1 min/day (SE = 11.9) of light PA, 15.5 min/day (SE = 2.2) of moderate-vigorous PA, and 653.0 min/day (SE = 12.6) of SB. During COVID-19 pandemic there was a decrease in steps/day (ß = -886 steps/day, SE = 361, p = 0.018), in moderate-vigorous PA (ß = -2.8 min/day, SE = 2.4, p = 0.018), and a trend in light PA (ß = -26.6 min/day, SE = 13.4, p = 0.053). In addition, SB increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (ß = 29.6 min/day, SE = 13.4, p = 0.032). The magnitude of changes was greater on the weekend, mainly for steps/day (ß = -1739 steps/day, SE = 424, p < 0.001) and the SB pattern (more time spent in bouts of &#8805;10 and 30 min, less breaks/day and breaks/h). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may elicit unhealthy changes in movement behavior in hypertensive older adults. Lower PA, higher and more prolonged SB on the weekend are the main features of the behavioral changes.","Browne, Rodrigo A V; Macêdo, Geovani A D; Cabral, Ludmila L P; Oliveira, Gledson T A; Vivas, Andrés; Fontes, Eduardo B; Elsangedy, Hassan M; Costa, Eduardo C",Exp Gerontol,,317
452943,COVID-19 and diabetes: International Diabetes Federation perspectives,2020,"Novel corona-virus (nCOV) has been declared as a pandemic that started from the city Wuhan of China. This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227â¯K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy.","Younis, Mohammed Chachan",Comput Med Imaging Graph,,317

Electronic learning (e-learning) became the core method of teaching the curriculum during the pandemic. After 8 weeks of only online learning, a survey was conducted to investigate perception of this type of learning among medical students.A survey was conducted by distributing an online questionnaire to Polish medical students. Data gathered from the survey were analyzed with routine statistical software.Eight hundred four students answered the questionnaire. According to respondents' answers, the main advantages of online learning were the ability to stay at home (69%), continuous access to online materials (69%), learning at your own pace (64%), and comfortable surroundings (54%). The majority of respondents chose lack of interactions with patients (70%) and technical problems with IT equipment (54%) as the main disadvantages. There was no statistical difference between face-to-face and online learning in terms of opinions on the ability of the learning method to increase knowledge (Pâ=â.46). E-learning was considered less effective than face-to-face learning in terms of increasing skills (Pâ<â.001) and social competences (Pâ<â.001). Students assessed that they were less active during online classes compared to traditional classes (Pâ<â.001). E-learning was rated as enjoyable by 73% of respondents.E-learning is a powerful tool for teaching medical students. However, successful implementation of online learning into the curriculum requires a well thought-out strategy and a more active approach.","Baczek, Michal; Zaganczyk-Baczek, Michalina; Szpringer, Monika; Jaroszynski, Andrzej; Wozakowska-Kaplon, Beata",Medicine (Baltimore),,317

The underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood. Emerging evidence suggests that CFTR dysfunction may directly or indirectly impact ß-cell function, offering the potential for improvement with CFTR modulator therapy. In small pilot studies, treatment with ivacaftor improved insulin secretion in patients with the G551D CFTR mutation. In the current study, we examined the impact of lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. METHODS: 39 subjects from the PROSPECT Part B study who had been prescribed lumacaftor/ivacaftor by their CF care team at a CF Foundation's Therapeutic Development Network center were recruited. Subjects underwent 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) at baseline prior to first dose of lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and at 3, 6 and 12 months on therapy. OGTT glucose, insulin and c-peptide parameters were compared. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, OGTT fasting and 2 hour glucose levels, glucose area under the curve, insulin area under the curve and time to peak insulin level were not significantly different at 3, 6 and 12 months on lumacaftor/ivacaftor therapy.

At first, it was about course finishing; later, the issues moved to assessment. This scourge increases mental issues, stress, dissatisfaction, sorrow, and nervousness. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the mental health and behaviour of Mizoram University students during the Covid-19 lockdown period. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional investigation, and a snowball method sampling technique was utilised for obtainging information from the students. Results: There were 65.2% of students who revealed that they were giving more consideration to their emotional wellbeing during this pandemic. More than half of the participants (67.2%) reported no expanded worry of stress from scholastic work, and 65.2% reported that they were paying more attention to their emotional wellbeing and mental health following the pandemic. Further, 69.7% reported that they were spending more time exercising. Nearly 55% of students took part in Zoom classes, with a length of 35 to 40 min. About 65.7% of students gained proficiency in their course by means of a learning management system.

Thus, the present research aimed to study the intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine as a precondition for international travel using an extended Norm-Activation Model. The study model integrates a new construct, namely mass media coverage on COVID-19 vaccination as additional predictor of intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The survey data were collected from 1221 international travelers. Structural equation modelling shows a very good fit of the final model to the data; the conceptual model based on extended Norm-Activation Model was strongly supported. Awareness of consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' health has shown a positive effect on individuals' ascribed responsibility to adopt emotionally driven (anticipated pride and anticipated guilt) pro-social behaviors that activate a personal norm towards altruistic and pro-mandatory vaccination-friendly behavior.

This disease spread around the whole globe, thus WHO declared it as a pandemic by March 11, 2020. Due to rapid mutation rate, lack of specific genomic knowledge and treatment modalities against this RNA based virus, world scientific community urges to work for vaccine production, treatments options and alternative remedies including eastern herbs as potential anti-viral agents. Methods: Olea europaea (Olive) was found highly beneficial on the basis of its previous therapeutic applications. So, in the current study, its five different compounds (Catechin, Cynaroside, Elenolic Acid, Hydroxytyrosol, and Oleuropein) were chosen according to Lipinski physiochemical parameters, which were compared with already clinically used five anti-viral drugs (Ribavirin, Niclosamide, Nelfinavir, S-Nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine, Chloroquine) against the Main-Peptidase (PDB ID:2GTB) of SARS-nCoV2 using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software. Results: Among the chosen compounds of Olea europaea which were docked on the active site of Main-Peptidase, Oleuropein provide the best minimum binding energy of -8.3201kcal/mol followed by Cynaroside with -7.2121kcal/mol. These two energy complexes are considered to have better drug potential in this initial studies as compare to the already commercially used drug agents e.g. Chloroquine, Ribavirin, Niclosamide and S-Nitroso-N-acetyl Penicillamine having binding energy of -6.7168, -5.8171, -6.3361 and -5.4219kcal/mol respectively. Other three agents from olive were also docked to compare the binding energy of aforementioned clinically used drugs. Conclusion: Oleuropein and Cynaroside are considered to be the most compelling compounds as a drug agent against coronavirus2 infection. Further, molecular dynamic simulations and in-vivo investigations are needed to endorse the current findings of these compounds as potential drugs.","Saif, R.; Ali, G.; Ashfaq, K.; Zia, S.; Qureshi, A.

Different studies try to identify the main effects that the crisis and several lockdowns have had on the citizens’ mental health. This research analyses the coping strategies generated by students from a community group and a clinical group in response to this crisis, using the Coping Responses Inventory—Adult Form (CRI-A) by Moos with a sample of 1074 students of Universidad de Extremadura. Multivariate analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis have been carried out, revealing, amongst other things, a greater predisposition of the clinical sample towards factors such as seeking guidance and support, cognitive avoidance or emotional discharge. Results show that students with prior mental health problems perform an unhealthy coping response based on avoidance strategies. This group of students suffers a double source of distress and anxiety, one derived from their prior psychopathologic problems and the stress of the lockdown and another one originating from an inefficient coping response, which makes coping strategies raise levels of distress and anxiety.","López-Ramos, Víctor-María León-del-Barco Benito Mendo-Lázaro Santiago Polo-del-Río María-Isabel",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,317

The COVID-19 pandemic deeply influenced UCSDHS activities as new public health challenges increasingly related to high population density, cross-border traffic, economic disparities, and interconnectedness between cross-border communities, which accelerated development of clinical collaborations between UCSDHS and several border community hospitals - one in the US, two in Mexico - as high volumes of severely ill patients overwhelmed hospitals. Objective: We describe the development, implementation, feasibility, and acceptance of a novel critical care support program in three community hospitals along the US-Mexico border. Methods: We created and instituted a hybrid critical care program involving: 1) in-person activities to perform needs assessments of equipment and supplies and hands-on training and education, and 2) creation of a telemedicine-based (Tele-ICU) service for direct patient management and/or consultative, education-based experiences. We collected performance metrics surrounding adherence to evidence-based practices and staff perceptions of critical care delivery. Findings: In-person intervention phase identified and filled gaps in equipment and supplies, and Tele-ICU program promoted adherence to evidence-based practices and improved staff confidence in caring for critically ill COVID-19 patients at each hospital. Conclusion: A collaborative, hybrid critical care program across academic and community centers is feasible and effective to address cross-cultural public health emergencies.","Ramnath, Venktesh R; Hill, Linda; Schultz, Jim; Mandel, Jess; Smith, Andres; Morris, Tim; Holberg, Stacy; Horton, Lucy E; Malhotra, Atul; Friedman, Lawrence S",Ann Glob Health,,317

Despite the epidemiological importance, clinical patterns of children with COVID-19 remain unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of children with COVID-19. METHODS: The Medline database was searched between December 1st 2019 and April 6th 2020. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion criteria were (a) studied patients younger than 18 years old; (b) presented original data from cases of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; and (c) contained descriptions of clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, or radiological examinations. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies (1124 cases) were included. From all the cases, 1117 had their severity classified: 14.2% were asymptomatic, 36.3% were mild, 46.0% were moderate, 2.1% were severe, and 1.2% were critical. The most prevalent symptom was fever (47.5%), followed by cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%), and nausea/vomiting (7.1%). One hundred forty-five (36.9%) children were diagnosed with pneumonia and 43 (10.9%) upper airway infections were reported. Reduced lymphocyte count was reported in 12.9% of cases. Abnormalities in computed tomography were reported in 63.0% of cases. The most prevalent abnormalities reported were ground-glass opacities, patchy shadows, and consolidations. Only one death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestations of children with COVID-19 differ widely from adult cases.

COVID-19 also has an unneglected effect on migraine patients. Migraine attack frequency as one of migraine characteristics, its impact during COVID-19 deserves further research. We aimed to evaluate whether migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic differed from pre-COVID-19, and explore their possible influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD: This prospective cohort study enrolled 187 migraine patients who came from the Department of Neurology of West China Hospital from October 2019 to December 2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 157 patients were included. We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics and epidemiological contact information and followed up on March 2020. Then Paired-Samples T test, logistic regression and interaction tests were used to analyze data. RESULT: We found that value of migraine attack frequency was 2.47 ± 1.12 before and 3.54 ± 1.79 during COVID-19 (P<0.0001). Then we divided patients into two group based on the difference of migraine attack frequency between COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 and employed logistic regression analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, divorced status (OR=6.53, P=0.0453), good sleep pre-COVID-19 and poor sleep during COVID-19 (OR=3.11, P=0.0432) had independent effect on migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic. And we found no interaction in the poor sleep during COVID-19 between various subgroups. CONCLUSION: Migraineurs may suffer from more frequent migraine attack during COVID-19 pandemic. Pay more attention to marital status and assessment of sleep status may contribute to adjusting suitable treatment strategies of migraine patients during pandemic.","Ma, Mengmeng; Bao, Jiajia; Fang, Jinghuan; Li, Changling; Li, Yanbo; Ge, Wenjing; Zhang, Yang; Guo, Jian; He, Li",Current neurovascular research (Online),,317

News publishers have journalistic authority and are oftentimes seen as one of the most important knowledge-producing institutions in society, routinely carrying out epistemic practices that strive towards producing verified and reliable news about public affairs. The COVID-19 pandemic has forcefully reminded us about this vital information function of the news media, with a surge in traffic to mobile applications and news sites around the world. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is simultaneously crushing the advertising business that plays such a vital role in funding news production. This commentary argues that many journalistic institutions - particularly on the local level - currently face an existential crisis, one that calls for immediate and collective action. With a normative desire of saving journalism, we put forward that society should engage in what we refer to as communal news work as an attempt to financially sustain journalism during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and well into the future.","Olsen, Ragnhild Kristine; Pickard, Victor; Westlund, Oscar",Digit.

482801,Web Exclusive. Annals On Call - Clinical Reasoning and Testing for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID epidemic hit like a tsunami worldwide. At the time of its arrival in Italy, available literary data were meager, and most of them concerned its epidemiology. World Health Organization proposed guidelines in march 2020, a strategy of treatment has been developed, and a significant number of subsequent articles have been published to understand, prevent, and cure COVID patients. METHODS: From the observation of two patients, we performed a careful analysis of scientific literature to unearth the relation between COVID infection, clinical manifestations as pneumonia and thrombosis, and to find out why it frequently affects obese, diabetics, and elderly patients. RESULTS: The analysis shows that hepcidin could represent one of such correlating factors. Hepcidin is most elevated in older age, in non-insulin diabetics patients and in obese people. It is the final target therapy of many medicaments frequently used. Viral disease, and in particular SARS-CoV19, could induce activation of the hepcidin pathway, which in turn is responsible for an increase in the iron load. Excess of iron can lead to cell death by ferroptosis and release into the bloodstream, such as free iron, which in turn has toxic and pro-coagulative effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of hepcidin and iron overload might play a crucial role in COVID infection, becoming potential targets for treatment. Hepcidin could also be considered as a biomarker to measure the effectiveness of our treatments and the restoration of iron homeostasis the final intent.

There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for COVID-19 aside from remdesivir; early efforts to identify efficacious therapeutics for COVID-19 have mainly focused on drug repurposing screens to identify compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cellular infection systems. These screens have yielded intriguing hits, but the use of nonhuman immortalized cell lines derived from non-pulmonary or gastrointestinal origins poses any number of questions in predicting the physiological and pathological relevance of these potential interventions.

This study aimed to assess the mental health status of Bangladeshi university students during the lockdown period. Subject and methods: Through an online-based questionnaire, information was collected from 509 university students of Bangladesh from June 19, 2020, to June 28, 2020, using convenient sampling. K-means clustering was applied to organize students according to their psychological health score, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also conducted to determine the association among the student's activities and their mental health during the pandemic. In addition, these associations were examined through chi-square test and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Students were categorized into four categories where 4.32% had mild, 72.7% had moderate, 12.57% had moderately severe, and 10.41% suffered from severe mental health imbalance. The results showed that having family members affected by the coronavirus, facing insecurity, using social media, and smoking habits increased the mental health imbalances of students; in contrast, being worried about studying, future career, spending more time with family members, and participation in household chores reduced the mental health disturbances of students. On the other hand, the results of the ordinal logistic regression indicated that sleeping time and participation in household chores were preventive factors for students. Conclusion: This study reveals that a large proportion of University students of Bangladesh suffered from mental health disturbances during the lockdown period. Implementing mental health plans and providing job security, improved communication approaches toward family members, not flattening illusive news, and preoccupation in household activities may assist to enhance the mental health status of the university students. The authors believe that this study's findings will be helpful to expedite the rate of attaining the sustainable development goal associated with health status in Bangladesh.","Alam, Muhammad Khairul; Ali, Ferdous Bin; Banik, Rajon; Yasmin, Sabina; Salma, Nahid",Z Gesundh Wiss,,317

498647,Lessons from COVID-19: How human behaviour may influence the science,2020,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients receiving maintenance dialysis are a highly vulnerable population due to their comorbidities and circumstances that limit physical distancing during treatment. This study sought to characterize the risk factors for and outcomes following COVID-19 in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Maintenance dialysis patients in clinics of a midsize national dialysis provider that had at least 1 patient who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from February to June 2020. PREDICTORS: Demographics, dialysis characteristics, residence in a congregated setting, comorbid conditions, measurements of frailty, and use of selected medications. OUTCOMES: COVID-19, defined as having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and all-cause mortality among those with COVID-19. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic regression analyses conducted to identify clinical characteristics associated with COVID-19 and risk factors associated with mortality among patients following COVID-19. RESULTS: 438 of 7948 (5.5%) maintenance dialysis patients developed COVID-19. Male sex, Black race, in-center dialysis (vs home dialysis), treatment at an urban clinic, residence in a congregate setting, and greater comorbidity were associated with contracting COVID-19. Odds of COVID-19 were 17-fold higher for those residing in a congregated setting (odds ratio [OR], 17.10 [95% CI, 13.51-21.54]). Of the 438 maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, 109 (24.9%) died. Older age, heart disease, and markers of frailty were associated with mortality. LIMITATIONS: No distinction was detected between symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with asymptomatic screening limited by testing capacity during this initial COVID-19 surge period. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is common among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, particularly those residing in congregate settings. Among maintenance dialysis patients with COVID-19, mortality is high, exceeding 20%.","Hsu, Caroline M; Weiner, Daniel E; Aweh, Gideon; Miskulin, Dana C; Manley, Harold J; Stewart, Carol; Ladik, Vlad; Hosford, John; Lacson, Edward C; Johnson, Douglas S; Lacson, Eduardo",Am J Kidney Dis,,317
500339,Cultivating a Better Understanding of COVID-19 Amidst a Shifting Landscape,2020,"Due to comprehensive social distancing measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, medical faculties worldwide have made a virtue of necessity in resorting to online teaching. Medical faculties grapple with how to convey clinical competencies to students in this context. There is a need for research not only to map but also to explain the effect of these secondary measures on students' learning and mental wellbeing. During a period of ongoing comprehensive social distancing measures in Germany, we translated a competency-based curriculum including obstetrics, paediatrics, and human genetics to an e-learning course based on online patient and teacher encounters. In our qualitative study on students' and teachers' views, we identify potential enablers and drivers as well as barriers and challenges to undergraduate medical education under lockdown. In summer 2020, we conducted six focus group interviews to investigate medical students' and teachers' perspectives, experiences and attitudes. All focus groups were videotaped, transcribed verbatim and coded. To guide our deductive and inductive analysis, we applied the theoretical framework of Regmi and Jones. Content analysis was performed in a multi-perspective group. We identified five major themes contributing to a successful use of clinical competency-based e-learning under lockdown: Communication (with teachers, students, and patients), Mental wellbeing, Structure and self-organization, Technical issues, and Learning and commitment. We discuss enablers and potential barriers within all themes and their overlap and link them in an explanatory model. In our setting, students and teachers find e-learning holds strong potential and especially in times of COVID-19 it is greatly appreciated.

The use of technology to guide people during physical education classes has become a great strategy for people who cannot leave their homes. Besides, technology can insert people in an immersive environment increasing their interaction, merriment, improving their immune and cardiovascular systems.

METHODS: A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.","Wang, Zheng-He; Yang, Hai-Lian; Yang, Yun-Qing; Liu, Dan; Li, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Xi-Ru; Zhang, Yu-Jie; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Wu, Xian-Bo; Yang, Xing-Fen; Mao, Chen",J Affect Disord,,317

Studies addressing parameters that may influence COVID-19 progression relied on either the total numbers of detected cases and similar proxies and/or a small number of analyzed factors, including analysis of regions that display a narrow range of these parameters. We here apply a novel approach, exploiting widespread growth regimes in COVID-19 detected case counts. By applying nonlinear dynamics methods to the exponential regime, we extract basic reproductive number R0 (i.e., the measure of COVID-19 inherent biological transmissibility), applying to the completely naive population in the absence of social distancing, for 118 different countries. We then use bioinformatics methods to systematically collect data on a large number of demographics and weather parameters from these countries, and seek their correlations with the rate of COVID-19 spread. In addition to some of the already reported tendencies, we show a number of both novel results and those that help settle existing disputes: the absence of dependence on wind speed and air pressure, negative correlation with precipitation; significant positive correlation with society development level (human development index) irrespective of testing policies, and percent of the urban population, but an absence of correlation with population density per se. We find a strong positive correlation of transmissibility on alcohol consumption, and the absence of correlation on refugee numbers, contrary to some widespread beliefs. Significant tendencies with health-related factors are reported, including a detailed analysis of the blood type group showing consistent tendencies on Rh factor, and a strong positive correlation of transmissibility with cholesterol levels.","Salom, Igor; Rodic, Andjela; Milicevic, Ognjen; Zigic, Dusan; Djordjevic, Magdalena; Djordjevic, Marko",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09682v1.pdf,317

When taking account of demographic, economic, and political factors (but not health-policy related factors) we find that, controlling for population size, cumulative deaths are between 100 and 130% higher in a US state than in a European country. We no longer find a US/EUROPE gap in fatalities from COVID after taking account of how each nation/state implemented social distance measures. This suggests that various types of social distance measures such as school closings and lockdowns, and how soon they were implemented, help explain the US/EUROPE gap in cumulative deaths measured 100 days after the pandemic's onset in a state or country.","Aparicio, Ainoa; Grossbard, Shoshana",Rev Econ Househ,,317

While a 26-nucleotide deletion variant (D26) was only found in one nasopharyngeal sample in March 2020, the 34-nucleotide deletion (D34) was found within a single geriatric hospital unit in 5/9 patients and one health care worker in April 2020. Phylogeny analysis strongly suggested a nosocomial transmission of D34, with potential fecal transmission, as also identified in a stool sample. No difference in disease severity was observed between patients hospitalized in the geriatric unit infected with WT or D34. In vitro D26 and D34 characterization revealed comparable replication kinetics with the wild-type (WT), but differential host immune responses. While interferon-stimulated genes were similarly upregulated after infection with WT and ORF6 variants, the latter specifically induced overexpression of 9 genes coding for inflammatory cytokines in the NF-kB pathway, including CCL2/MCP1, PTX3, and TNF&#945;, for which high plasma levels have been associated with severe COVID-19.

Globally, there is an urgent need to use safe and effective vaccines for immunization to achieve comprehensive protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Focusing on developing a rapid vaccine platform with significant immunogenicity as well as broad and high protection efficiency, we designed a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) displayed on self-assembled ferritin nanoparticles. In a 293i cells eukaryotic expression system, this candidate vaccine was prepared and purified. After rhesus monkeys are immunized with 20 μg of RBD–ferritin nanoparticles three times, the vaccine can elicit specific humoral immunity and T cell immune response, and the neutralizing antibodies can cross-neutralize four SARS-CoV-2 strains from different sources. In the challenge protection test, after nasal infection with 2 × 10(5) CCID50 SARS-CoV-2 virus, compared with unimmunized control animals, virus replication in the vaccine-immunized rhesus monkeys was significantly inhibited, and respiratory pathology observations also showed only slight pathological damage. These analyses will benefit the immunization program of the RBD–ferritin nanoparticle vaccine in the clinical trial design and the platform construction to present a specific antigen domain in the self-assembling nanoparticle in a short time to harvest stable, safe, and effective vaccine candidates for new SARS-CoV-2 isolates.","Li, Heng; Guo, Lei; Zheng, Huiwen; Li, Jing; Zhao, Xin; Li, Jiaqi; Liang, Yan; Yang, Fengmei; Zhao, Yurong; Yang, Jinling; Xue, Mengyi; Zuo, Yuanyuan; Zhou, Jian; Chen, Yanli; Yang, Zening; Li, Yanyan; Jin, Weihua; Shi, Haijing; He, Zhanlong; Li, Qihan; Liu, Longding",Bioconjug Chem,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.1c00208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951913/,317
593115,Challenges and solutions in meeting up the urgent requirement of ventilators for COVID-19 patients,2020-05-05,"The natural products pulchrol and pulchral, isolated from the roots of the Mexican plant Bourreria pulchra, have previously been shown to possess antiparasitic activity towards Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania braziliensis and L. amazonensis, which are protozoa responsible for Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. These infections have been classified as neglected diseases, and still require the development of safer and more efficient alternatives to their current treatments. Recent SARs studies, based on the pulchrol scaffold, showed which effects exchanges of its substituents have on the antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activity. Many of the analogues prepared were shown to be more potent than pulchrol and the current drugs used to treat leishmaniasis and Chagas disease (miltefosine and benznidazole, respectively), in vitro. Moreover, indications of some of the possible interactions that may take place in the binding sites were also identified. In this study, 12 analogues with modifications at two or three different positions in two of the three rings were prepared by synthetic and semi-synthetic procedures. The molecules were assayed in vitro towards T. cruzi epimastigotes, L. braziliensis promastigotes, and L. amazonensis promastigotes. Some compounds had higher antiparasitic activity than the parental compound pulchrol, and in some cases even benznidazole and miltefosine. The best combinations in this subset are with carbonyl functionalities in the A-ring and isopropyl groups in the C-ring, as well as with alkyl substituents in both the A- and C-rings combined with a hydroxyl group in position 1 (C-ring). The latter corresponds to cannabinol, which indeed was shown to be potent towards all the parasites.","Terrazas, Paola; Salamanca, Efrain; Dávila, Marcelo; Manner, Sophie; Gimenez, Alberto; Sterner, Olov",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203527/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26133944,317

This study aimed to explore deeply what learning gains were associated with the use of three serious educational games (SEGs) created for use in secondary biology classrooms that partner teachers implemented during a 2-week curriculum unit. This longitudinal, mixed method study includes a control year, in which we examined how six highly qualified teachers taught students (n = 407) a 2-week curriculum unit addressing cellular biology without the SEGs, followed by 2 years in which the teachers integrated the SEGs into the curriculum unit with students (n =871). Data were collected from multiple sources, including a validated content pre- and post-test measure, embedded gameplay data, participant observation, teacher interviews, and focus groups. Quantitative findings showed significant learning gains associated with students who experienced the game condition during year 2, when compared with the control condition. During the replication year (year 3), learning gains increased again, compared with year two. Although the SEGs did not change between years 2 and 3, teachers were provided real-time access to students’ performance during gameplay. Thematic analysis of observation notes, teacher interviews, and student performance in-game identified four affordances teachers identified related to the use of serious educational games in their classrooms and the extended partnership model employed.

To date, over 60 types of HAdV have been identified. Here, HAdV types are characterized in children in the Beijing area with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) and the clinical features and laboratory findings of hospitalized HAdV-infected cases are described. METHODS: Respiratory specimens were collected from pediatric patients with ALRTIs in the emergency department or from those admitted to Beijing Children’s Hospital between March 2007 and December 2012. Infections with common respiratory viruses were determined by PCR or RT-PCR. HAdV positive samples were further typed by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among 3356 patients with ALRTIs, 194 (5.8 %) were found to have HAdV infection. HAdV infection was primarily confined to children (88.35 %) less than 5 years of age. A total of 11 different types of HAdV were detected throughout the study period, with HAdV-B7 (49.0 %) and HAdV-B3 (26.3 %) as the most prevalent types, followed by HAdV-C2 (7.7 %) and HAdVC1 (4.6 %). Newly emerging and re-emergent types or variants, HAdV-B55 (n = 5), HAdV-C57 (n = 3), and HAdV-B14p1 (n = 1), were identified. Results also included the reported first case of co-infection with HAdV-C2 and HAdV-C57. Clinical entities of patients with single HAdV infection (n = 49) were similar to those with mixed HAdV/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (n = 41). Patients with HAdV-B7 infection had longer duration of fever and higher serum levels of muscle enzymes than HAdV-B3-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B3 were the predominant types identified in pediatric ALRTIs. HAdV-B7 infection tends to have more severe clinical consequences. The presence of newly emerging types or variants and co-infection with different types of HAdV highlights the need for constant and close surveillance of HAdV infection.","Liu, Chunyan; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Jing; Ren, Lili; Li, Jianguo; Xie, Zhengde; Xu, Baoping; Yang, Yan; Qian, Suyun; Wang, Jianwei; Shen, Kunling",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26429778/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1126-2,317

Compared to adults, the most significant change in viral disease manifestation is encompassed by the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a new inflammatory syndrome which develops 2–4 weeks after COVID-19 exposure, with evidence suggesting it is a post-infectious immune reaction. We describe its epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis (which varies based on definition used) and treatment options based on published recommendations. A systematic literature search we conducted through MEDLINE yielded 518 abstracts and identified five studies that reported more than 100 cases of MIS-C and their mortality. Most cases developed multiorgan dysfunction, including cardiovascular, dermatologic, neurological, renal, and respiratory issues, and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Many patients admitted to the ICU needed inotrope support and invasive mechanical ventilation, and the most severe cases required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Most clinicians treated MIS-C with intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroids, and biological therapies. Overall mortality was low (2–3%) in all studies. Further research is needed to: understand if early intervention can prevent its progression; optimize its treatment; and improve outcomes of this new syndrome for the patients who develop MIS-C.

To learn from our experience, we described the critical care response to the outbreak. METHODS: This is a case study of the response of the Intensive Care Department (75-bed capacity) at a tertiary-care hospital to COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a high number of critically ill patients. RESULTS: Between March 1 and July 31, 2020, 822 patients were admitted to the adult non-cardiac ICUs with suspected (72%)/confirmed (38%) COVID-19. At the peak of the surge, 125 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were managed on single day. To accommodate these numbers, the bed capacity of 4 ICUs was increased internally from 58 to 71 beds (+40%) by cohorting 2 patients/room in selected rooms; forty additional ICUs beds were created in 2 general wards; one cardiac ICU was converted to managed non-COVID-19 general ICU patients and one ward was used as a stepdown for COVID-19 patients. To manage respiratory failure, 53 new ICU ventilators, 90 helmets for non-invasive ventilation and 47 high-flow nasal cannula machines were added to the existing capacity. Dedicated medical teams cared for the COVID-19 patients to prevent cross-contamination. The nurse-to-patient and RT-to-patient ratio remained mostly 1:1 and 1:6, respectively. One-hundred-ten ward nurses were up-skilled to care for COVID-19 and other ICU patients using tiered staffing model. Daily executive rounds were conducted to identify patients for transfer and at least 10 beds were made available for new COVID-19 admissions/day. The consumption of PPE increased multiple fold compared with the period preceding the pandemic. Regular family visits were not allowed and families were updated daily by videoconferencing and phone calls. CONCLUSIONS: Our ICU response to the COVID-19 pandemic required almost doubling ICU bed capacity and changing multiple aspects of ICU workflow to be able to care for high numbers of affected patients.","Al-Dorzi, Hasan M.; Aldawood, Abdulaziz S.; Almatrood, Amal; Burrows, Victoria; Naidu, Brintha; Alchin, John D.; Alhumedi, Haifaa; Tashkandi, Nabeeha; Al-Jahdali, Hamdan; Hussain, Arif; Harbi, Mohammed Khulaif Al; Zaibag, Muayed Al; Salih, Salih Bin; Shamrani, Majid Mousa Al; Alsaawi, Abdulmohsen; Arabi, Yaseen M.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627058/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034121003087?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.09.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034121003087,317

598809,A New Triple Threat,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by the development of a deleterious hyperinflammatory response, in which the pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 plays a pivotal role. The administration of immunomodulatory therapies has been proposed to revert the tissue damage induced by COVID-19-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The present review summarizes the biological rationale and available clinical experience with this therapeutic strategy in the specific scenario solid organ transplantation (SOT). RECENT FINDINGS: A number of case reports, case series, and non-controlled cohort studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal tocilizumab in SOT (namely kidney transplantation) recipients with COVID-19 pneumonia and CRS. Although the heterogeneity in patient management and the lack of a control group limit the interpretation of these results, tocilizumab therapy appears to provide some clinical benefit in post-transplant COVID-19 and to be reasonably safe in terms of bacterial superinfection. A large randomized clinical trial (RCT) has shown survival benefit with adjuvant corticosteroids in non-transplant patients, but supporting evidence is scarce for SOT recipients and confounded by the variable adjustment of baseline immunosuppression. Anecdotal experiences have been reported with the use of the anti-IL-1 agent anakinra and the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor colchicine in this population. SUMMARY: Immunomodulation has emerged as a promising option for SOT recipients with COVID-19-related CRS, with available experience mainly restricted to the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab. However, the supporting evidence is scarce and of low quality. In the absence of RCT, observational studies including well-matched control groups should be designed in future.","Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Aguado, José María",Curr Transplant Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40472-020-00306-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110739/,317

Within the CNS, JCPyV predominately targets two cell types: oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The underlying mechanisms of astrocytic infection are poorly understood, yet recent findings suggest critical differences in JCPyV infection of primary astrocytes compared to a widely studied immortalized cell model. RNA sequencing was performed in primary normal human astrocytes (NHAs) to analyze the transcriptomic profile that emerges during JCPyV infection. Through a comparative analysis, it was validated that JCPyV requires the mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, and additionally requires the expression of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Specifically, the expression of DUSP1 is needed to establish a successful infection in NHAs, yet this was not observed in an immortalized cell model of JCPyV infection. Additional analyses demonstrated immune activation uniquely observed in NHAs. These results support the hypothesis that DUSPs within the MAPK/ERK pathway impact viral infection and influence potential downstream targets and cellular pathways. Collectively, this research implicates DUSP1 in JCPyV infection of primary human astrocytes, and most importantly, further resolves the signaling events that lead to successful JCPyV infection in the CNS.","Wilczek, Michael P.; Armstrong, Francesca J.; Geohegan, Remi P.; Mayberry, Colleen L.; DuShane, Jeanne K.; King, Benjamin L.; Maginnis, Melissa S.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578413/,317

The aim of the study was to compare diagnostic performance of admission chest CT and LUS for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: We included patients admitted to emergency department between February 21-March 6, 2020 (high prevalence group, HP) and between March 30-April 13, 2020 (moderate prevalence group, MP) undergoing LUS and chest CT within 12 h. Chest CT was considered positive in case of “indeterminate”/“typical” pattern for COVID-19 by RSNA classification system. At LUS, thickened pleural line with ≥ three B-lines at least in one zone of the 12 explored was considered positive. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC were calculated for CT and LUS against real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology as reference standard. RESULTS: The study included 486 patients (males 61 %; median age, 70 years): 247 patients in HP (COVID-19 prevalence 94 %) and 239 patients in MP (COVID-19 prevalence 45 %). In HP and MP respectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90–95 %, 43–69 %, 96−72 %, 20–95 % for CT and 94−93 %, 7–31 %, 94−52 %, 7–83 % for LUS. CT demonstrated better performance than LUS in diagnosis of COVID-19, both in HP (AUC 0.75 vs 0.51; P < 0.001) and MP (AUC 0.85 vs 0.62; P < 0.001).

Fortunately, the risk of neonatal infection via perinatal/postnatal transmission is low when recommended precautions are followed. However, the psychosocial implications of these practices and racial/ethnic disparities highlighted by this pandemic must also be addressed when caring for mothers and their newborns. This review provides a comprehensive overview of neonatal–perinatal perspectives of COVID-19, ranging from the basic science of infection and recommendations for care of pregnant women and neonates to important psychosocial, ethical, and racial/ethnic topics emerging as a result of both the pandemic and the response of the healthcare community to the care of infected individuals.","Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Beam, Kristyn S.; Bernardini, Laura B.; Ramos, Erika G.

606594,Vitamin D supplementation and energy and metabolic homoeostasis in obese and overweight subjects: a protocol for a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinicians have reported an increase in functional tic‐like behaviours in children and youth during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We describe adults developing rapid onset of functional tic‐like behaviours between May 2020 and June 2021. METHODS: Data were analysed from the Adult Tic Disorders Registry, a single‐site,12‐month prospective cohort study that began enrolment in January 2021. We compared clinical features of participants with Tourette syndrome or persistent motor/vocal tic disorder to participants with rapid onset tic‐like behaviours. RESULTS: Thirty‐three participants registered between January and June of 2021; nine had rapid onset tic‐like behaviours, and 24 had Tourette syndrome or persistent motor tic disorder. Participants with rapid onset tic‐like behaviours were younger (19.9 vs. 38.6 years, p = 0.003), had older age at onset (15.3 vs. 10.1, p = 0.0009), and were more likely female (p < 0.0001). They had higher motor and vocal tic severity and impairment scores (all p < 0.01) and were more likely to have complex arm/hand motor tics (p < 0.0001), complex vocal tics (p < 0.0001), and coprolalia (p = 0.004). They had significantly higher scores on all mental health symptom self‐report measures (all p < 0.05) and were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with depression (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features that help differentiate rapid onset tic‐like behaviours from Tourette syndrome or persistent motor tic disorder include their phenomenology, onset age, and clinical course. Rapid onset tic‐like behaviours are a distinct subtype of functional neurological disorder that has emerged during the COVID‐19 pandemic in young people and appears to be strongly socially influenced.","Pringsheim, Tamara; Martino, Davide",Eur J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.15034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293224/,317

A good knowledge of the main features of hospitalized patients during the complete lockdown should improve the management of new COVID-19 surges. All patients hospitalized at one large tertiary hospital in Madrid for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia from March 1 to May 31 were retrospectively identified. A total of 1752 patients were admitted with suspected pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 3-month study period. The peak of daily admissions (n = 84) was reached on March 24, whereas the maximal cumulative number of hospitalized patients (n = 626) occurred on March 30. Overall, 85.3% had a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at least once during admission. Their median age was 65 (54–77) and 59.9% were male. The median length of hospitalization was of 7 (4–13) days. Roughly 6.5% were admitted at the intensive care unit. Death occurred in 242 (13.8%). Overall, 75% of deaths occurred in patients older than 75 years-old. It was 38.2% in patients hospitalized older than 80 years-old versus 2.2% in patients younger than 60 years-old (p < 0.001). Up to 94 (38.8%) of deceased patients had been transferred from nursing homes. The median Charlson co-morbidity score was 6 in deceased patients. The in-hospital mortality rate during the first wave of COVID-19 in Madrid was 14%. It was largely driven by older age, the presence of underlying chronic conditions (≥2) and living at nursing homes.","Moreno-Torres, Victor; de la Fuente, Sara; Mills, Patricia; Muñoz, Alejandro; Muñez, Elena; Ramos, Antonio; Fernández-Cruz, Ana; Arias, Ana; Pintos, Ilduara; Vargas, Juan Antonio; Cuervas-Mons, Valentín; de Mendoza, Carmen",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879741/,317
612386,Cardiac biomarker-based risk stratification algorithm in patients with severe COVID-19,2020-06-18,"Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encode multifunctional proteases that are essential for viral replication and evasion of host innate immune mechanisms. The papain-like protease PLpro cleaves the viral polyprotein, and reverses inflammatory ubiquitin and anti-viral ubiquitin-like ISG15 protein modifications1,2. Drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (hereafter, SARS2 PLpro) may hence be effective as treatments or prophylaxis for COVID-19, reducing viral load and reinstating innate immune responses3. We here characterise SARS2 PLpro in molecular and biochemical detail. SARS2 PLpro cleaves Lys48-linked polyubiquitin and ISG15 modifications with high activity. Structures of PLpro bound to ubiquitin and ISG15 reveal that the S1 ubiquitin binding site is responsible for high ISG15 activity, while the S2 binding site provides Lys48 chain specificity and cleavage efficiency. We further exploit two strategies to target PLpro. A repurposing approach, screening 3727 unique approved drugs and clinical compounds against SARS2 PLpro, identified no compounds that inhibited PLpro consistently or that could be validated in counterscreens. More promisingly, non-covalent small molecule SARS PLpro inhibitors were able to inhibit SARS2 PLpro with high potency and excellent antiviral activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection models.","Klemm, Theresa; Ebert, Gregor; Calleja, Dale J.; Allison, Cody C.; Richardson, Lachlan W.; Bernardini, Jonathan P.; Lu, Bernadine G.

613130,"Severity of Pneumonia in Under 5-Year-Old Children from Developing Countries: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study",2017-07-12,"SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has rapidly replaced the Alpha variant around the world. The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.","Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Johnson, Bryan A.; Xia, Hongjie; Ku, Zhiqiang; Schindewolf, Craig; Widen, Steven G.; An, Zhiqiang; Weaver, Scott C.; Menachery, Vineet D.; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462752/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456173,317

In this study, we investigated the host–guest interaction between the popular supramolecule calix[4]arene derivatives and the favipiravir drug by using the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. The B3LYP hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative adsorption energy (∆E) and adsorption enthalpy (∆H) calculated for the complexes formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in the study, Gibbs free energy change (∆G) value for the adsorption was only negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations were performed by examining the C=O, O–H and NH(2) vibrational frequencies to see the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMO–LUMO gap values decreased significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined. Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature. Based on the calculations made to see the solvent effect on the adsorption of favipiravir it was determined that it did not affect the interaction between the drug molecule and the calix[4]arene compound too much and the adsorption energy turned into a slightly less negative value.","Yuksel, Numan; Köse, Ahmet; Fellah, M.

This generates a massive production of papers including pre-clinical, clinical and revisions but till now no specific treatment were identified. Meanwhile, like other coronavirus infections, COVID-19 leads to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting in hyperinflammation, exacerbated immune response and multiple organ dysfunctions indicating that drugs that modulate this response, as glucocorticoids could be a treatment option. However glucocorticoids have several side effects or usage limitations. In this sense a drug with anti-inflammatory effects and capable to reduce inflammation but with less after-effects could be a powerful tool to combat COVID-19. Thus the Ac2-26 Mimetic Peptide of Annexin A1 emerges as a possible therapy. The peptide has many anti-inflammatory effects described including the reduction of interleukin (IL)-6, one of the main mediators of cytokine storm syndrome. Therefore the hypothesis to use the Ac2-26 peptide to treat severe COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper.","Gustavo Bonavita, Andre",Med Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110352; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720331418?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720331418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129009/,317

The primary purpose of this study is to review and present current evidence and recommendations for personal protective equipment and safety recommendations for orthopaedic surgeons and trauma surgeons. METHODS: A systematic review of the available literature was performed using the keyword terms “COVID-19”, “Coronavirus”, “surgeon”, “health-care workers”, “protection”, “masks”, “gloves”, “gowns”, “helmets”, and “aerosol” in several combinations. The following databases were assessed: Pubmed, Cochrane Reviews, Google Scholar. Due to the paucity of available data, it was decided to present it in a narrative manner. In addition, participating doctors were asked to provide their guidelines for PPE in their countries (Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany, UK) for consideration in the presented practice recommendations. RESULTS: World Health Organization guidance for respiratory aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) such as intubation in a COVID19 environment was clear and included the use of an FFP3 (filtering face piece level 3) mask and face protection. However, the recommendation for surgical AGPs, such as the use of high-speed power tools in the operating theatre, was not clear until the UK Public Health England (PHE) guidance of 27 March 2020. This guidance included FFP3 masks and face protection, which UK surgeons quickly adopted. The recommended PPE for orthopaedic surgeons, working in a COVID19 environment, should consist of level 4 surgical gowns, face shields or goggles, double gloves, FFP2-3 or N95-99 respirator masks. An alternative to the mask, face shield and goggles is a powered air-purifying respirator, particularly if the surgeons fail the mask fit test or are required to undertake a long procedure. However, there is a high cost and limited availabilty of these devices at present. Currently available surgical helmets and toga systems may not be the solution due to a permeable top for air intake. During the current COVID-19 crisis, it appeared that telemedicine can be considered as an electronic personal protective equipment by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination. CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic and trauma surgery using power tools, pulsatile lavage and electrocautery are surgical aerosol-generating procedures and all body fluids contain virus particles. Raising awareness of these issues will help avoid occupational transmission of COVID-19 to the surgical team by aerosolization of blood or other body fluids and hence adequate PPE should be available and used during orthopaedic surgery. In addition, efforts have to be made to improve the current evidence in this regard.

We described the changes in chest CT to enable better understanding of the progression of COVID-19 during hospitalization. METHODS: Consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted from January 11, 2020 to February 16, 2020 and followed until March 26, 2020 at the Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen, China were included. Semi- quantitative analysis was used to assess the shape, distribution, and range of lung lesions. For each image, the lungs were divided into six regions. The total CT score was the sum of individual region scores. RESULTS: 305 patients underwent a total of 1442 chest CT scans with a mean interval of 5 days (interquartile range (IQR) = 3−6 days). All patients were discharged after an average hospitalization of 25 days (IQR = 20−33 days). From the onset of initial symptoms, the total CT score peaked at an earlier date in the non-severe than the severe cases (13 days versus 15 days). Typical CT image of non-severe cases mainly presented as ground-glass opacities (GGO), whilst GGO mixed with consolidation was more seen in severe cases. In addition, severe versus non-severe cases had higher prevalence of fibrosis and air bronchogram in CT scans (P from <0.001 to 0.05, P = 0.001, respectively). The proportion of patients with fibrosis and air bronchogram appeared to decrease from the fourth (20 days from onset, IQR = 16–24) and the third pulmonary CT scan (15 days from onset, IQR = 12–19), respectively. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated progressions in early stage, with the greatest pulmonary damage on CT occurred at approximately 13 days after initial onset of symptoms. Worse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were found in severe cases, indicating continuous health care for pulmonary rehabilitation and consecutive follow-up to monitor irreversible fibrosis and consolidation are necessary.","Yun, Yongxing; Wang, Ying; Hao, Yuantao; Xu, Lin; Cai, Qingxian",Eur J Radiol Open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047720300940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392360/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047720300940; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100305,317

Clinical manifestations vary from silent infection to severe pneumonia, disseminated thrombosis, multi‐organ failure, and death. COVID‐19 pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated, while increasing evidence suggests that disease phenotypes are strongly related to the virus‐induced immune system's dysregulation. Indeed, when the virus‐host cross talk is out of control, the occurrence of an aberrant systemic inflammatory reaction, named “cytokine storm,” leads to a detrimental impairment of the adaptive immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen‐presenting cells able to support innate immune and promote adaptive responses. Besides, DCs play a key role in the anti‐viral defense.

The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulfate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport.

While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. The rapid emergence of this sub-B.1 clade with recurrent I82T mutation suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.","Shen, Lishuang; Bard, Jennifer Dien; Triche, Timothy J.; Judkins, Alexander R.; Biegel, Jaclyn A.; Gai, Xiaowu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.434758,317
628477,Proposed integrative model for post-COVID symptoms,2021-06-01,"Publisher Summary This chapter is about components of volunteer blood donations that are each transfused as a single unit. A single donation of a pint of whole blood is virtually always separated by centrifugation into a unit of red blood cells and a unit of plasma; a unit of platelets or a unit of cryoprecipitated plasma can also be prepared, but this is done for less than half of whole blood donations, since patients' clinical needs for platelets and cryoprecipitated plasma are much less than patients' needs for red blood cell transfusion. Each of these units is labeled, and regulated as a drug, following FDA regulations. While today virtually all of these blood components from whole blood donation are from volunteer donors, the FDA would permit paying these donors, but requires that the component's label be marked conspicuously with the words “PAID DONOR” as opposed to “VOLUNTEER DONOR.” Whole blood donation is permitted no more often than once every eight weeks. Most of the plasma separated from red blood cell units is not needed for direct transfusion to patients, and so it is provided as “Recovered Plasma” to large multinational for-profit companies that pool and fractionate it into plasma derivatives. The major source of plasma for plasma derivative manufacture, however, is “Source Plasma” collected by plasmapheresis.","Page, Peter L.; Pizer, H.

Although, global experts and policy makers have agreed on this theory, the transition from a vision to practical application is inconspicuous. COVID-19 pandemic has caused massive damage to the world economy and continues to peril human lives everywhere. Ignorance of the principles of One Health approach in the current health care system has proved to be the Achilles heel of our health policy. Social distancing, lockdown, and hand hygiene are short-term preventive measures imposed by nations worldwide but are difficult to sustain in the long run. Thus, it is long overdue that we change our unidimensional approach regarding the control and prevention of diseases. A rational practice of the One Health strategy should be our utmost priority to control the ongoing grave situation. The purpose of this article is to bring the attention of healthcare professionals and researchers toward the One Health paradigm for the betterment of public health while combating COVID-19 and to prepare for future emergence of infectious diseases. Our assessment for this review is based on the philosophy and views shared by recent publications on the One Health approach which emphasizes an integrated, multisectoral, and holistic concept (animal health-human health-environmental factors) and promotes a transdisciplinary-integrated tactic for disease prevention and control.","Jorwal, Pooja; Bharadwaj, Swati; Jorwal, Pankaj",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1058_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33681013/,317

Pigs are amplifying hosts of JEV and thought to be maintained in nature predominantly by avian-mosquito cycles. In the innate immune system, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) is a small transmembrane protein family and has been identified as the first line of defense against a broad range of RNA virus invasion. In this paper, we found that swine IFITM (sIFITM) could restrict the replication of both JEV vaccine strain and wild strain NJ-2008. The cysteine S-palmitoylation modification of sIFITM plays important roles in their anti-JEV effects and intracellular distributions. Our findings show the anti-JEV activities of swine interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins and broaden the antiviral spectrum of IFITM protein family. The preliminary exploration of S-palmitoylation modification of sIFITM may contribute to understanding of the antiviral molecular mechanism of sIFITM.","Xu, Zhao; Li, Xiaoling; Xue, Jichu; Shen, Lingyi; Zheng, Wenming; Yin, Sugai; Xu, Jun",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838949/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268222030115X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268222030115X?v=s5,317

A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3. Thus, policies for reducing obesity and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are most needed to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women.","Martinez-Portilla, R.

However, there are only a few reports on patients' willingness to be vaccinated. This study investigated the willingness of Chinese outpatients to accept COVID-19 vaccination as well as influencing factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Jiangsu province, China in December 2020. Self-administered questionnaires, which were distributed to 625 outpatients among secondary hospitals, addressed demographic characteristics, sociological characteristics, and subjective reasons. There were 522 (83.5%) participants who gave completely valid responses. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for willingness of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: 71.5% of participants were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. ""worried about contracting COVID-19"" (49.6%) and ""vaccines have just been introduced and need time to consider"" (38.9%) were the main reasons for being willing and unwilling to receive COVID-19 vaccine, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that ""vaccines are an effective way to prevent diseases"" (OR = 5.07, 95%CI: 3.32-7.75), ""the price you are willing to pay for non-free vaccines (yuan) (101-500 vs &#8804;100)â³ (OR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.16-3.02), ""per capital monthly income(yuan) (>6000 vs &#8804;3000)""(OR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.03-4.41), and ""self- assessed health status (Good vs Bad)â³ (OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.01-2.90) were the main risk factors for outpatients to be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The willingness of Chinese outpatients to receive COVID-19 vaccine was not high. The government should do more to increase publicity of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine thus increasing willingness to vaccinate, and provide free vaccine to eliminate the cost impact.","Zhang, Di; Cui, Qi; Xu, Junyi; Cai, Jian; Lu, Xiaoping; Yang, Yinguang",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348592/; https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1954441,317

There is a lack of effective methods to predict indoor contaminant distribution primarily because of uncertainty of the contaminant concentration in supply air which in turn due to the mixing ratio of fresh and recirculation air. In this paper, a versatile numerical method to determine the pollutant distribution of ventilation system with recirculation at steady state is proposed based on typical ventilation systems with accessibility of supply air (ASA) and accessibility of contaminant source (ACS). The relationship is established between contaminant concentrations of supply air and return air in a ventilated room or zone. The concentrations of supply air and contaminant distribution in each room can be determined using such parameters as ASA and ACS. The proposed method is validated by both experimental data and numerical simulation result. The computing speed of the proposed method is compared with the iteration method. The comparisons between the proposed method and the lumped parameter model are also conducted. The advantages of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, speed and versatility make it advantageous to be applied in air quality control of complex ventilation systems with recirculation.","Li, Xianting; Shao, Xiaoliang; Ma, Xiaojun; Zhang, Yuanhui; Cai, Hao",J Hazard Mater,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389411005474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21641112/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.04.108; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389411005474,317

An online-based cross-sectional survey, using a web-based interviewing technique, was conducted to collect data on DHL. Simple bivariate and multivariate linear regression was performed to assess the association of key characteristics with DHL. The results show a high DHL related to COVID-19 in 54.3% of students. Most of the Pakistani students demonstrated ~50% DHL in all dimensions, except for reliability. Multivariate findings showed that gender, sense of coherence and importance of information were found to be significantly associated with DHL. However, a negative association was observed with students′ satisfaction with information.

We conducted an exploratory single-center analysis to estimate the change in number of new stroke diagnoses in our region, and evaluate the proximate reasons for this change during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary care center in New Jersey. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Comprehensive Stroke Center prospective cohort was retrospectively analyzed for the number of stroke admissions, demographic features, and short-term outcomes 5 months prior to 3/1/2020 (pre-COVID-19), and in the 6 weeks that followed (COVID-19 period). The primary outcome was the number of new acute stroke diagnoses before and during the COVID-19 period, as well as the potential reasons for a decline in the number of new diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 328 included patients, 53 (16%) presented in the COVID-19 period. There was a mean fall of 38% in new stroke diagnoses (mean 1.13/day [SD 1.07] from 1.82/day [SD 1.38], p<0.01), which was related to a 59% decline in the number of daily transfers from referral centers (p<0.01), 25% fewer telestroke consultations (p=0.08), and 55% fewer patients presenting directly to our institution by private vehicle (p<0.01) and 29% fewer patients through emergency services (p=0.09). There was no significant change in the monthly number of strokes due to large vessel occlusion (LVO), however the proportion of new LVOs nearly doubled in the COVID-19 period (38% vs. 21%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The observations at our tertiary care corroborate anecdotal reports that the number of new stroke diagnoses is falling, which seems related to a smaller proportion of patients seeking healthcare services for milder symptoms. These preliminary data warrant validation in larger, multi-center studies.","Siegler, J.E.; Heslin, M.E.; Thau, L.; Smith, A.; Jovin, T.G.",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105230572030361X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410808/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105230572030361X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.104953,317

DESIGN: Multivariate analysis with population weights. SETTING: Two hundred eighty-seven American Indian Reservations and tribal homelands (in Oklahoma) and, as of April 10, 2020, 861 COVID-19 cases on these reservation lands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between rate per 1000 individuals of publicly reported COVID-19 cases at the tribal reservation and/or community level and average household characteristics from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey records. RESULTS: By April 10, 2020, in regression analysis, COVID-19 cases were more likely by the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing (10.83, P = .001) and were less likely according to the percentage of reservation households that were English-only (−2.43, P = .03). Household overcrowding measures were not statistically significant in this analysis (−6.40, P = .326). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for the lack of complete indoor plumbing and access to potable water in a pandemic may be an important determinant of the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases. Access to relevant information that is communicated in the language spoken by many reservation residents may play a key role in the spread of COVID-19 in some tribal communities. Household overcrowding does not appear to be associated with COVID-19 infections in our data at the current time. Previous studies have identified household plumbing and overcrowding, and language, as potential pandemic and disease infection risk factors. These risk factors persist.

The characteristics of patients with diabetes vulnerable to this infection are less specified. We aim to present the characteristics of patients with diabetes admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Design: A retrospective case series. Setting: A single clinical centre in the UK. Methods We have retrospectively collected the demographics, medical characteristics and outcome of all patients with diabetes admitted to hospital over two-week period with COVID-19 infection. All cases were diagnosed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal and nasal swabs. Results A total of 71 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period of whom 16 (22.5%) patients had diabetes and were included in this case series. There was no significant difference between patients with compared to those without diabetes regarding age, gender or clinical presentation. However, comorbidities were more common in patients with diabetes specially hypertension {75% v 36.4%, a difference of 38.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5 to 58.3} and chronic kidney disease (37.5 v 5.5, a difference of 32% (1.6 to 51.6). Patients with diabetes were significantly more obese than those without diabetes (56.2% v 21.8% a difference of 34.4%, 95% CI 7.7 to 61.1). About one third (31.3%) of patients with diabetes were frail. Mean {standard deviation (SD)} duration of diabetes was 10 (2.8) years and mean (SD) HbA1c was 60.3 (15.6) mmol/mol. The use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was common (37.5%, 25% and 18.8% respectively). There was no significant difference in the outcomes between patients with compared to those without diabetes. Conclusion Patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 were significantly more obese and had high prevalence of comorbidities than those without diabetes. Other features of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 infection included long duration of diabetes, less tight glycaemic control and common use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs and NSAIDs.","Conway, J.; Gould, A.; Westley, R.; Raju, S.; Oklopcic, A.; Broadbent, A.; Abdelhafiz, AH.; Sinclair, AJ.",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720307130; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720307130?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971153/,317

All concentrated water samples produced substantial cytopathic effects on the Vero, HEK 293, Hela and A549 cell lines. These results indicate the potential of viruses in the water samples especially from the lower catchment areas of the Umgeni River to infect human hosts throughout the year. The present study highlights the importance of routine environmental surveillance of human enteric viruses in water sources. This can contribute to a better understanding of the actual burden of disease on those who might be using the water directly without treatment.","Ganesh, Atheesha; Lin, Johnson; Singh, Moganavelli",Clean (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313584/; https://doi.org/10.1002/clen.201200564,317
644825,A quantitative assessment of the contribution of “citizen First Responder” in the adult out-of-hospital chain of survival during COVID-19 pandemic,2021-07-25,"Background: Diagnostic tests and examinations inform clinical decision making. Thus, an essential part of medical students’ workplace-based training is dedicated to core skills in clinical diagnostic sciences. Due to a reduction of clinical internships for fifth-year students in the wake of COVID-19 learning activities replacing this aspect of training were needed. Project description: Virtual Patient online learning materials addressing clinical diagnostic sciences, specifically, radiology, were developed to prepare students for the transition to workplace-based learning. Three types of activities related to interprofessional patient treatment, showing how radiology knowledge improves the diagnosing and treatment of patients, were used to design the narrative of each virtual patient. The materials also showed students “how to learn” in the clinical workplace while showing “what to learn”. Students complete relevant tasks and compare their approach with experts’ approach in a self-directed way. Results: Twenty self-study quizzes, accompanied by nine interactive Webinars were developed, providing 13% of the overall available replacement learning materials for the summer term 2020. In June 2020, 486 students completed the program and collected a mean share of 16% (SD=10) of their required credits by choosing to learn with these materials. Conclusion: Developing virtual patients based on three types of clinical activities to prepare students for the transition to workplace based learning proved successful and allowed rapid development of learning materials. The presented online quiz format and webinar format showed high acceptance and interest among students.","Wagner-Menghin, Michaela; Szenes, Victor; Scharitzer, Martina; Pokieser, Peter",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364370/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001384,317

Deep learning was reported to discover intricate structures from clinical images and achieve expert-level performance in medical image analysis. To develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework on chest CT images for auto-detection of NCP, particularly focusing on differentiating NCP from influenza pneumonia (IP). Methods: 35 confirmed NCP cases were consecutively enrolled as training set from 1138 suspected patients in three NCP designated hospitals together with 361 confirmed viral pneumonia patients from center one including 156 IP patients, from May, 2015 to February, 2020. The external validation set enrolled 57 NCP patients and 50 IP patients from eight centers. Results: 96.6% of NCP lesions were larger than 1 cm and 76.8% were with intensity below -500 Hu, indicating less consolidation than IP lesions which had nodules ranging 5-10 mm. The classification schemes accurately distinguished NCP and IP lesions with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) above 0.93. The Trinary scheme was more device-independent and consistent with specialists than the Plain scheme, which achieved a F1 score of 0.847, higher than the Plain scheme (0.774), specialists (0.785) and residents (0.644).

This study investigates the correlation between the degree of accelerated diffusion and lethality of COVID-19 and the surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region, Italy. Daily average concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) in two size fractions PM2.5, PM10 and maxima PM10 ground level atmospheric pollutants together air quality and climate variables (daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure field and Planetary Boundary Layer-PBL height) collected during 1 January–30 April 2020 were analyzed. In spite of being considered primarily transmitted by indoor bioaerosols droplets and infected surfaces, or direct human-to-human personal contacts, it seems that high levels of urban air pollution, weather and specific climate conditions have a significant impact on the increased rates of confirmed COVID-19 Total number, Daily New and Total Deaths cases, possible attributed not only to indoor but also to outdoor airborne bioaerosols distribution. Our analysis demonstrates the strong influence of daily averaged ground levels of particulate matter concentrations, positively associated with average surface air temperature and inversely related to air relative humidity on COVID-19 cases outbreak in Milan. Being a novel pandemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) version, COVID-19 might be ongoing during summer conditions associated with higher temperatures and low humidity levels. Presently is not clear if this protein “spike” of the new coronavirus COVID-19 is involved through attachment mechanisms on indoor or outdoor airborne aerosols in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host in some agglomerated urban areas like Milan is.","Zoran, Maria A.; Savastru, Roxana S.; Savastru, Dan M.; Tautan, Marina N.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720333453?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32512362/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720333453; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139825,317

In this multicenter retrospective study, we reviewed charts of patients admitted with symptomatic COVID-19 infection and STEMI to a total of 4 hospitals spanning Italy, Lithuania, Spain and Iraq from February 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. A total of 78 patients were included in this study, 49 (63%) of whom were men, with a median age of 65 [58, 71] years, and high comorbidity burden. During hospitalization, 8 (10%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 14 (18%) required mechanical ventilation. 19 (24%) patients were treated with primary PCI and 59 (76%) were treated with fibrinolytic therapy. 13 (17%) patients required cardiac resuscitation, and 9 (11%) died. For the 19 patients treated with primary PCI, 8 (42%) required intubation and 8 (42%) required cardiac resuscitation; stent thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (21%). A total of 5 patients (26%) died during hospitalization. 50 (85%) of the 59 patients initially treated with fibrinolytic therapy had successful fibrinolysis.

Plasma levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) against the viral spike or nucleoprotein were determined for 25,091 individuals enrolled in a surveillance program in Wuhan, China. We compared 405 asymptomatic individuals who mounted a detectable antibody response with 459 symptomatic COVID-19 patients. The well-defined duration of the SARS-CoV-2 endemic in Wuhan allowed a side-by-side comparison of antibody responses following symptomatic and asymptomatic infections without subsequent antigen re-exposure. IgM responses rapidly declined in both groups. However, both the prevalence and durability of IgG responses and neutralizing capacities correlated positively with symptoms. Regardless of sex, age, and body weight, asymptomatic individuals lost their SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies more often and rapidly than symptomatic patients did.

To assess changes in Emotional Intelligence Appraisal (EIA) scores following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for pharmacy students within a voluntary co-curricular leadership development program.Methods. Participants from the Class of 2021 (pandemic group) completed an EIA self-assessment near the beginning of the leadership program (August 2019, pre-pandemic) and end of the program (July 2020, during peak first-wave COVID-19 activity) and wrote an accompanying self-reflection. To determine changes in emotional intelligence potentially attributable to COVID-19, differences in EIA scores from the pandemic group were compared to the pooled results of previous program cohorts (Classes of 2017-2019). Prevalent themes in student self-reflections were also highlighted.Results. A total of 35 student leaders comprised the pandemic group, with 166 students included within the control group. The proportion of students with final EIA scores indicating high emotional intelligence was greater for the pandemic group (74.3% vs 50.6%). While both groups had increased final EIA scores compared to baseline values, score increases were significantly higher for the pandemic group with respect to overall emotional intelligence and relationship management. Students commented that the pandemic highlighted the importance of emotional intelligence during stressful situations, though the lack of in-person interaction was noted as a limitation for social development.Conclusion. Pharmacy students participating in a leadership development program during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced greater increases in emotional intelligence than pre-pandemic cohorts.

Materials and methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted to include all the admitted patients (n = 191) having COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive, and evaluated those for prognosis and disease outcome by utilizing several biochemical and hematological markers. Results: Amongst the patients admitted in the ward versus in the intensive care unit (ICU), there were significant differences in mean hemoglobin (P = 0.003), total leukocyte count (P = 0.001), absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001), absolute monocyte count (P = 0.019), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte ratio (LMR) (P < 0.001), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and Lymphocyte-to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) (P = 0.002), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (P < 0.001). Amongst the deceased patients, there was significant leukocytosis (P = 0.008), neutrophilia and lymphopenia (P < 0.001), increased NLR (P = 0.001), decreased LMR (P < 0.001), increased PLR (p = 0.017), decreased LCR (p = 0.003), and elevated CRP level (P < 0.001).

658192,Daily glucose variation influenced by the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients treated in Lima-Peru,2021-06-29,"To address the need for a safe, efficacious vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the critical properties of enabling both blocking viral entry into cells and clearing virus from cells already infected, we have developed a bivalent, human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) SARS-CoV-2 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine that is currently in clinical testing. This vaccine uses the next-generation hAd5 [E1-, E2b-, E3-] platform previously used successfully in cancer patients with pre-existing adenovirus immunity, engineered to express both SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein modified to improve the generation of neutralizing antibodies to block entry of the virus, and nucleocapsid (N) protein with an Enhanced T cell Stimulation Domain (ETSD) to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to clear the virus and block replication by killing infected cells. The targeting of N to endosomes and lysosomes to enhance CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses distinguishes our vaccine. In our previously reported pre-clinical studies we showed that in mice, the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine elicits both humoral and T-cell responses that are robust and T helper cell 1 (Th1) dominant. Here we report that the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine is recognized by anti-sera and T cells from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and that the presence of N is vital for T-cell recall. The findings presented herein: i. demonstrate specific recognition of hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD infected cells by plasma antibodies from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but not antibodies from virus-naive subjects; ii. show enhanced binding of plasma SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from previously infected patients to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) expressing the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine as compared to hAd5 S-Fusion alone; iii. reveal N-ETSD localizes to vesicles associated with MHC class II antigen presentation, including endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes in MoDCs; iv. demonstrate endosome/lysosome-targeted N-ETSD elicits higher interferon-gamma T-cell responses than cytoplasm-localized N; and v. N-ETSD alone or in the hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD construct induces both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory recall. This recognition of hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD vaccine antigens by T cells from previously SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, together with the ability of this vaccine candidate to elicit de novo immune responses in naive mice suggests that it re-capitulates the natural immune response to SARS-CoV-2 to activate both B and T cells towards viral neutralization and recognition of infected cells, critical for prevention of COVID-19 disease. Intriguingly, our hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD T-cell biased vaccine has the potential to not only provide protection for uninfected individuals, but also to be utilized as a therapeutic for already infected patients to induce rapid clearance of the virus by activating T cells to kill the virus-infected cells, thereby reducing viral replication and lateral transmission.","Sieling, P.; Zakin, L.; Shin, A.; Morimoto, B.; Adisetiyo, H.; Garban, H.; Liu, P.; Rice, A.; Taft, J.; Patel, R.; Buta, S.; Martin-Fernandez, M.; Bogunovic, D.; Gabitzsch, E.; Safrit, J.

Widely used experimental paradigms such as the Trier Social Stress Test feature physical social encounters to induce stress by means of social-evaluative threat. As lockdowns and contact restrictions currently prevent in-person meetings, established stress induction paradigms are often difficult to use. Despite these challenges, stress research is of pivotal importance as the pandemic will likely increase the prevalence of stress-related mental disorders.Therefore, we review recent research trends like virtual reality, pre-recordings and online adaptations regarding their usefulness for established stress induction paradigms. Such approaches are not only crucial for stress research during COVID-19 but will likely stimulate the field far beyond the pandemic. They may facilitate research in new contexts and in homebound or movement-restricted participant groups.Moreover, they allow for new experimental variations that may advance procedures as well as the conceptualization of stress itself.

However, it was associated with a higher probability of length of hospital stay over 15 days (aOR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.68-2.64) compared with No RBV/IFN-α therapy. Moreover, the propensity score-matched cohort and subgroup analysis displayed similar results. CONCLUSION: RBV/IFN-α therapy was not observed to any benefit in improving clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, suggesting that RBV/IFN-α therapy should be avoided in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Hui; Xiong, Nian; Li, Changjun; Gong, Yanhong; Liu, Li; Yang, Heping; Tan, Xiangping; Jiang, Nan; Zong, Qiao; Wang, Jing; Lu, Zuxun; Yin, Xiaoxv",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515771/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000667?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.055,317

663232,Routine use of statins and increased mortality related to COVID-19 in inpatients with type 2 diabetes: Results from the CORONADO study,2020-10-19,"Declines in period life expectancy at birth (PLEB) provide seemingly intuitive indicators of the impact of a cause of death on the individual lifespan. Derived under the assumption that future mortality conditions will remain indefinitely those observed during a reference period, however, their intuitive interpretation becomes problematic when period conditions reflect a temporary mortality “shock”, resulting from a natural disaster or the diffusion of a new epidemic in the population for instance. Rather than to make assumptions about future mortality, I propose measuring the difference between a period average age at death and the average expected age at death of the same individuals (death cohort): the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL). For fine-grained tracking of the mortality impact of an epidemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. For illustration, quarterly MUL values in 2020 are derived from estimates of COVID-19 deaths that might substantially underestimate overall mortality change in affected populations. These results nonetheless illustrate how MUL tracks the mortality impact of the pandemic in several national and sub-national populations. Using a seven-day rolling window, the empirical shortcut suggests MUL peaked at 6.43 years in Lombardy, 8.91 years in New Jersey, and 6.24 years in Mexico City for instance. Sensitivity analyses are presented, but in the case of COVID-19, the main uncertainty remains the potential gap between reported COVID-19 deaths and actual increases in the number of deaths induced by the pandemic in some of the most affected countries. Using actual number of deaths rather than reported COVID-19 deaths may increase seven-day MUL from 6.24 to 8.96 years in Mexico City and from 2.67 to 5.49 years in Lima for instance. In Guayas (Ecuador), MUL is estimated to have reached 12.7 years for the entire month of April 2020.","Heuveline, Patrick",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314459/,317

Now, determining the transmission potential and immune status among sheltering in place asymptomatic patients and clinical staff resuming their activity is crucial. Here, we report herd immunity, infective, and naïve incidence for SARS-CoV-2 after the lockdown period, among asymptomatic medical personnel and patients in two US ART centers located in states with different COVID19 incidences. Design: Prospective multicenter study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04466644). Materials and Methods: A total of 339 asymptomatic individuals (personnel and patients) were analyzed from June 18 to July 30, 2020 in two ART centers reopening after lockdown following CDC safety guidelines. In Clinic A (Utah Fertility Center), located in a low prevalence State (312 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 154 individuals were analyzed. In clinic B (Boston IVF), in a high prevalence scenario (Massachusetts, 1,462 cases per 100,000 on 06/01/2020), 185 individuals were tested. Asymptomatic individuals attending or working in the indicated clinics were tested by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and for IgG quantification on blood samples (Abbott Inc, Scarborough, ME, USA), following FDA-Emergency Use Authorization protocols. IRB approval was obtained from WIRB Protocol #20201490. Results: From 339 asymptomatic individuals tested, the percentage of non-informativity was 0 for RT-PCR and 0.6% (2 out of 339) for the IgG test. Only those individuals with informative results for both tests (n= 337) are presented. [Formula presented] Conclusions: In the population investigated, our results suggest that the impact of the pandemic is far from reaching the level required to achieve herd immunity (i.e., 50% of a population). Therefore, transmission remains a risk since potential infectivity is present in 0.6% of the asymptomatic population tested. This figure was maintained despite their different geographical locations and the adherence to CDC guidelines of the IVF clinics involved. Interestingly, the two PCR+ individuals were IgG + suggesting virus persistence or reinfection that, if tested by serology alone, would be considered immune. These results together with the high incidence of naive individuals draws attention for the implementation of a consistent program of testing for COVID19 as a means of preventing reemerging outbreaks in our fertility centers.","Foulk, Russell A.; Sakkas, Denny; Kayali, Refik; Valbuena, Diana; Simon, Carlos; Cuzzi, Juliana",Fertility and Sterility,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028220322706; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0015028220322706,317
666709,Selecting Treatments During an Infectious Disease Pandemic: Chasing the Evidence,2021-08-17,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) initially appeared and has most rapidly spread in Wuhan, China. The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.","Cao, Lei; Huang, Ting-ting; Zhang, Jun-xia; Qin, Qi; Liu, Si-yu; Xue, Hui-min; Gong, Ya-xin; Ning, Chang-hua; Shen, Xiao-tong; Yang, Jia-xin; Mi, Yan-ni; Xiao, Xue; Cao, Yongxiao",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.11.20034215,317

Traditionally, chemical libraries are screened either using in vitro culture systems or in silico to identify and chemically modify small molecules with antimicrobial properties. Nevertheless, almost all compounds passing through in vitro screening fail to pass preclinical trials. Drug screening in Drosophila offers to fill the gap between in vitro and mammalian model host testing by eliminating compounds that are toxic or have reduced bioavailability and by identifying others that may boost innate host defence or selectively reduce microbial virulence in a whole-organism setting. Such alternative screening methods in Drosophila, while low-throughput, may reduce the cost and increase the success rate of preclinical trials.","Tzelepis, Ilias; Kapsetaki, Stefania-Elisavet; Panayidou, Stavria; Apidianakis, Yiorgos",Curr Opin Pharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471489213001495; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2013.08.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471489213001495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23992884/,317

These elevated baseline D-dimer levels have been associated with disease severity and mortality in retrospective cohorts. Objectives: To review current available data on the association between D-Dimer levels and mortality in patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic review of published studies using MEDLINE and EMBASE through 13 April 2020. Two authors independently screened all records and extracted the outcomes. A random effects model was used to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Six original studies enrolling 1355 hospitalized patients with moderate to critical COVID-19 (391 in the non-survivor group and 964 in the survivor group) were considered for the final pooled analysis. When pooling together the results of these studies, D-Dimer levels were found to be higher in non-survivors than in-survivors. The SMD in D-Dimer levels between non-survivors and survivors was 3.59 µg/L (95% CI 2.79–4.40 µg/L), and the Z-score for overall effect was 8.74 (p < 0.00001), with a high heterogeneity across studies (I²=95%). Conclusions: Despite high heterogeneity across included studies, the present pooled analysis indicates that D-Dimer levels are significantly associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Early integration of D-Dimer testing, which is a rapid, inexpensive, and easily accessible biological test, can be useful to better risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients.","Sakka, Mehdi; Connors, Jean M; Hékimian, Guillaume; Martin-Toutain, Isabelle; Crichi, Benjamin; Colmegna, Ines; Bonnefont-Rousselot, Dominique; Farge, Dominique; Frere, Corinne",J Med Vasc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S254245132030287X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdmv.2020.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862984/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254245132030287X?v=s5,317

RRV is responsible for the highest prevalence of human disease cases associated with mosquito-borne transmission in Australia, and has long been a leading suspect in cases of post-viral fatigue syndromes, with extrapolation of this link to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME). Research into RRV pathogenesis has revealed a number of immune evasion strategies, impressive for a virus with a genome size of 12 kb (plus strand RNA), which resonate with insights into viral pathogenesis broadly. Drawing from observations on RRV immune evasion, mechanisms of relevance to long term idiopathic fatigue are featured as a perspective on infection and eventual ME symptoms, which include considerations of; (1) selective pro-inflammatory gene suppression post antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of RRV infection, (2) Evidence from other virus families of immune disruption and evasion post-ADE, and (3) how virally-driven immune evasion may impact on mitochondrial function via target of rapamycin (TOR) complexes. In light of these RRV measures to counter the host immune - inflammatory responses, links to recent discoveries explaining cellular, immune and metabolomic markers of ME will be explored and discussed, with the implications for long-COVID post SARS-CoV-2 also considered.

Current predictions estimate that, during a pandemic wave, 12–30% of the population will develop clinical influenza (compared with 5–15% for seasonal influenza) with 4% of those patients requiring hospital admissions and one in five requiring critical care. This review covers the background, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. The role of immunization and antiviral drugs is discussed. Experience from the first wave of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza suggests that a number of infected patients become critically ill and require intensive care admission. These patients rapidly develop severe progressive respiratory failure which is often associated with failure of other organs, or marked worsening of underlying airways disease. The critical care management of these patients and the implications for resources is reviewed.

Olfactory training involving aromatic oils has been recommended to improve olfactory recovery, but quantitative data are missing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the benefit of olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application for patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction for ≥1 month. METHODS: We performed an observational, real-life, data-based study on a cohort of patients who experienced at least 1 month of persistent olfactory dysfunction between January 30 and March 26, 2021. An analysis was performed after a mean olfactory training time of 4 weeks, and at least 500 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. Participants exposed themselves twice daily to odors from 4 high-concentration oils and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application. Improvement was defined as a 2-point increase on a 10-point, self-assessed olfactory visual analogue scale. RESULTS: In total, 548 patients were assessable for primary outcome assessment. The mean baseline, self-assessed olfactory score was 1.9 (SD 1.7), and this increased to 4.6 (SD 2.8) after a mean olfactory training time of 27.7 days (SD 17.2). Olfactory training was associated with at least a 2-point increase in 64.2% (352/548) of patients. The rate of patients’ olfactory improvement was higher for patients who trained for more than 28 days than that rate for patients who trained for less than 28 days (73.3% vs 59%; P=.002). The time to olfactory improvement was 8 days faster for patients with hyposmia compared to the time to improvement for patients with anosmia (P<.001). This benefit was observed regardless of the duration of the olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Olfactory training and visual stimulation assisted by a dedicated web application was associated with significant improvement in olfaction, especially after 28 days of olfactory training.","Denis, Fabrice; Septans, Anne-Lise; Periers, Lea; Maillard, Jean-Michel; Legoff, Florian; Gurden, Hirac; Moriniere, Sylvain",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/29583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003765/,317

Given the potential complexity of COVID-19 illnesses, a multifactorial causation is likely, but several studies have focused on infection-induced coagulopathy. Procoagulant states are commonly found in association with the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies. The correlation of the latter with thrombosis and/or clinical severity remains controversial. Although measures of antiphospholipid antibodies most commonly include assessments for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-ß2-glycoprotein-I antibodies, lesser common antibodies have been detected, and there remains speculation that other yet undiscovered autoimmune thrombotic events may yet be found. The recent discovery of post-vaccination thromboses associated with platelet factor 4 antibody has created another level of concern. The pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibodies and their role in COVID-19-related thrombosis deserves further attention.

679227,Initial Experience of an Emergency Department in Shenzhen in Responding to the Emerging Wuhan Coronavirus Pneumonia,2020-03-23,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented adjustments to intensive care unit (ICU) organization and care processes globally. Research Question Did hospital emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic differ depending on hospital setting; which strategies worked well to mitigate strain as perceived by intensivists? Study Design and Methods : Between August-November 2020, we performed semi-structured interviews of intensivists from tertiary and community hospitals across six regions in the United States (U.S.) that experienced early and/or large surges of COVID-19 patients. We identified themes of hospital emergency responses using the “four S framework” of acute surge planning (i.e., Space, Staff, Stuff, System). Results 33 intensivists from 7 tertiary and 6 community hospitals participated. Clinicians across both settings felt that canceling elective surgeries was helpful to increase ICU capabilities and that hospitals should establish clearly-defined thresholds at which surgeries are limited during future surge events. ICU staff was the most limited resource; staff shortages were improved by the use of tiered staffing models, just-in-time training for non-ICU clinicians, designated treatment teams, and deployment of trainees. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages and re-use were widespread, causing substantial distress among clinicians; hands-on PPE training was helpful to reduce clinicians’ anxiety. Transparency and involvement of frontline clinicians as stakeholders were important components of effective emergency responses and helped maintain trust among staff. Interpretation We identified several strategies to potentially mitigate strain as perceived by intensivists working in both tertiary and community hospital settings. Our study also demonstrates the importance of trust and transparency between frontline staff and hospital leadership as key components of effective emergency responses during public health crises.","Vranas, Kelly C.; Golden, Sara E.; Mathews, Kusum S.; Schutz, Amanda; Valley, Thomas S.; Duggal, Abhijit; Seitz, Kevin P.; Chang, Steven Y.; Nugent, Shannon; Slatore, Christopher G.; Sullivan, Donald R.; Hough, Catherine L.",Chest,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221010692?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.05.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062115/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221010692,317
680320,A snapshot on radiotherapy for head and neck cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: a survey of the Italian Association of Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology (AIRO) head and neck working group,2020-10-06,"Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a “cytokine storm”, the mechanism of which is not yet understood. I propose that cytokine storms result from synergistic interactions among Toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR) due to combined infections of SARS-CoV-2 with other microbes, mainly bacterial and fungal. This proposition is based on eight linked types of evidence and their logical connections. (1) Severe cases of COVID-19 differ from healthy controls and mild COVID-19 patients in exhibiting increased TLR4, TLR7, TLR9 and NLRP3 activity. (2) SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses activate TLR3, TLR7, RIG1 and NLRP3. (3) SARS-CoV-2 cannot, therefore, account for the innate receptor activation pattern (IRAP) found in severe COVID-19 patients. (4) Severe COVID-19 also differs from its mild form in being characterized by bacterial and fungal infections. (5) Respiratory bacterial and fungal infections activate TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 and NLRP3. (6) A combination of SARS-CoV-2 with bacterial/fungal coinfections accounts for the IRAP found in severe COVID-19 and why it differs from mild cases. (7) Notably, TLR7 (viral) and TLR4 (bacterial/fungal) synergize, TLR9 and TLR4 (both bacterial/fungal) synergize and TLR2 and TLR4 (both bacterial/fungal) synergize with NLRP3 (viral and bacterial). (8) Thus, a SARS-CoV-2-bacterium/fungus coinfection produces synergistic innate activation, resulting in the hyperinflammation characteristic of a cytokine storm. Unique clinical, experimental and therapeutic predictions (such as why melatonin is effective in treating COVID-19) are discussed, and broader implications are outlined for understanding why other syndromes such as acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis display varied cytokine storm symptoms.","Root-Bernstein, Robert",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22042108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672738/,317

Data for this cross-sectional study come from a community-based online survey of COVID-19 isolated people (N = 328), who are not infected with the 2019-nCoV virus. We applied correlation and moderating effect for data analysis and found that cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety symptoms. These results give us a new perspective on understanding the relationship between anxiety symptoms and perceived stress by clarifying the protective function of cognitive reappraisal. It buffers the induced negative emotion when COVID-19 isolated people perceive overpressure, and thus instigates future research into targeted clinical interventions, which aim to cultivate cognitive reappraisal skills for those isolated people in the face of stressful events or crisis events.","Xu, Chen; Xu, Yanjun; Xu, Song; Zhang, Qianhui; Liu, Xiaotong; Shao, Yifan; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Peng, Li; Li, Min",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982809/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00858,317

The current study aims to address this deficit, understanding how these groups conceptualise COVID-19, and how this influences engagement in testing, with the future aim of developing targeted communications to address the challenges of testing uptake. Method:Black (African and Caribbean) and South (Asian Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi) community members were purposefully recruited across the UK. Fifty seven semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed using principles of Grounded Theory. Results:The findings illustrate that Black and South Asians conceptualise COVID-19 as a disease that makes them visible to others outside their community, in having more severe risk and suffering worst consequences, resulting in fear, stigmatisation and alienation. Views about COVID-19 were embedded in cultural beliefs, relating to culturally specific ideas around disease, such as ill-health being the will of God. Challenges brought about by the pandemic were conceptualised as one of many struggles, with the saliency of the virus contextualised against life experiences. These themes and others influenced engagement with COVID-19 testing. Testing was less about accessing timely and effective treatment for themselves, and more about acting to protect the family and community. Testing symbolised a loss of income, anxiety and isolation, accentuated by issues of mistrust of the system, and not being valued, or being treated unfairly. Conclusion:In tackling these challenges, we conclude that health communications should focus on counterbalancing the mistrust, alienation and stigmatisation that act as barriers to testing, with trust built using local credible sources.","Vandrevala, T.

Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Google Scholar through June 2020. Inclusion criteria were observational design, humans, adults, English language, ST as the exposure, resting HR/HRV as the outcome, and (meta-analysis only) availability of the quantitative association with variability. After qualitative synthesis, meta-analysis used inverse variance heterogeneity models to estimate pooled associations. Results: Thirteen and eight articles met the criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. All studies were cross-sectional and few used gold standard ST or HRV assessment methodology. The qualitative synthesis suggested no associations between ST and HR/HRV. The meta-analysis found a significant association between ST and HR (β = 0.24 bpm per hour ST; CI: 0.10, 0.37) that was stronger in males (β = 0.36 bpm per hour ST; CI: 0.19, 0.53). Pooled associations between ST and HRV indices were non-significant (p > 0.05). Substantial heterogeneity was detected. Conclusions: The limited available evidence suggests an unfavorable but not clinically meaningful association between ST and HR, but no association with HRV. Future longitudinal studies assessing ST with thigh-based monitoring and HRV with electrocardiogram are needed.","Alansare, Abdullah Bandar; Bates, Lauren C.; Stoner, Lee; Kline, Christopher E.; Nagle, Elizabeth; Jennings, J.

Through a historical study of educational leadership, this research discovered that the position of the leader is constantly being reshaped and adapted to the current social, cultural, and economic circumstances. During the last year, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the educational leadership has had to be reshaped worldwide. The aim of this study is to investigate the issues that have arisen from the aforementioned situation, as well as to try to figure out how a school’s principal might apply the basic principles of educational leadership, in a period of crisis. This investigation was focused on the use of the qualitative method. The study included 88 teachers and 5 principals from Cyprus, as well as teachers and parents. Based on the findings of the study, we discovered that the challenges faced by school principals and teachers are primarily linked to alienation, marginalization, time management, improving bureaucracy, problems with technical equipment and distance learning programs. Solution to these obstacles seemed to be the: Empathy, teamwork, and decentralization of the educational system, which are all promoted by the principal, who occasionally has additional authority.","Constantia, Charalampous; Christos, Papademetriou; Glykeria, Reppa; Anastasia, Athanasoula-Reppa; Aikaterini, Voulgari",J Educ (Boston),https://doi.org/10.1177/00220574211032588,317

Research identifies learning, compliance, and psychological costs as deterring program use. Compliance costs reflect the burdens of following program rules, which may entail providing documentation, responding to discretionary demands of bureaucrats, or attending appointments to maintain benefits. Studies identify one element of compliance costs—quarterly appointments—as a barrier to continued WIC participation. This article draws on 44 in‐depth qualitative interviews with participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). We examine how WIC participants perceive the reduction of compliance costs following the implementation of remote appointments in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. WIC participants report satisfaction with remote appointments and a reduction in the compliance costs of accessing and maintaining benefits. We conclude by recommending longer term changes to policy and practices to increase access and continuity in WIC receipt.","Barnes, Carolyn; Petry, Sarah",Public Adm Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548698/,317

However, it has been reported that the relationship between OM‐85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections is variable. This meta‐analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS: A systematic literature search up‐to May 2020 was performed and 14 studies were detected with 1859 paediatric subjects, of them 890 consumed OM‐85. They were reporting relationships between OM‐85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Odds ratio (OR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated to evaluate the prognostic role of OM‐85 consumption and recurrent respiratory tract infections using the dichotomous or continuous method with a random or fixed‐effect model. RESULTS: OM‐85 consumption was significantly related to lower frequency of respiratory tract infections (MD, −1.16; 95% CI, −1.66 to −0.65, P < .001); lower total duration of respiratory tract infections (MD, −19.51; 95% CI, −23.00 to −16.01, P < .001); lower incidence of respiratory tract infections (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21‐0.77, P = .006); lower number of antibiotic courses (MD, −1.40; 95% CI, −2.63 to 0.17, P = .03); and lower antibiotic use (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.29‐0.52, P < .001). However, OM‐85 consumption was not significantly related to adverse event rate (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.52‐2.03, P = .94); or to wheezing attacks frequency (MD, −0.25; 95% CI, −0.59 to 0.08, P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of OM‐85 consumption on recurrent respiratory tract infections may have a great effect as a tool to improve subjects’ immunity against recurrent respiratory tract infections, which could be helpful in crucial situations, eg, COVID‐19 pandemic. OM‐85 non‐consumers had an independent risk relationship with recurrent respiratory tract infections. This relationship forces us to recommend OM‐85 consumption with those with a high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections to avoid any possible complications.","Cao, Changqing; Wang, Jinghua; Li, Yuning; Li, Yumei; Ma, Liyan; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E.

Existing evidence shows that substance use and related harms differ by gender. Yet, no Canadian study has applied a gendered lens to alcohol and cannabis consumption use during this time. Our objectives were to (1) provide gender-specific prevalence estimates of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use; and (2) examine gender-specific associations between sociodemographic and mental health variables and alcohol and cannabis use. METHODS: Using data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, we calculated nationally representative, gender-specific prevalence estimates and disaggregated them by sociodemographic and mental health variables. Four logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported increase in alcohol use (16.2% women; 15.2% men) and cannabis use (4.9% women; 5.8% men) did not differ by gender. For both genders, income, racialized group membership, working in the past week, being a parent/legal guardian of a child aged under 18 and screening positive for depression and anxiety were associated with increased alcohol use. Men and women who were between the ages of 18 to 44, screened positive for depression, or both, were more likely to report increased cannabis use. For women, education was significantly associated with increased alcohol use. For men, being a parent/legal guardian was significantly associated with lower odds of increased cannabis use. CONCLUSION: Sociodemographic factors, as well as depression and anxiety, were similarly associated with increased alcohol and cannabis use for both men and women in the second wave of the pandemic.","Hill MacEachern, Kate; Venugopal, Jeya; Varin, Mélanie; Weeks, Murray; Hussain, Nousin; Baker, Melissa M",Health Promot.

685279,Conditions and strategies to meet the challenges imposed by the COVID-19-related visiting restrictions in the ICU: a Scandinavian cross-sectional study,2021-07-26,"BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity, premature mortality and acute care utilization in patients with digestive disease. In the province of Alberta, hospital readmission rates for patients with cirrhosis are estimated at 44% at 90 days. For hospitalized patients, multiple care gaps exist, the most notable stemming from i) the lack of a structured approach to best practice care for cirrhosis complications, ii) the lack of a structured approach to broader health needs and iii) suboptimal preparation for transition of care into the community. Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial which aims to address these gaps. The proposed intervention is initiated at the time of hospitalization through implementation of a clinical information system embedded electronic order set for delivering evidence-based best practices under real-world conditions. The overarching objective of the CCAB trial is to demonstrate effectiveness and implementation feasibility for use of the order set in routine patient care within eight hospital sites in Alberta. METHODS: A mixed methods hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the order set intervention. The primary outcome is a reduction in 90-day cumulative length of stay. Implementation outcomes such as reach, adoption, fidelity and maintenance will also be evaluated alongside other patient and service outcomes such as readmission rates, quality of care and cost-effectiveness. This theory-based trial will be guided by Normalization Process Theory, Consolidated Framework on Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework. DISCUSSION: The CCAB project is unique in its breadth, both in the comprehensiveness of the multi-component order set and also for the breadth of its roll-out. Lessons learned will ultimately inform the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in “real-world” conditions as well as adoption and adaptation of these best practices within the rest of Alberta, other provinces in Canada, and beyond.

Such data are very important for the analysis of molecular mechanisms of disease progression and development of new strategies for the treatment of various diseases and pathological conditions. The texts of publications represent a primary source of information, which is especially important to collect the data of the highest quality due to the immediate obtaining information, in comparison with databases. In our study, we aimed at the development and testing of an approach to the named entity recognition in the abstracts of publications. More specifically, we have developed and tested an algorithm based on the conditional random fields, which provides recognition of NEs of (i) genes and proteins and (ii) chemicals. Careful selection of abstracts strictly related to the subject of interest leads to the possibility of extracting the NEs strongly associated with the subject. To test the applicability of our approach, we have applied it for the extraction of (i) potential HIV inhibitors and (ii) a set of proteins and genes potentially responsible for viremic control in HIV-positive patients. The computational experiments performed provide the estimations of evaluating the accuracy of recognition of chemical NEs and proteins (genes). The precision of the chemical NEs recognition is over 0.91; recall is 0.86, and the F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) is 0.89; the precision of recognition of proteins and genes names is over 0.86; recall is 0.83; while F1-score is above 0.85. Evaluation of the algorithm on two case studies related to HIV treatment confirms our suggestion about the possibility of extracting the NEs strongly relevant to (i) HIV inhibitors and (ii) a group of patients i.e., the group of HIV-positive individuals with an ability to maintain an undetectable HIV-1 viral load overtime in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Analysis of the results obtained provides insights into the function of proteins that can be responsible for viremic control.

We get the stability theorems for the disease-free equilibrium and provide adequate situations of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics equilibrium of present and absent cases. A Hopf bifurcation parameter τ concerns the effects of time delay and we demonstrate that the locally asymptotic stability holds for the present equilibrium. The reproduction number is brief in less than or greater than one, and it effectively is controlling the COVID-19 infection outbreak and subsequently reveals insight into understanding the patterns of the flare-up. We have included eight parameters and the least square method allows us to estimate the initial values for the Indian COVID-19 pandemic from real-life data. It is one of India’s current pandemic models that have been studied for the time being. This Covid19 SEIR model can apply with or without delay to all country’s current pandemic region, after estimating parameter values from their data. The sensitivity of seven parameters has also been explored. The paper also examines the impact of immune response time delay and the importance of determining essential parameters such as the transmission rate using sensitivity indices analysis.

Cows were on treatments 3 weeks prepartum through 8 weeks post‐partum. Treatments were as follows: (i) no direct‐fed microbial (DFM) or cellulase and amylase enzymes (C), (ii) 45.4 g/day of DFM (D) or (iii) 45.4 g/day of DFM and 18.2 g/day of enzyme (DE). Total mixed ration fed and refused were measured daily to determine dry matter intake (DMI). Blood samples were taken three times weekly and analysed for β‐hydroxybutyrate, glucose and non‐esterified fatty acids. Body weight (BW) was measured weekly. Colostrum was weighed and analysed for IgA and IgG concentration. Calves were fed 4 L of colostrum within 2 hr of birth. Calf blood samples were taken at 0 and 24 hr for analysis of IgA and IgG concentrations and apparent efficiency of absorption. Milk yield was measured daily and samples collected weekly. Initial BW was different among treatments with D being lesser than C or DE treatments. Body weight, weight gain, efficiency of gain, DMI and blood parameters were unaffected. Treatment did not affect colostrum yield. Ash percentage of colostrum tended to increase with D and DE, while IgA and total solids yield decreased with D. Colostrum fat yield was decreased in D and DE. Treatments did not impact BW, serum IgA and IgG concentrations or apparent efficiency of absorption of calves. Post‐partum BW, DMI, blood parameters, milk production and composition were unaffected by treatment. However, cows on D gained more BW and tended to have greater efficiency of gain compared to those on DE, but were similar to C. Somatic cell scores were greatest for D. Results indicate that DFM and enzyme supplementation did not improve health and performance of dairy cattle during the pre‐ and post‐partum periods under conditions of this study.","Ort, S.

RESULTS: In this study we analyzed the record of the influenza-illness-like patients with a recent travel history to Wuhan arrived in Hong Kong between December 31, 2019 and January 21, 2020. We found that the ratio COVID-19 and influenza is much smaller than a study among ILI in Wuhan. This difference could be due to the difference in sampling. We argue that it is important to consider both samples when inferring number of COVID-19 cases from ILI patients.","Tao, Jun; Gao, Huizhi; Zhu, Shuying; Yang, Lin; He, Daihai",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220321901; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220321901?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.1474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33011280/,317
689260,"A stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial assessing the implementation, effectiveness and cost-consequences of the EDDIE+ hospital avoidance program in 12 residential aged care homes: study protocol",2021-06-05,"The dual threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) have emphasized the urgent need for self-disinfecting materials for infection control. Despite their highly potent antimicrobial activity, the adoption of photoactive materials to reduce infection transmission in hospitals and related healthcare facilities has been severely hampered by the lack of scalable and cost-effective manufacturing, in which case high-volume production methods for fabricating aPDI-based materials are needed. To address this issue here, we examined the antimicrobial efficacy of a simple bicomponent spray coating composed of the commercially-available UV-photocrosslinkable polymer N-methyl-4(4'-formyl-styryl)pyridinium methosulfate acetal poly(vinyl alcohol) (SbQ-PVA) and one of three aPDI photosensitizers (PSs): zinc-tetra(4-N-methylpyridyl)porphine (ZnTMPyP(4+)), methylene blue (MB), and Rose Bengal (RB). We applied these photodynamic coatings, collectively termed SbQ-PVA/PS, to a variety of commercially available materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) confirmed the successful application of the coatings, while inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed a photosensitizer loading of 0.09-0.78 nmol PS/mg material. The antimicrobial efficacy of the coated materials was evaluated against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-29213 and human coronavirus strain HCoV-229E. Upon illumination with visible light (60 min, 400-700 nm, 65 ± 5 mW/cm(2)), the coated materials inactivated S. aureus by 97-99.999% and HCoV-229E by 92-99.999%, depending on the material and PS employed. Photobleaching studies employing HCoV-229E demonstrated detection limit inactivation (99.999%) even after exposure for 4 weeks to indoor ambient room lighting. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential for photodynamic SbQ-PVA/PS coatings to be universally applied to a wide range of materials for effectively reducing pathogen transmission.","Ghareeb, C.
