According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the US have been of adults 65 years old and older. Therefore, the global recommendation for older populations includes social isolation, which involves staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, possibly for an extended period of up to three or four months. Such distancing presents serious challenges to the health and well-being of older adults, more so those who are frail or have multiple chronic conditions.<br><br>.","Rashedi, Vahid; Borhaninejad, Vahidreza",Indian J Med Ethics,959,1

METHOD: Prospective data collection was conducted during a four-week time period and a total sum of 160 working hours for each of the two 1.5â¯T MRI scanners. Three core processes defined the value stream of patient handling before, during and after the MRI examination: i) Scheduling & Registration, ii) Organization & Preparation, and iii) MR scan. Quantitative data was collected for six essential time intervals of the MRI workflow. RESULTS: A total of 302 MRI examinations were assessed. The workflow analysis revealed that effective utilization of scan capacity during operating hours varied by scanner (Scanner 1: 77 % / Scanner 2: 85 %). Mean process times for were: patient preparation time 18.9â¯min (±15.1) pâ¯=â¯0.11, scan preparation time 5.7â¯min (±4.0) pâ¯=â¯0,015, effective scan time 39.6â¯min (±18.0) pâ¯<â¯0.0001, scan room occupation time 50.9â¯min (±21.0) pâ¯<â¯0.0001, clean-up time 5.6â¯min (±3.2) pâ¯=â¯0.001, total patient handling time 69.7â¯min (±26.3) pâ¯<â¯0.0001, turnover time 13.4â¯min (±21.4) pâ¯=â¯0.65. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility and applicability of a standardized core processes analyses for MRI scanning, which identified underutilization of scanning capacities, related to multiple factors, such as punctuality of patients, the number of same day cancellations, the process of placing an IV access and patient transport contribute to underutilization of MRI scanners. Furthermore, proactive patient management and effective communication with patients and referring physicians might have relevant time saving potential in the scan room.","Streit, Ulrike; Uhlig, Johannes; Lotz, Joachim; Panahi, Babak; Seif Amir Hosseini, Ali",Eur J Radiol,959,0

In this cross-sectional study, 298 frontline nurses were surveyed during the first month of direct care delivery for patients with COVID-19 via the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Through logistic regression analysis, we identified the influencing factors of ASD. Our results showed that 13.8% of participants had ASD; frontline nurses were affected by ASD symptoms in different degrees; higher perceived social support from friends and colleagues were the major protective factors of ASD; and a negative coping style was a risk factor for ASD. Psychological crisis management interventions aimed at frontline nurses may be essential to prevent ASD during public health crisis events.

On January 25, 2021, MDH identified the SARS-CoV-2 variant P.1 in one specimen through this surveillance system using whole genome sequencing, representing the first identified case of this variant in the United States. The P.1 variant was first identified in travelers from Brazil during routine airport screening in Tokyo, Japan, in early January 2021 (1). This variant has been associated with increased transmissibility (2), and there are concerns that mutations in the spike protein receptor-binding domain might disrupt both vaccine-induced and natural immunity (3,4). As of February 28, 2021, a total of 10 P.1 cases had been identified in the United States, including the two cases described in this report, followed by one case each in Alaska, Florida, Maryland, and Oklahoma (5).","Firestone, Melanie J; Lorentz, Alexandra J; Meyer, Stephanie; Wang, Xiong; Como-Sabetti, Kathryn; Vetter, Sara; Smith, Kirk; Holzbauer, Stacy; Beaudoin, Amanda; Garfin, Jacob; Ehresmann, Kristin; Danila, Richard; Lynfield, Ruth",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,959,1

The severity of the disease depends on the efficiency of the immune system which, if it is weak, cannot stem the infection and its symptoms. The new CoV-19 spreads in the population at a rate of 0.8-3% more than normal flu and mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. If CoV-19 would spread with a higher incidence rate (over 10%), and affect the people who live in closed communities such as islands, it would cause many more deaths. Moreover, people from the poorest classes are most at risk because of lack of health care and should be given more assistance by the competent authorities. To avoid the aggravation of CoV-19 infection, and the collapse of the health system, individuals should remain at home in quarantine for a period of approximately one month in order to limit viral transmission. In the case of a pandemic, the severe shortage of respirators and protective clothing, due to the enormous demand and insufficient production, could lead the CoV-19 to kill a large number of individuals. At present, there is no drug capable of treating CoV-19 flu, the only therapeutic remedies are those aimed at the side effects caused by the virus, such as inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, recognized as the first causes of death. One of the COVID-19 treatments involves inhaling a mixture of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, obtaining better results than with oxygen alone. It was also noted that individuals vaccinated for viral and/or bacterial infectious diseases were less likely to become infected. In addition, germicidal UV radiation ""breaks down"" the oxygen O2 which then aggregate into O3 (ozone) molecules creating the ozone layer, capable of inhibiting viral replication and improving lung respiration. All these precautions should be taken into consideration to lower the risk of infection by CoV-19. New anti-viral therapies with new drugs should also be taken into consideration. For example, microbes are known to bind TLR, inducing IL-1, a pleiotropic cytokine, highly inflammatory, mediator of fever and fibrosis. Therefore, drugs that suppress IL-1 or IL-1R, also used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis are to be taken into consideration to treat COVID-19. We strongly believe that all these devices described above can lead to greater survival and. therefore, reduction in mortality in patients infected with CoV-19.","Conti, P; Gallenga, C E; Tetè, G; Caraffa, Al; Ronconi, G; Younes, A; Toniato, E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,959,16

METHODS: Using official data on deaths in Switzerland, all-cause mortality in 2020 was compared with that of previous years using directly standardized mortality rates, age- and sex-specific mortality rates, and life expectancy. RESULTS: The standardized mortality rate was 8.8% higher in 2020 than in 2019, returning to the level observed 5-6 years before, around the year 2015. This increase was greater for men (10.6%) than for women (7.2%) and was statistically significant only for men over 70 years of age, and for women over 75 years of age. The decrease in life expectancy in 2020 compared to 2019 was 0.7%, with a loss of 9.7 months for men and 5.3 months for women. CONCLUSIONS: There was an excess mortality in Switzerland in 2020, linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as this excess only concerned the elderly, the resulting loss of life expectancy was restricted to a few months, bringing the mortality level back to 2015.","Locatelli, Isabella; Rousson, Valentin",PLoS One,959,20
