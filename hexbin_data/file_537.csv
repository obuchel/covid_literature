1396,1396,1396,A Chemoinformatics Approach to the Discovery of Lead-Like Molecules from Marine and Microbial Sources En Route to Antitumor and Antibiotic Drugs,11.992372,6.1644773,2014-01-27,"The comprehensive information of small molecules and their biological activities in the PubChem database allows chemoinformatic researchers to access and make use of large-scale biological activity data to improve the precision of drug profiling. A Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship approach, for classification, was used for the prediction of active/inactive compounds relatively to overall biological activity, antitumor and antibiotic activities using a data set of 1804 compounds from PubChem. Using the best classification models for antibiotic and antitumor activities a data set of marine and microbial natural products from the AntiMarin database were screened—57 and 16 new lead compounds for antibiotic and antitumor drug design were proposed, respectively. All compounds proposed by our approach are classified as non-antibiotic and non-antitumor compounds in the AntiMarin database. Recently several of the lead-like compounds proposed by us were reported as being active in the literature.","Pereira, Florbela; Latino, Diogo A. R. S.; Gaudêncio, Susana P.",Mar Drugs,537,1

The two compounds were similarly active against the viruses in organ culture, and minimal inhibitory concentrations could be determined by titration of organ culture fluid harvests into tissue culture or directly in the organ cultures themselves. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were consistently lower in tracheal than in intestinal organ cultures and were consistently higher for H. hoministype 2 than for H. hoministype I. Thus the organ cultures are promising systems in which to evaluate antiviral activity against those agents that replicate in vitro only in organ culture, and they may have particular application to the study of herpetic tracheitis and esophagitis.","Dolin, Raphael; Smith, Holly A.",J Infect Dis,537,3

Current concepts relate such influences to the capacity of class II molecules to present relevant peptides to autoreactive T cells. We have here analyzed the MHC influence on the immune response and the development of EAE after immunization with the immunodominant peptide MBP‐63–88. Analysis of MHC‐congenic LEWIS strains showed that RT1(a), RT1(c) and RT1(l) haplotypes are permissive for disease induction, whereas RT1(d) and RT1(u) are resistant. All EAE responding strains showed peptide‐specific proliferation and interferon (IFN)‐γ secretion, but no early significant tendency to express interleukin (IL‐4) or transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β mRNA in lymphocytes in response to the MBP 63–88, 7 days post immunization (p.i.). Later, 14 days p.i., peptide‐specific induction of IL‐4 and TGF‐β occurred in RT1(l) rats. Among the EAE non‐responders strains, only the RT1(u) rats showed an immune response to MBP 63‐88. This response, however, was qualitatively different from the immune response in the EAE‐susceptible strains. Thus, there was no proliferation and only moderate IFN‐γ production in response to peptide, but in contrast, a significant and early peptide‐induced IL‐4 and TGF‐β response was observed. The data suggest that the MHC‐associated susceptibility to EAE is partly related to the ability to mount a TH1‐like immune response while the MHC‐associated EAE resistance may either be related to MBP peptide non‐responsiveness or to peptide recognition and induction of a qualitatively different and disease down‐regulatory immune response.","Mustafa, Maha; Vingsbo, Carina; Olsson, Tomas; Ljungdahl, Åke; Höjeberg, Bo; Holmdahl, Rikard",Eur J Immunol,537,5

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic course in oldest in Italy,12.157288,10.200122,2020-05-11,"This article explores the decisive role of British military medicine in shaping official approaches to the 1918 influenza pandemic. It contends that British approaches were defined through a system of military pathology, which had been established by the War Office as part of the mobilization of medicine for the First World War. Relying on the bacteriological laboratory for the identification and control of pathogenic agents, military pathology delivered therapeutic and preventive measures against a range of battlefield diseases, and military and civilian authorities trusted that it could do the same with influenza. This article traces how it shaped efforts to establish the etiology of the pandemic and to produce a general influenza vaccine. It highlights the challenges involved in both strategies. Understanding the central role of military pathology helps make sense of the nature, direction, scale, and limitations of medical mobilization against the pandemic in Britain and the authority accorded to specific medical bodies for elaborating and coordinating strategies. Crucially, it demands that we rethink the relationship between the war and pandemic as one about the social organization of medical knowledge and institutions.","Bresalier, Michael",J Hist Med Allied Sci,537,20

To date, few studies have compared high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) use with noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV). We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of three respiratory support devices in patients with acute respiratory failure. METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Ichushi databases were searched. Studies including adults aged ≥ 16 years with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and randomized-controlled trials that compared two different oxygenation devices (COT, NPPV, or HFNC) before tracheal intubation were included. A frequentist-based approach with a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis was used. The network meta-analysis was performed using the GRADE Working Group approach. The outcomes were short-term mortality and intubation rate. RESULTS: Among 5507 records, 27 studies (4618 patients) were included. The main cause of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was pneumonia. Compared with COT, NPPV and HFNC use tended to reduce mortality (relative risk, 0.88 and 0.93, respectively; 95% confidence intervals, 0.76–1.01 and 0.80–1.08, respectively; both low certainty) and lower the risk of endotracheal intubation (0.81 and 0.78; 0.72–0.91 and 0.68–0.89, respectively; both low certainty); however, short-term mortality or intubation rates did not differ (0.94 and 1.04, respectively; 0.78–1.15 and 0.88–1.22, respectively; both low certainty) between NPPV and HFNC use. CONCLUSION: NPPV and HFNC use are associated with a decreased risk of endotracheal intubation; however, there are no significant differences in short-term mortality.

PIDs are present at the crossroad between infections, immune dysregulation, and cancers. A panel encompassing 42 genes involved in both PIDs and cancer has been investigated for the genes’ compositional properties, codon usage patterns, various forces affecting codon choice, protein properties, and gene expression profiles. In the present study, the codon choice of genes was found to be dependent upon the richness of the nucleotide; the viz AT nucleotide rich genome preferred AT ending codons. The dinucleotide TpA adversely affected protein expression, while CpG did not. The CTG codon was the most overrepresented codon in 80.95% of genes. Analysis of various protein properties, including GRAVY, AROMA, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, hydrophobicity, instability index, and numbers of acidic, basic, and neutral amino acid residues revealed that the hydrophobicity index, instability index, and numbers of acidic and basic amino acid residues are the factors affecting gene expression. Based on neutrality analysis, parity analysis, ENc-GC3 analysis, and regression analysis of nucleotides present at the first and third positions of the codon, it was determined that selection pressure, mutation pressure, and compositional constraints all participated in shaping codon usage. The study will help determine the various evolutionary forces acting on genes common to both PIDs and cancer. Codon usage analysis might be helpful in the future to augment both diseases simultaneously. The research also indicates a peculiar pattern adapted by a set of genes involved in any disease.","Khandia, Rekha; Alqahtani, Taha; Alqahtani, Ali M.",Biomedicines,537,11

Because of its wide source, low extraction cost and good physical and chemical properties, it has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, the application of collagen derived from terrestrial organisms is limited due to the existence of diseases, religious beliefs and other problems. Therefore, exploring a wider range of sources of collagen has become one of the main topics for researchers. Marine-derived collagen (MDC) stands out because it comes from a variety of sources and avoids issues such as religion. On the one hand, this paper summarized the sources, extraction methods and characteristics of MDC, and on the other hand, it summarized the application of MDC in the above fields. And on the basis of the review, we found that MDC can not only be extracted from marine organisms, but also from the wastes of some marine organisms, such as fish scales. This makes further use of seafood resources and increases the application prospect of MDC.","Xu, Ning; Peng, Xue-Liang; Li, Hao-Ru; Liu, Jia-Xuan; Cheng, Ji-Si-Yu; Qi, Xin-Ya; Ye, Shao-Jie; Gong, Hai-Lun; Zhao, Xiao-Hong; Yu, Jiangming; Xu, Guohua; Wei, Dai-Xu",Front Nutr,537,20

Perinatal immunologic factors examined to date incompletely account for this tendency to disseminate, for the rapid disappearance of this vulnerability early in postnatal life, and for the disproportionate occurrence in prematures. To determine a possible influence of gestational age or perinatal events upon this phenomenon, we studied 29 placental specimens of varying gestational age and mode of delivery. The intracellular survival of type 2 HSV within placental lymphocytes was assessed at 48 hour intervals for 6 days to determine the frequency and magnitude of virus titer changes. Early (0-48hrs) titer increases were significantly (p=0.015) more frequent in specimens with gestational age ≤ 35 wks (3/8) than those with ≥ 36 wks (0/21) gestations. Titer increases from 48 to 96 hours were common (14/29) but bore no relationship to gestational age, labor, or mode of delivery. Most importantly, late (>96 hrs) titer increases were most influenced by the occurrence of labor and unrelated to gestational age. Late titer increases did not occur in specimens from caesarian section without labor(0/12) and were significantly (p=0.023) more frequent in specimens where labor occurred (7/17). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that early gestational age and the occurrence of labor transiently provide a more permissive intracellular environment for HSV replication and dissemination.","Andersen, Richard D; Trimble, Judye J",Pediatr Res,537,1

One of the key point of this method is the usage of interval-valued restricted equivalence functions because their parametrization allows one to tune them to each problem, which leads to obtaining accurate results. However, they require the application of the exponentiation several times to obtain a result, which is a time demanding operation implying an extra charge to the computational burden of the method. In this contribution, we propose to reduce the number of exponentiation operations executed by the system, so that the efficiency of the method is enhanced with no alteration of the obtained results. Moreover, the new approach also allows for a reduction on the search space of the evolutionary method carried out in IVTURS. Consequently, we also propose four different approaches to take advantage of this reduction on the search space to study if it can imply an enhancement of the accuracy of the classifier. The experimental results prove: 1) the enhancement of the efficiency of IVTURS and 2) the accuracy of IVTURS is competitive versus that of the approaches using the reduced search space.","Sanz, José Antonio; da Cruz Asmus, Tiago; de la Osa, Borja; Bustince, Humberto",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,537,1

Malondialdehyde (MDH) is a colorless lipid that can be used as a marker for oxidative stress. Cranial ultrasound sensitivity and specificity in detection of neonatal HIE ought to be further investigated. This study aims to detect whether serum (MDH) can be used as an indicator for HIE severity and to assess the role of cranial ultrasound in diagnosis of HIE neurological disorders, correlating ultrasound findings to MDA levels. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between the serum MDA levels in patients compared to controls as well as among serum MDA in patients with advancing Sarnat stages (I, II, III) P value < 0.001. Statistically significant levels of serum MDA were found in patients with ischemic US findings compared to those with normal scan; 36.4% of cases with ischemic US findings were diagnosed as Sarnat stage II while 63.6% were diagnosed with stage III with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Cranial ultrasound can be used for diagnosis of neonatal hypoxic ischemic insults, with lower sensitivity in mild cases and increased sensitivity in severe cases; and when combined with measuring serum MDA levels, it can be used as a diagnostic marker and as a predictor for severity of HIE.","Seif El Dein, Hadeel M.; Fahmy, Nouran; El Din, Zahraa Ezz; Morgan, Marianne; Fattah, Marwa Abdel; Eltatawy, Sara S.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,537,22

It was unclear how many admissions were from suspected abuse. Our objective was to determine the social impact of the shelter-in-place mandate on the number of burn admissions secondary to suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic compared to previous years. METHODS: Patients were identified using Institutional Burn Center registry and linked to the clinical and administrative data. All patients admitted from January 1, 2016 to July 31, 2020 with suspected abuse were eligible for inclusion. Demographics, patient and burn characteristics were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed with Students’ t-test, and chi-squared test. RESULTS: There were 7177 patients included in the study. Prior to 2020, each year the percentage of cases with suspected abuse decreased compared to previous years (19% decrease in 2017, 23% decrease in 2018, 30% decrease in 2019). Compared 2019, the number of patients admitted with suspected abuse during the COVID pandemic increased 257%, p=0.00046. There were no significant differences in race, ethnicity, sex, burn mechanism, or burn size in those admitted with abuse-related injuries. The average age of patients with abuse-related injuries in 2020 was 13 years old, compared to an average age of 28 years old for the period from 2016–2019 (p< 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant increase in number of patients admitted for suspected abuse. Shelter-in-place mandate limited viral transmission of COVID-19 but led to unfathomable increases in abuse cases at our institution.","Williams, Felicia N; Sljivic, Sanja; Chrisco, Lori; Maxwell, Eli; Hollowell, Jamie; Nizamani, Rabia; King, Booker",J Burn Care Res,537,16

Drawing on protection motivation theory, the study validated a psychometric model to explain what motivates individuals to install a warning app for the first time and to keep using it over time. Multi-group covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to model the answers to a survey that measured the drivers of intention to begin using or intention to continue using a warning app. The model shows that, for both non-users and users, trust, social influence, and response efficacy positively and maladaptive rewards negatively affect intention to use and intention to continue use warning apps. However, perceived vulnerability influences only intention to use, whereas response cost and self-efficacy affect continued use intention. Hence, this study enhances the theoretical understanding of technology-enabled protection behaviors and provides practitioners with a list of factors to consider for pushing the adoption and continued use of emergency warning applications.

It accounts for 75% of all kidney tumors. Although new targeted drugs continue to appear, they are still not suitable for all patients. Therefore, an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of the development of ccRCC and exploration of new targets for the treatment of ccRCC will help to achieve precise treatment for ccRCC. With the development of molecular research, the study of long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) has given us a new understanding of tumors. Although LncRNA does not encode proteins, it directly interacts with proteins in various signaling pathways and affects cell functions. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the mechanism of LncRNA in ccRCC. The expression level of Linc00472 in ccRCC tissues is significantly lower than adjacent normal tissues, and its low expression is closely related to Furman's high grade. The low expression of Linc00472 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with ccRCC. The results of protein interaction and functional enrichment analysis indicate that genes upregulated in renal clear cell carcinoma may play a major role. Analysis of target gene prediction results showed that Linc00472 may be used as ceRNA in the miR-24-3p-HLA-DPB1 pathway, miR-24-3p-CXCL9 pathway, miR-221-3p-C3aR1-VEGFR2 pathway, miR-17-5p-HLA-DQA1/HLA-DQB1 pathway, and miR-17-5p-C3aR1/C5aR1-VEGFR2 pathway which play important functions. In addition, the regulatory relationship between miR-24-3p and TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B), CD36, and COL4A1 should also be noted. The value of Linc00472 in the diagnosis and treatment of ccRCC is worthy of further study.","Gao, Shuoze; Wang, Zhiping",J Healthc Eng,537,24

The two major recessive Parkinson's disease genes PINK1 and Parkin play essential roles in mitophagy initiation, increasing the interest in mitophagy in both basic and translational research over the past 10 years. Initially, mitophagy was measured by the loss of mitochondria either through confocal imaging or immunoblot of mitochondrial proteins such as Tom20 or COXII. Confocal imaging of mitochondria DNA loss via anti-DNA staining is another option. All of these methods, which take considerable effort and labor, are not sensitive enough to detect early stages of mitophagy with unambiguous objectivity. The mKeima assay can be used for both confocal imaging and FACS analysis to provide a thorough picture of mitophagy with a wide dynamic range. The Keima fluorophore has bimodal excitation under neutral and acidic pH conditions. Thus, when Keima is targeted to mitochondria it can accurately reveal the formation of mitolysosomes. Here the author briefly describes the origin and history of mKeima and how it is adapted to measure mitophagy. The author presents detailed protocols for making stable cell lines for optimized mitophagy detection and discuss many parameters that might affect the assay. A troubleshooting section is also provided to discuss possible pitfalls to improve reproducibility and sensitivity of the assay. © 2019 The Authors.

As a C-2 epimer of glucose, d-mannose can alleviate bone loss and repress immunopathology by upregulating regulatory T cells; however, the role of d-mannose in OA-related cartilage degeneration remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the chondroprotective effect of d-mannose in vitro and in vivo on OA. We found that incubating interleukin (IL)-1β-treated rat chondrocytes with d-mannose restrained OA degeneration by elevating cell proliferation, strongly activating autophagy, reducing apoptosis, and downregulating catabolism. Additionally, oral gavage administration of d-mannose to monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-treated rats revealed that a median (1.25 g/kg/day) rather than high or low dose of d-mannose suppressed OA progression and attenuated OA development based on lower macroscopic scores for cartilage, decreased histological scores for cartilage and synovium, strongly activated autophagy, and downregulated catabolism. In terms of a downstream mechanism, we showed that d-mannose might attenuate OA degeneration by activating autophagy in IL-1β-treated rat chondrocytes by promoting the phosphorylation of 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our in vitro findings revealed that d-mannose delayed IL-1β-induced OA degeneration in rat chondrocytes by enhancing autophagy activation through the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, the in vivo results indicated that a median dose of d-mannose suppressed MIA-induced OA development. These results suggested that d-mannose exhibits chondroprotective effects and represents a potential disease-modifying drug and novel therapeutic agent for OA.","Lin, Zhiming; Miao, Jianing; Zhang, Tao; He, Ming; Zhou, Xiaonan; Zhang, He; Gao, Yue; Bai, Lunhao",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,537,8

The current study aims to investigate the role of intolerance of uncertainty in cognitive, emotional and behavioral reactions to this pandemic and propose a path model of these reactions. In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia, participants in a general sample (n = 1,011) as well as an older adult sample (n = 655) completed measures regarding intolerance of uncertainty, mental health (anxiety, well-being, perceived stress) and adherence to preventive measures. Two rounds of data collection were carried out in the first sample. Intolerance of uncertainty was found to be related to mental health indicators and the structural equation model showed a direct and indirect effect on them as well as on the adherence to preventive measures. However, the comparison of data from different time points has brought inconsistent results. The findings highlight the role of intolerance of uncertainty in reaction to threat and indicate the potential of uncertainty reduction e.g., getting clear messages from authorities, as a way of decreasing mental health problems.","Bavolar, Jozef; Kacmar, Pavol; Hricova, Monika; Schrötter, Jana; Kovacova-Holevova, Bibiana; Köverova, Miroslava; Raczova, Beata",The Journal of general psychology,537,9

In the present work, we report a study of the binding and interaction with model membranes of a peptide pertaining to the putative fusion domain of SARS-CoV, SARS FP, as well as the structural changes that take place in both the phospholipid and the peptide molecules upon this interaction. From fluorescence and infrared spectroscopies, the peptide ability to induce membrane leakage, aggregation and fusion, as well as its affinity toward specific phospholipids, was assessed. We demonstrate that SARS FP strongly partitions into phospholipid membranes, more specifically with those containing negatively charged phospholipids, increasing the water penetration depth and displaying membrane-activity modulated by the lipid composition of the membrane. Interestingly, peptide organization is different depending if SARS FP is in water or bound to the membrane. These data suggest that SARS FP could be involved in the merging of the viral and target cell membranes by perturbing the membrane outer leaflet phospholipids and specifically interacting with negatively charged phospholipids located in the inner leaflet.","Guillén, Jaime; de Almeida, Rodrigo F M; Prieto, Manuel; Villalaín, José",The journal of physical chemistry.

About 10-20% recur after initial treatment, with increasing recurrence following subsequent treatment courses. This sequence can lead to recurrent CDI (rCDI), refractory to conventional therapeutics resulting in the most common indication for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is the most effective microbial therapeutic to date and can cure rCDI in 80-90% of cases. There is growing concern, however, for pathogen transmission through FMT, underscoring the importance of careful recipient selection. In adults referred for FMT with a tentative diagnosis of rCDI, alternative diagnoses were recognized in 25% of patients, but such observation in children is lacking. In this single-center retrospective study, alternative diagnoses (for example constipation/overflow diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease) were found in 13 (22.4%) of 58 children who were referred for FMT evaluation for rCDI. Of the patients who were diagnosed with rCDI, 16 (27.6%) did not require FMT.","Ruan, Wenly; Kellermayer, Richard",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,537,16

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (≥27 in persons with ≥1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]).

The present prospective comparison study was designed to determine the effects of variations in arterial blood pressure on the reliability of the FTV system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS Comparative measurements of cardiac output by FTV (derived from a femoral arterial line; software version 1.14) and IPATD were performed in 16 patients undergoing elective CABG in the period before institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia, after sternotomy, and during five time points during graft preparation. During graft preparation, arterial blood pressure was increased stepwise in intervals of 10 to 15 minutes by infusion of noradrenaline and lowered thereafter to baseline levels. RESULTS Mean arterial blood pressure was varied between 85 mmHg and 115 mmHg. IPATD cardiac output did not show significant changes during periods with increased arterial pressure either during sternotomy or after pharmacological manipulation. In contrast, FTV cardiac output paralleled changes in arterial blood pressure; i.e. increased significantly if blood pressure was raised and decreased upon return to baseline levels. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and FTV cardiac output were closely correlated (r = 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 - 0.74), P < 0.0001) while no correlation between MAP and IPATD cardiac output was observed. Bland-Altman analyses for FTV versus IPATD cardiac output measurements revealed a bias of 0.4 l/min (8.5%) and limits of agreement from 2.1 to -1.3 l/min (42.2 to -25.3%). CONCLUSIONS Acute variations in arterial blood pressure alter the reliability of the FlowTrac/Vigileo device with the second-generation software. This finding may help to explain the variable results of studies comparing the FTV system with other cardiac output monitoring techniques, questions the usefulness of this device for hemodynamic monitoring of patients undergoing rapid changes in arterial blood pressure, and should be kept in mind when using vasopressors during FTV-guided hemodynamic optimization.","Eleftheriadis, Savvas; Galatoudis, Zisis; Didilis, Vasilios; Bougioukas, Ioannis; Schön, Julika; Heinze, Hermann; Berger, Klaus-Ulrich; Heringlake, Matthias",Critical care,537,1

Various membrane proteins are present in Plasmodium falciparum, the principal malaria pathogen. Among them, P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (PfRh5) is indispensable for erythrocyte invasion, and has become a promising vaccine target. Basigin (CD147, EMMPRIN) has been identified as the erythrocyte receptor of PfRh5, and shown to be essential for the invasion of multiple strains of the pathogen. AREAS COVERED Fundamental information on basigin is fully described, including structure as a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and function based on its interactions with external molecules and with proteins within the same membrane. The involvement of basigin in many diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases is also described, the implication being that anti-basigin therapy might be helpful to treat certain illnesses. Finally, PfRh5 as a vaccine candidate is covered, and its interaction with basigin is evaluated. EXPERT OPINION The identification of basigin, a well-characterized membrane protein, as a receptor essential for malaria infection will contribute significantly to prevention and treatment of malaria. As an example, anti-basigin therapy can be considered an alternative approach to the treatment of drug-resistant malaria.","Muramatsu, Takashi",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,537,16

This included patient demographic data and intraoperative and postoperative outcomes. INTERVENTIONS Four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and SILS for cholecystectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative time, conversion to open operation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Operative time was longer with SILS for cholecystectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (P < .001). A correlation was seen between reducing SILS operative time and increasing experience (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, -0.29). Three patients in the SILS for cholecystectomy group required the addition of extra laparoscopic ports. No patients in the SILS for cholecystectomy group required conversion to open surgery compared with 4 patients in the standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. Patients stayed an average of 0.76 days following SILS for cholecystectomy and 1.53 days following conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

A pattern of weekly HED is most prevalent in emerging adults (i.e., age 18-25). However, rates of HED consistently decline in the mid to late twenties, referred to as 'aging out' or 'maturing out' of HED. Although many individual studies have followed changes in drinking behaviour over the transition to adulthood, there has yet to be a systematic review to identify consistent factors contributing to risk (i.e. failure to age out) and protection (i.e. successful aging out). The objective of this review will be to summarize and critically appraise the literature on factors contributing to aging out of HED among emerging adults. METHODS A systematic search of observational cohort studies following drinking behaviours in age cohorts overlapping with the emerging adulthood period will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychInfo, and CINAHL. Two independent reviewers will evaluate identified studies for inclusion eligibility, extract study data, and assess the quality of included studies. Primary outcomes will be quantity/frequency of alcohol use (e.g. drinks/week) and severity of alcohol-related problems. Predictors of maturing out of HED will be reported narratively, and where appropriate, random effects meta-analyses will be conducted to provide pooled effect sizes. An evidence map will be created to characterize the overall pattern of findings. DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide a timely and warranted summary of published work contributing to understanding aging out of heavy episodic drinking. Our findings will provide critical commentary on the developmental course of HED during the transition from adolescence to adulthood and will be the first review to consider both protective and risk factors for maturing out of frequent binge drinking. By highlighting factors identifying those at-risk for prolonged heavy episodic drinking, our conclusions will have important treatment implications for primary, secondary, and tertiary intervention strategies.

Our objective was to test the performance of such MRI-derived collateral flow indices for prediction of recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy. METHODS Fifty-seven patients with MCA-M1 occlusion evaluated with multimodal MRI prior to thrombectomy were included. Bayesian processing allowed quantification of collateral perfusion indices like the volume of tissue with severely prolonged arterial-tissue delay (>6 s) (VolATD6). Baseline DWI lesion volume was also measured. Correlations with angiographic collateral flow grading and post-thrombectomy recanalization were assessed. RESULTS VolATD6 < 27 ml or DWI lesion volume <15 ml provide the most accurate diagnosis of excellent collateral supply (p < 0.0001). The combination of VolATD6 > 27 ml and DWI lesion volume >15 ml significantly discriminates recanalizers versus nonrecanalizers (whole cohort, p = 0.032; MERCI cohort (n = 50), p = 0.024). When both criteria are positive, 76.2 % of the patients treated with the MERCI retriever do not fully recanalize (p = 0.024). In multivariate analysis, the aforementioned combined criterion and the angiographic collateral grade are the only independent predictors of recanalization with the MERCI retriever (p = 0.015 and 0.029, respectively). CONCLUSION Bayesian arterial-tissue delay maps and DWI maps provide a non-invasive assessment of the degree of collateral flow and a combined index that is predictive of MCA-M1 recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the accuracy of this index in patients treated with novel stent retriever devices.","Nicoli, F; Scalzo, F; Saver, J L; Pautot, F; Mitulescu, A; Chaibi, Y; Girard, N; Salamon, N; Liebeskind, D S",Neuroradiology,537,31

Comprehensive incidence, epidemiologic and etiologic data are needed to update prevention and control strategies. METHODS We conducted active, population-based surveillance for hospitalized cases of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) among children <5 years of age in rural Thailand. ALRI cases were systematically sampled for an etiology study that tested nasopharyngeal specimens by polymerase chain reaction; children without ALRI were enrolled as controls from outpatient clinics. RESULTS We identified 28,543 hospitalized ALRI cases from 2005 to 2010. Among the 49% with chest radiographs, 76% had findings consistent with pneumonia as identified by 2 study radiologists. The hospitalized ALRI incidence rate was 5772 per 100,000 child-years (95% confidence interval: 5707, 5837) and was higher in boys versus girls (incidence rate ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.35-1.41) and in children 6-23 months of age versus other age groups (incidence rate ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.69-1.84). Viruses most commonly detected in ALRI cases were respiratory syncytial virus (19.5%), rhinoviruses (18.7%), bocavirus (12.8%) and influenza viruses (8%). Compared with controls, ALRI cases were more likely to test positive for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 (P ≤ 0.01 for all). Bloodstream infections, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae and nontyphoidal Salmonella, accounted for 1.8% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Our findings underscore the high burden of hospitalization for ALRI and the importance of viral pathogens among children in Thailand. Interventions targeting viral pathogens coupled with improved diagnostic approaches, especially for bacteria, are critical for better understanding of ALRI etiology, prevention and control.","Hasan, Reem; Rhodes, Julia; Thamthitiwat, Somsak; Olsen, Sonja J; Prapasiri, Prabda; Naorat, Sathapana; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Henchaichon, Sununta; Dejsirilert, Surang; Srisaengchai, Prasong; Sawatwong, Pongpun; Jorakate, Possawat; Kaewpwan, Anek; Fry, Alicia M; Erdman, Dean; Chuananon, Somchai; Amornintapichet, Tussanee; Maloney, Susan A; Baggett, Henry C",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,537,1

Although initially different in vagal tone suppression during solitary play, girls and boys exhibited similar group patterns of vagal reengagement during successive language and play tasks with their mothers and with an experimenter. In terms of individual differences, vagal suppression during solitary play and vagal reengagement during social interactive tasks predicted language and play performance. Gender differences emerged in patterns of predictive relations: Task-to-task vagal changes predicted primarily play performance in girls and language performance in boys. These findings expose the effects of social context on directional changes in task-to-task vagal tone and speak to the functional role of appropriate vagal regulation in young children's language and play performance.","Suess, Patricia E; Bornstein, Marc H",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,537,12

Purpose of this survey is to assess the habits related to IM, their application in clinical practice and the perceived pros and cons. An online survey was distributed to the medical community via newsletters, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. The survey consisted of 22 questions made on an individual-basis and collected anonymously on SurveyMonkey. A total of 287 subjects from 33 countries responded to the survey (mean age 43 years, 74.8% male). Of all respondents, 88.3% routinely send and 90.3% receive clinical data through IM which was second only to face-to-face contact as the preferred method for sharing clinical data. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (88.6%), medical history (61.4%), and echo loops (55.7%) were the data shared most often. Nearly half of the clinical data that are sent (43%) or received (44%) are not anonymized. In the same way, 29.3% of the respondents were not aware of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) at the time of the survey. IM apps are used by medical professionals worldwide to share and discuss clinical data and are preferred to many other methods of data sharing, being second only to face-to-face contact. IM are often used to share many different types of clinical data, being perceived as a fast and easy way of communication. Medical professionals should be aware of the appropriate use of IM to prevent legal and privacy issues.","Guerra, Federico; Linz, Dominik; Garcia, Rodrigue; Kommata, Varvara; Kosiuk, Jedrzej; Chun, Julian; Boveda, Serge; Duncker, David","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",537,1

In group A, patients underwent surgery anesthesia with dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil. In group B, patients underwent surgery anesthesia only with sufentanil. The anesthesia induced intubation, operation time and incidence of postoperative adverse reaction of patients were compared between the two groups. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were observed and recorded before induction, before intubation and after intubation. Blood coagulation analyzer was used to detect four items of coagulation before and after operation. FACSCalibur flow cytometry was used to detect T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of patients in the two groups. The pain scores (VAS) of patients in the two groups were measured and recorded after surgery at 4, 24 and 48 h.

METHODS We identified women aged ≥18 years with stage 0-IV breast cancer who were diagnosed in a single health system between January 2014 and July 2016. The baseline visit was defined as the first postdiagnosis, pretreatment clinical evaluation. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression (modeling non-zero DT scores and DT scores = 0) and logistic regression (modeling DT score ≥ 4, threshold for social services referral) were used to examine associations between baseline score (0 = none to 10 = extreme) and types of stressors (emotional, familial, practical, physical, spiritual) after adjustment for race/ethnicity and other characteristics. Linear regression with log transformation was used to identify predictors of time to evaluation and time to treatment. RESULTS A total of 1029 women were included (median baseline DT score = 4). Emotional, physical, and practical stressors were associated with distress in both the ZINB and logistic models (all P < .05). Black patients (n = 258) were more likely to report no distress than Whites (n = 675; ZINB zero model odds ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.68-4.40; P < .001) despite reporting a similar number of stressors (P = .07). Higher DT scores were associated with shorter time to evaluation and time to treatment while being Black and having physical or practical stressors were associated with delays in both (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Patient-reported stressors predicted delays in time to care, but patient-reported levels of distress did not, with Black patients having delayed time to care despite reporting low levels of distress. We describe anticipatory, culturally responsive strategies for using patient-reported outcomes to address observed disparities.","Fayanju, Oluwadamilola M; Ren, Yi; Stashko, Ilona; Power, Steve; Thornton, Madeline J; Marcom, P Kelly; Hyslop, Terry; Hwang, E Shelley",Cancer,537,32

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 220 dogs with a nasal swab specimen submitted to an Atlanta-area diagnostic laboratory between May 1 and July 2, 2015, for PCR assay detection of CIV specifically or CIV and 5 other respiratory pathogens. PROCEDURES Veterinarians of tested dogs were surveyed by various means to collect information regarding clinical signs, survival status at the time of survey completion, vaccination history (≤ 12 months prior to testing), and travel history (≤ 2 months prior to testing). Data were compared between CIV-positive and CIV-negative dogs. RESULTS Surveys for 120 (55%) dogs were completed. Forty (33%) of these dogs had positive results of CIV testing. No significant differences were identified between CIV-positive and CIV-negative dogs regarding breed, sex, reproductive status, duration of clinical signs prior to testing, other dogs in the household, or travel history. When other factors were controlled for, CIV-positive dogs were more likely to be adult (> 1 year of age) than juvenile (≤ 1 year of age) and to be inappetent. Only 1 (3%) CIV-positive dog died during the study period (shortly after it was evaluated because of respiratory signs).

The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD patients' management were assessed in our Tertiary Gastroenterology Center in Bucharest, Romania. METHODS Medical records of IBD patients admitted between 15th of March and 15th of August 2020 were retrospectively reviewed and compared to a control cohort of consecutive IBD patients admitted to our unit during the corresponding period of 2019. RESULTS There was a highly significant shift towards one-day hospitalization during the referral period in 2020 for IBD cases (91% in 2020 vs 82.2% in 2019, p=0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the distribution of patient's gender, IBD phenotype or newly diagnosed IBD cases. A significantly lower proportion of admitted patients received 5-aminosalicylic acid (29% vs 41.2%, p=0.0001), whereas a substantially higher number of patients were prescribed biological therapy in 2020 in comparison to the corresponding 2019-time frame (79.5% vs 57.9%, p<0.0001). The distribution of the biological agent used was significantly different in 2019 in comparison to the 2020 period mainly due to the increase in vedolizumab prescription in 2020 (p<0.0001). During the study period in 2020, seven IBD patients (1.7%) were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection, all of them with mild symptoms without impact on the IBD course. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic led to reorganizing medical care, limiting the hospital admissions in favor of severe IBD cases, favoring telemedicine for mild disease and optimization of treatment for moderate to severe IBD with an increased use of biologicals aimed to maximize the risk/benefit ratio. Incidence of SARS-Cov2 infection during the first wave of COVID-19 infection in our study group was 1.7% and did not adversely impact the IBD disease course.","Vadan, Roxana; Iacob, Razvan; Costache, Roxana; Stroie, Tudor; Saizu, Ionut Adrian; Iacob, Speranta; Gheorghe, Liliana; Diculescu, Mircea; Gheorghe, Cristian",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,537,1

First, we show that structure finding with the PC algorithm can be inherently unstable and requires further operational constraints in order to consistently obtain models that are faithful to the data. We propose a methodology to stabilise the structure finding process, minimising both false positive and false negative error rates. This is demonstrated with synthetic data. Second, to apply the proposed structure finding methodology to a data set comprising single-voxel Magnetic Resonance Spectra of normal brain and three classes of brain tumours, to elucidate the associations between brain tumour types and a range of observed metabolites that are known to be relevant for their characterisation. The data set is bootstrapped in order to maximise the robustness of feature selection for nominated target variables. Specifically, Conditional Independence maps (CI-maps) built from the data and their derived Bayesian networks have been used. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is built from CI-maps, being a major challenge the minimization of errors in the graph structure. This work presents empirical evidence on how to reduce false positive errors via the False Discovery Rate, and how to identify appropriate parameter settings to improve the False Negative Reduction. In addition, several node ordering policies are investigated that transform the graph into a DAG. The obtained results show that ordering nodes by strength of mutual information can recover a representative DAG in a reasonable time, although a more accurate graph can be recovered using a random order of samples at the expense of increasing the computation time.","Casaña-Eslava, Raúl Vicente; Ortega-Martorell, Sandra; Lisboa, Paulo J; Candiota, Ana Paula; Julià-Sapé, Margarida; Martín-Guerrero, José David; Jarman, Ian H",PloS one,537,9

As older adults are more vulnerable than those in other age groups in this disaster, their psychological distress in this pandemic is of particular concern. Considering the importance of communities in combating the pandemic, we examined the role of a community in relieving older adults' psychological distress and the heterogeneous effect by older adults' different levels of risk perception.Method: We collected data through a questionnaire survey of 272 older adults in 12 communities in the Sichuan province of China in April 2020, and used the structural equation model to analyze the data.Results: we found that community resilience was negatively associated with older adults' psychological distress (depression, anxiety, stress), and this association was mediated by perceived community prevention effectiveness. However, this indirect effect was stronger for older adults with low risk perceptions than for ones with high risk perceptions (including self-risk perception and group-risk perception).Conclusion: These findings underlined a community's vital significance in alleviating older adults' psychological distress amid the COVID-19 pandemic and moreover indicated that tailored interventions for facilitating community pandemic prevention should be designed for older adults with different risk perceptions.","Zhang, Jinfeng; Wang, Yan; Zhou, Mingjie",Aging & mental health,537,1

A CASE SERIES.,12.23223,10.734922,2020-09-25,"Background Garlic oil is a rich source of organosulfur compounds including diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide. There have been studies showing the neuroprotective actions of these organosulfur compounds. However, the potential of these organosulfur compounds in neuropathic pain has not been explored. The present study was aimed at investigating the pain attenuating potential of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rats. The study also explored their pain-attenuating mechanisms through modulation of H2S, brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Methods The rats were subjected to CCI injury by ligating the sciatic nerve in four places. The development of neuropathic pain was measured by assessing mechanical hyperalgesia (Randall-Selittotest), mechanical allodynia (Von Frey test), and cold allodynia (acetone drop test) on 14th day after surgery. Results Administration of diallyl disulfide (25 and 50 mg/kg) and diallyl trisulfide (20 and 40 mg/kg) for 14 days led to a significant reduction in pain in CCI-subjected rats. Moreover, treatment with these organosulfur compounds led to the restoration of H2S, BDNF and Nrf2 levels in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia. Coadministration of ANA-12 (BDNF blocker) abolished pain attenuating actions as well as BDNF and the Nrf2 restorative actions of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, without modulating H2S levels. Conclusions Diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide have the potential to attenuate neuropathic pain in CCI-subjected rats possibly through activation of H2S-BDNF-Nrf2 signaling pathway.","Wang, Gang; Yang, Yan; Wang, Chunfeng; Huang, Jianzhong; Wang, Xiao; Liu, Ying; Wang, Hao",The Korean journal of pain,537,1

Structural components of the 3D object, spectrally encoded in the remitted light, are transformed from the Fourier domain into each voxel of the 3D OCT image without compromising sensitivity. Spatial distribution of the nanoscale structural changes in the depth direction is visualized in just a single OCT scan. This label free approach provides new possibilities for depth resolved study of pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules in the body with high sensitivity and specificity. It offers a powerful opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Experimental results show the ability of the approach to differentiate structural changes of 30 nm in nanosphere aggregates, located at different depths, from a single OCT scan, and structural changes less than 30 nm in time from two OCT scans.

Our previous study showed that the use of minimal media for P. gingivalis allowed to isolate novel inhibitors of P. gingivalis growth. However, growth of P. gingivalis in minimal media was not always reproducible. METHODS To explain this phenomenon, we analyzed the growth of seven wild-type ATCC 33277 strains and two wild-type W83 strains in 10 minimal media and three complex media. RESULTS All nine strains grew in LF (Lactalbumin-Ferric chloride), GC (bovine γ-immunoglobulin G-Calcium chloride), and newly developed mC (milk-Casein) minimal media. Therefore, LF, GC, and mC could be used as minimal media for P. gingivalis. In contrast, other six minimal media containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) supported the growth of several less strains; among these, two media also showed lack of reproducibility in growth among ATCC 33277 strains. On the other hand, four ATCC 33277 strains grew similarly in all 13 media, but two W83 and other three ATCC 33277 strains grew differently in at least one medium. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the lack of reproducibility of P. gingivalis growth on minimal media is caused by the presence of BSA, and by differences among the standard strains of P. gingivalis.","Saiki, Keitarou; Urano-Tashiro, Yumiko; Takahashi, Yukihiro",Journal of oral biosciences,537,30

TSWs often experience violence from clients, police, and others, but it is estimated that 50% of these acts of violence are at the hands of their intimate partners. The marginalization of TSWs is fueled by abuse through isolation and shaming which prevents them from seeking help through formal channels like police or counselling services. There is limited research on intimate partner violence (IPV) involving transgender sex workers (biologically male at birth who transition to women) and their partners who are typically heterosexual/bisexual men. In China, stigmatization, homophobia, heterosexism, and transphobia structurally disadvantage TSWs and this power structure tacitly supports violence and abuse against them. To survive, TSWs rely on informal networks with their 'sisters' for advice and emotional support which is more effective at combatting IPV than criminal justice or social policy efforts. Ethnographic data from in-depth interviews with 25 TSWs provide insight about IPV and how informal social support is a protective factor that helps them cope with routine acts of violence. The findings identify the importance of the 'sisterhood' and how it protects and helps TSWs manage their physical and mental health.","Tsang, Eileen Yuk-Ha",International journal of environmental research and public health,537,1

We herein report six cases of successful single-incision laparoscopic (SILS) herniorrhaphy. METHODS Six patients, five with unilateral inguinal hernias and one with bilateral inguinal hernias, underwent SILS herniorrhaphy. A Covidien SILS port was inserted via an umbilical incision, through which three trocars of 5, 5 and 12 mm (or 5 mm) were inserted. The peritoneum was then opened with flexible scissors and electrocoagulation, after which, the preperitoneal space was dissected. A mesh was then fixed, and the peritoneum was finally closed using Covidien SILS Stitch or AbsorbaTack. RESULTS The mean length of the operation for the unilateral cases was 136 min. The increased time was due to difficulties unrelated to this methodology. However, the length of the operation in the bilateral case was 94 min. All patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS SILS herniorrhaphy requires experience and more time than conventional three-port herniorrhaphy. However, if the length of the operation can be shortened, then this novel surgical technique is considered to be feasible and it is expected to improve the cosmetic outcome without any additional risk.","Takayama, Satoru; Nakai, Nozomu; Sakamoto, Masaki; Takeyama, Hiromitsu",Surgery today,537,1

Mesh hernia repair became the gold standard because of its low recurrence rate in comparison with non-tension-free repair. Laparoscopic approach seems to have potential advantages over open techniques, including faster recovery and reduced acute and chronic pain rate. Laparoscopic mesh fixation is usually performed using staples, which is associated with higher cost and risk for chronic pain. Recently, the role of mesh fixation has been questioned by several surgeons. AIM To evaluate mesh displacement in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair comparing mesh fixation with no fixation. METHODS From January 2012 to May 2014, 60 consecutive patients with unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized into two groups: control group--10 patients underwent totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with mesh fixation; NO FIX group-50 patients underwent TEP repair with no mesh fixation. Mesh was marked with three 3-mm surgical clips at its medial inferior, medial superior and lateral inferior corners. Mesh displacement was measured by comparing an initial X-ray, performed in the immediate postoperative period, with a second X-ray obtained 30 days later. RESULTS The mean displacement of all three clips in control group was 0.1-0.35 cm (range 0-1.2 cm), while in NO FIX group was 0.1-0.3 cm (range 0-1.3 cm). The overall displacement of control and NO FIX group did not show any difference (p = 0.50). CONCLUSION Fixation of the mesh for TEP repair is unnecessary. TEP repair with no mesh fixation is safe and is not associated with increased risk of mesh displacement.","Claus, C M P; Rocha, G M; Campos, A C L; Bonin, E A; Dimbarre, D; Loureiro, M P; Coelho, J C U",Surgical endoscopy,537,20

After creating a defect in the left side of the diaphragm, thoracic drainage was performed by thoracostomy tube insertion through the defect and a small (DD-SP) or large (DD-LP) puncture created in the caudal mediastinum, or through both the diaphragmatic defect and intact contralateral diaphragm with a small (DI-SP) or large (DI-LP) puncture in made in the caudal mediastinum. Differences in intrapleural pressure (IPP) between the right and left hemithoraxes after air evacuation along with differences in IPP before making a defect and after air evacuation in each hemithorax were calculated. A difference (p ≤ 0.0011) in IPP between the left and right hemithoraxes after air evacuation as well as before making a defect and after air evacuation in the right hemithorax was detected for the DD-SP group. No significant differences (p ≥ 0.0835) were observed for the DI-LP, DD-LP, or DI-SP groups. Creation of a large mediastinal puncture or thoracic evacuation through both a diaphragmatic defect and intact contralateral diaphragm can facilitate proper pneumothorax elimination bilaterally after diaphragmatic defect closure in dogs with a small puncture in the caudal mediastinum.","Yoon, Hun-Young; Mann, F A; Lee, Suhwon; Jeong, Soon-wuk",Journal of veterinary science,537,6

DESIGN Local health departments voluntarily participated weekly in a National Association of County and City Health Officials Web-based survey designed to provide situational awareness to federal partners about NPI recommendations and implementation during the response and to provide insight into the epidemiologic context in which recommendations were made. SETTING Local health departments during the fall 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. PARTICIPANTS Local health departments that voluntarily participated in the National Association of County and City Health Officials Sentinel Surveillance Network. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Local health departments were asked to report data on recommendations for and the implementation of NPIs from 7 community sectors. Data were also collected on influenza outbreaks; closures, whether recommended by the local health department or not; absenteeism of students in grades K-12; the type(s) of influenza viruses circulating in the jurisdiction; and the health care system capacity. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine LHDs participated. Most LHDs issued NPI recommendations to their community over the 10-week survey period with 70% to 97% of LHDs recommending hand hygiene and cough etiquette and 51% to 78% voluntary isolation of ill patients. However, 21% to 48% of LHDs lacked information of closure, absenteeism, or outbreaks in schools, and 28% to 50% lacked information on outpatient clinic capacity. CONCLUSIONS Many LHDs were unable to monitor implementation of NPI (recommended by LHD or not) within their community during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. This gap makes it difficult to adjust recommendations or messaging during a public health emergency response. Public health preparedness could be improved by strengthening NPI monitoring capacity.","Cantey, Paul T; Chuk, Michelle G; Kohl, Katrin S; Herrmann, Jack; Weiss, Paul; Graffunder, Corinne M; Averhoff, Francisco; Kahn, Emily B; Painter, John",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,537,1

We assessed the host tissue incorporation of different bioprostheses using a new tool that combines immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with differential interference contrast images, making it possible to distinguish newly formed collagen. Partial hernial defects in the abdominal wall of rabbits were repaired using cross-linked/noncross-linked bioprostheses. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) was used as control. After 14/30/90/180 days of implant, specimens were taken for microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to determine host tissue ingrowth and collagen I/III protein and 1a1/3a1 gene expression. Shrinkage and stress resistance were also examined. At 14 days, cross-linked prostheses had suffered significantly less shrinkage than ePTFE or noncross-linked prostheses. Significantly higher shrinkage was recorded for ePTFE in the longer term. Microscopy revealed encapsulation of ePTFE by neoformed tissue, while the bioprostheses became gradually infiltrated by host tissue. Noncross-linked prosthesis showed better tissue ingrowth, more intense inflammatory reaction and more rapid degradation than the cross-linked prostheses. At 14 days, cross-linked prostheses induced up-regulated collagen 1a1 and 3a1 gene expression, while noncross-linked only showed increased collagen III protein expression at 90 days postimplant. At 6 months, the tensile strengths of cross-linked prostheses were significantly greater compared with ePTFE. Our findings demonstrate that despite the cross-linked collagen prostheses promoting less tissue ingrowth than the noncross-linked meshes, they became gradually replaced by good quality host tissue and were less rapidly degraded, leading to improved stress resistance in the long term.","Pascual, Gemma; Rodríguez, Marta; Sotomayor, Sandra; Moraleda, Eduardo; Bellón, Juan M",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,537,1

The human NoV open reading frame 1 (ORF1) encodes a 200-kDa polyprotein which is cleaved by the viral 20-kDa 3C-like protease (Pro, NS6) into 6 nonstructural proteins that are necessary for viral replication. The NoV ORF1 polyprotein is processed in a specific order, with ""early"" sites (NS1/2-3 and NS3-4) being cleaved rapidly and three ""late"" sites (NS4-5, NS5-6, and NS6-7) processed subsequently and less efficiently. Previously, we demonstrated that the NoV polyprotein processing order is directly correlated with the efficiency of the enzyme, which is regulated by the primary amino acid sequences surrounding ORF1 cleavage sites. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) peptides representing the NS2-3 and NS6-7 ORF1 cleavage sites, we now demonstrate that the amino acids spanning positions P4 to P2' (P4-P2') surrounding each site comprise the core sequence controlling NoV protease enzyme efficiency. Furthermore, the NoV polyprotein self-processing order can be altered by interchanging this core sequence between NS2-3 and any of the three late sites in in vitro transcription-translation assays. We also demonstrate that the nature of the side chain at the P3 position for the NS1/2-3 (Nterm/NTPase) site confers significant influence on enzyme catalysis (kcat and kcat/Km), a feature overlooked in previous structural studies. Molecular modeling provides possible explanations for the P3 interactions with NoV protease. IMPORTANCE Noroviruses (NoV) are the prevailing cause of nonbacterial acute gastroenteritis worldwide and pose a significant financial burden on health care systems. Proteolytic processing of the viral nonstructural polyprotein is required for norovirus replication. Previously, the core sequence of amino acids surrounding the scissile bonds responsible for governing the relative processing order had not been determined. Using both FRET-based peptides and full-length NoV polyprotein, we have successfully demonstrated that the core sequences spanning positions P4-P2' surrounding the NS2-3, NS4-5, NS5-6, and NS6-7 cleavage sites contain all of the structural information necessary to control processing order. We also provide insight into a previously overlooked role for the NS2-3 P3 residue in enzyme efficiency. This article builds upon our previous studies on NoV protease enzymatic activities and polyprotein processing order. Our work provides significant additional insight into understanding viral polyprotein processing and has important implications for improving the design of inhibitors targeting the NoV protease.","May, Jared; Viswanathan, Prasanth; Ng, Kenneth K-S; Medvedev, Alexei; Korba, Brent",Journal of virology,537,31

Initially, endoscopic management recommended the use of stents. METHODS A total of 19 patients received endoscopic treatment after LSG to manage leaks. The leak was classified depending on the primary orifice's size (more or less than 10 mm) or on the presence of gastric stenosis. The primary aim was to develop a therapeutic algorithm in order to reduce the number of endoscopic procedures. RESULTS The average number of endoscopic procedures was 2.8 (range 2-5) in group A (leak size <10 mm) and 4 (range 3-7) in group B (leak size >10 mm). Two out of 13 patients had stent migration (15.4 %) and required an additional procedure, one in group A and another in group B. The average duration to achieve complete healing was 3.4 months (range 2-14 months), 2.8 months for group A and 3.9 months for group B. CONCLUSIONS Limited data can be found in the literature on leaks after LSG.

Later, animal to human and human-to-human transmission of the virus began and resulting in widespread respiratory illness worldwide to around more than 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared this disease as a pandemic in March 2020. There is no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available to be used against COVID-19. Nevertheless, few broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have been studied against COVID-19 in clinical trials with clinical recovery. In the current review, we summarize the morphology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. A strong rational groundwork was made keeping the focus on current development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Among the proposed therapeutic regimen, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdisevir, azithromycin, toclizumab and cromostat mesylate have shown promising results, and limited benefit was seen with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. Early development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine started based on the full-length genome analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Several subunit vaccines, peptides, nucleic acids, plant-derived, recombinant vaccines are under pipeline.

However, cancer cells often rapidly develop drug resistance towards PIs due to a compensatory mechanism mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 1 (NFE2L1) and aspartic protease DNA damage inducible 1 homolog 2 (DDI2). Following DDI2-mediated cleavage, NFE2L1 is able to induce transcription of virtually all proteasome subunit genes. Under normal condition, cleaved NFE2L1 is constantly degraded by proteasome, whereas in the presence of PIs, it accumulates and induces proteasome synthesis which in turn promotes the development of drug resistance towards PIs. Here, we report that Nelfinavir (NFV), an HIV protease inhibitor, can inhibit DDI2 activity directly. Inhibition of DDI2 by NFV effectively blocks NFE2L1 proteolysis and potentiates cytotoxicity of PIs in cancer cells. Recent clinical evidence indicated that NFV can effectively delay the refractory period of MM patients treated with PI-based therapy. Our finding hence provides a specific molecular mechanism for combinatorial therapy using NFV and PIs for treating MM and probably additional cancers.","Gu, Yuan; Wang, Xin; Wang, Yu; Wang, Yebin; Li, Jie; Yu, Fa-Xing",Cellular signalling,537,16

However, with rising numbers of cases, multiple reports of cardiovascular manifestations have emerged. We present a case of COVID-19 infection complicated by myopericarditis and tamponade requiring drainage. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities presented with five days of productive cough, fever with chills, and intermittent diarrhea. She tested positive for COVID-19. Index EKG revealed new diffuse T-wave inversions and a prolonged QT interval (>500 ms). Troponin was mildly elevated without any anginal symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were not initiated due to concerns about QT prolongation. The echocardiogram revealed preserved left ventricular (LV) function, a small global pericardial effusion, and apical hypokinesis. Serial echocardiograms revealed an enlarging circumferential pericardial effusion with pacemaker wire reported as 'piercing' the right ventricular (RV) apex alongside early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, suggesting echocardiographic tamponade. Chest CT revealed extension of the RV pacemaker lead into the pericardial fat. Interestingly, on comparison with a previous chest CT from 2019, similar lead positions were confirmed. Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 400 cc exudate. CONCLUSIONS Acute myopericarditis and pericardial effusion can occur in COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of severe pulmonary disease. This case highlights the importance of awareness of rare cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the form of acute myopericarditis and cardiac tamponade and their early diagnosis and management.","Purohit, Richa; Kanwal, Arjun; Pandit, Anil; Patel, Bhavin M; Meininger, Glenn Robert; Brown, Jeffrey Jay; Kaliyadan, Antony George; Saini, Aditya",The American journal of case reports,537,1

Recombinant human (rh) TRAIL and the TRAIL-R1 directed monoclonal antibody mapatumumab are currently clinically evaluated as anticancer agents. The objective of this study was to develop radiopharmaceuticals targeting the TRAIL-R1, suitable for clinical use to help understand and predict clinical efficacy in patients. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH rhTRAIL was radioiodinated with (125) I, and conjugated mapatumumab was radiolabelled with (111) In. The radiopharmaceuticals were characterized, their in vitro stability and death receptor targeting capacities were determined and in vivo biodistribution was studied in nude mice bearing human tumour xenografts with different expression of TRAIL-R1. KEY RESULTS Labelling efficiencies, radiochemical purity, stability and binding properties were optimized for the radioimmunoconjugates. In vivo biodistribution showed rapid renal clearance of [(125) I]rhTRAIL, with highest kidney activity at 15 min and almost no detectable activity after 4 h. Activity rapidly decreased in almost all organs, except for the xenografts.

Present work verified whether novel Crabtree negative yeast inoculant could promote RS utilization, rumen fermentation, and milk quality in tropical crossbred lactating Holstein cows. The new stain of Crabtree negative yeasts (Pichia kudriavzevii KKU20 and Candida tropicalis KKU20) was isolated from the rumen of dairy cattle. This study used 6 multiparous crossbreds between Holstein Frisian × Zebu dairy cows in their mid-lactation period. Dairy cows were randomly allocated to three ensiled RS with various yeast stains including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P. kudriavzevii KKU20, and C. tropicalis KKU20 according to a 3 × 3 replicated Latin square design. Crabtree-negative yeast (P. kudriavzevii and C. tropicalis) increased the apparent digestibility of dry matter by about 6.9% when compared with Crabtree-positive yeast (S. cerevisiae). Bacterial populations were highest with ensiled RS by C. tropicalis KKU20. Ensiled RS with Crabtree-negative yeasts were significantly increased with total volatile fatty acids, but they did not affect volatile fatty acid profiles. Milk protein precentage was highest at 35.6 g/kg when C. tropicalis was fed, and lowest when applied with S. cerevisiae and P. kudriavzevii KKU20 in ensiled RS at 34.5 and 34.1 g/kg, respectively. Thus, feeding ensiled RS with novel Crabtree negative yeast could improve RS digestion, rumen fermentation, and milk protein content in dairy cows.","Suntara, Chanon; Cherdthong, Anusorn; Uriyapongson, Suthipong; Wanapat, Metha; Chanjula, Pin",Scientific reports,537,31

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of serum UA level in SICH after EVT in a real-world practice. METHODS Patients were selected from the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Anterior Circulation Ischemic Stroke Registry (ACTUAL). SICH was identified using the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between serum UA and SICH. RESULTS Among 611 enrolled patients, 90 (14.7%) were diagnosed with SICH within 72 hours after EVT. Patients with SICH had a significantly higher level of serum UA (median, 341.0 μmol/L versus 302.0 μmol/L; P = 0.003) than those without SICH. Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with UA levels in the fourth quartile, compared with the first quartile, were more likely to have SICH (odds ratio, 2.846; 95% confidence interval, 1.429-6.003; P = 0.003). The association remained significant after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders. Furthermore, the multiple-adjusted spline regression model showed an inverted U-shape association between UA and SICH (P = 0.047 for nonlinearity). CONCLUSION Our study indicated that increased serum UA level was independently associated with SICH after EVT in acute ischemic stroke.","Yuan, Kang; Zhang, Xiaohao; Chen, Jingjing; Li, Shun; Yang, Dong; Xie, Yi; Xia, Yaqian; Wu, Min; Wang, Huaiming; Xu, Gelin; Liu, Xinfeng",European journal of neurology,537,17

However, the key to clinical application depends on effective gene delivery. METHODS Using a large animal model, we developed two pharmaceutical formulations for gene delivery in the pigs' vagina, which were made up of poly (β-amino ester) (PBAE)-plasmid polyplex nanoparticles (NPs) based two gel materials, modified montmorillonite (mMMT) and hectorite (HTT). FINDINGS By conducting flow cytometry of the cervical cells, we found that PBAE-GFP-NPs-mMMT gel was more efficient than PBAE-GFP-NPs-HTT gel in delivering exogenous DNA intravaginally. Next, we designed specific CRISPR/SpCas9 sgRNAs targeting porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) and evaluated the genome editing efficacy in vivo. We discovered that PERV copy number in vaginal epithelium could be significantly reduced by the local delivery of the PBAE-SpCas9/sgRNA NPs-mMMT gel. Comparable genome editing results were also obtained by high-fidelity version of SpCas9, SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9, in the mMMT gel. Further, we confirmed that the expression of topically delivered SpCas9 was limited to the vagina/cervix and did not diffuse to nearby organs, which was relatively safe with low toxicity. INTERPRETATION Our data suggested that the PBAE-NPs mMMT vaginal gel is an effective preparation for local gene therapy, yielding insights into novel therapeutic approaches to sexually transmitted disease in the genital tract.

The natural reservoir of MARV is the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus); that of EBOV is unknown but believed to be another bat species. The Egyptian rousette develops subclinical productive infection with MARV but is refractory to EBOV. Interaction of filoviruses with hosts is greatly affected by the viral interferon (IFN)-inhibiting domains (IID). Our study was aimed at characterization of innate immune responses to filoviruses and the role of filovirus IID in bat and human cells. The study demonstrated that EBOV and MARV replicate to similar levels in all tested cell lines, indicating that permissiveness for EBOV at cell and organism levels do not necessarily correlate. Filoviruses, particularly MARV, induced a potent innate immune response in rousette cells, which was generally stronger than that in human cells. Both EBOV VP35 and VP24 IID were found to suppress the innate immune response in rousette cells, but only VP35 IID appeared to promote virus replication. Along with IFN-α and IFN-β, IFN-γ was demonstrated to control filovirus infection in bat cells but not in human cells, suggesting host species specificity of the antiviral effect. The antiviral effects of bat IFNs appeared not to correlate with induction of IFN-stimulated genes 54 and 56, which were detected in human cells ectopically expressing bat IFN-α and IFN-β. As bat IFN-γ induced the type I IFN pathway, its antiviral effect is likely to be partially induced via cross talk.IMPORTANCE Bats serve as reservoirs for multiple emerging viruses, including filoviruses, henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and zoonotic coronaviruses. Although there is no evidence for symptomatic disease caused by either Marburg or Ebola viruses in bats, spillover of these viruses into human populations causes deadly outbreaks. The reason for the lack of symptomatic disease in bats infected with filoviruses remains unknown. The outcome of a virus-host interaction depends on the ability of the host immune system to suppress viral replication and the ability of a virus to counteract the host defenses. Our study is a comparative analysis of the host innate immune response to either MARV or EBOV infection in bat and human cells and the role of viral interferon-inhibiting domains in the host innate immune responses. The data are useful for understanding the interactions of filoviruses with natural and accidental hosts and for identification of factors that influence filovirus evolution.","Kuzmin, Ivan V; Schwarz, Toni M; Ilinykh, Philipp A; Jordan, Ingo; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Sachidanandam, Ravi; Basler, Christopher F; Bukreyev, Alexander",Journal of virology,537,1

Our study analyzed the clinical profile, COVID-19 impact, and 30-day prognosis of invasively managed patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared to a historical cohort.All invasively managed ACS patients from March 1st to April 30th, 2020 were compared to a cohort from the same timeframe of 2019 (n = 316). COVID-19 confirmed cases were defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (CoV+). The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality and multivariable predictors of this outcome.A 40.4% reduction in ACS patients was noted (198 cases in 2019 to 118 in 2020), and 11% of 2020 ACS patients were CoV+. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were significantly more in-hospital patients with ACS (15.3% versus 6.1%, P = 0.007), and fewer patients were found to have a culprit lesion (58.5% versus 74.2%, P = 0.004) in 2020 compared to 2019. Thirty-day mortality in 2020 (7%) was not different from that in 2019 (4.2%), P = 0.294, but it was significantly higher in CoV+ patients (23.1%) compared to that in negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (CoV-) patients (5%), P = 0.047, in the 2020 group. In the multivariate analysis, CoV+ was an independent mortality predictor (OR = 9.8, 95% CI = 1.48-64.78), along with the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86-0.97), P = 0.0006.This study found increased 30-day mortality of invasively managed CoV+ ACS patients compared to that of CoV- patients during the 2020 COVID-19 spring outbreak. In the multivariable analysis, a SARS-CoV-2 positive test was independently associated with 30-day mortality. Further investigations of the underlying physiopathological relations between COVID-19 and ACS are warranted.","Salinas, Pablo; Travieso, Alejandro; Vergara-Uzcategui, Carlos; Tirado-Conte, Gabriela; Macaya, Fernando; Mejía-Rentería, Hernán; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Gonzalo, Nieves; Jiménez-Quevedo, Pilar; Pérez-Vizcayno, María-José; Escaned, Javier; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio",International heart journal,537,24

It was the main aim of the present study to determine if bisEMA can reach the dental pulp by generally passive diffusion through the coronal dentinal tubules stimulated via eluent liquids surrounding the root structures only. METHODS In 20 human third molar teeth, standard Class-I occlusal cavities were prepared and provided either with an adhesive system alone or additionally with a composite restoration, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The teeth were placed in an elution chamber such that the elution media only came into contact with the tooth root/tooth base where they were incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 d. Samples were taken after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to identify bisEMA and other monomers in ethanol/water (3:1) and aqueous eluates. RESULTS bisEMA was only found in ethanol/water eluates, where the teeth had received a composite restoration. Traces of bisEMA with up to three ethylene oxide units could be detected in these eluates. Depending on the dentin thickness, different elution kinetics of bisEMA were determined. Regardless of the treatment of teeth, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEEGDMA) were found in ethanolic/aqueous eluates in equal amounts. Most TEGDMA and TEEGDMA diffused through the dentin within the first 24 h. SIGNIFICANCE Depending on the dentin layer thickness, bisEMA was released for varied time periods, resulting in varied concentrations and exposure times for the different cells of the dental pulp. The concentrations of TEGDMA and TEEGDMA were greatest for cells of the dental pulp within the first 24 h.","Durner, Jürgen; Schrickel, Klaus; Watts, David C; Becker, Marc; Hickel, Reinhard; Draenert, Miriam E",Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,537,16

As a result, their construction does not support the high-precision accuracy and bandwidth needed for more advanced industrial automation. Due to the growing interest in replacing high precision manufacturing equipment with industrial robots for some applications, external high-precision feedback sensors (e.g., laser trackers), are needed to improve robot position and orientation accuracy. Before external sensors can be combined with control methodologies to improve robot accuracy, it is important to properly condition the measurement signals. In this paper, a Kinematic Error Observer (KEO) is derived and used to estimate a robot’s slowly changing kinematic errors in real-time. An analysis of the KEO is first conducted to demonstrate its stability properties, transient response characteristics, noise sensitivity, and performance in non-deterministic measurement systems. Next, an implementation of the KEO was used in conjunction with a laser tracker and 6DoF sensor to dynamically estimate the kinematic errors of a Yaskawa/Motoman MH180 industrial robot. The results show that the KEO is capable of estimating the robot’s quasi-static kinematic errors in both static and dynamic environments. It was also found that the KEO, with small enough observer gain, attenuates high frequency measurement noise and produces a smooth estimation of the robot’s kinematic error.","Woodside, Mitchell R.; Bristow, Douglas A.; Landers, Robert G.",Procedia Manufacturing,537,1

Since the 1870s, Owambo has experienced a rapid and widespread process of Christianization. Today, the vast majority of the population (both in Owambo and in wider Namibia) identify as Christian. In this context, the supremacy of the Bible and Christianity was established, in no small part, through the instigation of cultural crisis ? the upending of social norms and the demonization of African Traditional Religion (ATR) and local cultural practice. From foodstuffs to family structure, from initiation to forms of dress and adornment ? the overtly ?traditional? became taboo. And yet, responses to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrate the endurance of ATR and demonstrate that the cultural ?text? is at least as significant as the biblical text in the current crisis, whether as sphere of impact or source of resilience. This article therefore reflects on responses to the current COVID-19 crisis in light of the historical cultural crisis, exploring how Christianity and ATR are perceived to be affected by COVID-19, and how communities are drawing on Christianity/the Bible and ATR as sources of resilience.","John, Helen C.",Journal for the Study of the New Testament,537,7

Three male COVID-19 patients, aged 56, 84, and 49 years old, developed acute respiratory failure after admission. MPSL therapy (500 mg/day for 3 days) was started for these patients at 4, 4, and, 2 days after admission, respectively, when oxygen administration was required. Following this therapy, two of the three present cases received 30 or 40 mg/day of PSL for an additional 6 and 8 days, respectively. The remaining case discontinued corticosteroid after MPSL therapy. All three cases survived, had fever reduction at 6, 2, and 1 days after start of MPSL therapy, could discontinue oxygen therapy at 6, 6, and 11 days after start of MPSL therapy, and showed negative results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction at 8, 6, and 22 days after start of MPSL therapy, respectively. No serious side effects due to drug discontinuation of treatment for COVID-19 were observed. MPSL is a candidate drug for corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19. Corticosteroid therapy should be started in the early stage of respiratory failure. Optimal drug selection, timing of intervention, dose, and duration of corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 should be analyzed in the further studies. © Journal of Xiangya Medicine.

In Uganda, limited access to personal protective equipment amidst lack of clarity on the extent of the community disease burden may exacerbate this situation. We assessed SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among high-risk sub-populations, including healthcare workers, persons within the general population previously reporting experiencing key COVID-19 like symptoms and archived plasma specimens collected prior to confirmation of COVID-19 in Uganda. We collected venous blood from HCWs at selected health facilities and from population-cohort participants who reported specific COVID-19 like symptoms in a prior phone-based survey conducted during the first national lockdown (May-August 2020). Pre-lockdown plasma collected from individuals considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection was retrieved. Specimens were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using the CoronaChekTM rapid COVID-19 IgM/IgG lateral flow test assay. IgM only positive samples were confirmed using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHITECT AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgM) which targets the spike. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was defined as either confirmed IgM, both IgM and IgG or sole IgG positivity. The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs was 21.1% [95%CI: 18.2-24.2]. Of the phone-based survey participants, 11.9% [95%CI: 8.0-16.8] had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Among 636 pre-lockdown plasma specimens, 1.7% [95%CI: 0.9-3.1] were reactive. Findings suggest a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs and substantial exposure in persons presenting with specific COVID-19 like symptoms in the general population of South-central Uganda. Based on current limitations in serological test confirmation, it remains unclear whether pre-lockdown seropositivity implies prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Uganda.","Ssuuna, C.; Galiwango, R.

To study the prophylactic effectiveness of the intranasal application of VIFERON®, the gel for external and local use (interferon α-2b) 36,000 IU/g, against ARVI in newborns and their mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and methods. A total of 227 mother–newborn couples were examined, randomized into three groups: Group 1 (n = 63) – the VIFERON® gel was used according to the instructions;Group 2 (n = 50) – the VIFERON® gel was used in violation of the recommended scheme;Group 3 (control, n = 114) – did not use the medication. The main criteria for the effectiveness of prevention were: the incidence of ARVI in a mother–child couple for 3 months after inclusion in the study;the duration and severity of clinical symptoms of the disease;evaluation of the frequency of adverse events associated with the use of the drug under study. Results. The use of the VIFERON® gel led to a decrease in the number of ARVI cases in mothers (11.1 and 14.9%) and newborns (7.9 and 20.2%;p = 0.034) in Group 1 compared with Group 3, respectively, as well as to a significant reduction in the duration of the disease (p = 0.001), a decrease in the severity of clinical symptoms: the level of hyperthermia (p = 0.015), the duration of febrile (p = 0.021), cough (p = 0.032), rhinitis (p = 0.033). There were no statistically significant differences between these indicators in Groups 2 and 3, which requires to follow drug instructions in order to achieve the maximum effect. The timing of onset of diseases in Group 1 in the third month of observation from the beginning of drug administration makes it possible to justify the need for repeated courses of prophylaxis at high risk of respiratory diseases. In 100% of cases, the drug was well tolerated, and there were no adverse effects. Conclusion. The high preventive efficacy and safety of interferon α-2b with antioxidants in the form of gel for external and local use (VIFERON®, gel) in newborns and their mothers against ARVI were proved, which makes it possible to recommend its use to prevent the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 in newborns and confirms the validity of its inclusion in clinical guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 in children.","Bocharova, I.

The program aims to decrease private vehicle use to access the station and for travel to locations outside of Davis through partnerships with a carpool/rideshare app, as well as a ridehail app. Motivations for the program stem from the high passenger usage at the Davis station that may be impacted by parking capacity and other challenges. The city has limited interest in or ability to add new parking capacity, however pricing will be introduced to the lot in the future. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the City has not yet set a launch date for the program. This report evaluates the potential for the program using survey data collected from Davis residents about their travel expectations once COVID-19 is no longer a threat. The results of this study provide insights into residents’ interest in the planned pilot programs. Residents are most likely to use a free ridehail program to travel to the train station, while some are also likely to use a carpool/rideshare program and/or a free shuttle to downtown. Those with higher perceived risks associated with riding the train during COVID-19 are less likely to use these programs.

Using measured electricity use data from 500 homes in Ottawa, Canada, this study applies changepoint analysis, descriptive statistics, k-means clustering, and the corresponding change of electricity utility bills before and after COVID-19. Our analysis indicates that the average household daily electricity consumption increased by about 12% in 2020 relative to 2019, about one-third was due to warmer temperatures, with much of the rest due to the temperature-independent loads (e.g., lighting and appliances). Additionally, the highest five peak loads corresponding to post-COVID are significantly higher (15-20%) than peaks that occurred pre-COVID. The lockdown’s impact on household electricity use is not consistent, and there are noticeable differences among different months, seasons, and day types. Two clusters of household electricity use patterns emerged, with about one-third showing significant increases during the pandemic and the remainder showing only minor changes. On the other hand, in the summer, all customers’ electricity use profile patterns after the pandemic resemble the pattern before the pandemic. Yet, there is a significant increase (from 16.3 to 29.1%) in daily demand after COVID-19. Finally, the average increase in the utility bill post-COVID would be 9.71% if TOU rates were used instead of the flat rate that was implemented as a subsidy to consumers.","Abdeen, Ahmed Kharvari Farzam O039; Brien, William Gunay Burak",Energy and Buildings,537,24

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in residual serum samples from pediatric patients in the state of Arkansas over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic as an indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in children. Design: The study is a survey of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in children in Arkansas over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 2020 through April 2021, remnant serum samples were collected across five time periods (waves): April 2-May 6, June 6-August 10, September 8-October 17, November 7-December 17, 2020 and April 5-April 28, 2021. Setting: The multi-site survey collected remnant serum samples from four clinics across the state of Arkansas: Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH, Little Rock, AR), Arkansas Children's Northwest (Springdale, AR), and UAMS Family Medical Centers (Ft. Smith, AR and Pine Bluff, AR) Participants: The study population consisted of 2400 convenience serum samples from children ages 1-18 who visited hospitals or regional clinics in Arkansas for non-COVID-19-related reasons. Exposures: Infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main outcomes and measures: The presence of IgM and/or IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleoprotein were determined using a two-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Seroprevalence was estimated by demographic group, including age (1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18 years), sex, race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic), metropolitan status, SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and co-morbidities (respiratory virus infection within 6 months, asthma, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, autoimmune disease). Association with SARS-CoV-2 antibody reactivity was determined by demographic group. Results: The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rose from 7.9% in Wave 1 (95%CI, 4.9-10.9%) to 25.8% in Wave 5 (95% CI, 22.2-29.3%), as did the age- and sex-standardized seroprevalence rate which ranged from 8.6% in Wave 1 (95%CI, 5.1-11.1%) to 24.2% in Wave 5 (95% CI, 20.1-28.2%). Hispanic children had a significantly higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than non-Hispanic white children in Wave 3 (RR 2.82, 95% CI, 1.81-4.38), Wave 4 (RR 1.76, 95% CI, 1.03-3.00), and Wave 5 (RR 2.37, 95% CI, 1.69-3.33) Similarly, black children also showed a significantly higher risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than white children in Wave 3 (RR 1.71, 95% CI, 1.03-2.84) and Wave 5 (RR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.08-2.34). Conclusions and relevance: The percentage of Arkansas children with SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies increased from April 2020 to April 2021. These data indicate that many more children have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than indicated by diagnostic testing. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, recognition of long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 even after mild or asymptomatic infections, and the lack of an authorized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, these results highlight the importance of including children in SARS-CoV-2 public health, clinical care, and research strategies. These findings are important for state and local officials as they consider measures to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread in schools and daycares for the 2021-2022 school year.","Boehme, K. W.; Kennedy, J.

In this work, a systematic approach is developed to quantify the criticality of economic sectors based on a sector criticality index (SCI) and rank them based on their importance relative to the entire national economy. SCI is a weighted composite score based on five criteria which capture relevant dimensions in judging the importance of sectors: economic impact, connectivity, sector size, income multiplier, and employment. The input-output model is then used to evaluate the interaction amongst the economic sectors. The use of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study focusing on evaluating the impact on oleo-chemical industries and associated agro-industrial sectors in Malaysia.","Foong, S. Z.

The Legionella genome codes more than 300 effector proteins able to modulate host-pathogen interactions during infection. Among them are also enzymes altering the host-ubiquitination system including bacterial ligases and deubiquitinases. In this study, based on homology-detection screening on 305 Legionella effector proteins, we identified two Legionella OTU-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529), LotA (Lpg2248/Lem21) is already known). A crystal structure of LotC catalytic core (LotC14-310) was determined at 2.4 Å and compared with other OTU deubiquitinases, including LotB. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the structures of Legionella OTU-family (LotB and LotC) shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which define a novel class of OTU-deubiquitinase. Despite structural differences in their helical lobes, both LotB and LotC interact with ubiquitin. LotB has an additional ubiquitin binding site (S1’) enabling specific cleavage of Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of catalytically inactive LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-substrates for these two related DUBs. Together, our results provide new structural insights of bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles of bacterial deubiquitinases in host-pathogen interactions.","Shin, Donghyuk; Bhattacharya, Anshu; Cheng, Yi-Lin; Alonso, Marta Campos; Mehdipour, Ahmad Reza; van der Heden van Noort, Gerbrand J.; Ovaa, Huib; Hummer, Gerhard; Dikic, Ivan",bioRxiv,537,21

Since there is direct association between electrocardiography (ECG) data and the prognosis of cardiovascular disease, a systematic literature review was performed in the present study to address this association and make a conclusive agreement on the early diagnostic and prognostic values of ECG in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for “COVID-19” and “ECG” using all their equivalents and similar terms as search words. Afterwards, the records were limited to English articles and irrelevant documents, as well as articles that reported drug-induced cardiac dysfunction or patients with previous history of cardiovascular complications were excluded. RESULTS: Overall, 31 articles with 2379 patients were found and used for qualitative data extraction. Findings showed that there is a significant association between COVID-19 infection and ECG findings. Also, ST-segment changes, T wave inversions, QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation were found to be early indicators of cardiac involvement of COVID-19, which were associated with worse outcomes.

We describe the initial clinical characteristics of probable or suspect SARS patients that presented to the ED. METHODS A retrospective study of patients who were admitted through the ED and subsequently diagnosed to have probable SARS and suspect SARS was done. The data of these patients from the ED log were reviewed and analysed. RESULTS From 13 March 2003 to 31 May 2003, 11,461 patients were screened for SARS and 1,386 patients were admitted. Of these, 117 patients were diagnosed to have probable SARS and 146 suspect SARS. Their mean age was 36.7 years (range 1-80). Among these patients, there were 122 men (46.4 percent), and 205 were Singaporeans (77.9 percent). 13 patients had no initial contact history upon presentation to the ED. The mean duration between onset of symptom to presentation to the ED was 3.1 days. Travel history was less common in probable SARS cases than in suspect SARS cases as the epidemic was due mainly to local transmission. Fever was the most common presenting symptom (91.6 percent), and gastrointestinal symptoms were the least (6.9 percent). In the ED, 249 (94.7 percent) patients had chest radiographs and 86 (32.7 percent) had full blood count done. 22.2 percent of probable SARS patients had normal chest radiographs when they first presented to the ED. CONCLUSION The World Health Organisation criteria were important screening tools and admission guides, but should not be strictly followed.

METHODS Records from the Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre and Toronto Public Health from April 1 to July 31, 2003, were linked using probabilistic methods. Authorization decision (transfer authorized or denied) and SARS status (probable case, suspect case, or patient under investigation for SARS; or non-SARS case) were obtained for linked records. Primary outcome was the number of patients where correct authorization decisions were made based on SARS status at the time of request. Secondary outcome was the number for whom, in retrospect, authorization decision was correct knowing final SARS status. Algorithm sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined. RESULTS There were 14,571 requests for transfer and 2,132 patients investigated for SARS during the study period. The algorithm authorized 14,551 and did not authorize 20 requests. Sensitivity and specificity to make appropriate authorization decisions at the time of request were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2%-100%) and 99.95% (95% CI, 99.9-100%), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 65% (95% CI, 44.1%-85.9%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.4%-100%), respectively.

Positive and negative predictive values were 80% (95% CI, 62.5%-97.5%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.4%-100%), respectively. Seven of the 20 patients with nonauthorized requests were not known to have SARS at the time of request. Within ten days, three of seven were under investigation for, a suspect case of, or a probable case of SARS. CONCLUSIONS The medical decision algorithm was highly sensitive and specific in correctly authorizing transfers. Despite its highly sensitive and specific algorithm, it did incorrectly deny authorization to a very small number of patients without SARS.","MacDonald, Russell D; Henry, Bonnie; Stuart, Rebecca",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,537,1

Most fatalities occur in elderly people with comorbidities. However, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonias do also occur in younger patients with no comorbidities or risk factors at all. We report here on one of the ""early"" cases that occurred in Germany. A 57-year-old man was infected and developed pneumonia after a skiing vacation in Northern Italy. Other members of the travel group also fell ill, but only showed flu-like symptoms. Only a few if any infections originated from the affected person; at this point in time the infection situation in the region could still be grasped. Under supportive measures, the disease developed positively despite impressive radiological findings. The positive course is likely also due to the age of the person affected and the lack of any risk factors. The case does also exemplify that a good health condition does not necessarily protect from acquiring a moderately severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Harsch, Igor Alexander; Skiba, Marcin; Heß, Thomas; Wedel, Frank; Lopatta, Eric; Konturek, Peter Christopher",Wiadomosci lekarskie,537,1

However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent years. Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health measures. This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus. The data presented supports the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that ""smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation. Far from being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite."" Its R value (the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is lower. Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses. In the present paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control. The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.","Pennington, Hugh",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,537,1

METHODS Total RNA was extracted from right atrial tissue of a patient with right heart failure resected during a valvular replacement surgery by Trizol one-step method, and the full-length ACE-2 encoding gene was acquired by RT-nested-PCR. The ACE-2 encoding gene was then cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO eukaryotic expression vector to construct the recombinant plasmid pcDNA4/ ACE-2, which was then transfected into 293 T cell and ACE-2 eukaryotic transient expression was detected by Western Blot. Syncytia inhibition assay was established to detect SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody, and compared parallelly with SARS pseudovirus neutralization assay. RESULTS The recombinant plasmid pcDNA4/ ACE-2 could express ACE-2 protein in eukaryotic cells and induce cell-cell fusion between S protein- and ACE2-expressing cells. This cell-cell fusion assay could be used to detect SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody.

Hence, many viruses have evolved strategies to specifically inhibit apoptosis. However, Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV) is the first example of a DNA virus that not only induces apoptosis but also utilizes caspase activity to facilitate virus replication. To determine the function of caspase activity during ADV replication, virus-infected cell lysates or purified ADV proteins were incubated with various purified caspases. Caspases cleaved the major nonstructural protein of ADV (NS1) at two caspase recognition sequences, whereas ADV structural proteins could not be cleaved. Importantly, the NS1 products could be identified in ADV-infected cells but were not present in infected cells pretreated with caspase inhibitors. By mutating putative caspase cleavage sites (D to E), we mapped the two cleavage sites to amino acid residues NS1:227 (INTD downward arrow S) and NS1:285 (DQTD downward arrow S). Replication of ADV containing either of these mutations was reduced 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold compared to that of wild-type virus, and a construct containing both mutations was replication defective. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that cleavage was required for nuclear localization of NS1. The requirement for caspase activity during permissive replication suggests that limitation of caspase activation and apoptosis in vivo may be a novel approach to restricting virus replication.","Best, Sonja M; Shelton, Janie F; Pompey, Justine M; Wolfinbarger, James B; Bloom, Marshall E",Journal of virology,537,8

There are many individuals and agencies, including policy makers, planners, administrators, and staff at the federal, state, and local level, involved in the process of planning for and executing policy in respect to a surge in the medical requirements of a population. They are responsible to ensure there is sufficient surge capacity within their own jurisdiction. PROBLEM The [US] federal government has required New York State to create a system of hospital bed surge capacity that provides for 500 adult and pediatric patients per 1 million population, which has been estimated to be an increase of 15-20% in bed availability. In response, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOH) has requested that area hospitals take an inventory of available beds and set a goal to provide for a 20% surge capacity to be available during a mass-casualty event or other conditions calling for increased inpatient bed availability. METHODS In 2003, under the auspices of the NYC DOH, the New York Institute of All Hazard Preparedness (NYIHP) was formed from four unaffiliated, healthcare facilities in Central Brooklyn to address this and other goals. RESULTS The NYIHP hospitals have developed a surge capacity plan to provide necessary space and utilities. As these plans have been applied, a bed surge capacity of approximately 25% was identified and created for Central Brooklyn to provide for the increased demand on the medical care system that may accompany a disaster. Through the process of developing an integrated plan that would engage a public health incident, the facilities of NYIHP demonstrate that a model of cooperation may be applied to an inherently fractioned medical system.","Dayton, Christopher; Ibrahim, Jamil; Augenbraun, Michael; Brooks, Steven; Mody, Kiaran; Holford, Donald; Roblin, Patricia; Arquilla, Bonnie",Prehospital and disaster medicine,537,20

The nucleotide sequence of the cloned 1.5 kb fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 690 nucleotides which was identified as the M protein gene from its homology to BCV. This ORF encodes a protein of 230 amino acids with an M(r) of 26416. The gene is preceded by the motif UCCAAAC, analogous to the consensus coronavirus transcription initiation sequence. The M protein of HCV-OC43 shows features typical of all coronavirus M proteins studied: a hydrophilic, presumably external N terminus including about 10% of the protein, and a potential N-glycosylation site followed by three major hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The amino acid sequence of the M protein of HCV-OC43 has 94% identity with that of the Mebus strain of BCV, and also contains six potential O-glycosylation sites in the exposed N-terminal domain. Indeed, the glycosylation of the M protein was not inhibited in the presence of tunicamycin, which is indicative of O-glycosylation, as previously reported for BCV and murine hepatitis virus. Virions released from tunicamycin-treated cells contained the M glycoprotein but were devoid of both peplomer (S) and haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins. Thus, inhibition of the N-glycosylation of the S and HE structural proteins prevented their incorporation into progeny virions, an indication that they are dispensable for virion morphogenesis, unlike the M protein.","Mounir, S; Talbot, P J",The Journal of general virology,537,1

The disruptions also included intentional and unintentional reductions in health services, including immunization campaigns against the transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2). Building on a recently updated global poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model, we explored the implications of immunization disruption and restrictions of human interactions (i.e., population mixing) on the expected incidence of polio and on the resulting challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). We demonstrate that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, the GPEI could largely mitigate the impact of COVID-19 to the delays incurred. The relative importance of reduced mixing (leading to potentially decreased incidence) and reduced immunization (leading to potentially increased expected incidence) depends on the timing of the effects. Following resumption of immunization activities, the GPEI will likely face similar barriers to eradication of WPV and elimination of cVDPV2 as before COVID-19. The disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic may further delay polio eradication due to indirect effects on vaccine and financial resources.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Voorman, Arend; Pallansch, Mark A; Wassilak, Steven G F; Cochi, Stephen L; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Vaccine,537,29

This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. METHODS: 102 FCs from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average perceived stress coping. RESULTS: Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 (mean improvement [95% CI] = 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety (differential effect [95% CI] = 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness (CAMS-Rfocus: 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-Raccept: 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP.

We incorporated several COVID-19-related topics in pharmacology content taught throughout the Pharm.D. curriculum and analyzed student performance on related assignments. In first professional year class, we created an active learning exercise in Principles of Drug Action course about pharmacology of glucocorticoids that included recently published articles about the use of dexamethasone in severely-ill COVID-19 patients. Students completed an open-book group assignment containing open-ended questions on glucocorticoid pharmacology and COVID-19 treatment. They mastered the material with average scores of 89.06% on questions related to general glucocorticoid pharmacology and 98.21% on COVID-related glucocorticoid use questions. In professional year two, we created an active learning practice opportunity for Integrated Pharmacotherapy: Cardiology class about the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathways and their inhibition in COVID-19. Readings that summarized recent controversies about the role of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 were chosen. Students worked in groups on open-ended questions about general pharmacology of RAS inhibitors and their proposed and observed effects on COVID-19. Student scores for general pharmacology of RAS inhibitors questions and RAS inhibitors? effects on COVID-19 were similar in this activity, with the averages of 88.99% and 87.17%, respectively. Over the semester students demonstrated a trend towards improvement in their RAS pharmacology performance on closed-book assessments, which increased from 70.3% on the first test to the average of 84.6% on subsequent exams, however, the observed difference was not statistically significant. Finally, antiviral pharmacology lecture in Integrated Pharmacotherapy: Infectious Disease course presented to third professional year students included COVID-related content. We did not test students on COVID-related pharmacology content specifically in this class and their overall performance on antiviral drugs pharmacology exam questions was similar to last year's class performance (79.73% vs. 76.79%).

ObjectiveTo investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 mortality across different ethnic groups. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis is a retrospective cohort study using linked national Census, electronic health records and mortality data for English adults aged 40 years or older who were alive at the start of pandemic (24th January 2020). ExposuresBMI obtained from electronic health records. Self-reported ethnicity (white, black, South Asian, other) was the effect-modifying variable. Main Outcomes and MeasuresCOVID-19 related death identified by ICD-10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 mentioned on the death certificate from 24th January 2020 until December 28th 2020. ResultsThe analysis included white (n = 11,074,708; mean age 61.9 [{+/-}13.4] years; 54% women), black (n = 416,542; 56.4 [{+/-}11.7] years; 57% women), South Asian (621,691; 55.7 [{+/-}12.4] years; 51% women) and other (n = 478,196; 55.3 [{+/-}11.6] years; 55% women) ethnicities with linked BMI data. The association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was stronger in ethnic minority groups. Compared to a BMI of 22.5 kg/m2 in white ethnicities, the adjusted HR for COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in white, black, South Asian and other ethnicities was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87-1.03), 1.72 (1.52-1.94), 2.00 (1.78-2.25) and 1.39 (1.21-1.61), respectively. The estimated risk of COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 40 kg/m2 in white ethnicities (HR = 1.73) was equivalent to the risk observed at a BMI of 30.1 kg/m2, 27.0 kg/m2, and 32.2 kg/m2 in black, South Asian and other ethnic groups, respectively. ConclusionsThis population-based study using linked Census and electronic health care records demonstrates that the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with obesity is greater in ethnic minority groups compared to white populations. QuestionDoes the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality vary by ethnicity? FindingsIn this study of 12.6 million adults, BMI was associated with COVID-19 in all ethnicities, but with stronger associations in ethnic minority populations such that the risk of COVID-19 mortality for a BMI of 40 kg/m2 in white ethnicities was observed at a BMI of 30.1 kg/m2, 27.0 kg/m2, and 32.2 kg/m2 in black, South Asian and other ethnicities, respectively.

Multilevel mixed-effects regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between the frequency of UGS use and SWB, including individual and municipal level characteristics as covariates. Our results suggest that respondents who used UGS once or more per week during the pandemic reported higher SWB scores (8.7%) than those with zero visits.

These changes were made while the residency program maintained the priorities of patient care and safety, resident safety and well-being, open communication, and education. The process of adapting the residency program to the demands of the pandemic was iterative given the unprecedented nature of this crisis.

Currently, available diagnostic biomarkers are neither sensitive nor specific. Thus, the present study aimed to identify novel circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of CRC. All samples were provided by The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Analysis of the GSE108153 and GSE55139 datasets, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was performed using the online tool, GEO2R. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to determine miR-592 expression in CRC tissues, cells and serums of patients. Subsequently, the diagnostic value of serum miR-592 was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Both the assessment of clinical samples and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that miR-592 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of patients with CRC, suggesting that elevated serum miR-592 may be tumor-derived. ROC analysis indicated that serum miR-592 levels may differentiate patients with early stage CRC and advanced adenoma from healthy individuals, with area under the curve values of 0.801 and 0.747, respectively. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that serum miR-592 may be implicated as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of CRC.","Pan, Zhenguo; Miao, Lin",Oncol Lett,537,16

We included 101 patients with HF, 32 patients without HF and 20 controls. The three groups did not differ in general and clinical characteristics. Plasma levels of apelin and BNP were both higher in HF patients than non-HF patients and controls. Plasma levels of apelin and BNP were not correlated. Plasma level of BNP was increased with increasing New York Heart Association grade and apelin level was decreased. Apelin level was lower in HF patients with NYHA grade IV than in controls and non-HF patients. Apelin level had 75% diagnostic value for HF, and BNP level had 96.8% diagnostic value. At a cutoff of 6.44 ng/mL apelin level, sensitivity was 69.3%, and specificity 97.1%. However, the diagnostic of apelin for NYHA II patients was higher than that of BNP (99.6% vs. 96.1%).

METHODS: A prospective observational single-center study was performed, including all antenatal and parturient women admitted from April to August, 2020. Data were collected regarding number of admissions, deliveries, antenatal visits, reason for inaccessibility of health care, and complications during pregnancy, and compared with data from the pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS: There was a reduction of 45.1% in institutional deliveries (P < 0.001), a percentage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and 2.5-fold rise in admission to the intensive care unit of pregnant women during the pandemic. One-third of women had inadequate antenatal visits. The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lockdown and fear of contracting infection, resulting in 44.7% of pregnancies with complications.

Despite improved understanding, the duration of host immunity following COVID-19 infection and role of serological testing alone or in addition to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing in the HD population is not fully understood, which this study aimed to investigate. METHODS: There were two parts to this study. Between 15th March 2020 to 15th July 2020, patients receiving HD who tested positive on rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited into the COVID-19 arm, whilst asymptomatic patients without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited to the epidemiological arm of the Salford Kidney Study (SKS). All patients underwent monthly testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as per routine clinical practice since August 2020. The aims were twofold: firstly, to determine seroprevalence and COVID-19 exposure in the epidemiological arm; secondly, to assess duration of the antibody response in the COVID-19 arm. Baseline characteristics were reviewed between groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Mann-Whitney U and Chi-squared tests were used for testing significance of difference between groups. RESULTS: In our total HD population of 411 patients, 32 were PCR-positive for COVID-19. Of the remaining patients, 237 were recruited into the SKS study, of whom 12 (5.1%) had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of the 32 PCR-positive patients, 27 (84.4%) were symptomatic and 25 patients admitted to hospital due to their symptoms. Of the 22 patients in COVID-19 arm that underwent testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies beyond 7 months, all had detectable antibodies. A higher proportion of the patients with COVID-19 were frail compared to patients without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (64.3% vs 34.1%, p = 0.003). Other characteristics were similar between the groups. Over a median follow up of 7 months, a higher number of deaths were recorded in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 compared to those without (18.7% vs 5.9%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Serological testing in the HD population is a valuable tool to determine seroprevalence, monitor exposure, and guide improvements for infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to help prevent local outbreaks. This study revealed HD patients mount a humoral response detectable until at least 7 months after COVID-19 infection and provides hope of similar protection with the vaccines recently approved.","Wickens, Olivia; Chinnadurai, Rajkumar; Mannan, Fahmida; Svendsen, Frida; Baig, Mirza Yasar; Chukwu, Chukwuma; Ali, Ibrahim; Summersgill, Christina; Evans, Dawn; Antoine, Berckley V; Oxton, Julie; Mairs, Nathan; Flanagan, Emma; Oliver, Robert; Kalra, Philip A; Poulikakos, Dimitrios",BMC Nephrol,537,20

Limited data are available for liver function in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to investigate the risk factors related to liver injury in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in non-ICU Ward at Jinyintan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to February 23, 2020. Consecutively confirmed COVID-19 discharged cases were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of patients with liver injury and without liver injury were compared. RESULTS: A total of 79 COVID-19 patients were included. 31.6%, 35.4% and 5.1% COVID-19 patients had elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin respectively. Median value of ALT, AST and bilirubin for entire cohort was 36.5 (17.5 ~ 71.5) U/L, 34.5 (25.3 ~ 55.3) U/L and 12.7 (8.1 ~ 15.4) mmol/L respectively. There were no significant differences in age, previous medical history and symptoms between the two groups. Males were more likely to have liver injury when infected with COVID-19 (P < .05); compared with patients without liver injury, patients with liver injury had increased levels of white blood cell counts, neutrophils, CRP and CT score (P < .05) and had a longer length of stay (P < .05). Logistic regression analyses suggested that the extent of pulmonary lesions on CT was a predictor of liver function damage (P < .05).

However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperatures or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know if life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we wanted to know if the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism on adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affects adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.","Carter, Amanda W; Sheldon, Kimberly S",J. exp. biol,537,20

METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. CONCLUSION: By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","Pérez Dueñas, Virginia; Allona Krauel, María; Agrela Rojas, Emilio; Ramírez Prieto, Maria Teresa; Díez Izquierdo, Laura; López de la Guardia, Ulpiano; Torres Sánchez, Isabel",Arch. bronconeumol.

Crucially, Bayesian counterfactuals are estimated by the epistemic system; not by the decision system. Based on this remark, I prove the existence of Newcomb-like problems for which an epistemic system necessarily expects the entity to make a counterfactually bad decision. I then address (a slight generalization of) Newcomb's paradox. I solve the specific case where the player believes that the predictor applies Bayes rule with a supset of all the data available to the player. I prove that the counterfactual optimality of the 1-Box strategy depends on the player's prior on the predictor's additional data. If these additional data are not expected to reduce sufficiently the predictor's uncertainty on the player's decision, then the player's epistemic system will counterfactually prefer to 2-Box. But if the predictor's data is believed to make them quasi-omniscient, then 1-Box will be counterfactually preferred. Implications of the analysis are then discussed. More generally, I argue that, to better understand or design an entity, it is useful to clearly separate the entity's epistemic, decision, but also data collection, reward and maintenance systems, whether the entity is human, algorithmic or institutional.","Hoang, Le Nguyen",,537,8

Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19 cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73% better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE) was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.","da Silva, Tiago Tiburcio; Francisquini, Rodrigo; V Nascimento, Maric C",Expert Syst Appl,537,1

Few empirical studies have tested whether and how these control measures may affect mental health. No study investigated prevalence and impacts of utilizing eHealth among pregnant women during the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated 1) the roles of lockdown and mandatory quarantine in affecting mental health problems (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms), 2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and 3) the moderation roles of eHealth-related factors (i.e., social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services during COVID-19) among pregnant women in China. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions (24 February-10 March, 2020). RESULTS: Of the participants, 62.6% reported lockdown in the areas of residence and 3.8% were subjected to mandatory quarantine; 44.6% reported probable depression, 29.2% had probable anxiety, and 7.4% reported suicidal ideation. Only 3.3% of the participants reported using online prenatal care service during the outbreak. Significant socio-demographic/maternal variables of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, area of residence, gestational duration, number of children born, complication during pregnancy, means of utilizing prenatal care services, and social media use for health information. Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modeling [&#967;2(df)=495.21(14), p<.05, CFI=.99, NNFI=.98, RMSEA=.04 (90%CI=.038, .045)] showed quarantine status was strongly associated with poor mental health status directly and indirectly through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04, ß =.02, 95%CI=.01 to .02, p=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03, ß=.03, 95%CI=.02 to .03, p=.001). Multi-group analyses revealed social media use for health information and means of utilizing prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance to integrate mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policy. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators are modifiable, and can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.","Yang, Xue; Song, Bo; Wu, Anise; Mo, Phoenix K H; Di, Jiang Li; Wang, Qian; Lau, Joseph T F; Wang, Lin Hong",J. med. internet res,537,20

We analyzed more than 4700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and associated metadata retrieved from public repositories. SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (>99.9%), which drops to >96% when compared to bat coronavirus genome. We built a mutation-annotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and more than 160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a rather uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could have implications for diagnostics and the design of future vaccines. Identification of the root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is not without problems, owing to conflicting interpretations derived from either using the bat coronavirus genomes as an outgroup or relying on the sampling chronology of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and TMRCA estimates; however, the overall scenario favors haplogroup A as the ancestral node. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 genomes dating to November 12, 2019, thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2 most likely originated in Europe from an Asian ancestor and gave rise to subclade A2a, which represents the major non-Asian outbreak, especially in Africa and Europe. Multiple founder effect episodes, most likely associated with super-spreader hosts, might explain COVID-19 pandemic to a large extent.","Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Bello, Xabier; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Genome Res,537,16

Ecological evidence indicates that countries with national universal BCG vaccination programs for tuberculosis (TB) prevention have a much lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and mortality compared with those that do not have such programs. BCG is a century old vaccine used for TB prevention via infant/childhood vaccination in lowto middle-income countries with high infection prevalence rate and is known to reduce all-cause neonatal mortality. BCG remains the standard immunotherapy treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer globally for more than 44 years. Several trials are, therefore, investigating BCG as a prophylactic against COVID-19 in healthcare workers and the elderly. In this commentary, we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie BCG associated heterologous protection with a focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) organogenesis. Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (IFN-1) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity. We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive IFN-1 activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer.","Koti, Madhuri; Morales, Alvaro; Graham, Charles H; Siemens, David Robert",J. immunotherap. cancer,537,1

Materials/Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted across four affiliated sites following local Institutional Review Board approval. Eligibility criteria were defined as all patients with cancer whose treatment plan included brachytherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2/24/2020 to 6/30/2020. Treatment delays, cancellations, alterations of fractionation regimens and treatment paradigm changes were evaluated. Results: A total of 47 patients were eligible for analysis. The median age at time of treatment was 62 (Inter Quartile Range 56-70). Endometrial, cervical and prostate cancers were the most common sites included in this analysis. Three patients (6.4%) with cervical cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the course of their treatment. Interruptions of EBRT, cancellations of EBRT, cancellations of brachytherapy and treatment delays due to COVID occurred in 5 (10.6%), 3 (6.4%), 8 (17%) and 9 (19%) patients, respectively. The mean and median number of days delayed for patients who experienced treatment interruptions were 16.3 days (Std dev=13.9) and 14 days (IQR=5.75-23.75), respectively. For cervical cancer patients, the mean and median overall treatment time defined as time from start of EBRT to end of brachytherapy were 56 and 49 days, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the challenges the healthcare system faced during the pandemic, it is reassuring to report that most patients with cancer were safely treated with minor treatment delays and interruptions. Long-term follow-up is needed to assess the impact of COVID-19 and treatment interruptions on oncological outcomes.","Hathout, Lara; Ennis, Ronald; Mattes, Malcolm D; Wagman, Raquel; Grann, Alison; Jabbour, Salma K; Singh, Rachana; Yue, Ning; Haffty, Bruce; Vergalasova, Irina",,537,16

However, recent research has serious limitations, such as non-guideline definition of myocardial injury, heterogenicity of troponin sampling or very short-term follow-up. Using data from a large European cohort, we aimed to overcome these pitfalls and adequately characterize myocardial damage in COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and available high-sensitive troponin I (hs-TnI), from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. RESULTS: A total of 918 patients (mean age 63.2±15.5 years, 60.1% male) with a median follow-up of 57 (49-63) days were included. Of these, 190 (20.7%) fulfilled strict criteria for myocardial injury (21.1% chronic, 76.8% acute non-ischemic, 2.1% acute ischemic). Time from onset of symptoms to maximum hs-TnI was 11 (7-18) days. Thrombotic and bleeding events, arrhythmias, heart failure, need for mechanical ventilation and death were significantly more prevalent in patients with higher hs-TnI concentrations, even without fulfilling criteria for myocardial injury. hs-TnI was identified as an independent predictor of mortality [HR 2.52 (1.57-4.04) per 5-logarithmic units increment] after adjusting for multiple relevant covariates. CONCLUSION: Elevated hs-TnI is highly prevalent among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even mild elevations well below the 99th URL were significantly associated with higher rates of cardiac and non-cardiac complications, and higher mortality. Future research should address the role of serial hs-TnI assessment to improve COVID-19 prognostic stratification and clinical outcomes.","Caro-Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M; Rosillo, Sandra O; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Merino, Carlos; Marco, Irene; Martinez, Luis A; Garcia-Veas, Jose M; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-de-Sá, Esteban; Merino, Jose L",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),537,16

Mobile mental health apps can be scalable and useful tools in large-scale disaster responses and are particularly promising for reaching vulnerable populations. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed specifically to provide tools and resources for addressing COVID-19-related stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals who may benefit from mental health resources. METHODS: Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020, through October 31, 2020, were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. RESULTS: Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (n=325,691, 70.4%), and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (n=28,009, 58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for &#8804;3 days by 80.9% (n=34,611) of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% (n=11,444) returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% (n=10,546) of those who did not try a tool returned (P<.001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users who completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n=4870, 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n=2680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n=1455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (mean 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (mean 3.08 days; t1=3.01, P=.003). Individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (mean 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (mean 3.13 days; t1=2.29, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: As the mental health impacts of the pandemic continue to be widespread and increasing, digital health resources, such as apps like COVID Coach, are a scalable way to provide evidence-informed tools and resources. Future research is needed to better understand for whom and under what conditions the app is most helpful and how to increase and sustain engagement.","Jaworski, Beth K; Taylor, Katherine; Ramsey, Kelly M; Heinz, Adrienne; Steinmetz, Sarah; Pagano, Ian; Moraja, Giovanni; Owen, Jason E",J Med Internet Res,537,32

The main protease of the coronavirus is essential in the viral replication and is involved in polyprotein cleavage and immune regulation, making it an effective target when developing the treatment. A Number of approved antiviral drugs were tested against COVID-19 virus using molecular docking analysis by calculating the free natural affinity of the binding ligand to the active site pocket and the catalytic residues without forcing the docking of the ligand to active site. COVID-19 virus protease solved structure (PDB ID: 6LU7) is targeted by repurposed drugs. The molecular docking analysis results have shown that the binding of Remdesivir and Mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide with the protein drug target has optimal binding features supporting that Remdesivir and Mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide can be used as potential anti-viral treatment against COVID-19 disease.","Khater, Ibrahim Nassar Aaya",Biochemistry and Biophysics Reports,537,16

Moreover, the prognosis of the disease seems to be worse in immunocompromised patients when compared to the general population, with 4–5 times higher mortality rates. However, the overall impact on long-term function of the kidney graft is unknown. We report on a case of a 46-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was successfully treated for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury, most likely due to tubulo-interstitial involvement, with return to the baseline of the creatinine level by the time of discharge. We discuss the characteristics and differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury, as well as management of immunosuppression in connection with overall clinical status and evolution of kidney function. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based, efficient COVID-19 therapy. The risk-benefit balance of the yet to be approved treatment strategies may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.","Tosa, Flaviu Manaila Roxana Elec Alina Tudor Moisoiu Ghervan Liviu Elec Florin",Case Reports in Nephrology and Dialysis,537,20

METHODS: With endorsement from the Paediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, we designed and implemented a web-based survey of paediatric cardiac and multidisciplinary ICU medical directors in the United States of America and Canada to better understand paediatric cardiac rapid response practices. RESULTS: Sixty-five (52%) of 125 centres responded. Seventy-one per cent of centres had â¼300 non-ICU beds and 71% had dedicated cardiac ICUs. To respond to cardiac patients, dedicated cardiac rapid response teams were utilised in 29% of all centres (39% and 5% in centres with and without dedicated cardiac ICUs, respectively) [p = 0.006]. Early warning scores were utilised in 62% of centres. Only 31% reported that rapid response teams received specialised training. Transfers to ICU were higher for cardiac (73%) compared to generalised rapid response events (54%). The monitoring and reassessment of patients not transferred to ICU after the rapid response was variable. Cardiac and respiratory arrests outside the ICU were infrequent. Only 29% of centres formally appraise critical deterioration events (need for ventilation and/or inotropes post-rapid response) and 34% perform post-event debriefs. CONCLUSION: Paediatric cardiac rapid response practices are variable and dedicated paediatric cardiac rapid response systems are infrequent in the United States of America and Canada. Opportunity exists to delineate best practices for paediatric cardiac rapid response and standardise practices for activation, training, patient monitoring post-rapid response events, and outcomes evaluation.","Bavare, Aarti C; Afonso, Natasha S; Sembera, Kerry A; Buckley, Jason R; Raymond, Tia T; McKeta, Angela; Costello, John M",Cardiol Young,537,27

We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and -esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96-well format and on a high-throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High-throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID-19 causing agent, SARS-CoV-2.

Unfortunately, dMRI fiber mapping is an indirect method that relies on inference from measured diffusion patterns. Comparing dMRI results with other modalities is a way to improve the interpretation of dMRI data and help advance dMRI technologies. Here, we present methods for comparing dMRI fiber orientation estimates with optical imaging of fluorescently labeled neurofilaments and vasculature in 3D human and primate brain tissue cuboids cleared using CLARITY. The recent advancements in tissue clearing provide a new opportunity to histologically map fibers projecting in 3D, which represents a captivating complement to dMRI measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the capability to directly compare dMRI and CLARITY in the same human brain tissue and assess multiple approaches for extracting fiber orientation estimates from CLARITY data. We estimate the three-dimensional neuronal fiber and vasculature orientations from neurofilament and vasculature stained CLARITY images by calculating the tertiary eigenvector of structure tensors. We then extend CLARITY orientation estimates to an orientation distribution function (ODF) formalism by summing multiple sub-voxel structure tensor orientation estimates. In a sample containing part of the human thalamus, there is a mean angular difference of 19o±15o between the primary eigenvectors of the dMRI tensors and the tertiary eigenvectors from the CLARITY neurofilament stain. We also demonstrate evidence that vascular compartments do not affect the dMRI orientation estimates by showing an apparent lack of correspondence (mean angular differenceâ¯=â¯49o±23o) between the orientation of the dMRI tensors and the structure tensors in the vasculature stained CLARITY images. In a macaque brain dataset, we examine how the CLARITY feature extraction depends on the chosen feature extraction parameters. By varying the volume of tissue over which the structure tensor estimates are derived, we show that orientation estimates are noisier with more spurious ODF peaks for sub-voxels below 30 µm3 and that, for our data, the optimal gray matter sub-voxel size is between 62.5 µm3 and 125 µm3. The example experiments presented here represent an important advancement towards robust multi-modal MRI-CLARITY comparisons.","Leuze, C; Goubran, M; Barakovic, M; Aswendt, M; Tian, Q; Hsueh, B; Crow, A; Weber, E; Steinberg, G; Zeineh, M; Plowey, E; Daducci, A; Innocenti, G; Thiran, J-P; Deisseroth, K; McNab, J A",Neuroimage,537,12

Methods The chest CT features of seven COVID-19 patients, who were diagnosed by virus nucleic acid test from Jan. 25 to Feb. 15, 2020 in Changhai Hospital of Naval Medical University (Second Military Medical University), were analyzed retrospectively. There were six males and one female, aged (51.1±18.8) years (range 29-75 years). All the seven patients received chest CT plain scan examimation. The CT images were interpreted by two experienced senior radiologists, and the distribution, location and density of lesions, number of involved lobes, air bronchogram, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were analyzed. Results The average time from onset of symptoms to CT examination was 3.6 d (range 1-9 d) in the seven COVID-19 patients. The lesions were distributed in single lung in one case and bilateral lungs in six cases. The lesions involved middle and lateral fields of lungs in five cases and the whole field of lungs in two cases. The lesions showed ground-glass opacity in four cases and mixed shadow in three cases. The lesions involved two or less lobes in four cases and five lobes in three cases. One case had air bronchogram. No mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion were found. Conclusion COVID-19 patients have characteristic CT findings, which has important clinical significance for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. However, the diagnosis should be confirmed based on the patient's epidemic history, clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators.","Xu, Fang; Yun, Bian; Fang, Liu; Tao, Jiang; Cheng-Wei, Shao; Li, Wang; Jian-Ping, Lu",Acad.

As a compensatory response, plasma HCO3concentration decreases if pCO2decreases and increases conversely. These secondary responses prevent large pH fluctuations. However, metabolic acid-base disorders may still occur as a consequence of dysfunction of other organs and/or medical treatments. To recognize superimposed acid-base disorders, the availability of an accurate prediction of the expected HCO3that corresponds to a given pCO2is crucial. In chronic hypocapnia, the compensatory metabolic response is regulated by the equation ΔHCO3/ΔpCO2=0.4 mEq/L per mm Hg. An easy rule to compute the expected value of HCO3may be 0.4×pCO2+9. In chronic hypercapnia, the equation is ΔHCO3/ΔpCO2=0.48 mEq/L per mm Hg, and the expected value of HCO3becomes 0.48×pCO2+4.74. While this expression is accurate, it seems to be of limited use for simple ""bedside"" predictions. In this contribution, we propose the simpler expression: the expected value of HCO3in chronic hypercapnia=½ pCO2+3.5. For values of pCO2not exceeding 70 mm Hg, with the proposed expression, the difference in HCO3prediction in respect to the previous one is &lt;0.5 mEq/L, which is clinically negligible. The root mean square value of the error introduced by the proposed expression is as small as 0.19 mEq/L. Because of its accuracy, we believe that the proposed formula may be useful to identify mixed disorders at the bedside in a simpler way.","Marano, Marco; Senigalliesi, Luigi",Clin. Pulm. Med.,537,20

Experimental spectra are compared to their corresponding density of states, weighted by photoemission cross sections, calculated for clusters of ions pairs of increasing size. Thus, this study bridges single ion approaches to 3D periodical DFT studies and enables the exploration of the different aspects of electronic structure establishment in ILs. Even for a relatively small cluster size, the relative energy of cation and anions states shifts by an amount that corresponds closely to that expected from the Madelung energy of a bulk IL, and the photoemission cross section-weighted DOS spectra are in good agreement with the measured valence bands. Trends in the relative energy and ionic character of the frontier orbitals across this series of cyano-ILs are discussed.","Rangan, Sylvie; Viereck, Jonathan; Bartynski, Robert A",J. phys. chem.

The saprophytic fungi of Mucorales species cause the disease, Mucormycosis, only in immunocompromised hosts. Clinical presentation of mucormycosis is related to the underlying conditions;rhino-cerebral disease is the most common form, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus;pulmonary, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal infections can also occur. Severe COVID-19 itself is a life-threatening disease and various factors, including diabetes, especially when complicated by ketoacidosis, previous respiratory pathology, immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial infection sources and systemic immune alterations of COVID-19 itself predispose to mucormycosis. No specific biomarkers are available to diagnose mucormycosis;imaging of the involved area and histopathological examination of the biopsied tissue are most important in diagnosis. The underlying medical conditions must be corrected;these include good glycemic control, tapering of steroids, and reducing or stopping immunosuppressive medications. Systemic antifungal therapy with liposomal Amphotericin B is the medical treatment of choice though drug resistance is not uncommon. Surgical debridement of devitalized tissue is often required. Severe COVID-19 patients with secondary co-infections require longer hospitalization and had higher risks of death. The mortality rate is almost 50% despite timely adequate treatment.

Little is known of the burden of these sequelae, and there are no clear recommendations for follow-up of COVID-19 patients.In this multi-disciplinary evaluation, cardiopulmonary function and psychological impairment after hospitalization for COVID-19 are mapped. Methods: We evaluated patients at our outpatient clinic 6 weeks after discharge. Cardiopulmonary function was measured by echocardiography, 24-hours ECG monitoring and pulmonary function testing. Psychological adjustment was measured using questionnaires and semi-structured clinical interviews. A comparison was made between patients admitted to the general ward and Intensive care unit (ICU), and between patients with a high versus low functional status. Findings: Eighty-one patients were included of whom 34 (41%) had been admitted to the ICU. New York Heart Association class II-III was present in 62% of the patients. Left ventricular function was normal in 78% of patients.

On the contrary, the morbidity and mortality are showing decreasing trend as time progresses. The most intriguing part is the rise in asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive cases in the population, which made us speculate some kind of gradual development of immunity in the population. To date, no attention has been given to the accumulation of killed/inactivated/degenerated SARS-CoV-2 associated molecular particle patterns (SAMPPs). In this paper, we introduced the concept of SAMMPs and its existence on inanimate objects is quite conceivable due to the size of SARS-CoV-2 and exuberant shedding of the virus in respiratory secretions. SAMPPs can come into the contact with mucosal surfaces and thereof associated antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, we hypothesized the existence of SAMPPs mediated the development of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has caused an increase in the incidence rate of asymptomatic cases and a decrease in mortality rate. To understand the existence of SAMPPs associated natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2, future population based serological testing are recommended to investigate serum antibody levels against various molecular particles associated with SAMPPs.","Sharma, Nilesh Kumar; Sarode, Sachin C; Sarode, Gargi; Patil, Shankargouda",Med Hypotheses,537,20

In this context, several studies highlight the emergence of infectious zoonotic diseases which potentially lead to global pandemics. The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates such a trend, as its origins are related to the mismanagement of natural habitats and wildlife. Thus, it is fundamental to effectively address the interacting factors that stimulate the outbreak of pandemics. The present research assesses how environmental degradation contributed to the COVID-19 emergence, and present Environmental Education as an essential tool to raise awareness on the interaction of environmental protection, ecology and public health. We analyze successful international initiatives that encourage Environmental Education, such as the United Nations’s Earth School, the Unesco’s Global Education Coalition and the Brazilian initiative Ame o Tucunduba. We conclude that promoting Environmental Education may play a vital role in tackling challenges such as global pandemics by improving sustainability, and thus may avoid future environmental and health threats. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Cruz, T.

To explore parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their experience and perspectives toward remote teaching during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to parents who have at least one child who had attended a face-to-face learning environment prior to school closures and started remote teaching during the pandemic. 983 parents participated in the study. The parents' views on students' experiences of remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, their experiences and perspectives toward remote teaching were discussed. The results suggested that the remote teaching process has been challenging for both students and parents. It is found that the remote teaching practices were mainly covered in core courses; remote teaching is considered as unsuitable for young children and students with special needs; the parents complain about social isolation, lack of interactivity, and increased screen time; and remote teaching has placed a heavy burden on parents. Lastly, the parents stated that their children acquired self-regulated learning skills and digital socialization during emergency remote teaching.","Misirli, Ozge; Ergulec, Funda",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),537,22

There is a higher incidence in some regions and countries, especially where close association exists between growing numbers of cattle (the major source of Mycobacterium bovis) and people, many suffering from poverty, and where dairy products are consumed unpasteurised. More attention needs to be focused on possible increased zTB incidence resulting from growth in dairy production globally and increased demand in low income countries in particular. Evidence of new zoonotic mycobacterial strains in South Asia and Africa (e.g. M. orygis), warrants urgent assessment of prevalence, potential drivers and risk in order to develop appropriate interventions. Control of M. bovis infection in cattle through detect and cull policies remain the mainstay of reducing zTB risk, whilst in certain circumstances animal vaccination is proving beneficial. New point of care diagnostics will help to detect animal infections and human cases. Given the high burden of human tuberculosis (caused by M. tuberculosis) in endemic areas, animals are affected by reverse zoonosis, including multi-drug resistant strains.

Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) is FDA-approved for treatment of cytokine storm associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Here we examined compassionate use of tocilizumab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: We report on a single-center study of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and oxygen saturations <90% on oxygen support with most intubated. We examined clinical and laboratory parameters including oxygen and vasopressor requirements, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment. RESULTS: Twenty seven SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients received one 400 mg dose of tocilizumab. IL-6 was the predominant cytokine detected at tocilizumab treatment. Significant reductions in temperature and CRP were seen post-tocilizumab. However, four patients did not show rapid CRP declines, of whom three had poorer outcomes. Oxygen and vasopressor requirements diminished over the first week post-tocilizumab. Twenty-two patients required mechanical ventilation; at last follow-up, 16 were extubated. Adverse events and serious adverse events were minimal, but two deaths (7.4%) occurred that were felt unrelated to tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to published reports on the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2, tocilizumab appears to offer benefits in reducing inflammation, oxygen requirements, vasopressor support, and mortality. The rationale for tocilizumab treatment is supported by detection of IL-6 in pathogenic levels in all patients. Additional doses of tocilizumab may be needed for those showing slow declines in CRP. Proof of efficacy awaits randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.","Jordan, Stanley C; Zakowski, Phillip; Tran, Hai P; Smith, Ethan A; Gaultier, Cyril; Marks, Gregory; Zabner, Rachel; Lowenstein, Hayden; Oft, Jillian; Bluen, Benjamin; Le, Catherine; Shane, Rita; Ammerman, Noriko; Vo, Ashley; Chen, Peter; Kumar, Sanjeev; Toyoda, Mieko; Ge, Shili; Huang, Edmund",Clin. infect. dis,537,1

With the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have turned to more nontraditional sources of clinical data to characterize the disease in near real-time, study the societal implications of interventions, as well as the sequelae that recovered COVID-19 cases present (Long-COVID). However, manually curated social media datasets are difficult to come by due to the expensive costs of manual annotation and the efforts needed to identify the correct texts. When datasets are available, they are usually very small and their annotations do not generalize well over time or to larger sets of documents. As part of the 2021 Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon, we release our dataset of over 120 million automatically annotated tweets for biomedical research purposes. Incorporating best practices, we identify tweets with potentially high clinical relevance. We evaluated our work by comparing several SpaCy-based annotation frameworks against a manually annotated gold-standard dataset. Selecting the best method to use for automatic annotation, we then annotated 120 million tweets and released them publicly for future downstream usage within the biomedical domain.","Hernandez, L. A.

This study is a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the protein-coding sequences of seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) to decipher the nucleotide sequence variability and codon usage patterns. It is essential to understand the survival ability of the viruses, their adaptation to hosts, and their evolution. The current analysis revealed a high abundance of the relative dinucleotide (odds ratio), GC and CT pairs in the first and last two codon positions, respectively, as well as a low abundance of the CG pair in the last two positions of the codon, which might be related to the evolution of the viruses. A remarkable level of variability of GC content in the third position of the codon among the seven coronaviruses was observed. Codons with high RSCU values are primarily from the aliphatic and hydroxyl amino acid groups, and codons with low RSCU values belong to the aliphatic, cyclic, positively charged, and sulfur-containing amino acid groups. In order to elucidate the evolutionary processes of the seven coronaviruses, a phylogenetic tree (dendrogram) was constructed based on the RSCU scores of the codons. The severe and mild categories CoVs were positioned in different clades. A comparative phylogenetic study with other coronaviruses depicted that SARS-CoV-2 is close to the CoV isolated from pangolins (Manis javanica, Pangolin-CoV) and cats (Felis catus, SARS(r)-CoV). Further analysis of the effective number of codon (ENC) usage bias showed a relatively higher bias for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2. The ENC plot against GC3 suggested that the mutational bias might have a role in determining the codon usage variation among candidate viruses. A codon adaptability study on a few human host parasites (from different kingdoms), including CoVs, showed a diverse adaptability pattern. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV exhibit relatively lower but similar codon adaptability compared to MERS-CoV.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Roy, Swarup",Genomics,537,15

Meanwhile, in the context of lockdowns and other measures for preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread, the internet has surged as a web-based resource for health information. Under these conditions, social question-and-answer communities (SQACs) are playing an increasingly important role in improving public health literacy. There is great theoretical and practical significance in exploring the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish an extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model that could analyze the influence factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information. Particularly, we tried to test the moderating effects that different demographic characteristics had on the variables' influences. METHODS: This study was conducted by administering a web-based questionnaire survey and analyzing the responses from a final total of 598 valid questionnaires after invalid data were cleaned. By using structural equation modelling, the influencing factors of SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information were analyzed. The moderating effects of variables were verified via hierarchical regression. RESULTS: Performance expectation (ß=.282; P<.001), social influence (ß=.238; P=.02), and facilitating conditions (ß=.279; P=.002) positively affected users' willingness to adopt health information, whereas effort expectancy (P=.79) and perceived risk (P=.41) had no significant effects. Gender had a significant moderating effect in the structural equation model (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: SQAC users' willingness to adopt health information was evidently affected by multiple factors, such as performance expectation, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The structural equation model proposed in this study has a good fitting degree and good explanatory power for users' willingness to adopt health information.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the initial chest CT data of 62 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patients (34 men, 28 women; age range 20-91 years old) who did not receive any antiviral treatment between January 21 and February 4, 2020, in Chongqing, China. Patients were assigned to the early-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4 days) or progressive-stage group (onset of symptoms within 4-7 days) for analysis. CT characteristics and the distribution, size, and CT score of pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were assessed. RESULTS: In our study, the major characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 was ground-glass opacity (61.3%), followed by ground-glass opacity with consolidation (35.5%), rounded opacities (25.8%), a crazy-paving pattern (25.8%), and an air bronchogram (22.6%). No patient presented cavitation, a reticular pattern, or bronchial wall thickening. The CT scores of the progressive-stage group were significantly greater than those of the early-stage group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ground-glass opacities with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019. CT score can be used to evaluate the severity of the disease. If these typical alterations are found, then the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 must be considered. KEY POINTS: â¢ Multiple GGOs with consolidations in the periphery of the lungs were the primary CT characteristic of COVID-19. â¢ The halo sign may be a special CT feature in the early-stage COVID-19 patients. â¢ Significantly increased CT score may indicate the aggravation of COVID-19 in the progressive stage.","Zhou, Zhiming; Guo, Dajing; Li, Chuanming; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Yang, Ran; Li, Xiang; Zeng, Wenbing",Eur Radiol,537,18

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently spreading around the world. The relationships among the pandemic and its associated travel restrictions, social distancing measures, contact tracing, mask-wearing habits and medical consultation efficiency have not yet been extensively assessed. Based on the epidemic data reported by the Health Commission of Wenzhou, we analysed the developmental characteristics of the epidemic and modified the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model in three discrete ways. (1) According to the implemented preventive measures, the epidemic was divided into three stages: initial, outbreak and controlled. (2) We added many factors, such as health protections, travel restrictions and social distancing, close-contact tracing and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (TSOH), to the model. (3) Exposed and infected people were subdivided into isolated and free-moving populations. For the parameter estimation of the model, the average TSOH and daily cured cases, deaths and imported cases can be obtained through individual data from epidemiological investigations. The changes in daily contacts are simulated using the intracity travel intensity (ICTI) from the Baidu Migration Big Data platform. The optimal values of the remaining parameters are calculated by the grid search method. With this model, we calculated the sensitivity of the control measures with regard to the prevention of the spread of the epidemic by simulating the number of infected people in various hypothetical situations. Simultaneously, through a simulation of a second epidemic, the challenges from the rebound of the epidemic were analysed, and prevention and control recommendations were made. The results show that the modified SEIR model can effectively simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Wenzhou. The policy of the lockdown of Wuhan, the launch of the first-level Public Health Emergency Preparedness measures on 23 January 2020 and the implementation of resident travel control measures on 31 January 2020 were crucial to COVID-19 control.","Li, Wenning; Gong, Jianhua; Zhou, Jieping; Zhang, Lihui; Wang, Dongchuan; Li, Jing; Shi, Chenhui; Fan, Hongkui",Epidemiol Infect,537,33

Reasoning on TKGs that predicts potential facts (events) in the future brings great challenges to existing models. When facing a prediction task, human beings usually search useful historical information (i.e., clues) in their memories and then reason for future meticulously. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose CluSTeR to predict future facts in a two-stage manner, Clue Searching and Temporal Reasoning, accordingly. Specifically, at the clue searching stage, CluSTeR learns a beam search policy via reinforcement learning (RL) to induce multiple clues from historical facts. At the temporal reasoning stage, it adopts a graph convolution network based sequence method to deduce answers from clues. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the substantial advantages of CluSTeR compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the clues found by CluSTeR further provide interpretability for the results.","Li, Zixuan; Jin, Xiaolong; Guan, Saiping; Li, Wei; Guo, Jiafeng; Wang, Yuanzhuo; Cheng, Xueqi",,537,17

Participants engaged in the dictator game with humans and machines and, consistent with prior research on disasters, those impacted by Covid-19 displayed more altruism to other humans. Unexpectedly, participants impacted by Covid-19 displayed equal altruism toward human and machine partners. A mediation analysis suggests that altruism toward machines was explained by an increase in heuristic thinking -reinforcing prior theory that heuristic thinking encourages people to treat machines like people- and faith in technology -perhaps reflecting longer-term consequences on how we act with machines.

The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on normal pituitary glands function or pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) have not yet been elucidated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the impairment of pituitary glands and the development of PitNETs. METHODS: PitNETs tissues were obtained from 114 patients, and normal pituitary gland tissues were obtained from the autopsy. The mRNA levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for ACE2 in 69 PitNETs and 3 normal pituitary glands. The primary tumor cells and pituitary cell lines (MMQ, GH3 and AtT-20/D16v-F2) were treated with diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 agonist, with various dose regimens. The pituitary hormones between 43 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with 45 healthy controls. RESULTS: Pituitary glands and the majority of PitNET tissues showed low/negative ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, while AGTR1 showed high expression in normal pituitary and corticotroph adenomas. ACE2 agonist increased the secretion of ACTH in AtT-20/D16v-F2 cells through downregulating AGTR1. The level of serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls (p < 0.001), but was dramatically decreased in critical cases compared to non-critical patients (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on corticotroph cells and adenomas.","Gu, Wei Ting; Zhou, Fen; Xie, Wan Qun; Wang, Shuo; Yao, Hong; Liu, Yan Ting; Gao, Ling; Wu, Zhe Bao",Endocrine,537,21

Asprosin induces rapid glucose releases from the liver. However, its molecular mechanisms and function are still unclear. Adaptation of energy substrates from fatty acid to glucose is recently considered a novel therapeutic target in heart failure treatment. We hypothesized that the asprosin is able to modulate cardiac mitochondrial functions and has important prognostic implications in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 50 patients (86% male, mean age 55 ± 13 years) with DCM and followed their 5-year major adverse cardiovascular events from 2012 to 2017. Comparing with healthy individuals, DCM patients had higher asprosin levels (191.2 versus 79.7 ng/mL, P < 0.01). RESULTS: During the 5-year follow-up in the study cohort, 16 (32.0%) patients experienced adverse cardiovascular events. Patients with lower asprosin levels (< 210 ng/mL) were associated with increased risks of adverse clinical outcomes with a hazard ratio of 7.94 (95% CI 1.88-33.50, P = 0.005) when compared patients with higher asprosin levels (&#8805; 210 ng/mL). Using cardiomyoblasts as a cellular model, we showed that asprosin prevented hypoxia-induced cell death and enhanced mitochondrial respiration and proton leak under hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with DCM, elevated plasma asprosin levels are associated with less adverse cardiovascular events in five years. The underlying protective mechanisms of asprosin may be linked to its functions relating to enhanced mitochondrial respiration under hypoxia.","Wen, Ming-Shien; Wang, Chao-Yung; Yeh, Jih-Kai; Chen, Chun-Chi; Tsai, Ming-Lung; Ho, Ming-Yun; Hung, Kuo-Chun; Hsieh, I-Chang",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,537,22

The clinical setting, mortality rate, and prognostic factors in these patients have not been well established. Methods: We included all dialyzed patients with COVID-19 referred to our dialysis center between March 11 and April 11, 2020. Data were obtained through the review of the medical records and were censored at the time of data cutoff, on May 11, 2020. Results: Forty-four patients on maintenance dialysis with COVID-19 were referred to our dialysis unit during the COVID-19 epidemic. Median age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 51.5-72.5); 65.9% were men. Comorbidities included hypertension (97.7%), diabetes mellitus (50%), and chronic cardiac (38.6%) and respiratory (27.3%) diseases. Initial symptoms were fever (79.5%), shortness of breath (29.5%), cough (43.2%), and diarrhea (13.6%). Three profiles of severity were distinguished based on the World Health Organization (WHO) progression scale. Forty-one (93.2%) were hospitalized and only 3 were maintained on outpatient hemodialysis. Thirty-three (75%) patients required oxygen therapy, including 15 (45.5%) who were referred to the intensive care unit. Overall, 27.3% of patients died, and 58.5% were discharged from hospital, including only 2 (13.3%) of those admitted to the intensive care unit. By multivariate analysis, cough, thrombopenia <120 g/l, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal, and blood C-reactive protein (CRP) >175 mg/l were significantly associated with death.

The aim of this study was to verify whether there was an association between low skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation need in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of a referral center for COVID-19. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the hospital between February 26 and May 15, 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Skeletal muscle index was assessed from a transverse computed tomography image at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra with National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and statistical analysis was performed to find an association between skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: We included 519 patients, the median age was 51 (42-61) yrs, and 115 patients (22%) had low skeletal muscle index. On multivariable analysis, skeletal muscle index was not associated with mortality, intensive care unit admission, or invasive mechanical ventilation need nor in a subanalysis of patients 65 yrs or older. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle index determined by computed tomography at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra was not associated with negative outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Moctezuma-Velázquez, Paulina; Miranda-Zazueta, Godolfino; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Tamez-Torres, Karla Maria; Román-Montes, Carla Marina; Díaz-Mejía, Bruno Alejandro; Pérez-García, Esteban; Villanueva-Reza, Marco; Tovar-Méndez, Víctor Hugo; Medrano-Borromeo, Carla; Martínez-Valenzuela, Alejandra; Jandete-Medina, Míguel Ángel; Martínez-Guerra, Bernardo Alonso; Uscanga-Domínguez, Luis; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Olivas-Martinez, Antonio; Moctezuma-Velázquez, Carlos",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,537,13

Insights on S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with ACE2 receptor and drug repurposing has accelerated drug discovery for the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding small molecule binding sites in the S protein and ACE2 interface is crucial in the search of effective drugs to prevent viral entry. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents together with virtual screening to identify small molecules that could be potential inhibitors of S protein ACE2 interaction. Observation of organic probe molecule localization during the simulations revealed multiple sites at the S protein surface related to a small molecule, antibody, and ACE2 binding. In addition, a novel conformation of the S protein was discovered that could be stabilized by small molecules to inhibit attachment to ACE2. The most promising binding site on the RBD-ACE2 interface was targeted with virtual screening and top-ranked compounds (DB08248, DB02651, DB03714, and DB14826) are suggested for experimental testing.

Notably, one is specific to SARS-CoV-2, which is located in close proximity to the receptor binding domain. The other region, which is localised at the fusion peptide, could potentially function as a pan-SARS target.

Results will be obtained on the basis of an analysis of the upper tail of the cumulative distribution function of the time span between the departure of the travellers from the place where the infection occurs and the time instant when COVID-19 infections may currently be detected. As expected, the quarantine duration is a decreasing function of the fraction of the infected travellers, which one is prepared to identify as `acceptable risk'. The analysis suggests that a maximal $5~\%$ risk (of new infections originating from subjects who become infective after their quarantine is lifted) may be associated with a minimal quarantine duration of about eight days, $1~\%$ with about twelve, and $0.1~\%$ with about sixteen. Unless the distribution of the duration of short (typically, up to three weeks) travels departs significantly from the shape assumed in this study, the results of the present analysis do not provide support for the plans to shorten the quarantine duration of about ten days to two weeks, which currently applies to travellers entering most European countries from regions with a high risk of infection.","Matsinos, Evangelos",,537,16

The number of infected people and deaths are proliferating every day, which is putting tremendous pressure on our social and healthcare system. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases is a significant step to fight against this virus as well as release pressure off the healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: One of the critical factors behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic is a lengthy clinical testing time. The imaging tool, such as Chest X-ray (CXR), can speed up the identification process. Therefore, our objective is to develop an automated CAD system for the detection of COVID-19 samples from healthy and pneumonia cases using CXR images. METHODS: Due to the scarcity of the COVID-19 benchmark dataset, we have employed deep transfer learning techniques, where we examined 15 different pre-trained CNN models to find the most suitable one for this task. RESULTS: A total of 860 images (260 COVID-19 cases, 300 healthy and 300 pneumonia cases) have been employed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm, where 70% images of each class are accepted for training, 15% is used for validation, and rest is for testing. It is observed that the VGG19 obtains the highest classification accuracy of 89.3% with an average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.90, 0.89, 0.90, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep transfer learning techniques for the identification of COVID-19 cases using CXR images.","Rahaman, Md Mamunur; Li, Chen; Yao, Yudong; Kulwa, Frank; Rahman, Mohammad Asadur; Wang, Qian; Qi, Shouliang; Kong, Fanjie; Zhu, Xuemin; Zhao, Xin",J Xray Sci Technol,537,20

Many developing countries, however, have limited capacities to estimate R accurately. This study aims to demonstrate how health production function can be used to assess the state of COVID-19 transmission and to determine a risk-based relaxation policy. METHODS: The author employs a simple ""bridge"" between epidemiological models and production economics to establish the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases as a short-run total product function and to derive the corresponding marginal product, average product, and production elasticity. Three crucial dates defining the states of transmission, labelled red, yellow, and green zones, are determined. Relaxation policy is illogical in the ""red zone"" and is not recommended in the ""yellow zone"". In the ""green zone"", relaxation can be considered. The Bayesian probability of near term's daily cases meeting a policy target is computed. The method is applied to France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US, and to Indonesia as an example of application in developing countries. RESULTS: This study uses data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard, beginning from the first recording date for each country until February 28, 2021. As of June 30, 2020, France, Germany, Italy, and the UK had arrived at the ""green zone"" but with a high risk of transmission re-escalations. In the following weeks, their production elasticities were rising, giving a signal of accelerated transmissions. The signal was corroborated by these countries' rising cases, making them leaving the ""green zone"" in the later months. By February 28, 2021, the UK had returned to the ""green zone"", France, Germany, and Italy were still in the ""yellow zone"", while the US reached the ""green zone"" at a very high number of cases. Despite being in the ""red zone"", Indonesia relaxed its distancing measures, causing a sharp rise of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Health production function can show the state of COVID-19 transmission. A rising production elasticity gives an early warning of transmission escalations. The elasticity is a useful parameter for risk-based relaxation policy.","Wibowo, Dradjad H",BMC Public Health,537,21

As our emotional patterns and sensitive attributes like our identity, gender, mental well-being, are easily inferred using deep acoustic models, we encounter a new generation of privacy risks by using these services. One approach to mitigate the risk of paralinguistic-based privacy breaches is to exploit a combination of cloud-based processing with privacy-preserving, on-device paralinguistic information learning and filtering before transmitting voice data. In this paper we introduce EDGY, a configurable, lightweight, disentangled representation learning framework that transforms and filters high-dimensional voice data to identify and contain sensitive attributes at the edge prior to offloading to the cloud. We evaluate EDGY's on-device performance and explore optimization techniques, including model quantization and knowledge distillation, to enable private, accurate and efficient representation learning on resource-constrained devices. Our results show that EDGY runs in tens of milliseconds with 0.2% relative improvement in ABX score or minimal performance penalties in learning linguistic representations from raw voice signals, using a CPU and a single-core ARM processor without specialized hardware.","Aloufi, Ranya; Haddadi, Hamed; Boyle, David",,537,33

In this sense, the next public health challenge globally will be to preserving healthy HCWs during this pandemic. AIM: The present study has the aim of investigating the relationship among concerns, perceived impact, preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic and the mental health of Italian physicians. METHODS: From March 29th to April 15th 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques through Limesurvey platform. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple binary logistic regressions. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors for perceived job stress were concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR = 3.18 [95% CI = 2.00-5.05] P < .001), perceived impact on job demands (OR = 1.63 [95% CI = 1.05-2.52] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 2.50 [95% CI = 1.60-3.90] P < .001), and non-working concerns (OR = 1.86 [95% CI = 1.15-3.03] P < .05). With respect to the risk factors for rumination about the pandemic emerged concerns about catching COVID-19 (OR 1.74, [95% CI = 1.12-2.71] P < .05), perceived impact on job role (OR = 1.68 [95% CI = 1.12-2.52] P < .05), and impact on personal life (OR = 2.04 [95% CI = 1.08-3.86] P < .05). Finally, the risk factors for crying at work were perceived impact on job role (OR = 2.47, [95% CI = 1.20-5.09] P < .05), rumination about the pandemic (OR = 3.027 [95% CI = 1.27-7.19] P < .01), watching colleagues crying at work (OR = 3.82 [95% CI = 1.88-7.77] P < .01), and perceived job stress (OR = 3.53 [95% CI = 1.24-10.07] P < .05). CONCLUSION: In general, our results highlighted that being concerned about being infected/infecting other people, carrying out new and unusual tasks, and witnessing colleagues crying at work were important risk factors for physicians' well-being. Additional data are necessary to advance understanding of these risk factors in a long-term perspective.","Portoghese, Igor; Meloni, Federico; Galletta, Maura; Piras, Ilenia; D039,; Aloja, Ernesto; Finco, Gabriele; Campagna, Marcello",J Prim Care Community Health,537,20

Pandemic proportion brings into the foreground the number of people with severe forms of the disease, putting aside the fact that a large portion of the population is an asymptomatic, making them silent carriers of the virus. Additional confusion is made by inconsistent data about the presence of the virus in the nasopharyngeal region and the manifestation of the disease symptoms. Different tissue distribution of virus in the body starting from guts, liver, muscles, kidney etc. without any signs of tissue destruction, opens up the possibility that individuals with negative results of PCR test in the nasopharyngeal swab may also be latent carriers of the infection. Overall clinical presentation of the disease is influenced by the initial protection gained through the accumulated ""experience"" collected from previous encountering of corona family and noncorona viruses, resulting in overlapping of the humoral and cellular immunity. Apart from this, unjustifiably neglected but very significant form of host defense against infection is disease tolerance based on cohabitation with pathogen. It is important to note that consequences of the disease tolerance in terms of pathological and epidemiological aspects are quite different then classical antiviral immune response. This work will elaborate the impact of virome on the course of infection at all stages taking into account both immune resistance, as an ability of the host immune system to eliminate pathogen, and disease tolerance, as a form of host defense with neutral to positive impact to pathogen load. Also, in accordance with the above mentioned, the potential of naturally occurring compounds to profile the course of infection and to support currently available protocols for COVID-19 treatment was discussed.","Mijatovic, S.; Maksimovic-Ivanic, D.",Hrana i Ishrana,537,20

It has infected more than 20 million people worldwide and it is responsible for more than 737, 000 deaths. This work presents a study that explores linear regression mechanisms combined with a sliding and cumulative time window approach to provide inputs to assist in decision making for public policies, within the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution, whether they are hardening or easing the isolation. Data from five states of Brazil were collected and applied a Ridge regression to predict the curve behavior of cases and deaths of COVID-19. As a result, an Explained Variance Status (EVS) up to 0.998 and 0.999 is presented, considering cases and deaths, respectively.

We sought to determine the association of obesity and other clinical factors with outcomes among patients hospitalized for severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study included patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and September 17, 2020 in a 5-hospital health care system in Northeast United States, who had a positive RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 performed during hospitalization. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using admission weight and height, and the WHO classification was used to define obesity. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of obesity and other clinical parameters with mortality (defined as in-hospital death or transition to hospice care) and intensive care use (defined by transfer to intensive care unit [ICU]). Multivariate model was adjusted for demographics and 8 pertinent comorbidities. Among 3246 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 51–78), 49.9% were female, 30.5% overweight, and 43.2% had obesity (20.8%, 12.1%, and 10.4% with class I, II, and III obesity, respectively). A total of 542 (16.7%) patients died or received hospice care, and 811 (25.0%) required ICU care. In unadjusted analyses, patients with obesity had lower mortality compared with normal weight adults (13.0% vs. 23.1%) but a higher risk of ICU care (26.5% vs. 22.5%) and longer duration of ICU stays (9.5±10.6 vs. 6.6±8.5 [days];all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). Obesity was associated with a higher incidence of hypoxic respiratory failure requiring invasive (17.8% vs. 9.3%) and noninvasive (22.7% vs. 14.0%) ventilatory support. In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and diabetes were significantly associated with both mortality and ICU care. In contrast, obesity was not associated with a significantly higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.14;95% CI, 0.91–1.43) but was associated with a higher risk of ICU care (OR 1.27;95% CI 1.07–1.51 for all obesity and OR 2.07;95% CI 1.51–2.82 for class III obesity compared with normal weight). The association of underweight with mortality (OR 1.56;95% CI 0.93 - 2.60) and ICU care (OR 1.20;95% CI, 0.71–1.99) was not statistically significant. This retrospective study of hospitalized patients suggests that obesity is associated with intensive care use and longer duration of ICU stay but not with mortality due to COVID-19. These findings underscore the vulnerability of individuals with obesity during the current pandemic.","Kang, Yu Mi Brancale Joseph Athonvarangkul Diana Alausa Jameel Subair Labeebah Lipska Kasia Joanna Jastreboff Ania M.",Journal of the Endocrine Society,537,16

Treatment of the two diseases enables the possibility of interactions between antidepressant and antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this review was to analyze such interactions in one animal seizure model-the maximal electroshock (MES) in mice. Although numerous antidepressants showed an anticonvulsant action, mianserin exhibited a proconvulsant effect against electroconvulsions. In most cases, antidepressants potentiated or remained ineffective in relation to the antielectroshock action of classical antiepileptic drugs. However, mianserin and trazodone reduced the action of valproate, phenytoin, and carbamazepine against the MES test. Antiseizure drug effects were potentiated by all groups of antidepressants independently of their mechanisms of action. Therefore, other factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) modulation, should be considered as the background for the effect of drug combinations.","Borowicz-Reutt, Kinga K",Int. j. mol. sci.

DESIGN: We collected and sequenced 392 tongue-coating samples, 172 faecal samples and 155 serum samples from Central China and East China. We characterised microbiome and lipid molecules, constructed microbial classifiers in discovery cohort and verified their diagnostic potential in 74 confirmed patients (CPs) from East China and 37 suspected patients (SPs) with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Oral and faecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in CPs versus healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, butyric acid-producing bacteria were decreased and lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria were increased in CPs in oral cavity. The classifiers based on 8 optimal oral microbial markers (7 faecal microbial markers) achieved good diagnostic efficiency in different cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic efficacy reached 87.24% in the cross-regional cohort. Moreover, the classifiers successfully diagnosed SPs with IgG antibody positivity as CPs, and diagnostic efficacy reached 92.11% (98.01% of faecal microbiome). Compared with CPs, 47 lipid molecules, including sphingomyelin (SM)(d40:4), SM(d38:5) and monoglyceride(33:5), were depleted, and 122 lipid molecules, including phosphatidylcholine(36:4p), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0p/20:5) and diglyceride(20:1/18:2), were enriched in confirmed patients recovery. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to characterise the oral microbiome in COVID-19, and oral microbiomes and lipid alterations in recovered patients, to explore their correlations and to report the successful establishment and validation of a diagnostic model for COVID-19.","Ren, Zhigang; Wang, Haiyu; Cui, Guangying; Lu, Haifeng; Wang, Ling; Luo, Hong; Chen, Xinhua; Ren, Hongyan; Sun, Ranran; Liu, Wenli; Liu, Xiaorui; Liu, Chao; Li, Ang; Wang, Xuemei; Rao, Benchen; Yuan, Chengyu; Zhang, Hua; Sun, Jiarui; Chen, Xiaolong; Li, Bingjie; Hu, Chuansong; Wu, Zhongwen; Yu, Zujiang; Kan, Quancheng; Li, Lanjuan",Gut,537,16

However, a rise in COPD hospitalisations may indicate a considerable increase in fatality rate in public health. The current study focuses on the association between consecutive ambient air pollution (CAAP) and COPD hospitalisation to offer predictable early guidance towards estimates of COPD hospital admissions in the event of consecutive exposure to air pollution. Big data analytics were collected from 3-year time series recordings (from 2015 to 2017) of both air data and COPD hospitalisation data in the Chengdu region in China. Based on the combined effects of CAAP and unit increase in air pollutant concentrations, a quasi-Poisson regression model was established, which revealed the association between CAAP and estimated COPD admissions. The results show the dynamics and outbreaks in the variations in COPD admissions in response to CAAP. Cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE) are applied to validate the goodness of fit. In both short-term and long-term air pollution exposures, Z test outcomes show that the COPD hospitalisation risk is greater for men than for women; similarly, the occurrence of COPD hospital admissions in the group of elderly people (> 65 years old) is significantly larger than that in lower age groups. The time lag between the air quality and COPD hospitalisation is also investigated, and a peak of COPD hospitalisation risk is found to lag 2 days for air quality index (AQI) and PM10, and 1 day for PM2.5. The big data-based predictive paradigm would be a measure for the early detection of a public health event in post-COVID-19. The study findings can also provide guidance for COPD admissions in the event of consecutive exposure to air pollution in the Chengdu region.","Zhang, Yi; Wang, Ziyue; Cao, Yu; Zhang, Lifu; Wang, Guan; Dong, Fangjie; Deng, Ren; Guo, Baogen; Zeng, Li; Wang, Peng; Dai, Ruimei; Ran, Yu; Lyu, Wenyi; Miao, Peiwen; Su, Steven",Air Qual Atmos Health,537,1

However, data showing little improvement in the overall proportion of URMs in many health professions, despite widespread use of holistic review, suggest that relatively few programs using holistic review admit substantial proportions of underrepresented minorities. Therefore, more research is needed to understand factors that facilitate holistic review practices that successfully promote diverse student enrollment. The literature suggests that a supportive organizational culture is necessary for holistic review to be effective; yet, the influence of culture on admissions has not been directly studied. This study employs a qualitative, multiple case study approach to explore the influence of a culture that values diversity and inclusion ('diversity culture') on holistic review practices in two physician assistant educational programs that met criteria consistent with a proposed conceptual framework linking diversity culture to holistic admissions associated with high URM student enrollment (relative to other similar programs). Data from multiple sources were collected at each program during the 2018-2019 admissions cycle, and a coding manual derived from the conceptual framework facilitated directed content analysis and comparison of program similarities and differences. Consistent with the conceptual framework, diversity culture appeared to be a strong driver of holistic admissions practices that support enrolling diverse classes of students. Additional insights emerged that may serve as propositions for further testing and include the finding that URM faculty 'champions for diversity' appeared to strongly influence the admissions process.","Coplan, Bettie; Evans, Bronwynne C","Adv. health sci. educ.

Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the generalised prognostic role of small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in malignancies, based on variable data from different studies. METHODS: Four public databases were used to identify eligible studies. The association between prognostic indicators and clinical features was extracted and pooled to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was measured using Begg's test and Egger's test, and the stability of pooled results were measured using sensitivity analysis. Additionally, an online database based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was screened to further validate our results. Ultimately, we predicted the molecular regulation of SNHG15 based on the public databases. RESULTS: In total, 11 studies including 1087 patients were ultimately enrolled in our meta-analysis. We found that SNHG15 overexpression was associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and this was validated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) cohort. Moreover, increased SNHG15 expression suggested advanced TNM stage and LNM, but was not associated with age, gender, or tumour size. No publication bias or instability of the results was observed. SNHG15 was significantly upregulated in seven cancers and elevated expression of SNHG15 indicated shorter OS and DFS in five malignancies based on the validation using the GEPIA cohort. Further functional prediction indicated that SNHG15 may participate in some cancer-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Upregulation of lncRNA SNHG15 was notably associated with worse prognosis and clinical features, suggesting that SNHG15 might serve as a novel prognostic factor in various cancers.","Chen, Caizhi; Feng, Yeqian; Wang, Jingjing; Liang, Ye; Zou, Wen",BMC Cancer,537,1

Methods: Data on deaths following COVID-19 vaccination were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from December 11, 2020 through January 8, 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker was used to identify the total number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the same period to estimate the mortality rate. Stratified analysis was conducted by the location of vaccination. Results: As of January 8, 2021, 55 deaths were reported, and the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 8.2 per million population. A total of 37 deaths were reported among long-term care facility residents, and the mortality rate was 53.4 per million population. Top reported comorbidities associated with deaths included hypertension, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart failure. In addition, dementia was more likely to be associated with deaths vaccinated at long-term care facilities than at other locations.

PTMs consist in target modifications by small chemical moieties or conjugation of lipids, sugars or polypeptides. Among them, ubiquitin and a large family of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) share several features such as the structure of the small protein modifiers, the enzymatic cascades mediating the conjugation process and the targeted aminoacidic residue. In the brain, ubiquitination and two UBLs, namely sumoylation and the recently discovered neddylation orchestrate fundamental processes including synapse formation, maturation and plasticity, and their alteration is thought to contribute to the development of neurological disorders. Remarkably, emerging evidence suggests that these pathways tightly interplay to modulate the function of several proteins that possess pivotal roles for brain homeostasis as well as failure of this crosstalk seems to be implicated in the development of brain pathologies. In this review, we outline the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation and their functional interplay in synapse physiology and discuss their implication in the molecular pathogenesis of Intellectual Disability (ID), a neurodevelopmental disorder that is frequently co-morbid with a wide spectrum of brain pathologies. Finally, we propose a few outlooks that might contribute to better understand the complexity of these regulatory systems in regard to neuronal circuit pathophysiology.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation are related PTMs modulating cellular and molecular pathways that are essential to generate fully functional neuronal circuits. Their impairment is indeed implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders, including ID. Growing evidence now indicates they also functionally cooperate to govern synapse development and function. The main goals of this review are (i) to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of ubiquitination, sumoylation and neddylation in synapse functions; (ii) discuss how altered ubiquitination or sumoylation pathways may contribute to ID development; (iii) highlight evidence of a dynamic crosstalk between these PTMs, which represent a novel mechanism that could lead to the identification of new principles underlying synaptic function and dysfunction in ID.","Folci, Alessandra; Mirabella, Filippo; Fossati, Matteo",ENeuro,537,6

Due to the distinct but non-regular annual 35S pattern in precipitation, related data evaluation requires consideration of a35S input function that is based on representative rain samples. While minor rain events can easily be sampled quantitatively and hence representatively, a long-lasting rain event may get documented by a sample that represents only a certain sequence of the event, thus potentially resulting in a35S activity concentration that might not be representative. With the aim to examine the magnitude of temporal variations of the 35S activity concentration in rain during long-lasting rain events, we present and discuss two related exemplary 35S time series. Furthermore, we evaluate the applicability of the parameters total sulfate and electrical conductivity (EC), both detected in rainwater as easily attainable 35S proxies. The results of the study show (i) that the 35S activity concentration may vary substantially during long-lasting rain events due to atmospheric migration processes and aerosol washout and (ii) that neither sulfate nor EC are suitable as 35S proxies due to the different origin of 35S on the one hand and sulfate/EC on the other. Hence, for the determination of a35S activity concentration that is representative for a long-lasting rain event 35S analyses of an adequate number of sub-samples cannot be avoided.","Schubert, M; Weise, S M; Knöller, K",J Environ Radioact,537,23

Specifically, alongside cancellation and postponements of non-essential surgical services, emergency and essential surgical care delivery may become affected due to the shift of human and material resources towards fighting the pandemic. For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity in LMIC surgical ecosystems may result in higher morbidity and mortality, in addition to the COVID-19 toll. This paper aims to explore the potential consequences of COVID-19 on the emergency and essential surgical care in LMICs, to offer recommendations to mitigate damages and to reflect on preparedness for future crises. Reducing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMIC emergency and essential surgical services can be achieved through empowering communities with accurate information and knowledge on prevention, optimizing surgical material resources, providing quality training of health care personnel to treat SARS-CoV-2, and ensuring adequate personal protection equipment for workers on the frontline. While LMIC health systems are under larger strain, the experience from previous outbreaks may aid in order to innovate and adapt to the current pandemic. Protecting LMIC surgical ecosystems will be a pivotal process in ensuring that previous health system strengthening efforts are preserved, comprehensive care for populations worldwide are ensured, and to allow for future developments beyond the pandemic.","Ma, Xiya; Vervoort, Dominique; Reddy, Ché L; Park, Kee B; Makasa, Emmanuel",Int J Surg,537,29

A cross-sectional descriptive design of 500 nurses working at government and non-governmental hospitals in five regions in Saudi Arabia were selected using convenience sampling. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied and the Mann-Whitney test was utilized as a post hoc test. The majority of nurses in this study, 96.85%, had excellent knowledge of COVID-19. Some (83.2%) of nurses reported significant prevention knowledge and treatment skills about COVID-19, while 7.6% had little knowledge about prevention. More than half of the nurses (60.4%) had high positive attitudes toward caring for COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, female nurses, married nurses, and bachelor's degree nurses had greater awareness, better attitude, and prevention clinical experience towards COVID-19. Meanwhile, non-Saudi nurses had higher self-reported awareness, positive attitudes, optimal prevention, and positive perceptions compared to Saudi nurses.

Starting from an untrained network, we digitized a few hundred samples and iteratively increased the number of samples by validating initial classification results and adding them to the sample collection. We were able to strike a balance between the need for timely information and the accuracy of the result by combining the output from three different models, each aiming at distinctive types of buildings, in a post-processing workflow. We obtained a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.77 and F 1 score of 0.78, and were able to deliver first results in only 10 days after the initial request.

Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. We estimate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 y for 2020, for the total US population and by race and ethnicity, using four scenarios of deaths-one in which the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred and three including COVID-19 mortality projections produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Our medium estimate indicates a reduction in US life expectancy at birth of 1.13 y to 77.48 y, lower than any year since 2003. We also project a 0.87-y reduction in life expectancy at age 65 y. The Black and Latino populations are estimated to experience declines in life expectancy at birth of 2.10 and 3.05 y, respectively, both of which are several times the 0.68-y reduction for Whites. These projections imply an increase of nearly 40% in the Black-White life expectancy gap, from 3.6 y to over 5 y, thereby eliminating progress made in reducing this differential since 2006. Latinos, who have consistently experienced lower mortality than Whites (a phenomenon known as the Latino or Hispanic paradox), would see their more than 3-y survival advantage reduced to less than 1 y.","Andrasfay, Theresa; Goldman, Noreen",Proc.

Prediction accuracy was analyzed following fivefold cross validation, where ~ 63-71% of AUC-ROC and ~ 69-76% of AUC-PR were observed. While evaluated with independent test set, > 50% localizations were found to be correctly predicted. Besides, the developed computational model achieved higher accuracy than the existing methods.

Here, an experimental set-up is used to study transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through the air between ferrets over more than a meter distance. Both viruses cause a robust productive respiratory tract infection resulting in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two of four indirect recipient ferrets and SARS-CoV to all four. A control pandemic A/H1N1 influenza virus also transmits efficiently. Serological assays confirm all virus transmission events. Although the experiments do not discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets and fomites, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious while traveling through the air. Efficient virus transmission between ferrets is in agreement with frequent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms.

We, as the EMERGE (EMErging RheumatoloGists and rEsearchers) group of PReS (Pediatric Rheumatology European Society) analyzed how the pandemic has affected pediatric rheumatology practice. METHODS: An online survey was developed to assess changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the pandemic. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From 70 countries, 493 pediatric rheumatologists (80.3% in pediatric rheumatology practice for &#8805;5 years) responded to the survey. Around 70% disagreed that the pandemic led to reduced prescription of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Almost half were more likely to taper corticosteroids faster. One-fifth hesitated to switch the major immunosuppressant during a flare. Patients encountering difficulties obtaining hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab due to shortages were noted by 192 (38.9%) and 44 (8.9%), respectively. Twenty to 30% indicated that their patients had experienced a flare or delay in diagnosis/intervention due to postponed appointments.53% mentioned use of phone calls/smartphone applications while 47% shifted towards video consultations for patient care. Respondents indicated an increased number of patients with Kawasaki disease (30%), macrophage activation syndrome (15.6%), unusual vasculitic rashes (31.4%), and hyperinflammation (33.5%) during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This is the largest survey to date addressing changes in pediatric rheumatology practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary changes were due to delays in clinic appointments, increase in use of virtual technologies, and concerns about the use of immunosuppressive therapies.

DESIGN: Population-based retrospective observational study. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: People with a cervix age of 21-69 years who completed at least one cervical screening cytology test, colposcopy or treatment procedure for cervical dysplasia between January 2019 and August 2020. METHODS: Administrative databases were used to compare cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment procedure volumes before (historical comparator) and during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-August 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in cervical screening cytology, colposcopy and treatment volumes; individuals with high-grade cytology awaiting colposcopy. RESULTS: During the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the monthly average number of cervical screening cytology tests, colposcopies and treatments decreased by 63.8% (range: -92.3 to -41.0%), 39.7% (range: -75.1 to -14.3%) and 31.1% (range: -43.5 to -23.6%), respectively, when compared with the corresponding months in 2019. Between March and August 2020, on average 292 (-51.0%) fewer high-grade cytological abnormalities were detected through screening each month.

As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. Hence, we performed a retrospective cohort study to identify predictors of both infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls. Adjusted Odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) were assessed. Over a two-month study period, we diagnosed 80 COVID-19, 61 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases eligible to multivariate analysis. Among these, we identified delayed presentation (>3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.39), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95%CI 2.21-6.55) and anosmia (OR 7.80, 95%CI 4.20-14.49) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.17, 95%CI 2.69-14.14), headache (OR 5.03, 95%CI 1.88-13.44) and retro-orbital pain (OR 5.55, 95%CI 2.51-12.28) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.09-0.79) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were associated with OFIs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates. At clinical presentation, nine basic clinical and epidemiological indicators may help to distinguish COVID-19 or dengue from each other and other febrile illnesses.","Joubert, Antoine; Andry, Fanny; Bertolotti, Antoine; Accot, Frédéric; Koumar, Yatrika; Legrand, Florian; Poubeau, Patrice; Manaquin, Rodolphe; Gérardin, Patrick; Levin, Cécile",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,537,6

Employing multiple bioinformatics and computational pipelines on transcriptome data from primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) during SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed activation of several mechanistic networks, including those involved in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and interferon lambda (IFNL) in host cells. Induction of acute inflammatory response and activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was prominent in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells. Additionally, disease and functional analysis employing ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) revealed activation of functional categories related to cell death, while those associated with viral infection and replication were suppressed. Several interferon (IFN) responsive gene targets (IRF9, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, MX1, OAS2, OAS3, IFI44 and IFI44L) were highly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected NBHE cell, implying activation of antiviral IFN innate response. Gene ontology and functional annotation of differently expressed genes in patient lung tissues with COVID-19 revealed activation of antiviral response as the hallmark. Mechanistic network analysis in IPA identified 14 common activated, and 9 common suppressed networks in patient tissue, as well as in the NHBE cell model, suggesting a plausible role for these upstream regulator networks in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Our data revealed expression of several viral proteins in vitro and in patient-derived tissue, while several host-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. Our data highlights activation of IFN response as the main hallmark associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in human, and identified several differentially expressed lncRNAs during the course of infection, which could serve as disease biomarkers, while their precise role in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated.","Vishnubalaji, Radhakrishnan; Shaath, Hibah; Alajez, Nehad M",,537,12

Here, we test the possibility that the multivalent RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein (N) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) condenses with RNA via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that N protein can be recruited in phase-separated forms of human RNA-binding proteins associated with SG formation. Robust LLPS with RNA requires two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), the N-terminal IDR and central-linker IDR, as well as the folded C-terminal oligomerization domain, while the folded N-terminal domain and the C-terminal IDR are not required. N protein phase separation is induced by addition of non-specific RNA. In addition, N partitions in vitro into phase-separated forms of full-length human hnRNPs (TDP-43, FUS, hnRNPA2) and their low-complexity domains (LCs).

Asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood. Disruption of dental services continues with significantly reduced capacity. Ongoing precautions include preappointment and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centers across Scotland invited asymptomatic-screened patients aged over 5 y to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardized Viral Transport Medium-containing test kits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/email with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. Over a 13-wk period (from August 3, 2020, to October 31, 2020), 4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these, 22 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%-0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing infection prevention control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as health care team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues. Dental settings are a valuable location for public health surveillance.","Conway, D I; Culshaw, S; Edwards, M; Clark, C; Watling, C; Robertson, C; Braid, R; O039,; Keefe, E; McGoldrick, N; Burns, J; Provan, S; VanSteenhouse, H; Hay, J; Gunson, R",J Dent Res,537,16

Excessive inflammation is believed to result in the most severe symptoms and death from this disease. Since treatment options for patients with severe COVID-19 related pulmonary symptoms remain limited, whole-lung low-dose radiotherapy is being evaluated as an anti-inflammatory modality. However, there is concern about the long-term risks associated with low-dose pulmonary irradiation. To help quantify the benefit-risk balance of low-dose radiotherapy for COVID-19, we estimated radiation-induced lifetime risks of both lung cancer and heart disease (major coronary events) for patients of different sexes, treated at ages 50 to 85, with and without other relevant risk factors (cigarette smoking and baseline heart disease risk). METHODS AND MATERIALS: These estimates were generated by combining state-of-the-art radiation risk models for lung cancer and for heart disease together with background lung cancer and heart disease risks, and age/sex-dependent survival probabilities for the US population. RESULTS: Estimated absolute radiation-induced risks were generally higher for lung cancer as compared to major coronary events. The highest estimated lifetime radiation-induced lung cancer risks were approximately 6% for female smokers treated between ages 50 and 60. The highest estimated radiation-induced heart disease risks were approximately 3% for males or females with high heart disease risk factors and treated between ages 50 and 60. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated summed lifetime risk of lung cancer and major coronary events reached up to 9% in patients with high baseline risk factors. Predicted lung cancer and heart disease risks were lowest in older non-smoking patients and patients with few cardiac risk factors. These long-term risk estimates, along with consideration of possible acute reactions, should be useful in assessing the benefit-risk balance for low dose radiotherapy to treat severe COVID-19 pulmonary symptoms, and suggest that background risk factors, particularly smoking, should be taken into account in such assessments.","Shuryak, Igor; Kachnic, Lisa A; Brenner, David J",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,537,24

The aim of this review is to show the possible associations between COVID-19 and heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). RECENT FINDINGS: In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the prevalence of HFpEF is high, ranging from 4 to 16%, probably due to the shared cardio-metabolic risk profile. Indeed, comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and chronic kidney disease - known predictors of a severe course of COVID-19 - are major causes of HFpEF, too. COVID-19 may represent a precipitating factor leading to acute decompensation of HF in patients with known HFpEF and in those with subclinical diastolic dysfunction, which becomes overt. COVID-19 may also directly or indirectly affect the heart. In otherwise healthy patients, echocardiographic studies showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients present diastolic (rather than systolic) impairment, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. Such abnormalities are observed both in the acute or subacute phase of COVID-19. Cardiac magnetic resonance reveals myocardial inflammation and fibrosis in up to the 78% of patients in the chronic phase of the disease. These findings suggest that COVID-19 might be a novel independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF, through the activation of a systemic pro-inflammatory state. Follow-up studies are urgently needed to better understand long-term sequelae of COVID-19 inflammatory cardiomyopathy.","Zaccone, Gregorio; Tomasoni, Daniela; Italia, Leonardo; Lombardi, Carlo Mario; Metra, Marco",Curr Heart Fail Rep,537,18

Studying patient flow in a hospital is particularly fundamental as it demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of a hospital. Since hospital is a collection of physically nearby services under one administration, its performance and outcome are shaped by the interaction of its discrete components. Coordination of processes at different levels of organizational structure of a hospital can be studied using network analysis. Hence, this article presents a data-driven static and temporal network of departments. Both networks are directed and weighted and constructed using seven years' (2010-2016) empirical data of 24902 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The ties reflect an episode-based transfer of ACS patients from department to department in a hospital. The weight represents the number of patients transferred among departments. As a result, the underlying structure of a network of departments that deliver healthcare for ACS patients is described, the main departments and their role in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients are identified, the role of departments over seven years is analyzed and communities of departments are discovered. The results of this study may help hospital administration to effectively organize and manage the coordination of departments based on their significance, strategic positioning and role in the diagnosis and treatment process which, in turn, nurtures value-based and precision healthcare.","Abuhay, Tesfamariam M; Getinet, Yemisrach G; Metsker, Oleg G; Yakovlev, Alexey N; Kovalchuk, Sergey V",,537,20

The virus is primarily associated with flu-like symptoms but can also lead to severe pathologies and death. We here present an ordinary differential equation model of the intrahost immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, fitted to experimental data gleaned from rhesus macaques. The model is calibrated to data from a nonlethal infection, but the model can replicate behavior from various lethal scenarios as well. We evaluate the sensitivity of the model to biologically relevant parameters governing the strength and efficacy of the immune response. We also simulate the effect of both anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs on the host immune response and demonstrate the ability of the model to lessen the severity of a formerly lethal infection with the addition of the appropriately calibrated drug. Our model emphasizes the importance of tight control of the innate immune response for host survival and viral clearance.","Mochan, Ericka; Sego, T J; Gaona, Lauren; Rial, Emmaline; Ermentrout, G Bard",Bull Math Biol,537,33

Current Evidence and Clinical Perspectives,12.134813,10.695196,2021,"Aerosol transmission has been a pathway for virus spread for many viruses. Similarly, emerging evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2, and the resulting pandemic as declared by WHO in March 2020, determined aerosol transmission for SARS-CoV-2 to be significant. As such, public health officials and professionals have sought data regarding the effect of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) features to control and mitigate viruses, particularly coronaviruses. A systematic review was conducted using international standards to identify and comprehensively synthesize research examining the effectiveness of ventilation for mitigating transmission of coronaviruses. The results from 32 relevant studies showed that: increased ventilation rate was associated with decreased transmission, transmission probability/risk, infection probability/risk, droplet persistence, virus concentration, and increased virus removal and virus particle removal efficiency; increased ventilation rate decreased risk at longer exposure times; some ventilation was better than no ventilation; airflow patterns affected transmission; ventilation feature (e.g., supply/exhaust, fans) placement influenced particle distribution. Some studies provided qualitative recommendations; however, few provided specific quantitative ventilation parameters suggesting a significant gap in current research. Adapting HVAC ventilation systems to mitigate virus transmission is not a one-solution-fits-all approach but instead requires consideration of factors such as ventilation rate, airflow patterns, air balancing, occupancy, and feature placement. Practical ImplicationsIncreasing ventilation, whether through ventilation rates (ACH, m3/h, m3/min, L/min) or as determined by CO2 levels (ppm), is associated with decreased transmission, transmission probability/risk, infection probability/risk, droplet persistence, and virus concentration, and increased virus removal and efficiency of virus particle removal. As well, professionals should consider the fact that changing ventilation rate or using mixing ventilation is not always the only way to mitigate and control viruses as varying airflow patterns and the use of ventilation resulted in better outcomes than situations without ventilation. Practitioners also need to consider occupancy, ventilation feature (supply/exhaust and fans) placement, and exposure time in conjunction with both ventilation rates and airflow patterns. Some recommendations with quantified data were made, including using an air change rate of 9 h-1 for a hospital ward; waiting six air changes or 2.5 hours before allowing different individuals into an unfiltered office with [~]2 fresh air changes (FCH) and one air change for a high-efficiency MERV or HEPA filtered laboratory; and using a pressure difference between -2 and -25 Pa in negative pressure isolation spaces. Other recommendations for practice included using or increasing ventilation, introducing fresh air, using maximum supply rates, avoiding poorly ventilated spaces, assessing fan placement and potentially increasing ventilation locations, and employing ventilation testing and air balancing checks.","Thornton, Gail M.; Fleck, Brian A; Kroeker, Emily; Dandnayak, Dhyey; Fleck, Natalie; Zhong, Lexuan; Hartling, Lisa A",,537,24

This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the combined risk of requiring admission to ICU and/or receiving mechanical ventilation for people with asthma (RR = 0.87 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.19) and risk of death from COVID-19 (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.68-1.10; p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest that the prevalence of people with asthma among COVID-19 patients is similar to the global prevalence of asthma. The overall findings suggest that people with asthma have a lower risk than those without asthma for acquiring COVID-19 and have similar clinical outcomes.","Sunjaya, Anthony P; Allida, Sabine M; Di Tanna, Gian Luca; Jenkins, Christine",J Asthma,537,16

The model contains three free parameters, the initial reproduction number, the intervention strength, and the response delay relative to the time of infection. The NPI response is modeled by assuming that the rate of change of the reproduction number is proportional to the negative deviation of the incidence rate from an intervention threshold. This delay dynamical system exhibits damped oscillations in one part of the parameter space, and growing oscillations in another, and these are separated by a surface where the solution is a strictly periodic nonlinear oscillation. For parameters relevant for the COVID-19 pandemic, the tipping transition from damped to growing oscillations occurs for response delays of the order of one week, and suggests that effective control and mitigation of successive epidemic waves cannot be achieved unless NPIs are implemented in a precautionary manner, rather than merely as a response to the present incidence rate.","Rypdal, Kristoffer",,537,26

The reported results were controversial, so the objective of the present study is to assess the relationship between different blood groups and the onset and mortality of COVID-19 infection using meta-analysis method. Methods: We searched the databases using appropriate MeSH terms. We screened articles on the basis of titles, abstracts, and full texts, and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Quality assessment was done with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale checklist. The estimated frequency of COVID-19 infection and death in terms of ABO blood group and the overall estimate of the odd ratio between blood group with COVID-19 infection and death was done with 95% confidence interval. Results: The pooled frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among COVID-19 infected individuals was estimated as 36.22%, 24.99%, 29.67%, and 9.29% respectively. The frequency of blood groups A, B, O, and AB among the dead cases due to COVID-19 infection was estimated as 40%, 23%, 29%, and 8% respectively.

Although a minority (27.5%) of participants reported being comfortable attending a CSV during the COVID-19 pandemic, multivariable ordinal logistic regression found that willingness was higher among participants who had taken the survey later in the pandemic (aOR = 2.90, CI95% 1.90 to 4.43), who attended CSV at higher frequencies (aOR = 1.94, CI95% 1.26 to 2.99), who used substances at CSV (aOR = 1.98, CI95% 1.22 to 3.23), and who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies (aOR = 2.27, CI95% 1.17 to 4.39). In open survey answers, participants described reasons for or against attending CSV during the pandemic, as well as risk reduction strategies that would make them more comfortable attending (e.g., screening for test results, doing temperature checks, holding outdoor events, or restricting events to lower risk sexual practices). SGM individuals who attend CSV might be at increased risk for COVID-19. Public health officials should provide CSV organizers and attendees with guidelines on how to prevent or minimize transmission risk in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19.","Meunier, Étienne; Sundelson, Anne E; Tellone, Stephen; Alohan, Daniel; Fisher, Celia B; Grov, Christian",J. urban health,537,1

In this case series, we describe characteristics and outcomes of racially and ethnically diverse patients tested for and hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York City's public hospital system. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic health records of all patients who received a SARS-CoV-2 test between March 5 and April 9, 2020, with follow up through April 16, 2020. The primary outcomes were a positive test, hospitalization, and death. Demographics and comorbidities were also assessed. RESULTS: 22254 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2. 13442 (61%) were positive; among those, the median age was 52.7 years (interquartile range [IQR] 39.5-64.5), 7481 (56%) were male, 3518 (26%) were Black, and 4593 (34%) were Hispanic. Nearly half (4669, 46%) had at least one chronic disease (27% diabetes, 30% hypertension, and 21% cardiovascular disease). Of those testing positive, 6248 (46%) were hospitalized. The median age was 61.6 years (IQR 49.7-72.9); 3851 (62%) were male, 1950 (31%) were Black, and 2102 (34%) were Hispanic. More than half (3269, 53%) had at least one chronic disease (33% diabetes, 37% hypertension, 24% cardiovascular disease, 11% chronic kidney disease). 1724 (28%) hospitalized patients died. The median age was 71.0 years (IQR 60.0, 80.9); 1087 (63%) were male, 506 (29%) were Black, and 528 (31%) were Hispanic. Chronic diseases were common (35% diabetes, 37% hypertension, 28% cardiovascular disease, 15% chronic kidney disease). Male sex, older age, diabetes, cardiac history, and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with testing positive, hospitalization, and death. Racial/ethnic disparities were observed across all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This is the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse case series of patients tested and hospitalized for COVID-19 in New York City to date. Our findings highlight disparities in outcomes that can inform prevention and testing recommendations.","Kalyanaraman Marcello, Roopa; Dolle, Johanna; Grami, Sheila; Adule, Richard; Li, Zeyu; Tatem, Kathleen; Anyaogu, Chinyere; Apfelroth, Stephen; Ayinla, Raji; Boma, Noella; Brady, Terence; Cosme-Thormann, Braulio F; Costarella, Roseann; Ford, Kenra; Gaither, Kecia; Jacobson, Jessica; Kanter, Marc; Kessler, Stuart; Kristal, Ross B; Lieber, Joseph J; Mukherjee, Vikramjit; Rizzo, Vincent; Rowell, Madden; Stevens, David; Sydney, Elana; Wallach, Andrew; Chokshi, Dave A; Davis, Nichola",PLoS One,537,29

The synthesis process involved the addition of AgNO3 solution (1 mM) and color change of the extract from light brown to dark, confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles. Further, the characterization of synthesized So-AgNPs were done using different spectroscopical and microscopical techniques. FTIR spectra of So-AgNPs indicated vibrational peaks of polyphenolic hydroxyl groups, which are responsible for the stabilization of nanoformulation. Others microscopy methods such as SEM, TEM, XRD, and EDX illustrated that the synthesized So-AgNPs consist irregular size, spherical shape and thoroughly dispersed above the plane. Anticancer evaluation illustrated that the So-AgNPs have dose dependent anti-breast and anti-hepatic cancer activity (range of 97.72 ± 0.42 – 54.86 ± 0.46 % cell viability), which were noticed more effective than raw fruit extract of Scindapsus Officinalis.

Such loss could be prevented if there were a serologic assay for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for serological surveillance of its infection at the early stage of disease. METHODS: Using Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell-expressed full-length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein as capturing antigen, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/SARS-CoV-2 S1 serology enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit was developed and validated with negative samples collected prior to the outbreak or during the outbreak and positive samples from patients confirmed with COVID-19. RESULTS: The specificity of the ELISA kit was 97.5%, as examined against total 412 normal human samples. The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and 1 of 5 nucleic acid test-negative ""close contacts"" of COVID-19 patients.

Tracheostomy insertion has often been delayed and the enduring effects of this on voice, swallow, and airway outcomes in COVID-19 tracheostomy patients are unknown. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess these outcomes in this patient cohort following hospital discharge. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients who had undergone tracheostomy insertion, and were subsequently decannulated, were identified at our institution and followed up 2 months post-discharge. Patient-reported (PROMS) and clinician-reported outcome measures, endoscopic examination, and spirometry were used to assess voice, swallow, and airway outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study with a mean age of 56 years and male:female ratio of 28:13. Average duration of endotracheal intubation was 24 days and 63.4% of tracheostomies were performed at day 21 to 35 of intubation. 53.7% had an abnormal GRBAS score and 30% reported abnormal swallow on EAT-10 questionnaire. 81.1% had normal endoscopic examination of the larynx, however, positive endoscopic findings correlated with the patient self-reported VHI-10 (P = .036) and EAT-10 scores (P = .027). 22.5% had spirometric evidence of fixed upper airway obstruction using the Expiratory-Disproportion Index (EDI) and Spearman correlation analysis showed a positive trend between abnormal endoscopic findings and EDI scores over 50 (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this study reveal a high incidence of laryngeal injury among patients who underwent intubation and tracheostomy insertion during the COVID-19 pandemic. As these patients continue to be followed up, the evolution of these complications will be studied. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.

Overall, 96â¯268 articles were screened and 78 articles met inclusion criteria with outcomes in surface contamination, stability, and disinfection. Surface contamination was assessed on 3343 surfaces using presence/absence methods. Laboratories had the highest percent positive surfaces (21%, n = 83), followed by patient-room healthcare facility surfaces (17%, n = 1170), non-COVID-patient-room healthcare facility surfaces (12%, n = 1429), and household surfaces (3%, n = 161). Surface stability was assessed using infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 survived on stainless steel, plastic, and nitrile for half-life 2.3-17.9 h. Half-life decreased with temperature and humidity increases, and was unvaried by surface type. Ten surface disinfection tests with SARS-CoV-2, and 15 tests with surrogates, indicated sunlight, ultraviolet light, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite attain 99.9% reduction. Overall there was (1) an inability to align SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces with survivability data and effective surface disinfection methods for these surfaces; (2) a knowledge gap on fomite contribution to SARS-COV-2 transmission; (3) a need for testing method standardization to ensure data comparability; and (4) a need for research on hygiene interventions besides surfaces, particularly handwashing, to continue developing recommendations for interrupting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Bedrosian, Noah; Mitchell, Elizabeth; Rohm, Elsa; Rothe, Miguel; Kelly, Christine; String, Gabrielle; Lantagne, Daniele",Environ. sci. technol,537,21

Aim: To investigate individual risk behaviour levels with respect to local COVID-19 infection levels. Methods: A longitudinal field study recorded behaviours of individuals leaving medical facilities following the New York State's PAUSE order. A subset of that data was analysed herein (4793 records, 16 facilities, 23rd March-17th May 2020). Touched objects and transportation choices were compared over time using Chi-squared tests (P<0.05 significance threshold). Findings: Over 8 weeks, touching decreased progressively but for-hire vehicle usage (e.g. taxis) increased. In Week 1, 60.4% of subjects touched at least one environmental object [e.g. building door handle (21.8%); traffic light, railing or parking meter (5.6%)]; shared object (19.7%, e.g. vehicle door handle); personal object (13.9%, e.g. mobile phone); or themselves (0.7%). Certain touch points, however, remained throughout the study period. The use of public transportation remained steady (approximately 20%) throughout the study period; for-hire vehicle usage increased from 0% in Week 1-7% in Week 8, mirroring a 7% decrease in the use of personal vehicles (from 34% to 27%).

Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) overactivity has also been described in metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, conditions shared by women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) We hypothesized that RAS overactivity may be present in PCOS. Methods: We determined plasma levels of RAS-related proteins in a cohort of age matched control women (n=97) and women with PCOS (n=146). Plasma levels of RAS-related proteins (ACE2, Renin and Angiotensinogen (AGT)) were determined by Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement. Results: PCOS women had a higher BMI (p<0.001), systolic (p<0.0001) and diastolic (p<0.05) blood pressure, waist circumference (p<0.0001), testosterone (p<0.0001), free androgen index (p<0.0001) and CRP (p<0.0001). Renin was elevated in PCOS (p<0.05) and angiotensinogen was lower in PCOS (p<0.05), indicating overactivity of the RAS system in PCOS. ACE2 levels were lower in PCOS (p<0.05), suggesting that PCOS women are at risk for development of hypertension. Conclusion: RAS proteins levels differed between PCOS and control women, suggesting that the insulin resistance inherent in PCOS may predispose these women to more severe COVID-19 infection.","Moin, Abu Saleh Md; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Atkin, Stephen L; Butler, Alexandra E",Metabol Open,537,16

Recent reports suggest an association with use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for coronaviruses. Higher ACE2 concentrations might lead to increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 in patients on RAAS inhibitors. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured ACE2 concentrations in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure (index cohort). Results were validated in 1123 men and 575 women (validation cohort).The median age was 69 years for men and 75 years for women. The strongest predictor of elevated concentrations of ACE2 in both cohorts was male sex (estimate = 0.26, P < 0.001; and 0.19, P < 0.001, respectively). In the index cohort, use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE inhibitor (estimate = -0.17, P = 0.002) and ARB use (estimate = -0.15, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, while use of an MRA (estimate = 0.11, P = 0.04) was an independent predictor of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. CONCLUSION: In two independent cohorts of patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations.","Sama, Iziah E; Ravera, Alice; Santema, Bernadet T; van Goor, Harry; Ter Maaten, Jozine M; Cleland, John G F; Rienstra, Michiel; Friedrich, Alex W; Samani, Nilesh J; Ng, Leong L; Dickstein, Kenneth; Lang, Chim C; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Anker, Stefan D; Ponikowski, Piotr; Metra, Marco; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J; Voors, Adriaan A",Eur Heart J,537,32

As this topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines, there is a need to synthesize and categorize these diverse contributions to inspire future investigations of emerging or under-researched substantive areas. This article addresses this need by reviewing existing research on supply chain transparency and offers an integrated understanding of this growing literature. By analyzing a sample of over 300 peer-reviewed articles through bibliometric and automated text mining methods, we identify six distinct clusters that represent substantive literature subdomains: transparency technologies, knowledge integration, governance, sustainability, traceability, and resilience. Building on these structured analyses, we develop a literature framework to comprehensively organize insights from these clusters and illustrate the conceptual relationships between transparency management systems, transparency vehicles, and transparency outcomes. By providing a holistic examination of how supply chain transparency is enabled, our framework aids researchers’ future studies and guides practitioners’ strategies to identify, diagnose, and address modern challenges that face supply chains (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, workplace exploitation, increased third-party scrutiny).","Montecchi, Matteo Plangger Kirk West Douglas",International Journal of Production Economics,537,30

Despite the high prevalence of the disease, it has currently no definitive treatment. We here reported the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in severely ill COVID-19 patients diagnosed based on PCR and radiology tests. CASE PRESENTATION: Five severely ill COVID-19 patients in whom standard treatments failed were administrated with IVIG which prevented the deterioration of clinical symptoms. All the patients were treated with high-dose IVIG (0.3-0.5 g/kg) for 5 consecutive days so that no patient would receive lower than 25 g of the drug. All the patients showed a desirable therapeutic response and were discharged from the hospital with a stable clinical condition after being recovered. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IVIG at the therapeutic dose of 0.3-0.5 g/kg can improve the clinical condition and O2 saturation and prevent the progression of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms in whom standard treatments have failed.","Mohtadi, Negar; Ghaysouri, Abas; Shirazi, Samira; Shafiee, Elham; Bastani, Elham; Kokhazadeh, Taleb; Tavan, Hamed",Virology,537,16

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of 4 mg and 2 mg of baricitinib in combination with background topical corticosteroid (TCS) therapy in adults with moderate to severe AD who previously had an inadequate response to TCS therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomized clinical trial, BREEZE-AD7 (Study of Baricitinib [LY3009104] in Combination With Topical Corticosteroids in Adults With Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis) was conducted from November 16, 2018, to August 22, 2019, at 68 centers across 10 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Patients 18 years or older with moderate to severe AD and an inadequate response to TCSs were included. After completing the study, patients were followed up for up to 4 weeks or enrolled in a long-term extension study. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 2 mg of baricitinib once daily (n = 109), 4 mg of baricitinib once daily (n = 111), or placebo (n = 109) for 16 weeks. The use of low-to-moderate potency TCSs was allowed. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear), with a 2-point or greater improvement from baseline at week 16. Results: Among 329 patients (mean [SD] age, 33.8 [12.4] years; 216 [66%] male), at week 16, a vIGA-AD score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) was achieved by 34 patients (31%) receiving 4 mg of baricitinib and 26 (24%) receiving 2 mg of baricitinib compared with 16 (15%) receiving placebo (odds ratio vs placebo, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.4-5.6]; P = .004 for the 4-mg group; 1.9 [95% CI, 0.9-3.9]; P = .08 for the 2-mg group). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 64 of 111 patients (58%) in the 4-mg group, 61 of 109 patients (56%) in the 2-mg group, and 41 of 108 patients (38%) in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 4 patients (4%) in the 4-mg group, 2 (2%) in the 2-mg group, and 4 (4%) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, and folliculitis. Conclusions and Relevance: A dose of 4 mg of baricitinib in combination with background TCS therapy significantly improved the signs and symptoms of moderate to severe AD, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of baricitinib in AD.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.","Islam, Ariful; Sayeed, Md Abu; Rahman, Md Kaisar; Zamil, Shafayat; Abedin, Josefina; Saha, Otun; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul",Infect Genet Evol,537,20

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a wait-list for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting the accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six studies totaling 16 149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity compared to single genes (80.8% [75.1%, 85.4%] vs. 57.8% [52.3%, 63.1%]) with no significant decrease in specificity (87.8% [84.1%, 90.7%] vs. 92.1% [90.4%, 93.5%]). The most accurate single gene was found to be SDC2 with a sensitivity of 83.1% (72.6%, 90.2%) and a specificity of 91.2% (88.6%, 93.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Stool DNA methylation tests have high specificity (92%) with relatively lower sensitivity (81%). Combining genes increases sensitivity compared to single gene tests. The single most accurate gene is SDC2, which should be considered for further research.","Gachabayov, Mahir; Lebovics, Edward; Rojas, Aram; Felsenreich, Daniel M; Latifi, Rifat; Bergamaschi, Roberto",Colorectal dis,537,1

Here, we show a comprehensive profile of antibody, B cell and T cell dynamics over time in a cohort of patients who have recovered from mild-moderate COVID-19. Binding and neutralising antibody responses, together with individual serum clonotypes, decay over the first 4 months post-infection. A similar decline in Spike-specific CD4+ and circulating T follicular helper frequencies occurs. By contrast, S-specific IgG+ memory B cells consistently accumulate over time, eventually comprising a substantial fraction of circulating the memory B cell pool. Modelling of the concomitant immune kinetics predicts maintenance of serological neutralising activity above a titre of 1:40 in 50% of convalescent participants to 74 days, although there is probably additive protection from B cell and T cell immunity. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 immunity after infection might be transiently protective at a population level. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.","Wheatley, Adam K; Juno, Jennifer A; Wang, Jing J; Selva, Kevin J; Reynaldi, Arnold; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Lee, Wen Shi; Wragg, Kathleen M; Kelly, Hannah G; Esterbauer, Robyn; Davis, Samantha K; Kent, Helen E; Mordant, Francesca L; Schlub, Timothy E; Gordon, David L; Khoury, David S; Subbarao, Kanta; Cromer, Deborah; Gordon, Tom P; Chung, Amy W; Davenport, Miles P; Kent, Stephen J",Nat Commun,537,16

This environment makes the open-system dynamics significant for many quantum tech-nologies, such as entangled-state engineering, quantum simulation, and quantum sensing. The information flow of a system to its environment usually induces a Markovian process, while the backflow of information from the environment exhibits non-Markovianity. The practical environment, usually consisting of a large number of degrees of freedom, is hard to control, despite some attempts on controllable transitions from Markovian to non-Markovian dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the engineering of multiple dissipative channels by controlling the adjacent nuclear spins of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond. With a controllable non-Markovian dynamics of the open system, we observe that the quantum Fisher information flows to and from the environment using different noisy channels. Our work contributes to the developments of both noisy quantum metrology and quantum open systems from the view points of metrologically useful entanglement.","Lu, Yanan; Zhang, Yuran; Liu, Gangqin; Nori, Franco; Fan, Heng; Pan, Xinyu",,537,26

The participants responded to an online questionnaire packet that included socio-demographic information, COVID-19 impact on emotions and on university life, perceived stress (PSS-10) and resilience skills (RS-14). We received 955 responses. The respondents experienced an increase in perceived stress in 89.4% of cases (66% stress moderate and 23.4% high). Moreover, 54.4% of students reported decrease in attention span and difficulty in studying with consequent concern about the exam outcomes (55%). Resilience skills positively affect stressful events and in particular the COVID-19 impact on study and interpersonal relationships. The study shows a psychological impact of the Covid-19 emergency on college students. Stress significantly decreases learning and negatively affects psychological well-being of students. Resilience skills were a protective factor to overcome difficulties learning.","Quintiliani, L.; Sisto, A.; Vicinanza, F.; Curcio, G.; Tambone, V.",Psychology Health &amp; Medicine,537,1

To combat the virus, one of the most dramatic measures was the lockdown of 4 billion people in what is believed to be the largest quasi-quarantine in human history. As a response to the call to study information behavior during a global health crisis, we adopted a resource orchestration perspective to investigate six Chinese families who survived the lockdown. We explored how elderly, young and middle-aged individuals and children resourced information and how they adapted their information behavior to emerging online technologies. Two information resource orchestration practices (information resourcing activities and information behavior adaptation activities) and three mechanisms (online emergence and convergence in community resilience, the overcoming of information flow impediments, and the application of absorptive capacity) were identified in the study.","Pan, Shan L; Cui, Miao; Qian, Jinfang",Int J Inf Manage,537,32

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-seven patients with OCD who attended a specialist OCD Clinic in Barcelona, Spain, were assessed by phone from April 27 to May 25, 2020, during the early phase of the pandemic, using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and a structured interview that collected clinical and sociodemographic information. Results were compared with those for 237 healthy controls from the same geographic area who completed an online survey. RESULTS: Although 65.3% of the patients with OCD described a worsening of their symptoms, only 31.4% had Y-BOCS scores that increased >25%. The risk of getting infected by SARS-CoV2 was reported as a new obsession by 44.8%, but this only became the main obsessive concern in approximately 10% of the patients. Suicide-related thoughts were more frequent among the OCD cohort than among healthy controls. The presence of prepandemic depression, higher Y-BOCS scores, contamination/washing symptoms, and lower perceived social support all predicted a significantly increased risk of OCD worsening. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with OCD appear to be capable of coping with the emotional stress of the COVID-19 outbreak and its consequences during the initial phase of the pandemic. Nevertheless, the current crisis constitutes a risk factor for a significant worsening of symptoms and suicidal ideation. Action is needed to ensure effective and individualized follow-up care for patients with OCD in the COVID-19 era.","Alonso, P; Bertolín, S; Segalàs, J; Tubío-Fungueiriño, M; Real, E; Mar-Barrutia, L; Fernández-Prieto, M; Carvalho, S; Carracedo, A; Menchón, J M",Eur Psychiatry,537,24

The disease was later named as a novel Coronavirus disease or COVID-19. It was then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. As of February 5, 2021, 103 million laboratory-confirmed cases and nearly 2.3 million deaths have been reported globally. The number of death tolls continue to rise, and a large number of countries have been forced to implement social distancing and lockdown. As per literature, Coronavirus is transmitted human to human or human to animal via airborne droplets. Coronavirus enters the human cell through membrane ACE-2 exopeptidase receptor. WHO, ECDC, and ICMR advised to avoid public places and close contact with infected persons and pet animals. To date, there is no evidence of any effective treatment for COVID-19. The main therapies being used to treat the disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, and respiratory therapy. Although several therapies have been proposed, quarantine is the only intervention that appears to be effective in decreasing the contagion rate. We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about the pathogen and the current epidemic. In the present literature review, the causative agents of the pandemic, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis techniques are discussed. Further, currently used treatment and prevention strategies along with vaccine trials and computational tools are all described in detail.","Sharma, Rahul; Khokhar, Dharmendra; Gupta, Bhanushree; Saxena, Purnendu; Ghosh, Kallol Kumar; Geda, Arvind Kumar; Kuca, Kamil",Curr. med. chem,537,24

Regional assessments by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), and independent consultants, have demonstrated various contributory causal factors requiring changes in policy, relationships, and incentives within the dynamic and developing networks. Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) is an approach that encourages sociotechnical systems thinking to optimise the performance of systems that involve human activity. The global supply chain can be considered such a system. However, it has neither been systematically examined from this perspective. METHODS: In 2015, the UK Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors established the Pharmaceutical Sector Group. This unique group is open to all who work in the pharmaceutical sector at any level and in any discipline who share the vision of a pharmaceutical system that places an understanding of HFE at the heart of improving the use of healthcare products throughout their life cycles including their supply chains. RESULTS: For this complex system to work efficiently it is paramount that we have effective coordination and integration between the different elements in the supply chain. HFE can give valuable insights and solutions for developing these complex social-technical systems effectively. CONCLUSION: By partnering with international groups such as Biophorum and Bio Supply Chain Management Alliance, the wish stimulate discussion about how sociotechnical thinking about HFE may help develop better monitoring and investigative techniques to strengthen global supply chains.","Edwards, Brian; Gloor, Charles A; Toussaint, Franck; Guan, Chaofeng; Furniss, Dominic",Int. j. qual. health care,537,26

The performance of commercial serological point-of-care (POC) lateral flow tests are highly manufacturer-dependant. Low sensitivity increases the risk of false negative results and could result in unnecessary quarantine of test persons with developed antibodies. Low specificity increases the risk of false positive results and could lead to false assumptions of immunity.

METHODS: We analyzed national surveillance data to compare incidence of respiratory viruses during 2016-2019 vs. 2020. Results of multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for eight respiratory viruses were included: adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV; non-SARS-CoV-2), human rhinovirus (HRV), human bocavirus (HBoV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). RESULTS: During 2016-2019, rates of detection of respiratory viruses were relatively stable: ADV, 3.7%-9.2%; PIV, 1.4%-17.0%; RSV, 0.3%-15.3%; IFV, 0.4%-35.6%; HCoV, 1.5%-8.4%; HRV, 7.0%-25.1%; HBoV, 0.6%-6.3%; and HMPV, 0.7%-14.5%. Following implementation of social distancing in February 2020, rates of detection of enveloped viruses (HCoV, HMPV, IFV, PIV and RSV) were significantly reduced by up to 100%. However, non-enveloped viruses (ADV, HRV and HBoV) persisted throughout 2020, and HRV rates in hospitalized patients significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of social distancing for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea, rates of detection of enveloped respiratory viruses decreased significantly, whereas non-enveloped viruses persisted, suggesting that enhanced infection prevention strategies are required to mitigate spread of these viruses.","Park, Sangshin; Michelow, Ian C; Choe, Young June",J. infect. dis,537,16

This study aimed at quantifying the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown in France on nuclear medicine examination volume together with volume of examination cancellation and non-attendance. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the volume of planned examinations from 1 month before to 1 month after the first lockdown in French high-volume nuclear medicine departments (NMD) sharing the same information management system including both university hospitals, UH (n = 7), and cancer centres, CC (n = 2). RESULTS: The study enrolled 31,628 consecutive patients referred for a nuclear medicine examination performed or not (NMEP or NMEnP). The total volume of NMEP significantly dropped by 43.4% between the 4 weeks before and after the starting of the lockdown. The comparison of the percentage of NMEP and NMEnP between UH and CC is significantly different (p < 0.001). The percentage of NMEP during the study was 67.9% in UH vs 84.7% in CC. Percentages of NMEnP in UH and CC were due respectively to cancellation by the patient (14.9 vs 7.4%), cancellation by the NMD (9.5 vs 3.4%), cancellation by the referring physician (5.1 vs 4.4%) and non-attender patients (2.7 vs 0.2%).

Since VitD is related to the geogen, its promotion effect on zoledronate has regional specificity. AIM: Combining dual-energy X-ray and bone turnover markers (BTM) to explore the VitD level in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Harbin and monitor its effect on the anti-osteoporosis effect of ZOL. METHODS: A total of 120 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) were enrolled .These patients were divided into two groups with 25(OH)D levels = 10ng/ml as a critical point, and each group was randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups). All of the patients were conducted 5 mg ZOL. Then the experimental group was given calcitriol and calcium carbonate, and the control group was only given calcium carbonate. BTM were measured at baseline, 24h, 3 months and 6 months. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD) of bilateral hips (TH BMD) and lumbar spine (LS BMD) at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: The VitD deficiency rates of the patients enrolled were 84.1%. There was an inverse relationship between the baseline level of VitD and the serum levels of P1NP / ß-CTX, (r=-0.452,p=0.00; r=-0.225, p=0.01). Comparing with baseline, the level of serum P1NP,ß-CTX in each group declined significantly after the treatment (P<0.05).

We present a conceptual model to understand the multiple mechanisms through which the economic and public health crises sparked by COVID-19 might increase food insecurity and contribute to poor health outcomes in the short- and long-term. We hypothesize that, in the short-term, increased food insecurity, household economic disruption, household stress, and interruptions in healthcare will contribute to acute chronic disease complications. However, the impact of the pandemic on food security will linger after social-distancing policies are lifted and the health system stabilizes, resulting in increased risk for chronic disease development, morbidity, and mortality among food-insecure households in the long-term. Research is needed to examine the impact of the pandemic-related increase in food insecurity on short- and long-term chronic health outcomes, and to delineate the underlying causal mechanisms. Such research is critical to inform the development of effective programs and policies to address food insecurity and its downstream health impacts during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Leddy, Anna M; Weiser, Sheri D; Palar, Kartika; Seligman, Hilary",Am J Clin Nutr,537,16

The aim is to check whether the relationships the model poses among the various observables are actually found in the data. The study case of the second through the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy is taken. Given its scale invariance, initially the model is tested with reference to the curve of swab-confirmed infectious individuals only. It is found to match the data if the given curve of the {\em removed} (that is healed or deceased) individuals is assumed underestimated by a factor of about 3 together with other related curves. Contextually, the {\em generation time} and the {\em removal period}, as well as the {\em effective reproduction number}, are obtained fitting the SIR equations to the data; the outcomes prove to be in good agreement with those of other works. Then, using knowledge of the proportion of Covid-19 transmissions likely occurring from individuals who didn't develop symptoms, thus mainly undetected, an estimate of the {\em""true numbers""} of the epidemic is obtained, looking also in good agreement with results from other, completely different works.

We evaluated the effect of border closure on the incidence rate of COVID-19 across nine African countries. METHODS: An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess COVID-19 incidence rates in Egypt, Tunisia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa (SA). Data were collected between 14 February and 19 July 2020 from online data repositories. The linear trend and magnitude of change were evaluated using the itsa function with ordinary least-squares regression in Stata with a 7-d deferred interruption point, which allows a period of diffusion post-border closure. RESULTS: Overall, the countries recorded an increase in the incidence rate of COVID-19 after border closure. However, when compared with matched control groups, SA, Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and Kenya showed a higher incidence rate trend. In contrast, Ethiopia, DRC and Tunisia showed a lower trend compared with their controls. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of border closures within African countries had minimal effect on the incidence of COVID-19. The inclusion of other control measures such as enhanced testing capacity and improved surveillance activities will reveal the effectiveness of border closure measures.","Emeto, Theophilus I; Alele, Faith O; Ilesanmi, Olayinka S",Trans.

PM may present independently or concurrently with Pneumoperitoneum (PP) and other manifestation of free air. We present a rare Case of massive PM associated with extensive PP and Subcutaneous Emphysema in a SARSCOVID- 2 patient occurred during spontaneous ventilation in CPAP with face-mask. Description A 53-year-old, previously healthy man was admitted to Hospital after 7 days of fever, cough and fatigue, plus worsening dyspnea in the last two days. The body temperature was 39°C, Heart Rate 115 beats/minute and Respiratory Rate (RR) 28 breaths/minute with normal Blood Pressure (125/75 mmHg). The Oxygen Saturation was 86% despite oxygen supplementation by Ventimask 0.50 FiO2. Chest X-ray showed bilateral patchy opacities and he tested positive for SARS-COVID-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab.Support non-invasive ventilation was started using 10 cmH2O CPAP by total face mask. Despite the ventilatory support and increasing FiO2 till 80%, after 3 days the patient worsened, RR was 32 breaths/minute with visible inspiratory effort and attempt to increase tidal volume. Examination of the head and neck revealed crepitus on palpation. On auscultation heartbeat was inaudible, as well as breath sounds at the apex and parasternal, bilaterally. A total-body CT scan showed a massive PM (25 cm transverse and 8.9 cm anterior-posterior) and PP (Fig.1a). The patient was intubated and transferred to the ICU. Tracheoscopy did not show tear or leakage in the tracheal wall. The patient was put on lung protective ventilation with 6 ml/Kg IBW at 100% FiO2 and zero PEEP. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio was below 100. After 3 days, gas exchange and subcutaneous emphysema did not improved, so a further CT scan was performed, showing persistence of the PM. Thoracic surgery consultation suggested to drain the air by parasternal approach, but we noted that during nursing manoeuvres, rolling left and right, the cardiac tone returned audible. Thus, we put the patient on lateral and prone position alternatively. After 48 hours, the PM resolved completely and gas exchange improved (Fig. 1b). Discussion PM could be a complication of COVID disease due to barotrauma and lung frailty. This Case shows that massive PM can occur during CPAP in COVID patient spontaneously breathing, and it can be treated non invasively. PM resolved quickly by lateral and prone positioning. This Case is a reminder that PM should be excluded if acute deterioration occurs in a COVID-19 patient.","Petrucci, N.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,537,2

With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, new practical questions about their use are emerging. 2: One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time. 3: Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth-death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data.

For individuals with a chronic medical condition, this progression also includes a gradual transition to independence in healthcare management as well as a transfer in care location at some set point. As adolescents navigate these sometimes challenging processes, there is a significant risk for a decline in adequate health behaviors, which can have dire consequences. One of the most vital components of the transfer to adult care is medication adherence. Poor medication adherence puts patients at risk for worse outcomes, with the most profound being increased mortality for many conditions. In recent years, acknowledgment of the need to create evidence-based methods to aid patients during the transition period has been growing. This paper seeks to provide an overview of current research and recommendations for interventions to increase adherence to medication regimens during this period.","Campagna, Bianca R; Weatherley, Kristen; Shemesh, Eyal; Annunziato, Rachel A",,537,21

The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p < 0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the Subspecialised Primary Care Practice that were implemented during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic contributed containment of the pandemic. Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice indicated that physical separation of patients with potential SARS-CoV-2 infection was easier compared to those who continued working in their own practice. Additionally, leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident in dealing with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 16,416 people covering three risk groups was conducted between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. RESULTS: The overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI 26.1-29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5-18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5-13.8). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40 and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19-positive patient were good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic people compared with 47% in asymptomatic people. CONCLUSION: This sentinel-based population survey was the first comprehensive survey in India to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden.

We showed some agents with potentially favorable efficacy, acceptable safety as well as good pharmacokinetic profiles. Several therapies are under assessment to evaluate their efficacy and safety for COVID-19. However, some drugs were withdrawn due to their side effects after demonstrating some clinical efficacy. Indeed, the most effective therapies could be organ function support, convalescent plasma, anticoagulants, and immune as well as antiviral therapies, especially anti-influenza drugs due to the similarities between respiratory viruses regarding viral entry, uncoating, and replication. We encourage giving more attention to favipiravir, remdesivir, and measles vaccine.

We proceeded to a salvage strategy with rituximab and caplacizumab that was rapidly effective to resolve symptoms and hemolysis. It has been already reported a case in which a patient developed severe reactions to fresh-frozen plasma that required discontinuation of PEX. Differently from this case, our patient was already using the less immunogenic pooled plasma units Octaplas, therefore a strategy with caplacizumab was the only available option. Moreover, rituximab is associated with a shorter time to obtain a durable remission in aTTP and a faster time (15 days) to final ADAMTS13 activity recovery >10%.

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on 17 November 2019 with the index case (presymptomatic, yet infectious) in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Methods: We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries, ones which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.","Siwiak, Marian; Szczesny, Pawel; Siwiak, Marlena",PeerJ,537,12

We postulate a dose-response relationship in COVID-19, and that ""the dose of virus in the initial inoculum"" is an important missing link in understanding several incompletely explained observations in COVID-19 as a factor in transmission dynamics and severity of disease. We hypothesize that: (1) Viral dose in inoculum is related to severity of disease, (2) Severity of disease is related to transmission potential, and (3) In certain contexts, chains of severe cases can build up to severe local outbreaks, and large-scale intensive epidemics. Considerable evidence from other infectious diseases substantiates this hypothesis and recent evidence from COVID-19 points in the same direction. We suggest research avenues to validate the hypothesis.

Hospital systems require rapid adaptation to respond to the increased demand for airway management while ensuring high quality patient care and provider safety. There is limited literature detailing successful system-level approaches to adapt to the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring airway management. METHODS: A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. RESULTS: During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. CONCLUSIONS: Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge. The approach that addressed staffing needs prioritized provider protection and enhanced quality and safety monitoring may be adaptable to other institutions.","Walsh, Elisa C; Kwo, Jean; Chang, Marvin G; Pino, Richard M; Bittner, Edward A",J. healthc. qual.

As a step towards understanding these interconnections, we pose a simple game-theoretic model of a global pandemic in which individuals can choose where to live, and we investigate the global behavior that may emerge as a result of individuals reacting locally to the competing costs of isolation and infection. We study the game-theoretic equilibria that emerge from this setup when the population is composed of either selfish or altruistic individuals. First, we demonstrate that as is typical in these types of games, selfish equilibria are in general not optimal, but that all stable selfish equilibria are within a constant factor of optimal. Second, there exist infinitely-many stable altruistic equilibria; all but finitely-many of these are worse than the worst selfish equilibrium, and the social cost of altruistic equilibria is unbounded. Our work is in sharp contrast to recent work in network congestion games in which all altruistic equilibria are socially optimal. This suggests that a population without central coordination may react very poorly to a pandemic, and that individual altruism could even exacerbate the problem.","Brown, Philip N.; Collins, Brandon; Hill, Colton; Barboza, Gia; Hines, Lisa",,537,24

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region SAR (China) recorded its first confirmed cases on 23 January 2020. In this report, we describe a family cluster of 12 confirmed cases, with two additional confirmed cases from secondary transmission. Methods: We reported the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings of the family cluster, as well as the public health measures instituted. Results: All 12 confirmed COVID-19 cases were among the 19 attendees of a three-hour Chinese New Year family dinner consisting of hotpot and barbecue dishes. Environmental sampling of the gathering venue was negative. Two additional confirmed cases, who were co-workers of two confirmed cases, were later identified, indicating secondary transmission. Contact tracing, quarantine and environmental disinfection were instituted to contain further spread. Discussion: Our findings were highly suggestive of a superspreading event during the family gathering. The source was likely one of the cases during the pre-symptomatic phase. The event attested to the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through human-to-human transmission from social activities and argued for the necessity of social distancing in curtailing the disease spread.","Lam, Ho Yeung; Lam, Tsz Sum; Wong, Chi Hong; Lam, Wing Hang; Mei, Emily Leung Chi; Kuen, Yonnie Lam Chau; Wai, Winnie Lau Tin; Hin, Billy Ho Chi; Wong, Ka Hing; Chuang, Shuk Kwan",Western Pac Surveill Response J,537,10

In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemicseven if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease-a notion we call ""digital herd immunity'', which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel ""contact-tracing phase transition'' to an epidemic phase.

This decline in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) revenue may place financial strain on hospitals. Our goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the public interest in elective TJA. METHODS: The Google Search Volume Index (GSVI) identified the terms ""knee replacement,"" ""hip replacement,"" and ""orthopedic surgeon"" as the most common to describe TJA. The term ""elective surgery cancellation"" was also analyzed. Weekly GSVI data were extracted between 04-01-2015 and 04-04-2020. Time series analysis was conducted and state GSVI values were compared with COVID-19 prevalence and unemployment claims. RESULTS: The relative public interest in elective TJA has sharply declined since the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Between 03-01-2020 and 03-29-2020, the popularity of searches for ""knee replacement"", ""hip replacement,"" and ""orthopedic surgeon"" dropped by 62.1%, 52.1%, and 44.3%, respectively. A concurrent spike was observed for the term ""elective surgery cancellation."" California, New Hampshire, Maine, and Nevada showed a low relative rate for TJA searches, and the highest increase in unemployment claims. CONCLUSION: The onset of COVID-19 correlates with declining relative popularity of searches related to elective TJA. Higher volume of COVID-19 cases in certain states may correspond with lower relative search popularity, although this correlation remains unclear. These results portend the possibility of a decline in elective TJA case volume, further straining hospitals. Further research is required to inform stakeholders how best to proceed and determine any sustained effects from the current diminished relative interest in TJA.

Method: Latent Class Analyses (LCA) were used to determine neuropsychological classification in 231 patients referred to general adult neuropsychology services. A clinical rating scale was also used to approximate clinical decision-making. Regression models were constructed in a training sample (n = 127) drawn from an adult neuropsychology clinic using test scores from seven different a priori test battery combinations to predict group membership or clinical rating. The utility of the seven models was assessed in a testing sample (n = 104) from another independent adult neuropsychology clinic. Results: The LCA yielded a two class solution characterized by impaired versus non-impaired performance on neuropsychological tests. A seven test battery provided the best balance of accuracy and length in predicting LCA group with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 90%. Sensitivity and specificity were slightly attenuated using the clinical rating scale as the criterion, but the seven test battery still provided good accuracy (AUC=.906). Conclusions: Test protocols based on only five to eight test scores can accurately identify most patients with clinical impairment in a diverse adult neuropsychology clinic. Development of short protocols with adequate sensitivity and specificity will become increasingly important to address long waiting lists in light of the COVID pandemic against the general backdrop of increasing demand for neuropsychological services.","Kubu, C S; Frazier, T; Lapin, B; Naugle, R",Clin Neuropsychol,537,3

Therefore, the combination of legislation, the judiciary and administration is inevitable. Moreover, public administrations must transform the way they function by using more information and communication technology in order to remain responsive and efficient. This challenge was further revealed during lockdowns in individual countries, which affected their social and economic development. The solution to that challenge is the implementation of e-government in the public sector. It also increases innovation in governance processes as well as efficiency and effectiveness by offering more participative opportunities to citizens. Hence, a mature level of e-government development also arises. Nevertheless, there are significant differences among the levels of e-government development in the EU-28. The aim of this article is to assess the influence of e-government maturity on government effectiveness and efficiency in the EU-28. In order to obtain empirical results, a two-stage least square regression (2SLS) was applied. The empirical results show that e-government maturity positively and significantly contributes to enhancing government effectiveness and efficiency in the EU-28. In addition, the rule of law plays an important role in each stage regression model. Based on the empirical results, we can conclude that e-government is inevitable and should ensure the proper functioning of public administration during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Hodzic, S.; Ravselj, D.; Alibegovic, D.

Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days.

Unlike any other virus, the number of currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history, such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of viral sequences being collected. Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), further demonstrating our approach.","Ali, Sarwan; Tamkanat-E-Ali,; Khan, Muhammad Asad; Khan, Imdadullah; Patterson, Murray",,537,20

Nevertheless, detrimental aspects of the lockdown for older people are a reduction in physical activity and limited access to physiotherapy, which are likely to have a negative impact on the health status. This study examined the feasibility of video-based physiotherapy (VT) and the subjective rating of VT by patients and therapists. METHODS: From April to June 2020, 4 facilities with 9 patients (6 women, 64-82 years old) participated in the study and were provided with technical equipment. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted in eight patients to assess physical activity, functional ability and participation before and during the restrictions. Both patients and therapists were asked about their subjective experiences with VT. RESULTS: A total of 92 VT sessions took place. Performance of the exercises and comprehension of instructions were rated as good to very good. The level of acceptance was high. Of the patients four described a perceived reduction in their physical activities due to the public restrictions; however, in the questionnaires no substantial differences in participation and physical activity were found. DISCUSSION: The use of VT is feasible in older patients. Only minor technical support is needed. In pandemic situations or in other contexts VT appears to be a promising supplement or alternative to normal physiotherapy. Further studies are needed to identify suitable patient groups, to prove efficacy and to develop further content-related aspects of VT.","Happe, Lisa; Lau, Sandra; Koschate, Jessica; Diekmann, Rebecca; Hein, Andreas; Zieschang, Tania",Z.

Challenges of resource allocation frequently lead to ethical concerns of healthcare inequity. To tackle this, such developing nations continually need to implement healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. The COVID-19 pandemic has made significant demands of healthcare systems across the world-to provide equitable healthcare to all, to ensure public health principles are followed, to find novel solutions for previously unencountered healthcare challenges, and to rapidly develop new therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Countries worldwide have struggled to accomplish these demands, especially the latter two, considering that few nations had long-standing systems in place to ensure processes for innovation were on-going before the pandemic struck. The crisis represents a critical juncture to plan for a future. This future needs to incorporate a vision for the implementation of healthcare innovation, coupled with capacity building to ensure new strategies continue to be developed and executed. In this paper, the case of the massive Indian healthcare system is utilized to describe how it could implement this vision. An inclusive, ethically-resilient framework has been broadly laid out for healthcare innovation in the future, thereby ensuring success in both the short- and the long-term.","Ozair, Ahmad; Singh, Kaushal Kishor",Front Public Health,537,1

The different models provide different future projections including upper and lower bounds of scenarios. We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. However for other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak.

In this Article, we present the first effort to map the contours of what administrative law should mean for the Fed, with particular attention to the processes the Fed should follow in determining and announcing legal interpretations and major policy changes. First, we synthesize literature from administrative law and social science to show the advantages that an agency like the Fed can glean from greater openness and transparency in its interpretations of law and in its long-term policymaking processes. These advantages fall into two categories: (1) sending more credible signals of future action and thereby shaping the behavior of regulated parties and other constituents, and (2) increasing the diversity of incoming information on which to base decisions, thereby improving their factual and predictive accuracy. Second, we apply this framework to two key areas monetary policy and emergency lending to show how the Fed can improve its policy signaling and input diversity in the areas of its authority that are most expansive. The result is a positive account of what the Fed already does as an administrative agency and a normative account of what it should do in order to preserve necessary policy flexibility without sacrificing the public demands for policy clarity and rigor.","Conti-Brown, P.; Listokin, Y.; Parrillo, N.

Cancer patients are advised to stay at home in case of potential infection, which may cause delays of routine diagnosis and necessary treatment. How colorectal surgeons should manage this during the epidemic remains a big challenge. The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of routine colorectal surgery during coronavirus disease 2019 and to offer some Chinese recommendations to colorectal surgeons throughout the world. METHODS: A total of 166 patients receiving colorectal surgery from 20 December 2019 to 20 March 2020 at Department of General Surgery in Chinese General Hospital of People's Liberation Army were enrolled, and further divided into two groups based on before or after admission date of 20 January 2020. Clinicopathologic data such as hospital stay and economic data such as total costs were collected and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Longer hospital stay, higher proportion of non-local patients and more hospitalization cost were found in the post-20 January group (special-time group) (P < 0.001; P < 0.05; P < 0.05, respectively). Apart from this, no difference existed with regard to baseline demographical data such as age, sex and height, as well as clinicopathological data such as previous history, surgery time, operation extent and TNM staging.

METHODS: We administered three questionnaires on-line to a convenience sample of the general population from different regions of mainland China from February 1 to February 4, 2020. We used the Mandarin versions of the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We also collected demographic data and other information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing psychological distress. RESULTS: Of 1607 respondents, 1588 returned valid questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Nearly one quarter (22.8%) had high levels of psychological distress (K6 score &#8805; 13). Individuals with higher psychological distress were more likely to be unmarried, spend more than 6 h per day searching for information about COVID-19, more frequently adopt a passive coping style, and report less social support than those with lower psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in China has a great impact on the mental health status of the general population. Active coping strategies and increased social support are significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress, and may serve as the basis for psychological interventions.","Yu, Hua; Li, Mingli; Li, Zhixiong; Xiang, Weiyi; Yuan, Yiwen; Liu, Yaya; Li, Zhe; Xiong, Zhenzhen",BMC Psychiatry,537,1

This mechanism evolved from the ancestor bat coronavirus and is currently one of the main targets for antiviral strategies. However, there currently exist several Spike protein variants in the SARS-CoV-2 population as the result of mutations, and it is unclear if these variants may exert a specific effect on the affinity with ACE2 which, in turn, is also characterized by multiple alleles in the human population. In the current study, the GBPM analysis, originally developed for highlighting host-guest interaction features, has been applied to define the key amino acids responsible for the Spike/ACE2 molecular recognition, using four different crystallographic structures. Then, we intersected these structural results with the current mutational status, based on more than 295,000 sequenced cases, in the SARS-CoV-2 population. We identified several Spike mutations interacting with ACE2 and mutated in at least 20 distinct patients: S477N, N439K, N501Y, Y453F, E484K, K417N, S477I and G476S. Among these, mutation N501Y in particular is one of the events characterizing SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, which has recently risen in frequency in Europe. We also identified five ACE2 rare variants that may affect interaction with Spike and susceptibility to infection: S19P, E37K, M82I, E329G and G352V. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although BMI is widely used as an indicator, it cannot distinguish visceral from subcutaneous fat. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between visceral adiposity, subcutaneous fat, and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using the databases: PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC. Data on visceral fat area (VTA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) were collected. The outcome of interest was severe COVID-19. We used a REML random-effects model to pool the mean differences and odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 5 studies comprising of 539 patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher VTA (mean difference 41.7 cm2 [27.0, 56.4], p < 0.001; I2: 0%) and TFA (mean difference 64.6 cm2 [26.2, 103.1], p = 0.001; I2: 0%). There was no significant difference in terms of SFA between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (mean difference 9.3 cm2 [-4.9, 23.4], p = 0.199; I2: 1.2%). Pooled ORs showed that VTA was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 1.9 [1.1, 2.2], p = 0.002; I2: 49.3%).

With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the health care system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs within an actionable timeframe. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate the expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and in-use ventilators 1 day to 4 weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts Using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool, and we used the model to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions 4 weeks into the future based on current statewide hospitalization rates. The model estimated the number of new admissions that would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected the individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a postprocessing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured that our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground. RESULTS: Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020, showed variable accuracy across time, health care resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0%, while the error in forecasts made in September, a month with low COVID-19 activity, was 39.7%. Across health care use categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than those at the regional level. Although the accuracy declined as the forecast was projected further into the future, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the 3- to 4-week forecast horizon for state-level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilator need and all regional health care resource needs. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.","Castro, Lauren A; Shelley, Courtney D; Osthus, Dave; Michaud, Isaac; Mitchell, Jason; Manore, Carrie A; Del Valle, Sara Y",JMIR Public Health Surveill,537,16

The questionnaire mapped family facilities, parental time and competencies, and parenting Covid practices in helping with learning and communicating with the school. The analysis focused on the question of whether the parents assessed the home education as managed and whether they felt concerned about their child's further school results. At the same time, we understand the parents evaluations as the result of the interaction between technical, educational-relational, and competence conditions in families on the one hand and requirements on the part of schools on the other. The analysis showed that most parents rated home education positively. However, almost a third of the parents gave a negative evaluation, which was mainly related to concerns about the child's school success and feelings of uncertainty resulting from communication with the school. These were mainly parents with lower education, who had less time, technical equipment, and competence to help the child with learning.","Smetáčková, Irena Štech Stanislav",Studia Paedagogica,537,16

The frequency of published news is an indicator of the various levels of a problem. The more attention paid by a newspaper to the community, the more valuable it is in reporting problems. Currently, news related to the COVID-19 outbreak is most popular. The media has been reporting not only on health but also on social and economic issues during the pandemic. The questions of this research are (1) what social issues were reported in the online news media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) what economic issues were reported in the online news media during the same period. This study aims to identify the content of news when conveying COVID-19 pandemic information based on the frequency of appearance and news content based on social and economic issues in online news. This is a descriptive quantitative study using a content analysis approach to obtain primary data from 6,376 online news articles published by Antara News from 28 February to 8 April 2020. The NVivo 12 tool was used to analyse the data by dividing the types of COVID-19 issues related to social and economic issues in the news (in the form of text, images, videos and graphics) as an analysis unit. The results showed that Antara News used text, photos, videos and graphics 1,847 times for social issues and 2,701 times for economic issues related to COVID-19. The social issues involved 20 themes. Some of the important ones included regulations, social funds and charities, the humanities, the availability of infrastructure facilities, education, instruction and appeal, and culture and religion. Meanwhile, the economic issues involved 52 themes. Some of the important ones included exchange rates; transportation; the oil, natural gas and electricity industries; social funds and charities; regulation and policy; agriculture; and the tourism industry. The topics are related to social distancing, social restrictions, social actions, culture, other problems associated with the social sector (a decline in community purchasing power, consumption and dismissal) and the real and massive impact on economic growth. COVID-19 is not only a global health crisis but also a major labour market and economic crisis that has had a significant impact on society.

We examine changes in adult mental health in the UK population before and during the lockdown. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of a national, longitudinal cohort study, households that took part in Waves 8 or 9 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) panel, including all members aged 16 or older in April, 2020, were invited to complete the COVID-19 web survey on April 23-30, 2020. Participants who were unable to make an informed decision as a result of incapacity, or who had unknown postal addresses or addresses abroad were excluded. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to examine temporal trends. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change compared with preceding trends. FINDINGS: Waves 6-9 of the UKHLS had 53â351 participants. Eligible participants for the COVID-19 web survey were from households that took part in Waves 8 or 9, and 17â452 (41·2%) of 42â330 eligible people participated in the web survey. Population prevalence of clinically significant levels of mental distress rose from 18·9% (95% CI 17·8-20·0) in 2018-19 to 27·3% (26·3-28·2) in April, 2020, one month into UK lockdown. Mean GHQ-12 score also increased over this time, from 11·5 (95% CI 11·3-11·6) in 2018-19, to 12·6 (12·5-12·8) in April, 2020. This was 0·48 (95% CI 0·07-0·90) points higher than expected when accounting for previous upward trends between 2014 and 2018. Comparing GHQ-12 scores within individuals, adjusting for time trends and significant predictors of change, increases were greatest in 18-24-year-olds (2·69 points, 95% CI 1·89-3·48), 25-34-year-olds (1·57, 0·96-2·18), women (0·92, 0·50-1·35), and people living with young children (1·45, 0·79-2·12). People employed before the pandemic also averaged a notable increase in GHQ-12 score (0·63, 95% CI 0·20-1·06). INTERPRETATION: By late April, 2020, mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-COVID-19 trends. Policies emphasising the needs of women, young people, and those with preschool aged children are likely to play an important part in preventing future mental illness.

Investigating the prevalence of the symptoms of these disorders during the quarantine due to the coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) is important to outline clinical strategies for patient care. This study assessed the prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and oral behaviors and their associations during the social isolation due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Questionnaires were used to assess TMD symptoms in accordance with the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders: clinical protocol and assessment instruments, a questionnaire to verify oral behaviors and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in students of dentistry at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Brasília in May 2020. Qualitative data were subjected to descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis (p<0.05). The relationship between quantitative and qualitative data was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation (p<0.05). RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, and depression in the participants, resulting in association between gender and anxiety symptoms (p=0.029). There was a positive correlation between oral behaviors and TMD symptoms (r=0.364; p<0.001), between oral behaviors and anxiety symptoms (r=0.312; p=0.001), and between oral behaviors and symptoms of depression (r=0.216; p=0.021).

Previous studies have shown that Eap binds with nanomolar affinity to complement component C4b and prevents C4b binding the pro-protease, C2, thereby inhibiting formation of the pro-C3 convertase shared by the classical and lectin pathways (Woehl et al. in J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014). The C4b-binding and complement-inhibitory properties of Eap from S. aureus strain Mu50 lie within the two C terminal-most Eap domains (i.e. Eap34) (Woehl et al. J Immunol 193:6161-6171, 2014). Interestingly, Eap34 binds C4b with an apparent KD that is nearly 100-fold tighter than that of either Eap3 or Eap4 alone (Woehl et al. in Protein Sci 26:1595-1608, 2017).

The PR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) normally shortens with increasing heart rate (HR). The case of a patient with COVID-19 manifesting Mobitz type 1 atrioventricular (AV) block that normalized as the patient's condition improved prompted us to investigate PR interval behavior in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize PR interval behavior in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and to correlate that behavior with clinical outcomes. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional cohort analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases (March 26, 2020, to April 25, 2020). We reviewed pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 ECGs to characterize AV conduction by calculating the PR interval to HR (PR:HR) slope. Clinical endpoints were death or need for endotracheal intubation. RESULTS: ECGs from 75 patients (246 pre-COVID-19 ECGs and 246 COVID-19 ECGs) were analyzed for PR:HR slope. Of these patients, 38 (50.7%) showed the expected PR interval shortening with increasing HR (negative PR:HR slope), whereas 37 (49.3%) showed either no change (8 with PR:HR slope = 0) or paradoxical PR interval prolongation (29 with positive PR:HR slope) with increasing HR. Patients without PR interval shortening were more likely to die (11/37 [29.7%] vs 3/38 [7.9%]; P = .019) or require endotracheal intubation (16/37 [43.2%] vs 8/38 [21.1%]; P = .05) compared to patients with PR interval shortening. CONCLUSION: Half of patients with COVID-19 showed abnormal PR interval behavior (paradoxical prolongation or lack of shortening) with increasing HR. This finding was associated with increased risk of death and need for endotracheal intubation.","Pavri, Behzad B; Kloo, Juergen; Farzad, Darius; Riley, Joshua M",Heart Rhythm,537,16

Electrotransfer of oligonucleotides was studied in vitro, showing a direct transfer of negatively charged siRNA across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. In vivo, the feasibility of siRNA electrotransfer was demonstrated in different studies and tissues. While effective, electrotransfer of siRNA into 3D tissues still needs to be understood. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of siRNA electrotransfer and assessed its effect in 3D spheroids made of HCT116-GFP cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results indicate that siRNA uptake was not uniform across 3D multicellular spheroids. The electrophoretic migration of nucleic acids upon delivery of unipolar electric field pulses could explain the asymmetry of siRNA uptake. Moreover, a gradient was observed from external layers toward the center, leading to siRNA silencing of GFP positive cells located in the outer rim. While siRNA delivery experiments on spheroids may differ from intratumoral injections, the levels of transfection in spheroids are comparable to levels observed in published studies in vivo. Taken together, our results provide fundamental information about siRNA 3D distribution during electrotransfer, indicating that multicellular spheroids remain a relevant alternative to animal experimentation.","Pelofy, Sandrine; Bousquet, Hugo; Gibot, Laure; Rols, Marie-Pierre; Golzio, Muriel",Bioelectrochemistry,537,1

In this cohort study, an association was blindly computed between physiologically measured anxiety and attention vigilance (collected from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 31 2016) and self-reports of anxiety, mental health aspects, and sleep quality (collected from 20 April to 30 June 2020, and analyzed from 1 July to 1 September 2020), of 91 physicians treating COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. As a priori hypothesized, physicians treating COVID-19 patients showed a relative elevation in both physiological measures of anxiety (95% CI: 2317.69-2453.44 versus 1982.32-2068.46; P < 0.001) and attention vigilance (95% CI: 29.85-34.97 versus 22.84-26.61; P < 0.001), compared with their colleagues treating non-COVID-19 patients. At least 3 months into the pandemic, physicians treating COVID-19 patients reported high anxiety and low quality of sleep. Machine learning showed clustering to the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 subgroups with a high correlation mainly between physiological and self-reported anxiety, and between physiologically measured anxiety and sleep duration.

DESIGN & SETTING: This is a cluster randomised controlled superiority trial comparing collaborative care (PARTNERS2) with usual care, with an internal pilot to assess feasibility. The setting will be primary care within four trial recruitment areas: Birmingham & Solihull, Cornwall, Plymouth, and Somerset. GP practices are randomised 1:1 to either (a) the PARTNERS2 intervention plus modified standard care ('intervention'); or (b) standard care only ('control').

However, the incidence of bleeding, predictors of major bleeding, or the association between bleeding and mortality remain largely unknown. METHODS: We performed a cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that received intermediate- or therapeutic doses of anticoagulants from March 25 to July 22, 2020, to identify those at increased risk for major bleeding. We used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to explore the risk factors associated with major bleeding. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,965 patients were enrolled. Of them, 1,347 (69%) received intermediate- and 618 (31%) therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, with a median duration of 12 days in both groups. During the hospital stay, 112 patients (5.7%) developed major bleeding and 132 (6.7%) had non-major bleeding. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate for major bleeding was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36%-54%) and for non-major bleeding 32% (95%CI: 24%-40%). Multivariate analysis showed increased risk for in-hospital major bleeding associated with D-dimer levels >10 times the upper normal range (hazard ratio [HR], 2.23; 95% CI, 1.38-3.59), ferritin levels >500 ng/mL (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.02-3.95), critical illness (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.14-3.18) and therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.01-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receiving intermediate- or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation, a major bleeding event occurred in 5.7%.

The common clinical features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection included fever, fatigue, and damage to the respiratory or digestive system. However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause damage to the central nervous system (CNS) inducing psychiatric symptoms. CASE REPORT: Herein, we present the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with manic-like symptoms and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the case, focusing on the identifications of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient developed manic-like symptoms when his vital signs recovered on illness day 17. After manic-like attack, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in CSF was positive, while the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on CSF for the SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient received Olanzapine for treatment and his mood problems concurrently improved as indicated by scores of Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS). LIMITATION: This is a single case report only, and the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was not performed simultaneously when SARS-CoV-2 was positive in samples of sputum and stool. CONCLUSION: This first case of COVID-19 patient with manic-like symptoms highlights the importance of evaluation of mental health status and may contribute to our understanding of potential risk of CNS impairments by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lu, Shaojia; Wei, Ning; Jiang, Jiajun; Wu, Lingling; Sheng, Jifang; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Chen, Yu; Zheng, Shufa; Chen, Feng; Liang, Tingbo; Hu, Shaohua",J Affect Disord,537,12

Epidemiological data about sepsis from the 2017 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factor Study showed that the global burden of sepsis was greater than previously estimated. Bacteria have been shown to be the predominant pathogen of sepsis among patients with pathogens detected, while sepsis caused by viruses is underdiagnosed worldwide. The coronavirus disease that emerged in 2019 in China and now in many other countries has brought viral sepsis back into the vision of physicians and researchers worldwide. Although the current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis has improved, the differences between viral and bacterial sepsis at the level of pathophysiology are not well understood. Diagnosis methods that can broadly differentiate between bacterial and viral sepsis at the initial stage after the development of sepsis are limited. New treatments that can be applied at clinics for sepsis are scarce and this situation is not consistent with the growing understanding of pathophysiology.

RECENT FINDINGS: Direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 is not common, and convincing morphologic evidence of substantive kidney infection by SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. Severe COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury is likely multifactorial and results from the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat this illness. COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy (COVAN) is seen almost exclusively in patients with apolipoprotein L1 high-risk genotypes with no evidence of direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: The prevailing evidence does not support substantive or persistent infection of kidneys in COVID-19 and indirect means of tissue injury are favored, although a 'hit and run' model cannot be excluded. COVAN frequently occurs in patients with mild respiratory systems, suggesting that innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide the second hit needed for the development of collapsing glomerulopathy in susceptible individuals.","Smith, Kelly D; Akilesh, Shreeram",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,537,15

This review article summarizes the current evidence by also emphasizing its heterogeneity. Importantly, current evidence suggests that these non-invasive strategies can be successfully used even in case of severe respiratory failure and are, thus, indeed capable of avoiding intubation, and consequently, tube-related complications. In contrast, it also remains to be emphasized that prolonged spontaneous breathing supported by non-invasive treatment strategies is also prone to complications. In particular, late NIV failure is associated with substantially deteriorated outcome, which is suggested to be meaningful in view of NIV failure rates still being high in Germany. Finally, the current article also refers to a parallel article that addresses the discussion being held in the public media in Germany concerning this topic. Here, its textual questionability, but also its negative consequences for both the research community and the general society are elaborated.

Cardiovascular function assessed by flow mediated dilation (FMD) is reduced after sleep deprivation. High-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) improves postprandial FMD. Sleep-deprived individuals may practice HIIE followed by a high-fat breakfast. This study investigated the acute-partial sleep deprivation (APSD) and HIIE interaction on postprandial FMD. METHODS: Fifteen healthy males (age 31 ± 5 years) participated in: (a) reference sleep (~ 9.5 h) with no HIIE (RS), (b) RS and HIIE (RSX), and (c) APSD and HIIE (SSX). HIIE was performed in 3:2 min intervals at 90% and 40% of VO2 reserve. FMD was assessed the night before (D1), the morning of the next day (D2), 1 h (1hrPE) and 4 h post HIIE (4hrPE). RESULTS: FMD% change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 23.96, p < 0.001, Î·2 = 0.631) and SSX (F1,14 = 4.8, p = 0.47, Î·2 = 0.253) at 1hrPE. RSX and SSX did not differ at 1hrPE (F1,14 = 0.2, p = 0.889, Î·2 = 0.001), but SSX elicited greater FDM responses. Absolute FMD change was lower at RS compared to both RSX (F1,14 = 21.5, p < 0.001, Î·2 = 0.606) and SSX (F1,14 = 7.01, p = 0.019, Î·2 = 0.336) at 1hrPE. RSX and SSX did not differ at 1hrPE (F1,14 = .03, p = 0.858, Î·2 = 0.002), but SSX elicited greater FDM responses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two pediatric surgeons from each of the 10 countries most affected by COVID-19 were surveyed over a 10-day period. Data were obtained regarding service provision, infection control, specific surgical conditions, and the surgical workforce. RESULTS: Twenty pediatric surgeons responded. All centers had postponed non-emergency surgery and clinics for nonurgent conditions with virtual consultations being undertaken in 90% of centers. A majority (65%) of centers had not yet knowingly operated on a positive patient. Minimal access surgery was performed in 75% centers but a further 75% had reduced or stopped upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The management of simple appendicitis was unchanged in 70% centers, patients with intussusception were being referred for radiological reduction in all centers and definitive pull-through surgery for Hirschsprung patients was performed by 95% where washouts were successful. Timing of surgery for reducible neonatal inguinal hernias had changed in 55% of centers and the management of urgent feeding gastrostomy referrals and of inflammatory bowel disease patients failing with biological therapy varied considerably. CONCLUSION: Service provision has been severely affected by COVID-19 leading to an inevitable increase in untreated surgical pathology. Better understanding of extrapulmonary infectivity, the risk of asymptomatic carriage in children, and the reliability of testing for surgical scenarios may allow appropriate use of conventional surgery, including laparoscopy and endoscopy, and rational development of the novel care pathways needed during the pandemic.","Nasher, Omar; Sutcliffe, Jonathan Richard; Stewart, Richard James",Eur. j. pediatr. surg,537,5

Recently, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have emerged as a promising platform for vaccination. In this work, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are systematically engineered in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of UTRs, the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR are identified and termed NASAR, which are 5- to 10-fold more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. More importantly, NASAR mRNAs delivered by lipid-derived TT3 nanoparticles trigger a dramatic expression of potential SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The antigen-specific antibodies induced by TT3-nanoparticles and NASAR mRNAs are over two orders of magnitude more than that induced by the FDA-approved lipid nanoparticle material MC3 in vaccinated mice. These NASAR mRNAs merit further development as alternative SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Zeng, Chunxi; Hou, Xucheng; Yan, Jingyue; Zhang, Chengxiang; Li, Wenqing; Zhao, Weiyu; Du, Shi; Dong, Yizhou",Adv Mater,537,24

It is important to be aware of the laws that regulate the management, distribution, and control of medical devices. Article 82 of the Spanish Law 29/2006 on Guarantees and Rational Use of Medicines and Medical Devices establishes that it is the responsibility of Hospital Pharmacy Services ""to participate in and coordinate the purchase of medicines and medical devices in the hospital to ensure an efficient acquisition and rational use of medical devices"". For this reason, working groups of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy and other scientific societies have issued technical guidelines and consensus statements to provide technical support and updated information on the use of masks, individual protection equipments and other medical devices. In addition, the shortage of medical devices caused by the high demand has resulted in the uncontrolled production and distribution of medical devices. This phenomenon, added to the fraudulent selling of medical devices, highlights the need for a closer surveillance of the market to guarantee the efficacy and safety of available medical devices. A rational use of medical devices is necessary to ensure the availability and safety of these products, which requires the involvement of different stakeholders, including hospital pharmacists. Thus, it is essential that hospital pharmacists receive specific training in technical aspects concerning the possession and use of medical devices. This will help guarantee an effective and safe use of medical products. The acquisition and use of medical devices requires a keen understanding of the technical and legal aspects concerning these products, which makes hospital pharmacists essential for the integral management of medical devices.","Climent-Ballester, Seira; Selva-Otaolaurruchi, Juan",Farm Hosp,537,16

In Euope and North America, however, their use has been stigmatised for a long time, although this view has radically changed during the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Notwithstanding this, it is still unclear whether face masks worn by COVID-19 carriers may indeed prevent viral transmission and environmental contamination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical face masks in filtering SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Four male patients with COVID-19 were recruited for the study. Two patients wore a surgical mask for 5 h, while two others did not. The spread of the virus in the environment was evaluated through the approved Allplex 2019-nCoV assay. RESULTS: In the room with the two patients without surgical masks, the swab performed on the headboard and sides of the beds was positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. In the other room, where two patients were wearing surgical masks, all of the swabs obtained after 5 h tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study add to the growing body of literature supporting the use of face masks as a measure to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by retaining potentially contagious droplets that can infect other people and/or contaminate surfaces. Based on the current evidence, face masks should therefore be considered a useful and low-cost device in addition to social distancing and hand hygiene during the postlockdown phase.","Landi, Francesco; Marzetti, Emanuele; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Ciciarello, Francesca; Tritto, Marcello; Benvenuto, Francesca; Bramato, Giulia; Brandi, Vincenzo; Carfì, Angelo; D039,; Angelo, Emanuela; Fusco, Domenico; Lo Monaco, Maria Rita; Martone, Anna Maria; Pagano, Francesco; Rocchi, Sara; Rota, Elisabetta; Russo, Andrea; Salerno, Andrea; Cattani, Paola; Marchetti, Simona; Bernabei On Behalf Of The Gemelli Against Covid-Geriatric Team, Roberto",Trans.

Standard compartment models fail when they are implemented in the Argentina case. We extended a previous successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenza epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ($\alpha$) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones ($p$). The evolution is more sensitive to the $p-$parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic of extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.

Protocols including pre-operative self-isolation, COVID-19 testing, and surgery at a non-COVID-19 site have been developed to minimize risk of transmission. Despite this, it is likely that many patients will want to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19. The aim of this study is to identify the number of patients who still want to proceed with planned elective orthopaedic surgery in this current environment. Methods: This is a prospective, single surgeon study of 102 patients who were on the waiting list for an elective hip or knee procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics including age, ASA grade, COVID-19 risk, procedure type, surgical priority, and admission type were recorded. The primary outcome was patient consent to continue with planned surgical care after resumption of elective orthopaedic services. Subgroup analysis was also performed to determine if any specific patient factors influenced the decision to proceed with surgery. Results: Overall, 58 patients (56.8%) wanted to continue with planned surgical care at the earliest possibility. Patients classified as ASA I and ASA II were more likely to agree to surgery (60.5% and 60.0%, respectively) compared to ASA III and ASA IV patients (44.4% and 0.0%, respectively) (p = 0.01). In addition, patients undergoing soft tissue knee surgery were more likely to consent to surgery (90.0%) compared to patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty (68.6%), primary knee arthroplasty (48.7%), revision hip or knee arthroplasty (0.0%), or hip and knee injections (43.8%) (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Restarting elective orthopaedic services during the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant challenge. Given the uncertain environment, it is unsurprising that only 56% of patients were prepared to continue with their planned surgical care upon resumption of elective services.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:267-271.","Chang, Justin; Wignadasan, Warran; Kontoghiorghe, Christina; Kayani, Babar; Singh, Sandeep; Plastow, Ricci; Magan, Ahmed; Haddad, Fares",Bone Jt Open,537,26

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","Cuomo, Raphael E; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Cai, Mingxiang; Mackey, Tim K",BMC Public Health,537,16

However, information on early risk factors for the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral positivity is not yet available. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by the interval from the day of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results to the day SARS-CoV-2 testing showed negative results in these 137 patients with COVID-19. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. RESULTS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range, 4 to ~45) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger age (hazard ratio [HR], .658; P = .017); disease not being severe (HR, .653; P = .076); higher lymphocyte (HR, 1.464; P = .033), eosinophil (HR, 1.514; P = .020), and CD8+â T-cell (HR, 1.745; P = .033) counts; and lower IL-6 (HR, .664; P = .036) and IL-10 (HR, .631; P = .021). Multivariate analysis with covariable-adjusted results showed that the CD8+â T-cell count (HR, 2.376; P= .114) was a predominant risk factor for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show early laboratory parameters such as CD8+â T-cell count to be risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which has significance in the control and prevention of the disease.","Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Infect Dis,537,20

However, families do not have access to disease information, tailored problem-solving and effective management strategies, and with COVID-19, are more socially isolated and distressed. To address this dementia care gap, we describe a Phase III efficacy trial testing an online platform, WeCareAdvisor, and design modifications necessitated by COVID-19. WeCareAdvisor provides caregivers with disease information, daily tips, and a systematic approach for describing behaviors, investigating underlying causes, creating tailored strategies, and evaluating their effectiveness (DICE). The trial will enroll 326 caregivers nationwide, randomly assign them to immediately receive WeCareAdvisor (treatment), or a 3-month waitlist (control) and evaluate short (1- and 3-month) and long-term (6-month) outcomes for caregiver distress with and confidence managing BPSD, and BPSD occurrences. We will also evaluate utilization patterns with different prompting conditions: high-intensity (telephone and email reminders), low-intensity (email reminders), or no reminders to use WeCareAdvisor. COVID-19 necessitated design modifications resulting in greater inclusivity of caregivers from diverse races, ethnicities, and geographic areas. Key modifications include shifting from in-home, in-person interviewing to telephone; adjusting tool functionality from operating on a grant-funded iPad to caregivers' personal internet-capable devices; and expanding recruitment from one metropolitan area to nationwide. Study modifications necessitated by COVID-19 facilitate national outreach, easier tool adoption, and enable more diverse caregivers to participate. This study addresses a critical dementia care need, and design modifications may shorten timeline from efficacy testing to commercialization.","Gitlin, Laura N; Bouranis, Nicole; Kern, Vince; Koeuth, Sokha; Marx, Katherine A; McClure, Leslie A; Lyketsos, Constantine G; Kales, Helen C",J Technol Behav Sci,537,27

In recent years, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has emerged as a risk factor for chronic inflammatory background and subsequent aging-associated diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify biological factors (particularly leukocyte subtypes and inflammatory markers) associated with a risk of clinical deterioration (i.e., orotracheal intubation (OTI)) and to determine whether CH was likely to influence clinical and biological behavior in patients with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Here, we describe clinical and biological features, including the screening of CHIP mutants in a well-annotated cohort of 122 hospitalized patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (55% requiring OTI). We showed that elevated white blood cell counts, especially neutrophils and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at admission, were associated with an increased requirement of OTI. We noticed a high prevalence of CH (25%, 38%, 56%, and 82% of patients aged <60 years, 60-70 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years) compared to a retrospective cohort of patients free of hematological malignancy explored with the same pipelines (10%, 21%, 37%, and 44%).

METHODS: We investigated 169 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in two centers in Hunan Province, and divided them into two groups according to epidemiological history, ""imported patients"" refers to patient with a clear history of travel in Wuhan within 14 days before onset, and "" local patients"" refers to local resident without a recent history of travel in Wuhan, aiming to analyze the difference in clinical characteristics and outcomes between the two groups. All the epidemiological, clinical, imaging, and laboratory data were analyzed and contrasted. RESULTS: The incidence of fever on admission in imported patients was significantly higher than local patients. There was a significantly higher proportion of abnormal pulmonary signs, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, prolonged PT, elevated D-dimer and elevated blood glucose in imported patients. Compared with local patients, the proportion using antibiotics, glucocorticoids and gamma globulin were significantly higher in imported patients. The moderate type was more common in local patients, and the severe type were more frequent in imported patients. In addition, the median duration of viral clearance was longer in imported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that imported cases were more likely to develop into severe cases, compared with local patients and required more powerful treatments.

Methods: Three samples, each of one composed by 1,000+ persons aged 18 years or older, were interviewed online in three rounds, every 2 months, from July to November 2020. Results: The level of knowledge on COVID-19 was high in the three rounds, with percentages above 95% of correct answers related to ways of contagion and correct use of face masks. The most accepted measure was the mandatory use of face masks (80-86% of agreement in the three rounds, p = 0.001), followed by the night curfew (63% of agreement). Most participants (>80%) consistently reported using face masks, ventilating spaces, and washing or disinfecting hands. However, risk perception and self-efficacy were low.

Oral manifestations included ulcer, erosion, bulla, vesicle, pustule, fissured or depapillated tongue, macule, papule, plaque, pigmentation, halitosis, whitish areas, hemorrhagic crust, necrosis, petechiae, swelling, erythema, and spontaneous bleeding. The most common sites of involvement in descending order were tongue (38%), labial mucosa (26%) and palate (22%). Suggested diagnoses of the lesions were aphthous stomatitis, herpetiform lesions, candidiasis, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like, EM-like, mucositis, drug eruption, necrotizing periodontal disease, angina bullosa- like, angular cheilitis, atypical Sweet syndrome, and Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome. Oral lesions were symptomatic in 68% of the cases. Oral lesions were nearly equal in both genders (49% female, 51% male). Patients with older age and higher severity of COVID-19 disease had more widespread and sever oral lesions. Lack of oral hygiene, opportunistic infections, stress, immunosuppression, vasculitis and hyper-inflammatory response secondary to COVID-19 are the most important predisposing factors for onset of oral lesions in COVID-19 patients.

Vitamin D deficiency, which can result in a compromised immune response, has been also linked to increased risk and increased morbidities associated with COVID-19. In the absence of large-scale longitudinal studies to determine the strength of association between vitamin deficiency and COVID-19, cross-sectional studies of large patient cohorts can be used. METHODS: We used the i2b2 patient's registry platform at the University of Florida Health Center to generate a count of patients using the international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis codes for the period of October 1, 2015, through June 30, 2020. Logistic regression of the aggregates was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to be positive for COVID-19 (indicated by the ICD-10 diagnostic code COVID19) than patients with no deficiency (P < 0.001). The association decreased slightly after adjusting for sex (odds ratio [OR] = 4.58; P < 0.001) and malabsorption (OR = 4.46; P < 0.001), respectively. The association decreased significantly but remained robust (P < 0.001) after adjusting for race (OR = 3.76; P < 0.001), periodontal disease status (OR = 3.64; P < 0.001), diabetes (OR = 3.28; P < 0.001), and obesity (OR = 2.27; P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, patients with vitamin D deficiency were 5 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than patients with no deficiency after adjusting for age groups (OR = 5.155; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with increased risk for COVID-19.","Katz, Joseph; Yue, Sijia; Xue, Wei",Nutrition,537,16

Just as we have had to deconstruct social support to understand its component parts, we now deconstruct how different types of communication technologies play socially supportive roles. We draw on 101 in-depth interviews conducted in 2013-2014 to shed light on the support networks of a sample of East York residents and discern the role of communication technologies in the exchange of different types of social support across age groups. Our findings show that not much has changed since the 1960s in terms of the social ties that our sample of East Yorkers have, and the types of support mobilized via social networks: companionship, small and large services, emotional aid, and financial support. What has changed is how communication technologies interweave in complex ways with different types of social ties (partners, siblings, friends, etc.) to mobilize social support. We found that with siblings and extended kin communication technologies could boost the frequency of interaction and help exchange support at a distance. With friendship ties, communication technologies provide a continuous, constant flow of interaction. We draw implications for theories of social support and for social policy linked to interventions aimed at helping vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Quan-Haase, Anabel; Harper, Molly-Gloria; Wellmnan, Barry",,537,15

Most measures of RNT are disorder-specific and measure e.g. rumination in depression or worry in anxiety. METHODS: In the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), 1820 adults completed the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire to assess content-independent RNT over a 3-year follow-up period. We investigated the relative stability of content-independent RNT (Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire), over time as well as the association between changes in RNT and changes in affective disorder status (Composite International Diagnostic Interview) and depressive and anxiety severity (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Fear Questionnaire). RESULTS: In the total group, baseline RNT was strongly related to RNT three years later, while the difference between the scores at baseline and three years later was negligible. Increases and decreases in RNT were associated with the occurrence and recovery of affective disorders, respectively. Furthermore, changes in RNT between baseline and three years later were associated with corresponding changes in depression, anxiety, and avoidance symptom severity. These associations were small or negligible. LIMITATIONS: Our findings may not be representative of all affective disorders as individuals with an obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder were excluded from our sample. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that RNT is not primarily an index of disorder status or epiphenomenon of symptom severity and may constitute a relatively stable transdiagnostic person characteristic.","Hijne, Kim; Penninx, Brenda W; van Hemert, Albert M; Spinhoven, Philip",J Affect Disord,537,24

Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.","Rallapalli, Srinivas; Aggarwal, Shubham; Singh, Ajit Pratap",Sci Total Environ,537,16

Results: Online classes were viewed favorably by the vast majority of respondents. Out of 412 respondents 79.9% actively attended the classes. While 42% felt the timings were inappropriate as they clashed with duty hours, a set of 35% had difficulty understanding the content and most of them were undergraduates. Poor internet connection was a main hindrance identified. In total, 69.2% respondents were happy with the feasibility of the classes and believed these classes had the advantage of being economical as they offered exposure to national and international faculty from the comfort of their homes. Conclusion: Conducting online classes on a national scale is a herculean task for a developing country because of poor internet connectivity and deficient access to high-speed broadband services. Nevertheless, their popularity among students during the current crisis shows that it is a very pragmatic and feasible teaching option and can definitely supplement traditional classroom teaching.","Desai, Devanshi; Sen, Saswati; Desai, Sanjiv; Desai, Ranjana; Dash, Snehalata",Indian J Ophthalmol,537,20

METHODS: Modeling of the lag between diagnosis and death is done by using two classes of macroscopic analytical methods: the correlation-based methods based on Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation coefficients, and the logarithmic methods of two types. Also, we apply eight weighted average methods to smooth the time series before calculating the distance. We consider five lags with the least distance. All the computations are conducted on Matlab R2015b. RESULTS: The length of hospitalization for the fatal cases in the USA, Italy and Germany are 2-10, 1-6 and 5-19 days, respectively. Overall, this length in the USA is 2 days more than that in Italy and 5 days less than that in Germany. CONCLUSION: We take the distance between the diagnosis and death as the length of hospitalization. There is a negative association between the length of hospitalization and the case fatality rate. Therefore, the estimation of the length of hospitalization by using these macroscopic mathematical methods can be introduced as an indicator to scale the success of the countries fighting the ongoing pandemic.","Jamshidi, Babak; Jamshidi Zargaran, Shahriar; Bekrizadeh, Hakim; Rezaei, Mansour; Najafi, Farid",Int. j. qual. health care,537,1

In addition, rising case numbers reflect an increase in coronavirus transmission some time previously, so timing of response measures is highly important. Australia experienced a second wave from June 2020 onwards, confined to greater Melbourne, with initial social distancing measures failing to reduce rapidly increasing case numbers. We conducted a detailed analysis of this outbreak, together with an evaluation of the effectiveness of alternative response strategies, to provide guidance to countries experiencing second waves of SARS-Cov-2 transmission. An individual-based transmission model was used to (1) describe a second-wave COVID-19 epidemic in Australia; (2) evaluate the impact of lockdown strategies used; and (3) evaluate effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The model was calibrated using daily diagnosed case data prior to lockdown. Specific social distancing interventions were modelled by adjusting person-to-person contacts in mixing locations. Modelling earlier activation of lockdown measures are predicted to reduce total case numbers by more than 50%. Epidemic peaks and duration of the second wave were also shown to reduce. Our results suggest that activating lockdown measures when second-wave case numbers first indicated exponential growth, would have been highly effective in reducing COVID-19 cases. The model was shown to realistically predict the epidemic growth rate under the social distancing measures applied, validating the methods applied. The timing of social distancing activation is shown to be critical to their effectiveness. Data showing exponential rise in cases, doubling every 7-10 days, can be used to trigger early lockdown measures. Such measures are shown to be necessary to reduce daily and total case numbers, and the consequential health burden, so preventing health care facilities being overwhelmed. Early control of second wave resurgence potentially permits strict lockdown measures to be eased earlier.","Milne, George J; Xie, Simon; Poklepovich, Dana; O039,; Halloran, Dan; Yap, Matthew; Whyatt, David",Sci Rep,537,21

504544,504544,504544,In the spiral of history: SARS-Cov-2 infection,12.226492,10.83983,2021,"BACKGROUND: The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been characterized as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, there are few preclinical animal models that suitably represent infection, as the main point of entry to human cells is via human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is not present in typical preclinical mouse strains. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is highly virulent and unsafe for use in many research facilities. Here we describe the development of a preclinical animal model using intranasal administration of ACE2 followed by non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PsV) challenge. METHODS: To specifically generate our SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we used a lentivirus system. Following co-transfection with a packaging plasmid containing HIV Gag and Pol, luciferase-expressing lentiviruses, and a plasmid carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 PsVs can be isolated and purified. To better understand and maximize the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 PsV, we generated PsV carrying spike protein variants known to have varying human ACE2 binding properties, including 19 deletion (19del) and 19del + D614G. RESULTS: Our system demonstrated the ability of PsVs to infect the respiratory passage of mice following intranasal hACE2 transduction. Additionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo manipulability of our system using recombinant receptor-binding domain protein to prevent PsV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our PsV system is able to model SARS-CoV-2 infections in a preclinical mouse model and can be used to test interventions or preventative treatments. We believe that this method can be extended to work in various mouse strains or to model infection with different coronaviruses. A simple in vivo system such as our model is crucial for rapidly and effectively responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in addition to preparing for future potential coronavirus outbreaks.","Tseng, S.

This encompasses modeling the dynamics of invaded population, parameter estimation of the model, study of qualitative dynamics, and optimal control problem for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccination events such that the cost of the combined measure is minimized. The investigation reveals that disease persists with the increase in exposed individuals having comorbidity in society. The extensive computational efforts show that mean fluctuations in the force of infection increase with corresponding entropy. This is a piece of evidence that the outbreak has reached a significant portion of the population. However, optimal control strategies with combined measures provide an assurance of effectively protecting our population from COVID-19 by minimizing social and economic costs.","Das, Parthasakha; Upadhyay, Ranjit Kumar; Misra, Arvind Kumar; Rihan, Fathalla A; Das, Pritha; Ghosh, Dibakar",Nonlinear Dyn,537,1

A lockdown from 24 March was partially relaxed on 10 May. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R 0and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods: Office for National Statistics data on deaths in England and Wales is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R 0and forecasts for cases and deaths. Results: The UK initial log growth rate is r = 0.254 with s.e. 0.004. R 0= 6.94 with 95% CI (6.52, 7.39). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced throughout to 5% of their previous values, peaks of around 90,000 severely and 25,000 critically ill patients, and 44,000 cumulative deaths are expected by 16 June. With transmission rising from 5% in mid-April to reach 30%, 50,000 deaths and 475,000 active cases are expected in mid-June. Had such a lockdown begun on 17 March, around 30,000 (28,000, 32,000) fewer cumulative deaths would be expected by 9 June. Discussion: The R 0estimate is compatible with some international estimates but over twice the value quoted by the UK government. An earlier lockdown could have saved many thousands of lives.","Dropkin, Greg",Front. Public Health,537,32

From emergency planners to healthcare workers on the front line, and everyone in between, the pandemic, and the uncertainty surrounding it, was likely to become a significant stressor, one with no immediate solution but with the potential to cause enduring distress beyond its conclusion. The UK Defence Medical Services recognised the need to provide an evidence-based programme of care intended to support personnel transitioning from assisting the national response back to normal duties. This was informed by a narrative review that targeted literature exploring strategies for supporting the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers during 21st-century infectious disease outbreaks. The literature identified the experiences most likely to cause enduring distress, which comprised morally challenging decisions, vulnerability, death and suffering, professional and personal challenges, and expectations. The opportunity to find meaning in these experiences, by discussing them with peers who share a contextual understanding, is important to limit the longer-term psychosocial impact of such events. This paper will discuss the design considerations and planned implementation strategy of the Recovery, Readjustment and Reintegration Programme to limit the incidence of distress or longer-term mental ill health among military personnel.","Lamb, Di; Simms, A; Greenberg, N; Withnall, R D J",,537,23

In the current study, we investigate the underlying neural sources of these responses and test the hypothesis that they can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility. MEG responses were measured to natural and spectrally degraded (noise-vocoded) speech in 19 normal hearing participants. Results showed that cortical coherence to ""abstract"" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) were lateralized to the left hemisphere and changed parametrically with intelligibility of speech. In contrast, responses coherent to words/syllables accompanied by acoustic onsets were bilateral and insensitive to intelligibility changes. This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility but also powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. This explains why previous studies have reported widely inconsistent effects of speech intelligibility on cortical entrainment and, within a single experiment, provided clear support for conclusions about language lateralization derived from a large number of separately conducted neuroimaging studies. Since noise-vocoded speech resembles the signals provided by a cochlear implant device, the current methodology has potential clinical utility for assessment of cochlear implant performance.","Meng, Qingqing; Hegner, Yiwen Li; Giblin, Iain; McMahon, Catherine; Johnson, Blake W",Cereb. cortex,537,29

Both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals are infectious. We show that the proposed A-SIYS epidemic captures several well-established epidemic models as special cases and obtain sufficient conditions under which the disease gets eradicated by resorting to mean-field approximations. In addition, we highlight a potential inaccuracy in the derivation of the upper bound on the decay ratio in the activity-driven adaptive SIS (A-SIS) model in (Ogura et. al., 2019) and present a more general version of their result. We numerically illustrate the evolution of the fraction of infected nodes in the A-SIS epidemic model and show that the bound in (Ogura et. al., 2019) often fails to capture the behavior of the epidemic in contrast with our results.","Hota, Ashish R.; Gupta, Kavish",,537,20

In forming a mean-variance efficient portfolio, investment managers look for low-correlated assets in order to maximize diversification benefits. This article investigates the potential of European and US leveraged loans to serve as diversifiers in a multi-asset portfolio. By calculating correlations between leveraged loans and other asset classes over the sample period from 2002 to 2020, the authors are not only able to demonstrate increasing correlations in highly volatile markets (i.e., financial crises), but also long-term, crisis-independent positive trends in asset correlations. In particular, leveraged loans and their correlations with stocks and high-yield bonds present significantly positive long-term trends and hence diminishing diversification benefits. The authors state that instead of short-term market volatility, increasing market integration could be the driving force behind this effect. The results also indicate that diversification benefits from leveraged loans are lower in the US than in the European market. TOPICS: Fixed income and structured finance, developed markets, portfolio construction, performance measurement Key Findings ▪ The empirical analysis shows generally stable and low correlations of leveraged loans with most asset classes in European and US markets. Stocks and high-yield bonds are an exception, showing a pattern with rising long-term correlation coefficients. ▪ The correlation of leveraged loans with high-yield bonds is higher than those with other asset classes due to their comparable characteristics. Correlations between those asset classes have risen, especially since the global financial crisis in 2008. ▪ Due to higher market volumes and integration advantages in the US, the correlations of leveraged loans with other assets are higher in the US market, leading to lower diversification benefits compared to Europe.","Dreyer, Dirk Schaab Ilja",Journal of Structured Finance,537,16

We evaluated CoV and pneumococcal co-detection by sex in childhood pneumonia. METHODS: In the 2011-2014 Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health study, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs and other samples were collected from 3981 children <5 years hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia in 7 countries. Severity by NP/OP detection status of CoV (NL63, 229E, OC43 or HKU1) and high-density (&#8805;6.9 log10 copies/mL) pneumococcus (HDSpn) by real-time polymerase chain reaction was assessed by sex using logistic regression adjusted for age and site. RESULTS: There were 43 (1.1%) CoV+/HDSpn+, 247 CoV+/HDSpn-, 449 CoV-/HDSpn+ and 3149 CoV-/HDSpn- cases with no significant difference in co-detection frequency by sex (range 51.2%-64.0% male, P = 0.06). More CoV+/HDSpn+ pneumonia was very severe compared with other groups for both males (13/22, 59.1% versus range 29.1%-34.7%, P = 0.04) and females (10/21, 47.6% versus 32.5%-43.5%, P = 0.009), but only male CoV+/HDSpn+ required supplemental oxygen more frequently (45.0% versus 20.6%-28.6%, P < 0.001) and had higher mortality (35.0% versus 5.3%-7.1%, P = 0.004) than other groups. For females with CoV+/HDSpn+, supplemental oxygen was 25.0% versus 24.8%-33.3% (P = 0.58) and mortality was 10.0% versus 9.2%-12.9% (P = 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Co-detection of endemic CoV and HDSpn was rare in children hospitalized with pneumonia, but associated with higher severity and mortality in males. Findings may warrant investigation of differences in severity by sex with co-detection of HDSpn and SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Daniel E; Higdon, Melissa M; Prosperi, Christine; Baggett, Henry C; Brooks, W Abdullah; Feikin, Daniel R; Hammitt, Laura L; Howie, Steve R C; Kotloff, Karen L; Levine, Orin S; Madhi, Shabir A; Murdoch, David R; O039,; Brien, Katherine L; Scott, J Anthony G; Thea, Donald M; Antonio, Martin; Awori, Juliet O; Baillie, Vicky L; Bunthi, Charatdao; Kwenda, Geoffrey; Mackenzie, Grant A; Moore, David P; Morpeth, Susan C; Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Paveenkittiporn, Wantana; Ziaur Rahman, Mohammed; Rahman, Mustafizur; Rhodes, Julia; Sow, Samba O; Tapia, Milagritos D; Deloria Knoll, Maria",Pediatr Infect Dis J,537,16

Moreover, many factors remain unclear regarding the appropriate use of corticosteroids for COVID-19. In this context, this multicenter, retrospective, propensity score-matched study was launched to evaluate the efficacy of systemic corticosteroid administration for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 ranging in the degree of severity from mild to critically-ill disease. This multicenter, retrospective study enrolled consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients diagnosed January-April 2020 across 30 institutions in Japan. Clinical outcomes were compared for COVID-19 patients who received or did not receive corticosteroids, after adjusting for propensity scores. The primary endpoint was the odds ratio (OR) for improvement on a 7-point ordinal score on Day 15. Of 1092 COVID-19 patients analyzed, 118 patients were assigned to either the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid group, after propensity score matching. At baseline, most patients did not require invasive/noninvasive ventilation (85.6% corticosteroid group vs. 89.8% non-corticosteroid group). The odds of improvement in a 7-point ordinal score on Day 15 was significantly lower for the corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (OR, 0.611; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.388-0.962; p = 0.034). The time to improvement in radiological findings was significantly shorter in the corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.758; 95% CI, 1.323-2.337; p < 0.001), regardless of baseline clinical status. The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was shorter in corticosteroid versus non-corticosteroid group (HR, 1.466; 95% CI, 0.841-2.554; p = 0.177). Of the 106 patients who received methylprednisolone, the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly shorter in the pulse/semi-pulse versus standard dose group (HR, 2.831; 95% CI, 1.347-5.950; p = 0.006). In conclusion, corticosteroids for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not improve clinical status on Day 15, but reduced the time to improvement in radiological findings for all patients regardless of disease severity and also reduced the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients who required intubation.Trial registration: This study was registered in the University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry on April 21, 2020 (ID: UMIN000040211).","Ikeda, Satoshi; Misumi, Toshihiro; Izumi, Shinyu; Sakamoto, Keita; Nishimura, Naoki; Ro, Shosei; Fukunaga, Koichi; Okamori, Satoshi; Tachikawa, Natsuo; Miyata, Nobuyuki; Shinkai, Masaharu; Shinoda, Masahiro; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Iijima, Yuki; Izumo, Takehiro; Inomata, Minoru; Okamoto, Masaki; Yamaguchi, Tomoyoshi; Iwabuchi, Keisuke; Masuda, Makoto; Takoi, Hiroyuki; Oyamada, Yoshitaka; Fujitani, Shigeki; Mineshita, Masamichi; Ishii, Haruyuki; Nakagawa, Atsushi; Yamaguchi, Nobuhiro; Hibino, Makoto; Tsushima, Kenji; Nagai, Tatsuya; Ishikawa, Satoru; Ishikawa, Nobuhisa; Kondoh, Yasuhiro; Yamazaki, Yoshitaka; Gocho, Kyoko; Nishizawa, Tomotaka; Tsuzuku, Akifumi; Yagi, Kazuma; Shindo, Yuichiro; Takeda, Yuriko; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Ogura, Takashi",Sci Rep,537,20

Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1,671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators.

Global attempts are ongoing to find the drugs for the treatment of this virus but none of the antiviral drugs used for treatment of other human viral infection is working and hence attempts to find new drugs are continuing. Here the author is proposing that 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) which when used on its own is failing as an antiviral agent due to the removal of this compound by proof reading ability exceptionally found in Coronaviruses. The author here is proposing to test 5-FU in combination with a number of deoxynucleosides on animal models infected with this Covid-19. Should encouraging results ensue, therapies could then be tried on patients.","Ahmad, Shamim I",Med Hypotheses,537,16

Here, taking SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we explored the antiviral properties and immune-profile of a large panel of four highly stable and well-characterized MXenes - Ti3C2Tx, Ta4C3T x , Mo2Ti2C3T x and Nb4C3T x . To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti3C2T x in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo2Ti2C3T x also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology. MXene immune profiling revealed i) the excellent bio and immune compatibility of the material, as well as the ability of MXene ii) to inhibit monocytes and iii) to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect elicited by MXene. We here report a selection of MXenes and viral SARS-CoV-2 genotypes/mutations, a series of the computational, structural and molecular data depicting deeply the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of inhibition, as well as high dimensional single-cell immune-MXene profiling. Taken together, our results provide a compendium of knowledge for new developments of MXene-based multi-functioning nanosystems as antivirals and immune-modulators.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bayrakdar, Fatma; Fusco, Laura; Besbinar, Omur; Shuck, Christopher E; Yalcin, Süleyman; Erken, Mine Turktas; Ozkul, Aykut; Gurcan, Cansu; Panatli, Oguzhan; Summak, Gokce Yagmur; Gokce, Cemile; Orecchioni, Marco; Gazzi, Arianna; Vitale, Flavia; Somers, Julia; Demir, Emek; Yildiz, Serap Suzuk; Nazir, Hasan; Grivel, Jean-Charles; Bedognetti, Davide; Crisanti, Andrea; Akcali, Kamil Can; Gogotsi, Yury; Delogu, Lucia Gemma; Yilmazer, Açelya",Nano Today,537,1

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; patients were enrolled between March 11, and April 29, 2020. The date of final follow-up was July 30, 2020. We used a propensity score matching approach to compare outcomes. Study outcomes were formulated before data collection and analysis. SETTING: Critical care units at two large metropolitan hospitals in New York City. PATIENTS: Five-hundred forty-one patients with confirmed severe coronavirus disease 2019 respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: Bedside percutaneous dilational tracheostomy with modified visualization and ventilation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Required time for discontinuation off mechanical ventilation, total length of hospitalization, and overall patient survival. Of the 541 patients, 394 patients were eligible for a tracheostomy. One-hundred sixteen were early percutaneous dilational tracheostomies with median time of 9 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation (interquartile range, 7-12 d), whereas 89 were late percutaneous dilational tracheostomies with a median time of 19 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation (interquartile range, 16-24 d). Compared with patients with no tracheostomy, patients with an early percutaneous dilational tracheostomy had a higher probability of discontinuation from mechanical ventilation (absolute difference, 30%; p < 0.001; hazard ratio for successful discontinuation, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.34-5.84; p = 0.006) and a lower mortality (absolute difference, 34%, p < 0.001; hazard ratio for death, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.22; p < 0.001). Compared with patients with late percutaneous dilational tracheostomy, patients with early percutaneous dilational tracheostomy had higher discontinuation rates from mechanical ventilation (absolute difference 7%; p < 0.35; hazard ratio for successful discontinuation, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.3; p = 0.04) and had a shorter median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (absolute difference, -15 d; p < 0.001). None of the healthcare providers who performed all the percutaneous dilational tracheostomies procedures had clinical symptoms or any positive laboratory test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

We modeled a big dataset with 42 SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease-ligand complex structures from â¼98.7% similar SARS-CoV 3CL protease with abundant complex structures. The diverse flexible active site conformations identified in the dataset were clustered into six protease pharmacophore clusters (PPCs). For the PPCs with distinct flexible protease active sites and diverse interaction environments, we identified pharmacophore anchor hotspots. A total of 11 ""PPC consensus anchors"" (a distinct set observed in each PPC) were observed, of which three ""PPC core anchors"" EHV2, HV1, and V3 are strongly conserved across PPCs. The six PPC cavities were then applied in virtual screening of 2122 FDA drugs for repurposing, using core anchor-derived ""PPC scoring S"" to yield seven drug candidates. Experimental testing by SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition assay and antiviral cytopathic effect assays discovered active hits, Boceprevir and Telaprevir (HCV drugs) and Nelfinavir (HIV drug). Specifically, Boceprevir showed strong protease inhibition with micromolar IC50 of 1.42 µM and an antiviral activity with EC50 of 49.89 µM, whereas Telaprevir showed moderate protease inhibition only with an IC50 of 11.47 µM. Nelfinavir solely showed antiviral activity with a micromolar EC50 value of 3.28 µM. Analysis of binding mechanisms of protease inhibitors revealed the role of PPC core anchors.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) still need to be treated at percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) centers with relevant safety measures. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the therapeutic outcomes of PCI performed under the safety measures and normal conditions. AMI patients undergoing PCI between January 24 to April 30, 2020 were performed under safety measures for COVID-19. Patients received pulmonary computed tomography (CT) and underwent PCI in negative pressure ICU. Cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) staff and physicians worked with level III personal protection. Demographic and clinical data, such as door-to-balloon (DTB) time, operation time, complications for patients in this period (COVID-19 group) and the same period in 2019 (2019 group) were retrieved and analyzed. COVID-19 and 2019 groups had 37 and 96 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, gender, BMI and comorbidity between the two groups. DTB time and operation time were similar between the two groups (60.0 ± 12.39 vs 58.83 ± 12.85 min, p = 0.636; 61.46 ± 9.91 vs 62.55 ± 10.72 min, p = 0.592).

METHODS: Study data were collected over a 3-month period from June to September 2007. The survey research method was used. A total of 1500 randomly sampled registered nurses from 18 hospitals in Hunan, China completed self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 1500 nurses included in the study, 1444 returned valid self-report questionnaires. Compliance with standard precautions was found to be low in the surveyed nurses. With a maximum possible score of 80, the quartile range of the overall score for compliance for all nurses was 48.29 (upper quartile score 76.36, lower quartile score 28.07), which was occupied by 64.7% of the participants. The factors most affecting compliance were: standard precautions training (odds ratio (OR) 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85–2.55) and knowledge (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.01–3.41), followed by hospital grade (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.79–1.86), presence of sharps disposal box in the department (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10–3.41), general self-efficacy (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04–1.59), exposure experience (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56–0.85), and department in which the nurse worked (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05–1.46).

This study examines Chinese rural residents' mental health risk under emergency lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. It investigates how the environmental, socioeconomic, and behavioral dimensions of community support affect mental health in this emergency context. We also explore whether community support's effectiveness depends on the strictness of lockdown measures implemented and the level of individual perceived COVID-19 infection risk. We collect self-reported mental health risk, community support, and demographics information through a cross-sectional survey of 3892 Chinese rural residents living in small towns and villages. Ordinary least square regressions are employed to estimate the psychological effects of community support. The results suggest that the COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown policies negatively affect psychological well-being, especially for rural females. The capacity for community production has the largest impact on reducing mental health risks, followed by the stability of basic medical services, community cohesion, housing condition, the stability of communications and transportation supply, and the eco-environment. The effectiveness of different community support dimensions depends on the level of lockdown policy implemented and the levels of one's perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Our study stresses the psychological significance of a healthy living environment, resilient infrastructure and public service system, and community production capacity during the lockdown in rural towns and villages.","Jia, Ziyu; Xu, Shijia; Zhang, Zican; Cheng, Zhengyu; Han, Haoqing; Xu, Haoxiang; Wang, Mingtian; Zhang, Hong; Zhou, Yi; Zhou, Zhengxu",J Rural Stud,537,24

This study explored the patterns and the sources of variation in the sex gap in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates across 100 countries where sex-disaggregated cases and deaths were available as of September 2020. Our results show that there is generally a male disadvantage in both incidence and mortality; however, COVID-19 incidence exhibited a lower male disadvantage (1.2 times higher risk for males) than COVID-19 mortality (1.5 times higher risk for males). The extent of male disadvantages in COVID-19 outcomes across countries varied by societal gender inequalities and behavioural factors. Greater gender equality, both socially and behaviourally, was associated with more equal COVID-19 incidence and mortality between men and women. The findings imply that male disadvantages in COVID-19 outcomes, particularly incidence, are socially determined, whereas further investigation is needed to understand behavioural and biological elements yielding a male disadvantage in mortality.","Kim, Heeun; Fox, Ashley M; Kim, Younhee; Kim, Ryung; Bae, Green; Kang, Minah",Glob Public Health,537,30

We synthesize the literature on broader health and social impacts on people with disabilities arising from lockdown-related measures. Methods: Scoping review with thematic analysis. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three pre-print servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers addressing lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Snowballing searches and experts’ consultation also occurred. Two independent reviewers took eligibility decisions and performed data extractions. Results: Out of 1026 unique references, 85 addressed lockdown-related disparities experienced by people with disabilities. Ten primary and two central themes were identified: (1) Disrupted access to healthcare (other than for COVID-19); (2) Reduced physical activity leading to health and functional decline; (3) From physical distance and inactivity to social isolation and loneliness; (4) Disruption of personal assistance and community support networks; (5) Children with disabilities disproportionally affected by school closures; (6) Psychological consequences of disrupted routines, activities, and support; (7) Family and informal caregiver burden and stress; (8) Risks of maltreatment, violence, and self-harm; (9) Reduced employment and/or income exacerbating disparities; and (10) Digital divide in access to health, education, and support services. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and structural, pre-pandemic disparities were the central themes. Conclusions: Lockdown-related measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can disproportionally affect people with disabilities with broader impact on their health and social grounds. Lack of disability-inclusive response and emergency preparedness and pre-pandemic disparities created structural disadvantages, exacerbated during the pandemic. Both structural disparities and their pandemic ramifications require the development and implementation of disability-inclusive public health and policy measures.","Jesus, Tiago S.; Bhattacharjya, Sutanuka; Papadimitriou, Christina; Bogdanova, Yelena; Bentley, Jacob; Arango-Lasprilla, Juan Carlos; Kamalakannan, Sureshkumar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,537,1

Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques have emerged as a tool that can identify invasive species at a distinctly earlier time point than traditional methods of detection. Here, we focus on whether eDNA techniques can be successfully applied to detect new invasions by the destructive New Zealand Mud Snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (NZMS). It is an opportune time to apply eDNA-based detection in P. antipodarum, which is currently expanding its invasive range across eastern North America. We collected water samples from eight sites in central Pennsylvania that prior evidence indicated were not yet invaded by the NZMS but were part of the same watershed as other previously documented invaded sites. We found evidence for NZMS invasion at five of the eight sites, with subsequent physical confirmation of mud snails at one of these sites. This study is the first example of successful application of eDNA to detect a previously unidentified invasive population of NZMS, setting the stage for further monitoring of at-risk sites to detect and control new invasions of this destructive snail. This study also shows potential opportunities for invasion monitoring offered by using low-cost efforts and methods that are adaptable for citizen science.","Woodell, James D.; Neiman, Maurine; Levri, Edward P.",Biol Invasions,537,1

Modeling the trend of infection and real-time forecasting of cases can help decision making and control of the disease spread. However, data-driven methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can perform poorly due to limited daily samples in time. In this work, we develop an integrated spatiotemporal model based on the epidemic differential equations (SIR) and RNN. The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.","Li, Z.; Zheng, Y.; Xin, J.; Zhou, G.",,537,1

We use weekly data from January 3, 2020 to March 7, 2021. This provides a sufficient dataset for empirical analysis. Granger causality test results prove the two-way relationship between the fluctuation of infectious disease equities and confirmed cases. In addition, confirmed cases will cause the public to search for COVID-19 tests, and COVID-19 tests will also cause fluctuations in infectious disease equities, but there is no reverse correlation. The results of this research are useful to investors and policy makers. Investors can use the number of confirmed cases to predict the volatility of infectious disease equities. Similarly, policy makers can use the intervention of retrieved information to stabilize public sentiment and equity market fluctuations, and integrate a variety of information to make more scientific judgments on the trends of the epidemic.","Meng, Jinxia; Su, Qingyi; Zhang, Jinhua; Wang, Li; Xu, Ruihui; Yan, Cheng",Front Public Health,537,22

Choosing different types of food affects peoples’ mental and physical health and, with persistent consumption of certain types of food and frequent eating, there may be an increased likelihood of death. In this paper, a regression system is employed to evaluate the prediction of death status based on food categories. METHODS: A Healthy Artificial Nutrition Analysis (HANA) model is proposed. The proposed model is used to generate a food recommendation system and track individual habits during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure healthy foods are recommended. To collect information about the different types of foods that most of the world's population eat, the COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset was used. This dataset includes different types of foods from 170 countries around the world as well as obesity, undernutrition, death, and COVID-19 data as percentages of the total population. The dataset was used to predict the status of death using different machine learning regression models, i.e., linear regression (ridge regression, simple linear regularization, and elastic net regression), and AdaBoost models. RESULTS: The death status was predicted with high accuracy, and the food categories related to death were identified with promising accuracy. The Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R(2) metrics and 20-fold cross-validation were used to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction models for the COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset. The evaluations demonstrated that elastic net regression was the most efficient prediction model. Based on an in-depth analysis of recent nutrition recommendations by WHO, we confirm the same advice already introduced in the WHO report(1). Overall, the outcomes also indicate that the remedying effects of COVID-19 patients are most important to people which eat more vegetal products, oilcrops grains, beverages, and cereals - excluding beer. Moreover, people consuming more animal products, animal fats, meat, milk - including butter, sugar and sweetened foods, sugar crops, were associated with a higher number of deaths and fewer patient recoveries. The outcome of sugar consumption was important and the rates of death and recovery were influenced by obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Based on evaluation metrics, the proposed HANA model may outperform other algorithms used to predict death status. The results of this study may direct patients to eat particular types of food to reduce the possibility of becoming infected with the COVID-19 virus.","Shams, M.Y.; Elzeki, O.M.; Abouelmagd, Lobna M.; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Elfattah, Mohamed Abd; Salem, Hanaa",Comput Biol Med,537,1

M(pro) is conserved among coronaviruses and distinct from human proteases. Viral replication depends on the cleavage of the viral polyprotein at multiple sites. We present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) bound to two viral substrate peptides. The structures show how M(pro) recognizes distinct substrates and how subtle changes in substrate accommodation can drive large changes in catalytic efficiency. One peptide, constituting the junction between viral nonstructural proteins 8 and 9 (nsp8/9), has P1′ and P2′ residues that are unique among the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) cleavage sites but conserved among homologous junctions in coronaviruses. M(pro) cleaves nsp8/9 inefficiently, and amino acid substitutions at P1′ or P2′ can enhance catalysis. Visualization of M(pro) with intact substrates provides new templates for antiviral drug design and suggests that the coronavirus lifecycle selects for finely tuned substrate-dependent catalytic parameters.","MacDonald, Elizabeth A.; Frey, Gary; Namchuk, Mark N.; Harrison, Stephen C.; Hinshaw, Stephen M.; Windsor, Ian W.",ACS Infect Dis,537,1

Developments of efficient vaccines against new variants of PEDV have been challenging, not least because of the difficulties in eliciting mucosal and lactogenic immunity. A single-chain fragment variable (scFv) capable of efficient antigen recognition is an alternative to vaccination and treatment of a viral infection. In the present study, the variable regions of the light chain and the heavy chain of a G2b PEDV spike domain A (S1(A))-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) were sequenced, constructed with a (G4S) x3 linker, and produced by a mammalian protein expression system. Our results demonstrated that the PEDV S1(A) domain scFv was able to bind to S proteins of both G1 and G2b PEDVs. Nevertheless, the scFv was only capable of neutralizing the homologous G2b PEDV but not the G1 PEDV. The binding ability of the G2b-specific neutralizing scFv was not able to predict the neutralizing ability toward heterologous PEDV.

Also, the country's critical care beds are ≤63% occupied. This achievement results from the excellent coordination and action by the Argentine Ministry of Health together with the 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires of the nation for now. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regarding cardiovascular care for patients over 65 years of age, a more accurate analysis could be performed when two comparative half‐yearly periods corresponding to the years 2019 and 2020 (pandemic time) were compared. The data collected regarding this age range revealed issues that had not previously been evaluated in our country. That undoubtedly proposes a different solution for the future based on a strict scientific analysis. RESULTS: The ratio of patients who received stents to those that underwent coronary surgery was 6 to 1, while the ratio of patients who had off‐pump surgery to those that underwent minimally invasive surgery was 69 to 1. CONCLUSION: An Argentinian perspective regarding cardiovascular care is good because the country has an excellent level of qualified medical training in its cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology services, as well as healthcare infrastructure distributed throughout the country, which will undoubtedly be able to respond to the new challenges posed by the post‐pandemic period.","Benetti, Federico; Del Prete, Sergio H.; Glanc, Mario; Navia, Daniel",J Card Surg,537,23

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of trauma volume from Worcester Regional Hospital in South Africa from 1 January to 28 December 2020. We compared total volume and incidence rates during five calendar periods; one when alcohol sales were allowed as per normal and four when alcohol sales were completely or partially banned. Poisson regression was used to model differences between alcohol ban and non‐ban periods. RESULTS: During the first period (pre‐COVID‐19, no ban), the trauma admission rate was 95 per 100 days, compared to 39 during the second period (complete ban 1), 74 during the third period (partial ban 1), 40 during the fourth period (complete ban 2) and 105 during the fifth period (partial ban 2). There was a 59–69% decrease in trauma volume between the no ban and complete ban 1 periods. When alcohol sales were partially reinstated, trauma volume significantly increased by 83–90% then dropped again by 39–46% with complete ban 2. By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again (partial ban 2), trauma volume increased by 163–250%, thus returning to pre‐COVID‐19 levels. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a clear trend of decreased trauma volume during periods of complete alcohol prohibition compared to non‐ and partial alcohol bans. This finding suggests that temporary alcohol bans can be used to decrease health facility traffic during national emergencies.","Chu, Kathryn M.; Marco, Jenna‐Lee; Owolabi, Eyitayo Omolara; Duvenage, Riaan; Londani, Mukhethwa; Lombard, Carl; Parry, Charles D.

This article details and discusses the first commercial implementation and adaptation of the HSP prior to the Crew Demo-2 launch.METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of the application of NASA disease prevention protocols for human spaceflight during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of the pandemic, extra precautions added to the HSP included daily symptom surveys completed by Primary Contacts of the crew, COVID-19 RT-PCR testing, and improved quarantine protocols.RESULTS: Of the 91 SpaceX Primary Contacts who completed a total of 2720 daily symptom surveys prior to launch, 22 individuals (24.2) and 198 surveys (7.3) returned positive for potential symptoms of COVID-19. Two individuals were removed due to symptoms indistinguishable from COVID-19. Through this survey, systematic quarantine, and PCR testing, the Crew Demo-2 mission was successful with no known infectious diseases transmitted.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the commercial implementation of the NASA Health Stabilization Program by SpaceX with adjustments required during the COVID-19 pandemic was a success, with protocols allowing identification and removal of potentially infectious persons from the program.

There have been numerous advances in planning, biothreat countermeasure development, licensure, manufacturing, stockpiling and deployment. Increased biodefense surveillance capability has dramatically improved, while new tools and increased awareness have fostered rapid identification of new potential public health pathogens. Unfortunately, structural delays in vaccine design, development, manufacture, clinical testing and licensure processes remain significant obstacles to an effective national biodefense rapid response capability. This is particularly true for the very real threat of “novel pathogens” such as the avian-origin influenzas H7N9 and H5N1, and new coronaviruses such as hCoV-EMC. Conventional approaches to vaccine development, production, clinical testing and licensure are incompatible with the prompt deployment needed for an effective public health response. An alternative approach, proposed here, is to apply computational vaccine design tools and rapid production technologies that now make it possible to engineer vaccines for novel emerging pathogen and WMD biowarfare agent countermeasures in record time. These new tools have the potential to significantly reduce the time needed to design string-of-epitope vaccines for previously unknown pathogens. The design process—from genome to gene sequence, ready to insert in a DNA plasmid—can now be accomplished in less than 24 h. While these vaccines are by no means “standard,” the need for innovation in the vaccine design and production process is great. Should such vaccines be developed, their 60-d start-to-finish timeline would represent a 2-fold faster response than the current standard.","De Groot, Anne S; Einck, Leo; Moise, Leonard; Chambers, Michael; Ballantyne, John; Malone, Robert W; Ardito, Matthew; Martin, William",Hum Vaccin Immunother,537,21

However, few data from healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection support this assumption. We investigated the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (Ig G) against SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers who do not primarily take care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the general population in a well-defined geographical area. The first part of the study was conducted in May 2020 in Val Mesolcina (Southern Switzerland), a valley with ~8000 inhabitants. All healthcare workers were invited. All participants (n = 488) of the Swiss Longitudinal Cohort Study (SWICOS), a cohort representative of the general population, were also invited. Circulating Ig G against spike protein subunit 1 of SARS-CoV-2 were tested in each subject. Subjects with positive Ig G were tested again after 6 months. The condition of being a healthcare worker, rather than a part of the general population, was tested as a predictor of seroprevalence positivity by both simple and multiple (adjusted for age and sex) logistic regression. Eleven (2.6%) of the 423 SWICOS participants and 46 (16%) out of 289 healthcare workers were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The seroprevalence OR was 7.01 (95% CI: 3.53–15.47) for healthcare workers as compared to SWICOS participants. After adjusting for age and gender, the seroprevalence OR was 5.13 (95% CI: 2.54–10.40). About three quarters of the subjects in the SWICOS (73%) and in healthcare (79%) group with a previous positive serology still presented positive Ig G against the SARS-CoV-2 after 6 months. The present seroprevalence data point out that the SARS-CoV-2 infection is seven times higher among healthcare workers than in the general population of Val Mesolcina.

Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.","Ghosh, Srijit; Das, Srijita; Mondal, Rupsa; Abdullah, Salik; Sultana, Shirin; Singh, Sukhbir; Sehgal, Aayush; Behl, Tapan",Int Immunopharmacol,537,24

METHODS: : This retrospective cohort study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2002 linked to the Death Database 2000-2011 and the Hospitalization Database 1999/2000-2012/2013) (n=27,000). Mental disorders (past year major depressive episodes (MDE), bipolar disorders (BPD), anxiety disorders (AD), and substance dependence (SD)) and subsequent suicide events (deaths or hospitalizations for suicide attempts) were identified. Competing risk regression models were used to analyze the time-to-event data, adjusting for age, sex, marital status, and educational attainment. RESULTS: : Past year mental disorders were diagnosed in 11.38% of the cohort and 0.41% had suicide events. An increased hazard of suicide events associated with MDE, SD and AD weakened over-time, but this was not observed for BPD. For example, the HR of suicide events for MDE was 6.02 (95% confidence interval (CI)=2.65, 13.68) in the first 4 years, whereas, it was 2.03 (95% CI=0.91, 4.53) after 4 years.

Although immune-induced thrombocytopenia has been described mostly in moderate-to-severe COVID-19, the prognostic role of platelet count in COVID-19 is still controversial. Pseudothrombocytopenia has been reported to represent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in critical illness, and transient EDTA-dependent pseudothrombocytopenia lasting less than 3 weeks was described in a patient with severe acute COVID-19 pneumonia. In our case study, EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia was still present at 9 months after an initial SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in an apparently recovered 60 year old man. The persistence of antinucleocapside and antispike antibodies 9 months after the initial infection suggests that EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia may be related to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or IgM antibodies. We should acknowledge the possibility that pseudothrombocytopenia may also appear in some patients after seroconversion after the launch of large-scale vaccination programs.","Bereczki, Dániel; Nagy, Béla; Kerényi, Adrienne; Nagy, Gábor; Szarka, Krisztina; Kristóf, Katalin; Szalay, Balázs; Vásárhelyi, Barna; Bhattoa, Harjit P; Kappelmayer, János",Laboratory medicine,537,21

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly associated with respiratory tract disease but have been implicated in enteric disease. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of coronaviruses in stool samples from children and adults with gastrointestinal illness by RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical samples submitted for infectious diarrhea testing were collected from December 2007 through March 2008. RNA extraction and RT-PCR was performed for stools negative for Clostridium difficile using primer sets against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Clinical data from samples positive for coronaviruses were reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Samples from 479 patients were collected including 151 pediatric (<= 18yrs), and 328 adults (> 18yrs). Of these samples, 4 patients (1.3%, 2 adult; 2 pediatric) screened positive for the presence of a coronavirus. All detected coronaviruses were identified as HCoV-HKU1. No stools screened positive for either HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-OC43. All HCoV-HKU1 positive samples occurred between mid January to mid February. Clinical manifestations from HCoV-HKU1 positive patients included diarrhea, emesis and respiratory complaints. Three (75%) patients were admitted to the hospital with a median length of stay of 6 days. CONCLUSIONS: Coronaviruses as a group are not commonly identified in stool samples of patients presenting with gastrointestinal illness.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities among COVID-19 patients and their mortality risks with each category of pre-existing comorbidity. METHODS: To conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched using pre-specified search strategies. Further searches were conducted using the reference list of the selected studies, renowned preprint servers (eg, medRxiv, bioRxiv, SSRN), and relevant journals’ websites. Studies written in the English language included if those were conducted among COVID-19 patients with and without comorbidities and presented survivor vs non-survivor counts or hazard/odds of deaths or survivors with types of pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities reported in the selected studies were grouped into eight categories. The pooled likelihoods of deaths in each category were estimated using a fixed or random-effect model, based on the heterogeneity assessment. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of the funnel plot asymmetry and Egger’s regression test. Trim and Fill method was used if there any publication bias was found. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies included in this study comprised of 27 670 samples. The most common pre-existing comorbidities in COVID-19 patients were hypertension (39.5%), cardiovascular disease (12.4%), and diabetes (25.2%). The higher likelihood of deaths was found among COVID-19 patients who had pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.86-4.09), immune and metabolic disorders (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.03-2.85), respiratory diseases (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.72-2.19), cerebrovascular diseases (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 3.04-5.58), any types of cancers (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.63-3.03), renal (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 2.60-3.51), and liver diseases (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.50-3.69). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing comorbidities had a higher likelihood of death. These findings could potentially help health care providers to sort out the most susceptible COVID-19 patients by comorbidities, take precautionary measures during hospitalization, assess susceptibility to death, and prioritize their treatment, which could potentially reduce the number of fatalities in COVID-19.","Khan, Md Mostaured Ali; Khan, Md Nuruzzaman; Mustagir, Md Golam; Rana, Juwel; Islam, Md Saiful; Kabir, Md Iqbal",Journal of global health,537,21

METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) of “Pneumonia” from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2015. The only document types we studied were original articles and reviews, analyzing descriptive indicators by five-year periods and the scientific production by country, adjusting for population, economic, and research-related parameters. RESULTS: A total of 22,694 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time, from 981 publications in 2001 to 1977 in 2015 (R(2) = 0.956). The most productive country was the USA (38.49%), followed by the UK (7.18%) and Japan (5.46%). Research production from China increased by more than 1000%. By geographical area, North America (42.08%) and Europe (40.79%) were most dominant. Scientific production in low- and middle-income countries more than tripled, although their overall contribution to the field remained limited (< 15%). Overall, 18.8% of papers were the result of an international collaboration, although this proportion was much higher in sub-Saharan Africa (46.08%) and South Asia (23.43%). According to the specific MeSH terms used, articles focused mainly on “Pneumonia, Bacterial” (19.99%), followed by “Pneumonia, Pneumococcal” (7.02%) and “Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated” (6.79%).

In lieu of this, reports of elevated chitinase levels in ALS are interesting, as they are established surrogate markers of a chronic inflammatory response. While post-mortem studies have indicated glial expression, the cellular sources for these moieties remain to be fully understood. Therefore, the objective of this pilot study was to examine whether the peripheral immune system also contributes to chitinase dysregulation in ALS. The temporal expression of CHIT1, CHI3L1, and CHI3L2 in non-polarized monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMas) from ALS patients and healthy controls (HCs) was examined. We demonstrate that while CHIT1 and CHI3L1 display similar temporal expression dynamics in both groups, profound between-group differences were noted for these targets at later time-points i.e., when cells were fully differentiated. CHIT1 and CHI3L1 expression were significantly higher in MoMas from ALS patients at both the transcriptomic and protein level, with CHI3L1 levels also being influenced by age. Conversely, CHI3L2 expression was not influenced by disease state, culture duration, or age. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, that in ALS, circulating immune cells have an intrinsically augmented potential for chitinase production that may propagate chronic neuroinflammation, and how the ageing immune system itself contributes to neurodegeneration.","Gaur, Nayana; Huss, Elena; Prell, Tino; Steinbach, Robert; Guerra, Joel; Srivastava, Akash; Witte, Otto W.; Grosskreutz, Julian",Front Neurol,537,21

However, their specific mechanism is still unclear. This article mainly reviews the research progress in the structure, evolution, function, and mechanism of IFITMs, which may provide a theoretical basis for clarifying the molecular mechanism of interaction between the molecules and viruses and the research and development of new antiviral drugs based on IFITMs.","Ren, Linzhu; Du, Shouwen; Xu, Wang; Li, Tiyuan; Wu, Shipin; Jin, Ningyi; Li, Chang",Front Immunol,537,20

AIM OF THE STUDY: This systematic review aims to provide an insightful understanding of traditional uses, chemical composition, pharmacological effect and clinical application of T. hemsleyanum, and lay a foundation for the further study and for the utilization of T. hemsleyanum resource. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A domestic and overseas literature search in known databases was conducted for published articles using the relevant keywords. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-two chemical constituents identified from T. hemsleyanum have been reported, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, polysaccharide, organic acids, fatty acids, terpenoids, steroids, amino acid and others. Among these components, flavonoids and polysaccharides were the representative active ingredients of T. hemsleyanum, which have been widely investigated. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that these components exhibited various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antivirus, antitumor, antipyretic, anti-hepatic injury, immunomodulatory, antibacterial etc. Moreover, different toxicological studies indicated that the clinical dosage of T. hemsleyanum was safe and reliable. CONCLUSIONS: Modern pharmacological studies have well supported and clarified some traditional uses, and T. hemsleyanum has a good prospect for the development of new drugs due to these outstanding properties. However, the present findings did not provide an in-depth evaluation of bioactivity of the extracts, the composition of its active extracts was not clear. Moreover, they were insufficient to satisfactorily explain some mechanisms of action.

Here we report the first case series of 7 children diagnosed with MIS-C in Qatar. METHODS: Clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Sidra Medicine, Qatar from June to October 2020, who met the WHO case definition for MIS-C were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean age in our case series was 5.6 years, of which 71.4% were males. All patients were previously healthy but had a history of COVID-19 infection. Fever, rash, vomiting and abdominal pain were the most common symptoms (70–100%). The average hospitalization was 12.9 days with no case fatalities. Laboratory findings included lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in most patients, as well as evidence of coagulopathy and elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin and procalcitonin. Many patients (71.4%) required inotropic support in intensive care, while only one required respiratory support. Although all patients had elevated cardiac biomarkers, cardiovascular involvement was observed in 42.9% of patients with one patient developing a giant coronary aneurysm.

The recent identification of the genetic causes of steatohepatitis is revealing new avenues for more effective risk stratification. Discovery of the mechanisms underpinning the detrimental effect of causal mutations has led to some breakthroughs in the comprehension of the pathophysiology of steatohepatitis. Thanks to this approach, hepatocellular fat accumulation, altered lipid droplet remodelling and lipotoxicity have now taken centre stage, while the role of adiposity and gut-liver axis alterations have been independently validated. This process could ignite a virtuous research cycle that, starting from human genomics, through omics approaches, molecular genetics and disease models, may lead to the development of new therapeutics targeted to patients at higher risk. Herein, we also review how this knowledge has been applied to: a) the study of the main PNPLA3 I148M risk variant, up to the stage of the first in-human therapeutic trials; b) highlight a role of MBOAT7 downregulation and lysophosphatidyl-inositol in steatohepatitis; c) identify IL-32 as a candidate mediator linking lipotoxicity to inflammation and liver disease.

Although PEDV vaccines have been used widely, the disease has swept rapidly across the county, and is commonly observed in PED-vaccinated farms, and has recurred in domestic herds. To better understand PEDVs responsible for the reemerging outbreaks in Japan, full-length spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of 45 PEDVs collected in Japan during 2013–2016, were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis based on S gene sequences revealed that all the recent field PEDVs were genetically distinct from the classical Japanese strains, and were classified into three genotypes: North American (NA), S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Our data suggested a possibility that multiple parental PEDV strains were introduced into Japan from abroad at the same time or similar times. The newly identified Japanese strains showed the closest relationship to the US strains. Two sublineages of Japanese strains circulating in Japan were similar to two sublineages identified in the US, suggesting common ancestors for these strains. In comparison with two vaccine strains used in Japan, the field strains had various changes in epitope regions, glycosylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. These substitutions, particularly observed in epitope regions of the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins, may have affected antigenicity and vaccine efficacy, resulting in an unsuccessful PEDV control. Sequence comparisons between PEDVs collected from primary and secondary outbreaks in three herds revealed that the disease has developed to an endemic stage in which PEDV could persist for nearly two years in the herds or local regions, causing subsequent epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the genetic characteristics, origin, and molecular epidemiology of PEDVs circulating in Japan, as well as the PEDV strains causing recurrent outbreaks. This study provides a better insight into the PEDVs responsible for recent outbreaks in Japan, and could potentially help to develop measures for controlling and preventing the disease.

The rapid surveillance can select timely and appropriate interventions toward controlling the spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Farrington algorithm was originally proposed by Farrington et al (1996), extended by Noufaily et al (2012), and is commonly used to estimate excess death. However, one of the major challenges in implementing this algorithm is the lack of historical information required to train it, especially for emerging diseases. Without sufficient training data the estimation/prediction accuracy of this algorithm can suffer leading to poor outbreak detection. We propose a new statistical algorithm-the geographically weighted generalized Farrington (GWGF) algorithm-by incorporating both geographically varying and geographically invariant covariates, as well as geographical information to analyze time series count data sampled from a spatially correlated process for estimating excess death. The algorithm is a type of local quasi-likelihood-based regression with geographical weights and is designed to achieve a stable detection of outbreaks even when the number of time points is small. We validate the outbreak detection performance by using extensive numerical experiments and real-data analysis in Japan during COVID-19 pandemic. We show that the GWGF algorithm succeeds in improving recall without reducing the level of precision compared with the conventional Farrington algorithm.","Yoneoka, Daisuke; Kawashima, Takayuki; Makiyama, Koji; Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Eguchi, Akifumi",Stat. med,537,26

Clinical applications of antibodies often require large amounts of highly purified molecules, sometimes for multiple treatments. The development of very efficient expression systems is essential to the full exploitation of the antibody technology. Production of recombinant protein in the milk of transgenic dairy animals is currently being tested as an alternative to plasma fractionation for the manufacture of a number of blood factors (human antithrombin, human alpha-1-antitrypsin, human serum albumin, factor IX). The ability to routinely yield mg/ml levels of antibodies and the scale-up flexibility make transgenic production an attractive alternative to mammalian cell culture as a source of large quantities of biotherapeutics. The following review examines the potential of transgenic expression for the production of recombinant therapeutic antibodies.","Pollock, Daniel P; Kutzko, Joseph P; Birck-Wilson, Eszter; Williams, Jennifer L; Echelard, Yann; Meade, Harry M",J Immunol Methods,537,26

However, in the context of COVID‐19 where the immediate response to stopping the spread of the virus requires collective efforts and change, other sociopolitical factors need to be considered. Prior research points to health behaviors being impacted by neighborhood and national social relations, social identification, confidence in government and political orientation. This research, though, is generally piecemeal (or specific), tends to be cross‐sectional, and is usually not oriented to pandemics. These issues are addressed in the current research. A two‐wave study with a representative sample of Australians (N (Wave 1) = 3028) gathered during COVID‐19 examined sociopolitical factors at the local and national level as predictors of health behaviors one month later. Four models were tested. These encapsulated geographic levels (local or national) and two health behaviors (hand hygiene or physical distance). In the three of the four models, social identification was a significant predictor of health behavior, while controlling for sociodemographic and individual‐level measures. There were more mixed results for social relations and confidence in government. There is evidence that to better promote health behaviors sociopolitical factors need to be more prominent in public policy and health behavior models. HIGHLIGHTS: The goal of this study is to examine how sociopolitical factors impact physical distance and hand hygiene during the Australian COVID‐19 pandemic. Based on social cohesion literature and the social identity approach, we expected three social cohesion dimensions (social identification, confidence in government and social relations) to predict greater health behaviors one month later. Political orientation was also expected to predict health behaviors. The results show that social identification consistently predicts health behaviors, with weaker evidence for political orientation and confidence in the government, and mixed evidence for social relations. This research highlights the importance of considering and strengthening the sociopolitical context in our response to pandemics.","Cárdenas, Diana; Orazani, Nima; Stevens, Mark; Cruwys, Tegan; Platow, Michael; Zekulin, Michael; Reynolds, Katherine J.",Polit Psychol,537,16

This paper studies the effects of the partial relaxation of these travel restrictions in Europe during the summer months of 2020. It exploits the staggered start of the summer school breaks across German states as an exogenous shock to the travel opportunities of the population. While the school breaks also increased mobility within Germany, the event study regressions include disaggregated and time-varying controls for domestic mobility and local COVID-19-related restrictions. The resulting intention-to-treat effects of the relaxed travel restrictions show a significant and sizable increase of the COVID-19 incidence in German counties during the later weeks of the school breaks.","Backhaus, A.",,537,1

These viruses are spread by the fecal–oral route and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Foods may be contaminated at any time pre- or post-harvest; however, many outbreaks are associated with foods handled by infected restaurant workers. Produce may be contaminated by improper irrigation or fertilization practices, by the hands of infected pickers or processors, or as the result of adulteration during any stage of handling. Outbreaks have been commonly associated with foods which are served raw or only lightly cooked, such as molluscan shellfish, fruits and vegetables, and salads or products contaminated after cooking like frosted bakery products. The farming, shellfish, processing, transportation, and restaurant industries must maintain vigilance to reduce outbreaks of enteric virus illness. Intervention strategies to enhance product safety include increased industry and consumer education; changes in industrial practices, product management, and processing technologies; worker immunizations; and the development of improved monitoring tools for the detection of enteric viruses in foods.

In this study, we investigated the diversity of the virus in the context of SARS-CoV-2 spread in India. Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of the circulating viruses from all over India were collected from GISAID, an open data repository, until 25thJuly, 2020. We have focused on the non-synonymous changes across the genome that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the genomic signatures of the non-synonymous mutations demonstrated a strong association between the time of sample collection and the accumulation of genetic diversity. Most of these isolates from India belonged to the A2a clade (63.4%) which has overcome the selective pressure and is spreading rapidly across several continents. Interestingly a new clade I/A3i has emerged as the second-highest prevalent type among the Indian isolates, comprising 25.5% of the Indian sequences. Emergence of new mutations in the S protein was observed. Major SARS-CoV-2 clades in India have defining mutations in the RdRp. Maximum accumulation of mutations was observed in ORF1a. Other than the clade-defining mutations, few representative non-synonymous mutations were checked against the available crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the DynaMut server to assess their thermodynamic stability. We have observed that SARS-CoV-2 genomes contain more uracil than any other nucleotide. Furthermore, substitution of nucleotides to uracil was highest among the non-synonymous mutations observed. The A+U content in SARS-CoV-2 genome is much higher compared to other RNA viruses, suggesting that the virus RdRp has a propensity towards uracil incorporation in the genome. This implies that thymidine analogues may have a better chance to competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication than other nucleotide analogues.","Roy, Subrata; Nath, Himadri; Mallick, Abinash; Biswas, Subhajit",bioRxiv,537,1

It is hypothesized that the overall number of orthopaedic trauma encounters (OTEs), the number of OTEs related to both high and low severity injuries, and the proportion of OTEs related to high severity versus low severity injuries decreased compared with previous years. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of OTEs between 2016 and 2020. High and low severity OTEs were classified according to an algorithm created by the researchers. Data were statistically analyzed and compared with external data for traffic counts, motor vehicle accidents, and Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. RESULTS: A 45.1% decrease (P = 0.0005) was seen in OTEs from March and April 2016–2019 compared with 2020. The decrease began approximately 12 days before the shelter-in-place order. There was a 58.8% decrease in high severity injuries with a fracture (P = 0.013) and a 42.9% decrease in low severities injuries (P = 0.0003). The proportion of high to low severity OTEs was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of OTEs was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Michigan shelter-in-place order. A decrease in both high and low severity OTEs was found; however, there was no statistically significant change in the ratio of high to low severity OTEs compared with previous years. Although it is difficult to determine what portion of the decrease in OTE is attributable to the shelter-in-place order versus the COVID-19 pandemic in general, data suggest both play a role.

As a cost-effective and powerful method, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) plays an important role in numerically solving environmental fluid mechanics. Besides, with the development of computer science, an increasing number of researchers start to analyze pathogen transmission by using CFD methods. Inspired by the impact of COVID-19, this review summarizes research works of pathogen transmission based on CFD methods with different models and algorithms. Defining the pathogen as the particle or gaseous in CFD simulation is a common method and epidemic models are used in some investigations to rise the authenticity of calculation. Although it is not so difficult to describe the physical characteristics of pathogens, how to describe the biological characteristics of it is still a big challenge in the CFD simulation. A series of investigations which analyzed pathogen transmission in different environments (hospital, teaching building, etc) demonstrated the effect of airflow on pathogen transmission and emphasized the importance of reasonable ventilation. Finally, this review presented three advanced methods: LBM method, Porous Media method, and Web-based forecasting method. Although CFD methods mentioned in this review may not alleviate the current pandemic situation, it helps researchers realize the transmission mechanisms of pathogens like viruses and bacteria and provides guidelines for reducing infection risk in epidemic or pandemic situations.","Peng, Shanbi; Chen, Qikun; Liu, Enbin",Sci Total Environ,537,1

However, this success was not without cost, both economic and social. In our study, we examined the psychological wellbeing of New Zealanders during the COVID-19 lockdown when restrictions reduced social contact, limited recreation opportunities, and resulted in job losses and financial insecurity. We conducted an online panel survey of a demographically representative sample of 2010 adult New Zealanders in April 2020. The survey contained three standardised measures–the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the GAD-7, and the Well-Being Index (WHO-5)–as well as questions designed specifically to measure family violence, suicidal ideation, and alcohol consumption. It also included items assessing positive aspects of the lockdown. Thirty percent of respondents reported moderate to severe psychological distress (K10), 16% moderate to high levels of anxiety, and 39% low wellbeing; well above baseline measures. Poorer outcomes were seen among young people and those who had lost jobs or had less work, those with poor health status, and who had past diagnoses of mental illness. Suicidal ideation was reported by 6%, with 2% reporting making plans for suicide and 2% reporting suicide attempts. Suicidality was highest in those aged 18–34. Just under 10% of participants had directly experienced some form of family harm over the lockdown period. However, not all consequences of the lockdown were negative, with 62% reporting ‘silver linings’, which included enjoying working from home, spending more time with family, and a quieter, less polluted environment. New Zealand’s lockdown successfully eliminated COVID-19 from the community, but our results show this achievement brought a significant psychological toll. Although much of the debate about lockdown measures has focused on their economic effects, our findings emphasise the need to pay equal attention to their effects on psychological wellbeing.","Every-Palmer, Susanna; Jenkins, Matthew; Gendall, Philip; Hoek, Janet; Beaglehole, Ben; Bell, Caroline; Williman, Jonathan; Rapsey, Charlene; Stanley, James",PLoS One,537,16

PDCoV diarrhea was first reported in the US in early 2014, concurrently with co-circulation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus). The origin of PDCoV in pigs and also its sudden emergence or route of introduction into the US still remains unclear. In the US, since 2013–2014, the newly emerged PDCoV and PEDV have spread nationwide, causing a high number of pig deaths and significant economic impacts. The current US PDCoV strains are enteropathogenic and infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. Similar to PEDV infections, PDCoV infections also cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by transient viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and/or vomiting, followed by dehydration as the potential cause of death in nursing piglets. At present, differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is essential to control viral diarrheas in US swine. Cell culture-adapted US PDCoV (TC-PDCoV) strains have been isolated and propagated by us and in several other laboratories. TC-PDCoV strains will be useful to develop serologic assays and to evaluate if serial cell-culture passage attenuates TC-PDCoV as a potential vaccine candidate strain. A comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of epidemic PDCoV strains is currently needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and to develop an effective vaccine. This review focuses on the etiology, cell culture isolation and propagation, molecular epidemiology, disease mechanisms and pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.","Jung, Kwonil; Hu, Hui; Saif, Linda J.",Virus Res,537,1

We hypothesize that, in select patients, some complications of COVID-19 may be due to right-to-left (RTL) shunt. Shunt may be intra-pulmonary, or extra-pulmonary, and can cause paradoxical embolization, hypoxia and platypnoea orthodeoxia. Saline microbubble contrast echocardiography is a minimally invasive, inexpensive, bedside test that can detect, quantify, and define the anatomical substrate of intra-pulmonary and intra-cardiac shunts. The prevalence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population is high (20–30%) but is even higher in patients who have a stroke (50%). Thus, the striking absence of data on patients with PFO who develop COVID-19 suggests that this is being under-diagnosed. This may be because physicians and sonographers currently feel that screening for shunt is unnecessary. This could be an unintended consequence of guidance from several specialist societies to defer procedures to close PFO until after the pandemic. This may be counterproductive. Patients with shunt may be at particularly high risk of complications from COVID-19 and interventions to minimise RTL shunt could prevent paradoxical embolization and improve hypoxia in select high risk patients with COVID-19.","Rajendram, Rajkumar; Kharal, Ghulam Abbas; Mahmood, Naveed; Kharal, Mubashar",Thromb Res,537,1

Currently, an important percentage of patients in hemodialysis are elderly. This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 in this population and to determine risk factors associated with mortality. METHOD: Data was obtained from the Spanish COVID-19 CKD Working Group Registry, that included patients in renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation) infected by COVID-19. From March 18, 2020, to August 27, 2020, 1165 patients on hemodialysis affected by COVID-19 were included in the Registry. A total of 328 patients were under 65 years-old and 837 were 65 years old or older (elderly group). RESULTS: Mortality was 18.6% higher (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.8%-23.4%) in the elderly hemodialysis patients compared to the non-elderly group (see figure). Death from COVID-19 infection was increased 5.5-fold in hemodialysis patients compared to mortality in the general population for a similar period, and there was an age-associated mortality increase in both populations (see figure 1). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95% CI: 1.31-1.92), dyspnea at presentation (HR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.20-2.16), pneumonia (HR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.12-2.75) and admission to hospital (HR 4.13, 95% CI: 1.92-8.88) were identified as independent mortality risk factors in the elderly hemodialysis population. Treatment with glucocorticoids reduced the risk of death (HR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51-0.98) in aged patients on hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Mortality is dramatically increased in elderly hemodialysis patients affected by COVID-19. Age, dyspnea at presentation, pneumonia or hospitalization are factors associated with a worse prognosis, after adjusting dialysis population to other confounding factors.

The aims of this study were: a) to estimate epidemiological parameters of this wave including infection attack ratio, infection fatality ratio, and case ascertainment ratio, b) to assess the impact of public health interventions, and c) to examine what would have happened if those interventions had not been implemented. MethodsA dynamic, stochastic, individual-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model was developed to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression in the population of the Republic of Cyprus. The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use. ResultsBy May 8 2020th, the infection attack ratio was 0.31% (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 0.15%, 0.54%), the infection fatality ratio was 0.71% (95% CrI: 0.44%, 1.61%), and the case ascertainment ratio was 33.2% (95% CrI: 19.7%, 68.7%). If Cyprus had not implemented any public health measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 14th. The interventions averted 715 (95% CrI: 339, 1235) deaths. If Cyprus had only increased ICU beds, without any social distancing measure, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed by April 19th. ConclusionsThe decision of the Cypriot authorities to launch early non-pharmaceutical interventions limited the burden of the first wave of COVID-19. The findings of these analyses could help address the next waves of COVID-19 in Cyprus and other similar settings.","Gountas, Ilias; Quattrocchi, Annalisa; Mamais, Ioannis; Tsioutis, Constantinos; Christaki, Eirini; Fokianos, Konstantinos; Nikolopoulos, Georgios",,537,20

Actissist was developed by a multidisciplinary team of academics, clinicians, experts by experience and software engineers. Actissist has been tested in two trials, the first a proof-of-concept trial where Actissist was safe, acceptable and feasible, the second, a powered randomized controlled trial. Objective: This article describes how our multidisciplinary team designed and developed Actissist. This article describes: (i) how Actissist was informed by initial qualitative interviews and focus groups and an expert reference group; (ii) refinements made to the app based on ongoing user feedback; (iii) successes and challenges encountered; and (iv) learning points and recommendations for involving stakeholders in digital health interventions. Methods: Expert reference group meetings informed the development of Actissist and design of subsequent trials, which included individuals with lived experience of psychosis, clinicians, academics, computer scientists and software engineers. Person-centered stakeholder involvement was promoted using focus groups and qualitative interviews prior to the development of the app, which informed version one of Actissist. Interviews were carried out with participants who had used Actissist. Two further versions of Actissist were developed following additional rounds of testing. Results: Multidisciplinary working throughout the Actissist project led to the development, inclusion and improvement of the app design and content. These changes and features included non-directive and compassionate content, co-designed recovery videos, relaxation exercises, psychoeducation material, ability to “favorite” areas of the app that users found helpful, and goal-setting. Challenges to collaborative working included discrepancies between what stakeholders want and what is technically possible to deliver, resource pressures, trying to deliver desired features within the boundaries of fundamental trial design considerations, and power imbalances associated with multidisciplinary working. Conclusions: The involvement of stakeholders in the design and development and delivery of Actissist has been fundamental to our development approach.

Five thieves’ oil consists of a mixture of five oils: rosemary, lemon, clove, eucalyptus, and cinnamon. In this study, we performed gas chromatography, FTIR, and UV–vis spectroscopic analysis, as well as L-a-b color tests, contact angle determination, and surface tension determination. To verify its antibacterial activity, the metabolic activity and changes in cell membrane permeability of bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas were studied. As a result, it was found that among the constituent oils, the oils of clove and cinnamon were the least volatile and, at the same time, had the strongest antibacterial activity. However, a mix of all the oils also showed comparable activity, which was even more pronounced for the oils after 4 weeks of aging. This effect can be linked to the high content of terpene derivatives such as eugenol and cinnamaldehyde, which can cause changes in bacterial membrane permeability, affecting cell activity and survival. This study is the first to characterize the constituents of the popular folk medicine five thieves’ oil, confirming and explaining its strong antibacterial activity, thus constituting a significant contribution to contemporary health education.","Siejak, Przemysław; Smułek, Wojciech; Fathordobady, Farahnaz; Grygier, Anna; Baranowska, Hanna Maria; Rudzińska, Magdalena; Masewicz, Łukasz; Jarzębska, Małgorzata; Nowakowski, Piotr T.; Makiej, Aleksandra; Kazemian, Pardis; Drobnik, Paweł; Stachowiak, Barbara; Jarzębski, Maciej; Pratap-Singh, Anubhav",Molecules,537,16

Public health experts agree that the public health interventions of social distancing and face coverings will only be able to successfully curtail the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. when combined with the highly effective COVID-19 vaccines. The risk for severe COVID-19 is higher in Americans with highly prevalent metabolic and cardiovascular chronic conditions as well as vulnerable demographics, such as minorities and pregnant women. Unfortunately, experience with past unethical health practices can influence current vaccine confidence in people of color and women of childbearing age. Pharmacists are well-positioned in myriad health care settings across the nation to listen to these concerns and have the conversations necessary to increase vaccine confidence. Similar to effective roles pharmacists have had in other health prevention efforts like smoking cessation, pharmacists possess the motivational interviewing skills to guide patients from the “pre-contemplation” to the “action” stages of health behavior change. This nonjudgmental, mutual understanding will help identify the individual factors influencing vaccine decision-making and bring us closer to achieving “community immunity.”","Akpoji, Ukwen; Amos, Mary Ellen; McMillan, Katelyn; Sims, Sharanie; Rife, Kelsey",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),537,11

METHODS: This cross‐sectional, case‐control study aimed to compare SARS‐CoV‐2 T‐cell response by two different technologies, the analysis of IFN‐γ(+) CD8(+)/CD4(+) T cells by flow cytometry and the quantification of IFN‐γ release by ELISA‐related assay (without cell discrimination), both after SARS‐CoV‐2 stimulation among uninfected and convalescent HCWs. RESULTS: A high proportion of uninfected HCWs (53.8%) had pre‐existing IFN‐γ(+) CD8 T‐cell response after stimulation with at least one of the structural viral proteins S, M or N, while 35.9% had pre‐existing IFN‐γ(+) CD4 T‐cell response. This proportion was nearly or greater than 90% among convalescent HCWs. Interestingly, the magnitude of the response in uninfected was lower compared to that found in convalescent HCWs, using both methods. The concordance, quantifying the specific cellular response in convalescent HCWs, between both methods was 94.1% comparing CD8 T‐cell response and 89.7% comparing CD4 T‐cell response. This concordance was lower but still high in uninfected HCWs (76.5%) comparing CD8 T‐cell response and 71.8% comparing CD4 T‐cell response. CONCLUSIONS: The good concordance between the proportion of individuals with IFN‐γ release after SARS‐COV‐2 stimulation with the proportion of individuals with specific IFN‐γ(+) CD8/CD4 T cells found in this study drives IFN‐γ release assays to be a simple and easy way to determine the protective immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 in a wide population.","Vallejo, Alejandro; Vizcarra, Pilar; Quereda, Carmen; Moreno, Ana; Casado, José Luis",Eur J Clin Invest,537,1

Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to provide evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression, and accumulating evidence is emerging in support of using mindfulness apps yielding small-to-moderate treatment effects. The study was a 4-week randomized controlled trial with 561 university students and staff as participants, divided into a treatment group (mindfulness app) and an active control group (psychoeducational online content). Depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated as primary study outcomes. Saliva cortisol samples were also collected from a subgroup of the treatment arm (n = 29). Using the mindfulness app for four weeks resulted in small reductions in stress (d = .16), and depression (d = .16). Attrition was 28.0%. Subjects who practiced more did not experience additional improvement in wellbeing. Mindfulness apps offer modest but clear benefits to users in terms of improved mental health.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) causes fever, cough, sore throat, and in severe cases shortness of breath and death. To evaluate strategies, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Study Design Monitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days. Methods Our developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented. Results ARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. In Brazil, the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied between 2.56% and 6.50%. For the days when the forecasts outside the prediction interval, the percentage errors in relation to the worst case scenario were below 5%. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, and Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. Conclusion The proposed method for dynamic forecasting may be used to guide social policies and plan direct interventions in a robust, flexible and fast way. Since it is based on information from multiple databases, it can be adapted to the different realities, becoming an important tool to guide the course of politics and action against Covid-19 pandemic worldwide.","de Lima, C.

In EIDs, various symptoms persist even after recovery, and chronic fatigue is among those that are commonly reported. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of chronic fatigue syndrome on suicidality during the recovery phase among survivors of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). MERS survivors were recruited from five centers and prospectively followed up for 2 years. In total, 63 participants were registered at 12 months (T1), of whom 53 and 50 completed the assessments at 18 months (T2) and 24 months (T3), respectively. Suicidality and chronic fatigue were evaluated using the suicidality module of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. We analyzed the relationship between chronic fatigue and suicidality during the follow-up period using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). The suicidality rates were 22.2% (n = 14), 15.1% (n = 8), and 10.0% (n = 5) at T1–T3, respectively. Of the 63 participants, 29 had chronic fatigue syndrome at T1. The group that reported chronic fatigue syndrome at T1 was more likely to experience suicidality during the 2-year follow-up than the group that reported otherwise (RR: 7.5, 95% CI: 2.4–23.1). This association was present even after adjusting for potential confounders (RR: 7.6, 95% CI: 2.2-26.0).

We have optimized these B-factors, and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor the ‘Solubility-Weighted Index’ (SWI). Importantly, SWI outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools.

Nurses are not surprised by the level of misery and devastation that infectious diseases can cause. We have seen it all before. In every outbreak through history, nurses have responded to the dangers that direct engagement with such crises entails. The inherent risks nurses face in controlling potentially fatal pathogens are compounded by flaccid public policy and incompetent management, resulting in poorly resourced preparedness for the epidemics and pandemics that routinely punctuate our history. That nurses are repeatedly placed in such precarious work environments is an indictment on all involved. Over time, nurses responding to populations in crisis have learned not to rely too heavily on those occupying leadership positions for front‐line resources and protection or even early warnings or open disclosure about contagion risk, case numbers and outcomes. Once the danger has passed, the usual public expressions of gratitude for nurses who put themselves in harm’s way to help victims of these catastrophes seem to fade, amid hasty efforts to consolidate policies, processes and hierarchies back to the same settings that allowed the current crisis to flourish. So far in this pandemic, an unconfirmed number of nurses and other health workers have either died usually as a result of their involvement with infectious patients or become infected themselves. Data collection on this is haphazard at best, with nurse deaths absorbed within the aggregated morbidity data reported on during pandemics. This is despite nurses being the prominent professional workforce providing crucial front‐line interventions to protect public health. It is time nurses involved themselves with the overdue reformation of public health policies, information management and health systems that would seek to return nurses to precarious work environments and trivialize foreseeable risks to us, our communities and patients.","McDonald, Tracey",Int Nurs Rev,537,6

SUMMARY ANSWER: Out of the triage-negative patients whose blood samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over 6 months, 5.2% yielded positive results with a significantly higher rate in health care workers (HCWs) and a significant month-by-month increase in those with evidence of antibodies. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Patients of reproductive age are more prone to asymptomatic or minimal forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as compared to older age groups, and the identification of those with active infection and those already exposed (and probably immunized) is important for safety and cost-effective use of testing resources in the fertility setting. Data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in ART patients are limited and encompass short time frames; current rates are unknown. There is also no consensus on the optimal way of screening triage-negative ART patients in moderate/high-risk areas. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A prospective longitudinal unicentric study on triage negative ART patients (n = 516) and clinical staff (n = 30) was carried out. We analyzed 705 serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 sampled between 17 May 2020 (the first working day after lockdown release) up to 1 December 2020, to assess the positivity rates for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We collected data on the serological status for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 516 triage-negative men (n = 123) and women (n = 393) undergoing ART at a private fertility center and 30 HCWs that were at work during the study period. Antibodies were detected with a capture chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) targeting the highly Immunogenic S1 and S2 domains on the virus spike protein. We also analyzed the molecular test results of the cases exhibiting a positive serology. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The data showed that 5.2% of the triage-negative ART patients had a positive serological result for SARS-CoV-2, with an overall conversion rate of 2.1% for IgG and 4.6% for IgM. There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between sexes. The small cohort (n = 30) of HCWs had a markedly increased seroprevalence (12.9% for Ig M and 22.6% for IgG). The highest seropositivity in our cohort was recorded in November (16.2%). The IgM positivity rates revealed significant monthly increments, paralleling official prevalence rates based on nasopharyngeal swabs. No positive molecular tests were identified in cases exhibiting a solitary positive IgG result. We show that despite a 6-fold increase in the number of ART patients with a positive serology between May and December 2020, most of our patients remain unexposed to the virus. The study was undertaken in a high-risk area for COVID-19, with a 20-times increase in the active cases across the study period. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The geographical restriction, alongside the lack of running a second, differently-targeted immunoassay (orthogonal testing), could limit the generalizability and translation of our results to other fertility settings or other immunoassays. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The low positivity rates for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein seen at the end of 2020 imply that most of the fertility patients are still at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Until mass vaccination and other measures effectively diminish the pandemic, risk mitigation strategies must be maintained in the fertility units in the foreseeable future. Patients with a solitary IgG+ status are most likely ‘non-infectious’ and can elude further testing without giving up the strict use of universal protective measures. With increasing seroprevalences owing to infection or vaccination, and with the consecutive increase in test performance, it is possible that serological screening of ART patients might be more cost-effective than PCR testing, especially for the many patients with repeat treatments/procedures in a time-frame of months.

All authors declare having no conflict of interest with regard to this trial.","Manolea, Corina; Capitanescu, Andrei; Borș, Roxana; Rugescu, Ioana; Bechir, Melihan; Mehedintu, Claudia; Varlas, Valentin",Hum Reprod Open,537,20

Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies.

Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identity the risk factors, receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis was used for risk stratification. The baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 1.171, 95%CI = 1.049–1.306, P = .005) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.007, 95%CI = 1.002–1.011, P = .004) were identified as the independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 conditions, and the NLR-LDH grading system was developed to perform risk stratification. The baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR = 1.019, 95%CI = 1.004–1.306, P = .016) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (OR = 1.018, 95%CI = 1.004–1.035, P = .007) were identified as the independent predictors for disease progression of severe patients. Accordingly, The NLR-LDH grading system was a useful prognostic tool for the early detection of severe COVID-19. And in the severe patients, CRP and BNP seemed to be helpful for predicting the disease progression or death.","Liu, Jiacheng; Tu, Chao; Zhu, Muxin; Wang, Jianwen; Yang, Chongtu; Liu, Wei; Xiong, Bin",Medicine (Baltimore),537,26

AIM: To assess agreement on the etiology of abnormal liver biochemistries and diagnostic recommendations in COVID-19. METHODS: Twenty hepatology consultations were reviewed by three senior hepatologists who provided a differential diagnosis and diagnostic recommendations. Kappa agreement on the primary etiology was calculated. RESULTS: Kappa agreement between hepatologists on the primary etiology of elevated liver biochemistries was 0.10 (p = 0.03). Agreement was greater around drug-induced liver injury 0.51 (p < 0.0001) and SARS-CoV-2-related liver injury 0.17 (p = 0.03). Serial liver biochemistries were recommended in all consultations over other evaluations. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19, elevated liver biochemistries present a diagnostic challenge and can often be monitored conservatively.","Bloom, Patricia P.; Pasricha, Trisha S.; Andersson, Karin L.; Pratt, Daniel S.; Hashemi, Nikroo; Bhan, Irun; Viveiros, Kathleen",Dig Dis Sci,537,22

In particular, this study pays attention to formulating a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. METHODS: Incidence data of MERS-CoV from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study. A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions. RESULTS: Using the estimates of the transmission rates, the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods. Due to the superspreader, the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period; however, the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions. CONCLUSION: It turned out to be the intensive isolation and quarantine interventions that were the most critical factors that prevented the spread of the MERS outbreak. The results are expected to be useful to devise more efficient intervention strategies in the future.","Kim, Yunhwan; Lee, Sunmi; Chu, Chaeshin; Choe, Seoyun; Hong, Saeme; Shin, Youngseo",Osong Public Health Res Perspect,537,18

A follow-up study was performed on 147 asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province. Of 147 asymptomatic carriers, 50.0% were male, 50.3% cases were older than 40 years, and 43.8% were farmers, 68.7% cases were from north of Anhui Province. There were 16 asymptomatic carriers developed illness in the following 14 days isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases. The possible latent infection period was evaluated ranged from one to five days before onset, and the median time was two days. The second attack rate of 16 confirmed cases whom transferred from asymptomatic carriers was 9.7% (23/236), while 131 asymptomatic carriers caused 2.6% (24/914) close contacts infection, there was a significant difference of second attack rate among two groups (P＜0.001). Our study indicated that COVID-19 cases are contagious during the incubation period, and the close contact screening should be covered the incubation period. Furthermore, the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers was lower than that of confirmed cases.","Liu, Zhirong; Chu, Ruilin; Gong, Lei; Su, Bin; Wu, Jiabing",Int J Infect Dis,537,17

It is characterized by neovascularization in the retina and the optic disk. PDR clinical features contain highly intense retinal neovascularization and fibrous spreads, leading to visual distortion if not controlled. Different image processing techniques have been proposed to detect and diagnose neovascularization from fundus images. Recently, deep learning methods are getting popular in neovascularization detection due to artificial intelligence advancement in biomedical image processing. This paper presents a semantic segmentation convolutional neural network architecture for neovascularization detection. First, image pre-processing steps were applied to enhance the fundus images. Then, the images were divided into small patches, forming a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. A semantic segmentation convolutional neural network was designed and trained to detect the neovascularization regions on the images. Finally, the network was tested using the testing set for performance evaluation. The proposed model is entirely automated in detecting and localizing neovascularization lesions, which is not possible with previously published methods. Evaluation results showed that the model could achieve accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, Jaccard similarity, and Dice similarity of 0.9948, 0.8772, 0.9976, 0.8696, 0.7643, and 0.8466, respectively.

The symptoms of infection can be devastating or at the least very debilitating for vulnerable individuals. It is clear that the elderly are at most risk of the adverse impacts of the virus, including hospitalization and death. Others at risk are those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions and those with a hyper-excitable immune response. Treatment options for those with acute responses to the virus are limited and there is an urgent need for potential strategies that can mitigate these severe effects. One potential avenue for treatment that has not been explored is the microbiome gut/lung axis. In addition to those severely affected by their acute reaction to the virus, there is also a need for treatment options for those that are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and also those who have been adversely affected by the measures put in place to arrest the spread of the virus. One potential treatment option is photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. PBM has been shown over many years to be a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily deployed adjunctive treatment option for inflammatory conditions, pain, tissue healing and cellular energy. We have also recently demonstrated the effectiveness of PBM to alter the gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of consideration as a potential treatment for those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. The treatment may potentially be advantageous for those infected with the virus, those who have a slow recovery from the effects of the virus and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the isolation restrictions that have been imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liebert, Ann; Bicknell, Brian; Markman, Wayne; Kiat, Hosen",Aging Dis,537,1

In contrast, interferons are a crucial component of host antiviral immunity and can be directly suppressed by glucocorticoids. To investigate whether therapeutic interferons can compensate glucocorticoids-induced loss of antiviral immunity, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 387 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with quasi-random exposure to interferons and conditional exposure to glucocorticoids. Among patients receiving glucocorticoids, early interferon therapy was associated with earlier hospital discharge (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19–2.37) and symptom relief (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06–2.08), while these associations were insignificant among glucocorticoids nonusers. Early interferon therapy was also associated with lower prevalence of prolonged viral shedding (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10–0.57) only among glucocorticoids users. Additionally, these associations were glucocorticoid cumulative dose- and timing-dependent.

It effectively distinguished different communities of RNA having structural variation. It is found that at higher temperatures (348 K and above), 80% of the RNA structure is destroyed in both the SPC/E and mTIP3P water models. The thermal denaturation free energy change ΔΔG value calculated for the long-lived structure at higher temperatures of 348 and 363 K ranges from 2.58 to 2.78 kcal/mol for the SPC/E water model, which agrees well with the experimentally reported thermal denaturation free energy range of 2.874 kcal/mol of SARS CoV-NP at normal pH. At higher temperatures, the stability of RNA conformation is found to be due to the existence of non-native base pairs in the SPC/E water model.","Singh, Omkar; Venugopal, Pushyaraga P.; Mathur, Apoorva; Chakraborty, Debashree",J Phys Chem B,537,16

The exact mechanisms behind this association are less known. An implication for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 remains controversial. Some researchers have started looking into other potential actors, such as neuropilin-1, mitochondrial glutathione, vitamin D, and DPP4. In particular, neuropilin-1 seems to play an important role in the underlying mechanism linking COVID-19 and diabetic nephropathy. We suggest, based on the findings in this review, that its up-regulation in the diabetic kidney facilitates viral entry in this tissue, and that the engagement of both processes leads to a depletion of neuropilin-1, which was demonstrated to be strongly associated with the pathogenesis of DN. More studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, and research should be directed towards elucidating the potential roles of all these suggested actors and eventually discovering new therapeutic strategies that could reduce the burden of COVID-19 in patients with diabetic nephropathy.","Mourad, Diane; Azar, Nadim S.; Azar, Sami T.",Int J Mol Sci,537,22

Among its major functions are conservation of energy during starvation, recycling organelles, and turnover of long-lived proteins. Besides, autophagy plays a critical role in removing intracellular pathogens and very likely represents a primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism. More recent findings indicate that it has not only retained its ability to degrade intracellular pathogens, but also functions to augment and fine tune antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, viruses have also co-evolved strategies to manipulate this pathway and use it to their advantage. Particularly intriguing is infection-dependent activation of autophagy with positive stranded (+)RNA virus infections, which benefit from the pathway without succumbing to lysosomal degradation. In this review we summarise recent data on viral manipulation of autophagy, with a particular emphasis on +RNA viruses and highlight key unanswered questions in the field that we believe merit further attention.","Wong, Ho Him; Sanyal, Sumana",Semin Cell Dev Biol,537,5

Here, we explored the effect of injecting LA into the tail vein of middle-aged C57BL/6 mice on their cognitive ability as measured by the Morris water maze (MWM) test and cerebral blood flow (CBF). The related mechanisms were assessed via RNA-seq, and T (CD3e(+)) and B (CD45R/B220(+)) cells in the spleen and whole blood were quantified via flow cytometry. LA improved the cognitive ability, according to the MWM test results, and upregulated the CBF level of treated mice. The RNA-seq results indicate that LA affected the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, which is related to T- and B-cell proliferation, and the flow cytometry data suggest that LA promoted T- and B-cell proliferation in the spleen and whole blood. We also performed immune reconstruction via a tail vein injection of lymphocytes into B-NDG (NOD-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1)/Bcge) mice before treating them with LA. We tested cognitive ability by subjecting these animals to new object recognition tests and quantified the splenic and whole blood T and B cells. Cognitive ability improved after immune reconstruction and LA treatment, and LA promoted T- and B-cell proliferation in the spleen and whole blood. This study demonstrates that LA, by activating the IL-17 signaling pathway, promotes T- and B-cell proliferation in the spleen and whole blood of mice and improves cognitive ability.

The therapeutic effect of oxaliplatin on liver cancer is often limited by acquired resistance of the cancer cells. Abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway plays an important role in the acquired resistance of oxaliplatin. The present study investigated the effects of the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 and AKT inhibitor MK2206 on the chemosensitivity of oxaliplatin-resistant liver cancer cells and the molecular mechanism involved. An oxaliplatin-resistant liver cancer cell line HepG2(R) was developed. MTT assay, clone formation experiments, flow cytometry and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were used to determine the proliferation, cycle and apoptosis of HepG2(R) cells when oxaliplatin was combined with LY-294002 or MK2206 treatment. The effects of LY-294002 and MK-2206 on the abnormal activation of PI3K/AKT pathway and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α protein level in HepG2(R) cells were detected using western blotting. The results indicated that the PI3K/AKT pathway is stably activated in HepG2(R) cells. Compared with the AKT inhibitor MK2206, the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 more effectively downregulated the phosphorylation levels of p85, p110α, p110β, p110γ and AKT in the PI3K/AKT pathway in HepG2(R) cells, and more effectively inhibited the proliferation of the cells. LY-294002 enhanced the chemotherapy sensitivity of HepG2(R) cells to oxaliplatin by inducing G(0)/G(1) phase arrest and increasing the proportion of apoptotic cells. In addition, LY-294002 reduced the level of HIF-1α, which is highly expressed in HepG2(R) cells. It was concluded that LY-294002 enhanced the chemosensitivity of liver cancer cells to oxaliplatin by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which may be related to the inhibition of HIF-1α expression. These findings may have clinical significance for the treatment of oxaliplatin-resistant liver cancer.","Xu, Ruyue; Zhang, Yinci; Li, Amin; Ma, Yongfang; Cai, Wenpeng; Song, Li; Xie, Yinghai; Zhou, Shuping; Cao, Weiya; Tang, Xiaolong",Mol Med Rep,537,28

The phylogenetic trees based on the S1, M and N genes exhibited considerably different topology and the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type isolates were the predominant IBVs based on the phylogenetic analysis of S1 gene. Results of entropy of amino acid sequences revealed that the S1 gene had the largest variation; the M gene had less variation than the N gene. Positive selections were detected in not only S1 but also M and N gene proteins. In addition, five S1 gene recombinants between vaccine strain 4/91 and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type field isolate were confirmed. In conclusion, multiple IBV genotypes co-circulated; genetic diversity and positive selections existed in S1, M and N genes; 4/91 vaccine recombinants emerged in China. Our results show that field IBVs in China are continuing to evolve and vaccine strains may have an important role in the appearance of new IBV strains via recombination.

These include increased use of corticosteroids, immunosuppression following the viral infection, prolonged stays in the intensive care unit and sub-optimal laboratory testing available in the country. This article aims to assess the potential implications of a mucormycosis epidemic on a healthcare system already strained under the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides subsequent recommendations to weather the dual challenge of two deadly pathogens.","Asri, Sucharu; Akram, Muhammad Rizwan; Hasan, Mohammad Mehedi; Asad Khan, Fatima Muhammad; Hashmi, Nida; Wajid, Fareha; Ullah, Irfan",The International journal of health planning and management,537,20

An accurate estimate when HCV elimination will be reached is elusive. We have embarked on a nationwide HCV elimination project (CELINE) that allowed us to harvest detailed data on the Dutch HCV epidemic. This study aims to provide a well-supported timeline towards HCV elimination in The Netherlands. Methods: A previously published Markov model was used, adopting published data and unpublished CELINE project data. Two main scenarios were devised. In the Status Quo scenario, 2020 diagnosis and treatment levels remained constant in subsequent years. In the Gradual Decline scenario, an annual decrease of 10% in both diagnoses and treatments was implemented, starting in 2020. WHO incidence target was disregarded, due to low HCV incidence in The Netherlands (≤5 per 100,000). Results: Following the Status Quo and Gradual Decline scenarios, The Netherlands would meet WHO’s elimination targets by 2027 and 2032, respectively. From 2015 to 2030, liver-related mortality would be reduced by 97% in the Status Quo and 93% in the Gradual Decline scenario. Compared to the Status Quo scenario, the Gradual Decline scenario would result in 12 excess cases of decompensated cirrhosis, 18 excess cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 20 excess cases of liver-related death from 2020–2030. Conclusions: The Netherlands is on track to reach HCV elimination by 2030. However, it is vital that HCV elimination remains high on the agenda to ensure adequate numbers of patients are being diagnosed and treated.","van Dijk, Marleen; Brakenhoff, Sylvia M.; Isfordink, Cas J.; Cheng, Wei-Han; Blokzijl, Hans; Boland, Greet; Dofferhoff, Anthonius S.

Quantitatively, we analyzed the quality of recorded data according to missing information by the logistic regression analysis. The qualitative analysis identified six themes related to digitalization: satisfaction with the system, mothers’ resistance, need for training, double work, working environment, and other resources. The quantitative analysis showed that data entry errors improved around 10% to 80% based on odds ratios in subsequent quarters compared to first quarter periods. The number of registration numbers was not significantly related to the data quality, but the motivation, including financial incentives among HCWs, was related to the registration behavior.

With advances in genetics, biological aging can be calculated by telomere length. Telomeres are regions at the ends of chromosomes that play a role in the maintenance and integrity of DNA. With biological aging, telomere shortening occurs, causing cellular senescence. Several studies show that shorter telomeres are associated with acute and chronic diseases, stress, addictions, and intoxications. Even in the current COVID-19 pandemic, telomere shortening is proposed as a marker of severity in individuals infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On the other hand, healthy lifestyle habits increase telomere length and balance of various cellular functions, preventing diseases.","Teixeira, Marcus Zulian",Rev. Assoc. Med. Bras. (1992),537,1

METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study with prospective recruitment of volunteer families that included at least one first-reported adult case positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and at least one child aged less than 15 years living in the same household under strict home confinement was conducted in the Health Region of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the pandemic period April 28-June 3, 2020. All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood. RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.","Brotons, Pedro; Launes, Cristian; Buetas, Elena; Fumado, Vicky; Henares, Desiree; de Sevilla, Mariona Fernandez; Redin, Alba; Fuente-Soro, Laura; Cuadras, Daniel; Mele, Maria; Jou, Cristina; Millat, Pere; Jordan, Iolanda; Garcia-Garcia, Juan Jose; Bassat, Quique; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen",Clin Infect Dis,537,20

Recently, delayed skin reactions have been reported in 1% individuals following mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The exact pathophysiology and the risk factors still remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 6821 employees and patients were vaccinated at our institutions between February and June 2021. Every patient received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in our hospitals, and reported back in case of any side effects which were collected in our hospital managed database. RESULTS: Eleven of 6821 vaccinated patients (0.16%) developed delayed skin reactions after either the first or second dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Eight of 11 patients (73%) developed a rash after the first dose, while in 3/11 (27%), the rash occurred after the second dose. More females (9/11) were affected. Four of 11 patients required antihistamines, with two needing additional topical steroids. All the cutaneous manifestations resolved within 14 days. None of the skin reactions after the first dose of the vaccine prevented the administration of the second dose. There were no long-term cutaneous sequelae in any of the affected individuals. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that skin reactions after the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 are possible, but rare. Further studies need to be done to understand the pathophysiology of these lesions.","Hoff, Norman-Philipp; Freise, Noemi F.; Schmidt, Albrecht G.; Firouzi-Memarpuri, Parnian; Reifenberger, Julia; Luedde, Tom; Bölke, Edwin; Meller, Stephan; Homey, Bernhard; Feldt, Torsten; Jensen, Björn Erik Ole; Keitel, Verena; Schmidt, Livia; Maas, Kitti; Haussmann, Jan; Tamaskovics, Balint; Budach, Wilfried; Fischer, Johannes C.; Buhren, Bettina Alexandra; Knoefel, Wolfram Trudo; Schneider, Marion; Gerber, Peter Arne; Pedoto, Alessia; Häussinger, Dieter; Grebe, Olaf; van Griensven, Martijn; Braun, Stephan A.; Salzmann, Stefan; Rezazadeh, Amir; Matuschek, Christiane",Eur J Med Res,537,14

Multi-center study of consecutive patients with COVID-19 receiving CRRT. Primary outcome was CRRT filter loss. Sixty-five patients were analyzed, including 17 using an anti-factor Xa protocol to guide systemic heparin dosing. Fifty-four out of 65 patients (83%) lost at least one filter. Median first filter survival time was 6.5 [2.5, 33.5] h. There was no difference in first or second filter loss between the anti-Xa protocol and standard of care anticoagulation groups, however fewer patients lost their third filter in the protocolized group (55% vs. 93%) resulting in a longer median third filter survival time (24 [15.1, 54.2] vs. 17.3 [9.5, 35.1] h, p = 0.04).

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new COVID-19 test method that can deliver results in real time and on-site. In this work, we develop a fast, ultra-sensitive, and multi-functional plasmonic biosensor based on surface-enhanced infrared absorption for COVID-19 on-site diagnosis. The genetic algorithm intelligent program is utilized to automatically design and quickly optimize the sensing device to enhance the sensing performance. As a result, the quantitative detection of COVID-19 with an ultra-high sensitivity (1.66%/nm), a wide detection range, and a diverse measurement environment (gas/liquid) is achieved. In addition, the unique infrared fingerprint recognition characteristics of the sensor also make it an ideal choice for mutant virus screening. This work can not only provide a powerful diagnostic tool for the ultra-rapid, label-free, and multi-functional detection of COVID-19 but also help gain new insights into the field of label-free and ultrasensitive biosensing.","Li, Dongxiao; Zhou, Hong; Hui, Xindan; He, Xianming; Mu, Xiaojing",Anal Chem,537,16

However, reports of changes in sleep duration and associated factors are few. METHODS: Data were from an online survey of adults recruited via social media that included a question asking whether the respondent slept less or more after the onset of the pandemic. Analyses determined the association between changes in sleep duration and self reported sociodemographic and occupational information; beliefs about COVID-19; changes in sleep patterns; and responses pertaining to loneliness, anxiety, and depression. RESULTS: There were 5,175 respondents; 53.9% had a change in sleep duration. 17.1% slept less and 36.7% slept more. Sleeping more was related to greater education, being single/divorced/separated, unemployed or a student. Being retired, divorced/separated or a homemaker, and living in the Mountain or Central time zones were associated with less sleep. Beliefs that COVID-19 would result in personal adverse consequences was associated with both more and less sleep. However, the strongest associations with both more and less sleep were seen with depression, anxiety, and loneliness with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.92 (95% CI 1.67–2.21) for sleeping more and loneliness to 5.29 (95% CI 4.1–6.7) for sleeping less and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sleep duration since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were highly prevalent among social media users and were associated with several sociodemographic factors and beliefs that COVID-19 would have adverse personal impacts. However, the strongest associations occurred with worse mental health suggesting that improvements may occur with better sleep.","Batool-Anwar, Salma; Robbins, Rebecca; Ali, Shahmir H.; Capasso, Ariadna; Foreman, Joshua; Jones, Abbey M.; Tozan, Yesim; DiClemente, Ralph J.; Quan, Stuart F.",medRxiv,537,16

This report discusses the key elements of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 that can be readily treated: viral entry, the immune system and inflammation, and the cytokine storm. It is shown that the essential nutrients zinc, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), vitamin D and magnesium provide the ideal combination for prevention and treatment of COVID-19: prevention of SARS-CoV-2 entry to host cells, prevention of proliferation of SARS-CoV-2, inhibition of excessive inflammation, improved control of the regulation of the immune system, inhibition of the cytokine storm, and reduction in the effects of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated non-communicable diseases. It is emphasized that the non-communicable diseases associated with COVID-19 are inherently more prevalent in the elderly than the young, and that the maintenance of sufficiency of zinc, ω-3 PUFAs, vitamin D and magnesium is essential for the elderly to prevent the occurrence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases and cancer. Annual checking of levels of these essential nutrients is recommended for those over 65 years of age, together with appropriate adjustments in their intake, with these services and supplies being at government cost. The cost:benefit ratio would be huge as the cost of the nutrients and the testing of their levels would be very small compared with the cost savings of specialists and hospitalization.","Story, Michael J.",Biochimie,537,1

Due to its high prevalence, it constitutes the first cause of disability among the Americas, where only a very low percentage of the population receives the adequate evidence-based psychological treatment. Internet-Based Interventions (IBIs) are a great alternative to reduce the treatment gap for mental disorders. Although there are several studies in low-and middle-income countries proving IBIs' feasibility and acceptability, there is still little evidence of the effectiveness in diverse social and cultural contexts such as Latin America.

The present study evaluated changes in serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin (IL)-5 in atopic children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS: We recruited a total of 72 children with pneumonia. The patients were divided into 4 groups: atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group I, n=24), non-atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia (group II, n=23), atopic children with viral pneumonia (group III, n=13), and non-atopic children with viral pneumonia (group IV, n=12). Serum levels of IL-5, IL-13, VEGF, and tumor necrosis factor-α were measured at admission and at recovery using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were elevated in group I compared with the other groups at both admission phase and clinical recovery phase. In group I, serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were higher at recovery phase than at admission phase (VEGF: 1,102.2±569.4 vs. 874.9±589.9 pg/mL, respectively; IL-5: 150.5±63.9 vs. 120.2±46.7 pg/mL, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased in atopic children with M. pneumonia pneumonia than in the other groups. In this group, the serum levels of VEGF and IL-5 were more increased at recovery phase than at admission phase. The results of this study suggest that increases in VEGF and IL-5 may contribute to the development of hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia infection. These cytokines may act through their respective pro-inflammatory pathways to aggravate the allergic status and induce airway hypersensitivity during M. pneumonia pneumonia in atopic children.","Jeong, You-Cheol; Yeo, Mun-Soo; Kim, Joo-Hwa; Lee, Ha-Baik; Oh, Jae-Won",Allergy Asthma Immunol Res,537,16

In the presence of secondary infections, an understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus is crucial. The aim of this study was to characterize the transmission chains of MERS-CoV infection in the current South Korean outbreak. METHODS: Individual-level data from multiple sources were collected and used for epidemiological analyses. RESULTS: As of July 14, 2015, 185 confirmed cases of MERS have been reported in the Korean outbreak. Three generations of secondary infection, with over half belonging to the second generation, could be delineated. Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of virus transmission, affecting largely non-healthcare workers (154/184). Healthcare switching has probably accounted for the emergence of multiple generations of secondary infection. Fomite transmission may explain a significant proportion of the infections occurring in the absence of direct contact with infected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly available data from multiple sources, including the media, are useful to describe the epidemic history of an outbreak. The effective control of MERS-CoV hinges on the upholding of infection control standards and an understanding of health-seeking behaviours in the community.","Lee, Shui Shan; Wong, Ngai Sze",Int J Infect Dis,537,1

However, effective therapy for SVC is still scarce until now. Here we evaluated the inhibition of anisomycin (Ani), a metabolite produced by Streptomyces griseolus, on the replication of SVCV in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that Ani could suppress SVCV replication with the maximum inhibitory rate > 95% in epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. And the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of Ani on SVCV glycoprotein (G), nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein mRNA expressions were 21.79, 13.13 and 12.24 nM, respectively. Besides, Ani decreased SVCV-induced cytopathic effects and nucleus damages. As expected, Ani also showed a strong anti-SVCV activity in vivo, as indicated by inhibiting viral gene expression and increasing the survival rate of zebrafish. Intraperitoneal injection of Ani increased the survival rate of zebrafish by 30% and markedly inhibited the expressions of G and N mRNA by > 60% in kidney and spleen at day 1 and day 4 post-infection. Results so far suggest that Ani as a powerful agent against SVCV can be applied to the control of SVC in aquaculture.","Shen, Yu-Feng; Hu, Yang; Zhu, Bin; Wang, Gao-Xue",Virus Res,537,5

MERS-CoV had been associated with a high case fatality rate especially among severe cases. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of reported MERS-CoV cases between December 2016 and January 2019, as retrieved from the World Health Organization. The aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of reported cases and quantify the percentage of health care workers (HCWs) among reported cases. RESULTS: There were 403 reported cases with a majority being men (n = 300; 74.4%). These cases were reported from Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. HCWs represented 26% and comorbidities were reported among 71% of non-HCWs and 1.9% among HCWs (P < .0001). Camel exposure and camel milk ingestion were reported in 64% each, and the majority (97.8%) of those with camel exposures had camel milk ingestion. There were 58% primary cases and 42% were secondary cases. The case fatality rate was 16% among HCWs compared with 34% among other patients (P = .001). The mean age ± SD was 47.65 ± 16.28 for HCWs versus 54.23 ± 17.34 for non-HCWs (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV infection continues to have a high case fatality rate and a large proportion of patients were HCWs.

Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, and that the fomite route played a non-negligible role in the transmission.","Xiao, Shenglan; Li, Yuguo; Wong, Tze-wai; Hui, David S.

These circumstances not only increased affective symptoms and social isolation among community dwelling older adults but also alter the dynamics between them. Using network analyses, we study the changes in these dynamics before and during the lockdown. Community-dwelling older adults (N = 419) completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, and social isolation, before the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a cohort study, and during the lockdown period. The total scores of these questionnaires were compared across time. For the network analyses, partial correlation networks were constructed using items in the questionnaires as nodes, separately at both timepoints. Changes in edges, as well as nodal and bridge centrality were examined across time. Depression and anxiety symptoms, and social isolation had significantly increased during the lockdown. Significant changes were observed across time on several edges. Greater connectivity between the affective and social isolation nodes at lockdown was observed. Depression symptoms have become more tightly coupled across individuals, and so were the anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms have also become slightly decoupled from those of anxiety. These changing network dynamics reflect the greater influence of social isolation on affective symptoms across individuals and an increased vulnerability to affective disorders. These findings provide novel perspectives and translational implications on the changing mental health context amidst a COVID-19 pandemic situation.","Yu, Junhong; Mahendran, Rathi",Sci Rep,537,6

Blood samples were collected at hospital admission (T1) (Controls and COVID-19+ patients) and 0-72 h before hospital discharge (T2, alive or dead) to analyze systemic cytokines and chemokines, LPS concentrations, and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels. THP-1 human monocytic cell line was incubated with plasma from survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients and their phenotype, activation status, TLR4, and chemokine receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry. COVID-19 patients presented higher IL-6, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, TGF-{beta}1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1{beta}, and CCL5/RANTES levels than controls. Moreover, LPS and sCD14 were higher at hospital admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

Increased expression of CD16 and CCR5 were identified in THP-1 cells incubated with the plasma of survivor patients obtained at T2. The incubation of THP-1 with T2 plasma of non-survivors COVID-19 leads to higher TLR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR7, and CD69 expression.

We aimed to quantify the association between CeD and severe outcomes related to Covid-19. METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study, identifying individuals with CeD in Sweden, as defined by small intestinal villus atrophy diagnosed at all (n=28) Swedish pathology departments during the years spanning 1969–2017, and alive on February 1, 2020. We compared these patients to controls matched by sex, age, county, and calendar period. We performed Cox proportional hazards with follow-up through July 31, 2020, assessing risk of 1) hospital admission with a primary diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 (co-primary outcome); and 2) severe disease as defined by admission to intensive care unit and/or death attributed to Covid-19 (co-primary outcome). RESULTS: Among patients with CeD (n=40,963) and controls (n=183,892), the risk of hospital admission for Covid-19 was 2.9 and 2.2 per 1000 person-years respectively. After adjusting for comorbidities, the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 was not significantly increased in patients with CeD (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.80–1.50), nor was the risk of severe Covid-19 increased (HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.59–1.59). Results were similarly null when we compared CeD patients to their non-CeD siblings with regard to these outcomes. Among all patients with CeD and controls hospitalized with a diagnosis of Covid-19 (n=58 and n=202, respectively), there was no significant difference in mortality (HR for CeD compared to controls 0.96; 95% CI 0.46–2.02). CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, CeD was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 or intensive care unit and/or death attributed to Covid-19.","Lebwohl, Benjamin; Larsson, Emma; Söderling, Jonas; Roelstraete, Bjorn; Murray, Joseph A; Green, Peter H R; Ludvigsson, Jonas F",Clin Epidemiol,537,20

The present study pooled data of two similar clinical trials to provide further evidence for the antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan. METHODS: Individual patient data were analyzed from two randomized double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of carrageenan nasal spray in acute common cold. Patients with virus-confirmed common cold (n = 254, verum 126, placebo 128) were included and the following parameters were appraised: duration of disease, number of patients with relapses, number of respiratory viruses and viral titers at inclusion (visit 1) compared to days 3–5 (visit 2). RESULTS: Carrageenan treated patients showed a significant reduction in duration of disease of almost 2 days (p < 0.05) as well as significantly fewer relapses during 21 days of observation period (p < 0.05). The virus clearance between visit 1 and visit 2 was significantly more pronounced in the carrageenan group (p < 0.05). In both studies, virus-confirmed common cold was caused by three main virus subtypes: human rhinovirus (46%), human coronavirus (25%) and influenza A (14%) virus. Carrageenan nasal spray showed significant antiviral efficacy in all three virus subgroups, the highest effectiveness was observed in human corona virus-infected patients. The reduced duration of disease was 3 days (p < 0.01) and the number of relapses was three times less (p < 0.01) in carrageenan treated corona-virus-infected patients compared to control patients.

Retina, myocardium, lung, liver, kidney, vascular endothelium, and intestinal epithelium originated cells were included in the toxicity evaluation of CQ and HCQ, respectively. The proliferation pattern was monitored in 0–72 h by IncuCyte S3. CC50 and the ratio of tissue trough concentrations to CC50 (R(TTCC)) were brought into predicted toxicity profiles.

DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Any design with animal or human models examining a currently prescribed UK drug compared with a control, placebo or sham group, and reporting an effect on ACE2 level, activity or gene expression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OpenGrey from inception to 1 April 2020. Methodological quality was assessed using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk-of-bias tool for animal studies and Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for human studies. RESULTS: We screened 3360 titles and included 112 studies with 21 different drug classes identified as influencing ACE2 activity. Ten studies were in humans and one hundred and two were in animal models None examined ACE2 in human lungs. The most frequently examined drugs were angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (n=55) and ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (n=22). More studies reported upregulation than downregulation with ACE-I (n=22), ARBs (n=55), insulin (n=8), thiazolidinedione (n=7) aldosterone agonists (n=3), statins (n=5), oestrogens (n=5) calcium channel blockers (n=3) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists (n=2) and Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of the academic literature and media reports on the potential of drugs that could attenuate or exacerbate COVID-19 disease. This is leading to trials of repurposed drugs and uncertainty among patients and clinicians concerning continuation or cessation of prescribed medications. Our review indicates that the impact of currently prescribed drugs on ACE2 has been poorly studied in vivo, particularly in human lungs where the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to enact its pathogenic effects.

Yet how much a society should spend on healthcare is difficult to determine because additional health expenditures imply lower expenditures on other types of consumption. Furthermore, the welfare-maximizing (“efficient”) aggregate amount and composition of health expenditures depend on efficiency concepts at three levels that often get blurred in the debate. While the understanding of efficiency is good at the micro- and meso-levels—that is, relating to minimal spending for a given bundle of treatments and to the optimal mix of different treatments, respectively—this understanding rarely links to the efficiency of aggregate health expenditure at the macroeconomic level. While micro- and meso-efficiency are necessary for macro-efficiency, they are not sufficient. We propose a novel framework of a macro-efficiency score to assess welfare-maximizing aggregate health expenditure. This allows us to assess the extent to which selected major economies underspend or overspend on health relative to their gross domestic products per capita. We find that all economies under consideration underspend on healthcare with the exception of the United States. Underspending is particularly severe in China, India, and the Russian Federation. Our study emphasizes that the major and urgent issue in many countries is underspending on health at the macroeconomic level, rather than containing costs at the microeconomic level.","Chen, Simiao; Kuhn, Michael; Prettner, Klaus; Bloom, David E.; Wang, Chen",Soc Sci Med,537,14

Nevertheless, current evidence on the risk and benefits of continuing oncological treatment of cancer patients during the pandemic remains insufficient. We provide our experience in a center with high access for patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia in Lombardy, Italy. We conducted a retrospective study using a prospectively maintained database of patients admitted to our hospital between 25 February 2020 and 9 April 2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients with a history or current oncological disease were included in this study. Sixteen oncological patients (30.2%) died during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that age (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.17, p = 0.009), diabetes (OR: 15.05, p = 0.028) and active oncological disease (OR 13.60, p = 0.015) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. The mortality rate of the total number of cancer patients is about twice as high as that of non-oncological patients admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The presence of active oncological disease is independently related to mortality as well as age and diabetes. The majority of patients who died were frail. Careful evaluation of the risks and benefits of treatment in frail patients is needed, considering that difficult access to intensive care may have affected the mortality rate.","Cherri, Sara; Lemmers, Daniel H.

Of the non-pharmacological approaches in use, the biopsychosocial perspective supports parent-delivered interventions, in which parents themselves mediate pain relief, consistent with modern family-integrated care. This scoping review synthesizes the available research to provide an overview of the state of the art in parent-delivered pain-relieving interventions. Methods: A scoping review was performed to achieve a broad understanding of the current level of evidence and uptake of parent-driven pain- and stress-relieving interventions in neonatal care. Results: There is a strong evidence for the efficacy of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding, preferably in combination. These parent-delivered interventions are safe, valid, and ready for prompt introduction in infants' pain care globally. Research into parents' motivations for, and experiences of, alleviating infant pain is scarce. More research on combined parent-delivered pain alleviation, including relationship-based interventions such as the parent's musical presence, is needed to advance infant pain care. Guidelines need to be updated to include infant pain management, parent-delivered interventions, and the synergistic effects of combining these interventions and to address parent involvement in low-income and low-tech settings. Conclusions: A knowledge-to-practice gap currently remains in parent-delivered pain management for infants' procedure-related pain. This scoping review highlights the many advantages of involving parents in pain management for the benefit not only of the infant and parent but also of health care.","Ullsten, Alexandra; Andreasson, Matilda; Eriksson, Mats",Front Pediatr,537,1

This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells that attack the protective myelin sheath that surrounds CNS nerve axons. Upon demyelination, saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted, and patients experience neurologic deficiencies. The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with self-epitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction. In this review, we discuss an in vivo virus-induced mouse model of MS developed in our laboratory, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry-induced CNS autoimmunity.","Chastain, Emily M.

COVID-19 has significantly greater mortality in the elderly and comorbid patients which includes hip fracture patients. Non-operative treatment is not appropriate due to significantly higher mortality, and therefore, these patients are often exposed to COVID-19 in the peri-operative period. What is unclear is the effect of concomitant COVID-19 infection in these patients. METHODS: A multicentre prospective study across ten sites in the United Kingdom (responsible for 7% of hip fracture patients per annum in the UK). Demographic and background information were collected by independent chart review. Data on surgical factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, time to theatre, Nottingham Hip fracture score (NHFS) and classification of fracture were also collected between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020 with a matched cohort from the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Actual and expected 30-day mortality was found to be significantly higher than expected for 2020 COVID-19 positive patients (RR 3.00 95% CI 1.57–5.75, p < 0.001), with 30 observed deaths compared against the 10 expected from NHFS risk stratification. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection appears to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality in hip fracture patients. Whilst non-operative management of these fractures is not suggested due to the documented increased risks and mortality, this study provides evidence to the emerging literature of the severity of COVID-19 infection in surgical patients and the potential impact of COVID-19 on elective surgical patients in the peri-operative period.","Narang, A.; Chan, G.; Aframian, A.; Ali, Z.; Carr, A.; Goodier, H.; Morgan, C.; Park, C.; Sugand, K.; Walton, T.; Wilson, M.; Belgaumkar, A.; Gallagher, K.; Ghosh, K.; Gibbons, C.; Keightley, A.; Nawaz, Z.; Wakeling, C.; Sarraf, K.; Rogers, B.

To describe the life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, disease burden, and leading causes of mortality and disability in adults aged 65 years and older in the Region of the Americas from 1990 to 2019. METHODS. We used estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to examine the level and trends of life expectancy, healthy life expectancy, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS. Across the Region, life expectancy at 65 years increased from 17.1 years (95% uncertainty intervals (UI): 17.0–17.1) in 1990 to 19.2 years (95% UI: 18.9–19.4) in 2019 while healthy life expectancy increased from 12.2 years (95% UI: 10.9–12.4) to 13.6 years (95% UI: 12.2–14.9). All-cause DALY rates decreased in each older persons’ age group; however, absolute proportional DALYs increased from 22% to 32%. Ischemic heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the leading causes of premature mortality. Diabetes mellitus, age-related and other hearing loss, and lower back pain were the leading causes of disability. CONCLUSION. The increase in life expectancy and decrease of DALYs indicate the positive effect of improvements in social conditions and health policies. However, the smaller increase in healthy life expectancy suggests that, despite living longer, people spend a substantial amount of time in their old age with disability and illness. Preventable and controllable diseases account for most of the disease burden in older adults in the Americas. Society-wide and life-course approaches, and adequate health services are needed to respond to the health needs of older people in the Region.","Martinez, Ramon; Morsch, Patricia; Soliz, Patricia; Hommes, Carolina; Ordunez, Pedro; Vega, Enrique",Rev Panam Salud Publica,537,16

The dynamics of viral RNA concentration, particularly in the early stages of infection, can inform clinical measures and interventions such as test-based screening. We used prospective longitudinal quantitative reverse transcription PCR testing to measure the viral RNA trajectories for 68 individuals during the resumption of the 2019–2020 National Basketball Association season. For 46 individuals with acute infections, we inferred the peak viral concentration and the duration of the viral proliferation and clearance phases. According to our mathematical model, we found that viral RNA concentrations peaked an average of 3.3 days (95% credible interval [CI] 2.5, 4.2) after first possible detectability at a cycle threshold value of 22.3 (95% CI 20.5, 23.9). The viral clearance phase lasted longer for symptomatic individuals (10.9 days [95% CI 7.9, 14.4]) than for asymptomatic individuals (7.8 days [95% CI 6.1, 9.7]). A second test within 2 days after an initial positive PCR test substantially improves certainty about a patient’s infection stage. The effective sensitivity of a test intended to identify infectious individuals declines substantially with test turnaround time. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations peak rapidly regardless of symptoms. Sequential tests can help reveal a patient’s progress through infection stages. Frequent, rapid-turnaround testing is needed to effectively screen individuals before they become infectious.","Kissler, Stephen M.; Fauver, Joseph R.; Mack, Christina; Olesen, Scott W.; Tai, Caroline; Shiue, Kristin Y.; Kalinich, Chaney C.; Jednak, Sarah; Ott, Isabel M.; Vogels, Chantal B.

Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are related to individuals’ adherence to government measures. This study evaluated KAP toward COVID-19 among university students in Japan between May 22 and July 16, 2020, via an online questionnaire, and it further investigated the associated determining KAP factors. Among the eligible respondents (n = 362), 52.8% were female, 79.0% were undergraduate students, 32.9% were students whose major university subjects were biology-related, 35.4% were from the capital region, and 83.7% were Japanese. The overall KAP of university students in Japan was high. All respondents (100%) showed they possessed knowledge on avoiding enclosed spaces, crowded areas, and close situations. Most respondents showed a moderate or higher frequency of washing their hands or wearing masks (both at 96.4%). In addition, 68.5% of respondents showed a positive attitude toward early drug administration. In the logistic regressions, gender, major subjects, education level, nationality, residence, and psychological factors (private self-consciousness and extroversion) were associated with knowledge or attitudes toward COVD-19 (p < 0.05). In the logistic and multiple linear regressions, capital regions, high basic knowledge, high information acquisition, correct information explanations contributed positively to preventative action (p < 0.05). Non-capital regions, male gender, non-bio-backgrounds, high public self-consciousness, high advanced knowledge, incorrect information explanations, and high extroversion contributed negatively to self-restraint (p < 0.05). Moreover, self-restraint was decreasing over time. These findings clarify the Japanese university students’ KAP and the related factors in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they may help university managers, experts, and policymakers control the future spread of COVID-19 and other emerging infections.","Hatabu, Asuka; Mao, Xinhua; Zhou, Yi; Kawashita, Norihito; Wen, Zheng; Ueda, Mikiko; Takagi, Tatsuya; Tian, Yu-Shi",PLoS One,537,1

Therefore, the developmental time period of emerging adulthood, paired with the high-risk environment of college campuses, represents an important target for interventions. Attentional ability has recently emerged as a mediator of resilience to stress-related psychopathology and offers a potential neurocognitive target for interventions. We tested the hypothesis that attentional ability promotes resilience to binge drinking in a sample of 464 college students with (n = 221) or without (n = 243) familial risk for AUD. Two-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) tested effects of FH and self-reported binge drinking on attention scores from the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). In addition, mediation analyses tested whether BIS attention scores mediated the relationship between Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale scores and binge drinking. ANCOVA results indicated a significant FH-by-binge drinking interaction (p = 0.008) in which FH positive subjects who did not binge drink had the fewest attention problems, consistent with a marker of resilience. Furthermore, BIS attention scores significantly mediated the effect of Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale scores on binge drinking, with stronger effects in FH positive subjects (p < 0.001) than FH negative subjects (p = 0.49). The findings suggest that attention promotes resilience to binge drinking in individuals with familial risk for AUD. Interventions targeting attentional ability in this high-risk population, particularly FH positive individuals with attention deficits, may serve to reduce binge drinking and its consequences.","Elton, Amanda; Allen, J.

Successful pregnancy depends on adaptation of the woman's immune system to tolerate a genetically foreign fetus. Although the immune system changes are not well understood, a shift from cell-mediated immunity toward humoral immunity is believed to occur. These immunologic changes may alter susceptibility to and severity of infectious diseases in pregnant women. For example, pregnancy may increase susceptibility to toxoplasmosis and listeriosis and may increase severity of illness and increase mortality rates from influenza and varicella.

Past research on whether hyperchoice deteriorates decision experience is mixed. The present study hypothesizes the experience in the scenario of hyperchoice may be moderated by individual characteristics, including numeracy and age differences. A total of 116 older adults and 112 younger adults were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Along with the Rasch-based numeracy scale, each participant completed a consumer and a gamble choice task. In both tasks, the number of options being presented to participants was manipulated to create a hyperchoice condition (sixteen options) and a simple-choice condition (four options). Dependent variables were post-choice difficulty and satisfaction. Multiple regressions were performed with SPSS 24.0 to test the hypothesis. As a result, hyperchoice was related to greater decision difficulty in both choice tasks. Moreover, there was an interaction between numeracy and hyperchoice in the gamble task. Specifically, whereas higher numerate participants’ experienced difficulty and satisfaction were relatively stable between the two choice conditions, lower numerate participants experienced more difficulty and dissatisfaction in the hyperchoice condition than in the simple-choice condition. Additionally, compared to younger adults, older adults reported greater decision difficulty and lower decision satisfaction, regardless of choice condition. The study supported the notion that the specific effect of hyperchoice was moderated by individual factors. The study implied merchants should adopt strategies to ease decision experience and advocated for numeracy education.","Peterson, Natasha; Cheng, Jiuqing",Curr Psychol,537,28

Patients who were transferred from another facility with >24 hours stay and patients who died within 48 hours of hospitalization were excluded. METHODS: Elevated PCT values were determined based on each hospital’s definition. Antibiotic therapy and PCT results were evaluated for patients with no evidence of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) and patients with confirmed, probable, or possible bCAP. The added value of PCT testing to clinical criteria in detecting bCAP was evaluated using receiving operating curve characteristics (ROC). RESULTS: Of 962 patients, 611 (64%) received a PCT test. ROC curves for clinical criteria and clinical criteria plus PCT test were similar (at 0.5 ng/mL and 0.25 ng/mL). By bCAP group, median initial PCT values were 0.58 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR], 0.24–1.14), 0.23 ng/mL (IQR, 0.1–0.63), and 0.15 ng/mL (IQR, 0.09–0.35) for proven/probable, possible, and no bCAP groups, respectively. Among patients without bCAP, an elevated PCT level was associated with 1.8 additional days of CAP therapy (95% CI, 1.01–2.75; P < .01) compared to patients with a negative PCT result after adjusting for potential confounders. Duration of CAP therapy was similar between patients without a PCT test ordered and a low PCT level for no bCAP and possible bCAP groups.

This sudden halt to collective life meant that non-essential services were closed and many health promoting activities (i.e. physical activity, school) were stopped in their tracks. To curb the negative health impacts of lockdown measures, activities adapting to this new reality were urgently developed. One form of activity promoted indoor physical activity to prevent the adverse physical and psychological effects of the lockdown. Another form of activity included the rapid development of online learning tools to keep children and youth engaged academically while not attending school. While these health promoting efforts were meant to benefit the general population, we argue that these interventions may have unintended consequences and inadvertently increase health inequalities affecting marginalized youth in particular, as they may not reap the same benefits, both social and physical, from the interventions promoting at-home physical activities or distance learning measures. We elaborate on several interventions and their possible unintended consequences for marginalized youth and suggest several strategies that may mitigate their impact.","Alexander, Stephanie A; Shareck, Martine",Health Promot Int,537,14

However, it is difficult to mathematically measure how widespread the information is, especially for a general network structure. There have been studies on opinion spreading, but many studies are limited to specific spreading models such as the susceptible-infected-recovered model and the independent cascade model, and it is difficult to apply these studies to various situations. In this paper, we first suggest a general opinion spreading model (GOSM) that generalizes a large class of popular spreading models. In this model, each node has one of several states, and the state changes through interaction with neighboring nodes at discrete time intervals. Next, we show that many GOSMs have a stable property that is a GOSM version of a uniform equicontinuity. Then, we provide an approximation method to approximate the expected spread size for stable GOSMs. For the approximation method, we propose a concentration theorem that guarantees that a generalized mean-field theorem calculates the expected spreading size within small error bounds for finite time steps for a slightly dense network structure. Furthermore, we prove that a “single simulation” of running the Monte Carlo simulation is sufficient to approximate the expected spreading size. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks and show that our generalized approximation method well predicts the state density of the various models, especially in graphs with a large number of nodes. Experimental results show that the generalized mean-field approximation and a single Monte Carlo simulation converge as shown in the concentration theorem.","Choe, Byeongjin; Lin, Yishi; Lim, Sungsu; Lui, John C.

In addition, this study analysed the association of socio-demographic variables with KAP apart from finding the relationship between KAP. SUBJECT AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in India. Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. RESULTS: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables.

In response to the epidemic, a new crisis management program was implemented and tested in Taipei. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Having noticed that transmission surged on weekends during the Keelung epidemic, Taipei City launched a multi-channel mass risk communications program that included short message service (SMS) messages sent directly to approximately 2.2 million Taipei residents on Friday, October 12th, 2007. The public was told to keep symptomatic students from schools and was provided guidelines for preventing the spread of the disease at home. Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei's outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (mean±SD: 2.6±3.2 vs. 4.39±4.82 days, p = 0.03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1.2±1.7 days vs. 3.9±4.0 days, p<0.01). Taipei's program had a significant impact on patient compliance. Home confinement of symptomatic children increased from 10% to 60% (p<0.05) and helped curb the spread of AHC. Taipei experienced a rapid decrease in AHC cases between the Friday of the SMS announcement and the following Monday, October 15, (0.70% vs. 0.36%). By October 26, AHC cases reduced to 0.01%. The success of this risk communication program in Taipei (as compared to Keelung) is further reflected through rapid improvements in three epidemic indicators: (1) significantly lower crude attack rates (1.95% vs. 14.92%, p<0.001), (2) a short epidemic period of AHC (13 vs. 34 days), and (3) a quick drop in risk level (1∼2 weeks) in Taipei districts that border Keelung (the original domestic epicenter). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The timely launch of this systematic, communication-based intervention proved effective at preventing a dangerous spike in AHC and was able to bring this high-risk disease under control. We recommend that public health officials incorporate similar methods into existing guidelines for preventing pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Wu, Tsung-Shu Joseph; Chiu, Allen Wen-Hsiang; Wong, Wing-Wai; Wang, Po-En; Chan, Ta-Chien; King, Chwan-Chuen",PLoS One,537,24

No MERS vaccines are licensed for human use, reinforcing the urgency to develop safe and efficacious vaccines to prevent MERS. MERS-CoV spike protein forms a trimer, and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) serves as a vaccine target. Nevertheless, the protective efficacy of RBD in its native trimeric form has never been evaluated. In this study, a trimeric protein, RBD-Fd, was generated by fusing RBD with foldon trimerization motif. It bound strongly to the receptor of MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and elicited robust RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, maintaining long-term neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection. RBD-Fd potently protected hDPP4 transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that MERS-CoV RBD in its trimeric form maintains native conformation and induces protective neutralizing antibodies, making it a candidate for further therapeutic development.","Tai, Wanbo; Zhao, Guangyu; Sun, Shihun; Guo, Yan; Wang, Yufei; Tao, Xinrong; Tseng, Chien-Te K.; Li, Fang; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen",Virology,537,16

Minority communities are also more likely to have undiagnosed hypertension and T2D. Marshallese Pacific Islanders have been shown to have high proportions of diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension and T2D. Using survey and biometric data collected from 378 overweight/obese Marshallese Pacific Islander adults, this study documents the prevalence of hypertension and T2D, as well as the prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension and T2D. The study also examines associations between undiagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed T2D and age group, sex, health care access (defined by foregone care due to cost and health insurance status), and body mass index (BMI). Among participants with blood pressure readings indicative of hypertension, 68.4% were undiagnosed, and among participants with HbA1c indicative of T2D, 31.6% were undiagnosed. A quarter of participants (24.5%) had blood pressure and HbA1c measures indicative of both undiagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed T2D. Undiagnosed hypertension was significantly associated with age group (p’s<0.0001) and sex (p=0.028). Undiagnosed T2D was significantly associated with age group (p’s<0.05), forgone care due to cost (p=0.018), health insurance status (p=0.035), and BMI (p=0.001). Participants in this study had high proportions of undiagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed T2D. These findings will be immediately useful for those working to address hypertension and T2D disparities among Marshallese and other NHPI populations.","McElfish, Pearl A.; Scott, Aaron J.; Chatrathi, Harish E.; Rowland, Brett; Long, Christopher R.; Nagarsheth, Nirav; Calcagni, Mikaila; Patolia, Jay; Haggard-Duff, Lauren K.; Selig, James P.",Yale J Biol Med,537,1

This study aimed to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Overall, 690 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited between 1 January and 18 March 2020 from hospitals in Honghu and Nanchang; finally, 442 patients were assessed. Data were categorised into the training and test sets to develop and validate the model, respectively. FINDINGS: A predictive HNC-LL (Hypertension, Neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte count, Lactate dehydrogenase) score was established using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The HNC-LL score accurately predicted disease severity in the Honghu training cohort (area under the curve [AUC]=0.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.800–0.922; P<0.001); Honghu internal validation cohort (AUC=0.871, 95% CI: 0.769–0.972; P<0.001); and Nanchang external validation cohort (AUC=0.826, 95% CI: 0.746–0.907; P<0.001) and outperformed other models, including CURB-65 (confusion, uraemia, respiratory rate, BP, age ≥65 years) score model, MuLBSTA (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hypertension, and age) score model, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio model. The clinical significance of HNC-LL in accurately predicting the risk of future development of severe COVID-19 was confirmed. INTERPRETATION: We developed an accurate tool for predicting disease severity among COVID-19 patients. This model can potentially be used to identify patients at risks of developing severe disease in the early stage and therefore guide treatment decisions.

METHODOLOGY: The centers participating in the study were divided into three groups as tertiary referral centers, state hospitals and private practice hospitals. The number of outpatients, inpatients, daily interventions and urological surgeries were recorded prospectively between 9‐March‐2020 and 31‐May‐2020. All these variables were recorded for the same time interval of 2019 as well. The weekly change of the workload of urology during pandemic period was evaluated; also the workload of urology and the distributions of certain urological surgeries were compared between the pandemic period and the same time interval of the year 2019. RESULTS: A total of 51 centers participated in the study. The number of outpatients, inpatients, urological surgeries and daily interventions were found to be dramatically decreased by the third week of pandemics in state hospitals and tertiary referral centers; however the daily urological practice were similar in private practice hospitals throughout the pandemic period. When the workload of urology in pandemic period and the same time interval of the year 2019 were compared; a huge decrease was observed in all variables during pandemic period. However, temporary measures like ureteral stenting, nephrostomy placement and percutaneous cystostomy have been found to increase during Covid‐19 pandemic compared to normal life. CONCLUSIONS: Covid‐19 pandemic significantly effected the routine daily urological practice likewise other subspecialties and priority was given to emergent and non‐deferrable surgeries by urologists in concordance with published clinical guidelines.","Bozkurt, Ozan; Sen, Volkan; Irer, Bora; Sagnak, Levent; Onal, Bulent; Tanidir, Yiloren; Karabay, Emre; Kaya, Coskun; Ceyhan, Erman; Baser, Aykut; Duran, Mesut Berkan; Suer, Evren; Celen, Ilker; Selvi, Ismail; Ucer, Oktay; Karakoc, Sedat; Sarikaya, Ege; Ozden, Ender; Deger, Dogan; Egriboyun, Sedat; Ongun, Sakir; Gurboga, Ozgur; Asutay, Mehmet Kazim; Kazaz, Ilke Onur; Yilmaz, Ismail Onder; Kisa, Erdem; Demirkiran, Engin Denizhan; Horsanali, Ozan; Akarken, Ilker; Kizer, Onur; Eren, Huseyin; Ucar, Murat; Cebeci, Oguz Ozden; Kizilay, Fuat; Comez, Kaan; Mercimek, Mehmet Necmettin; Ozkent, Mehmet Serkan; Izol, Volkan; Gudeloglu, Ahmet; Ozturk, Bilgin; Akbaba, Kaan Turker; Polat, Salih; Gucuk, Adnan; Ziyan, Avni; Selcuk, Berin; Akdeniz, Firat; Turgut, Hasan; Sabuncu, Kubilay; Kaygisiz, Onur; Ersahin, Veli; Ibrahim Kahraman, Halil; Guzelsoy, Muhammet; Demir, Omer",Int J Clin Pract,537,16

We designed and implemented pharmaceutical and healthy lifestyle interventions for patients with diabetes and/or hypertension in rural primary care, and assessed their effectiveness at reducing severe CVD events. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a pragmatic, parallel group, 2-arm, controlled, superiority, cluster trial design. We randomised 67 township hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, to intervention (34) or control (33). A total of 31,326 participants were recruited, with 15,380 in the intervention arm and 15,946 in the control arm. Participants had no known CVD and were either patients with hypertension and a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher, or patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of their CVD risk. The intervention included prescription of a standardised package of medicines, individual advice on lifestyle change, and adherence support. Control was usual hypertension and diabetes care. In both arms, as usual in China, most outpatient drug costs were out of pocket. The primary outcome was severe CVD events, including coronary heart disease and stroke, during 36 months of follow-up, as recorded by the CVD surveillance system. The study was implemented between December 2013 and May 2017. A total of 13,385 (87%) and 14,745 (92%) participated in the intervention and control arms, respectively. Their mean age was 64 years, 51% were women, and 90% were farmers. Of all participants, 64% were diagnosed with hypertension with or without diabetes, and 36% were diagnosed with diabetes only. All township hospitals and participants completed the 36-month follow-up. At 36 months, there were 762 and 874 severe CVD events in the intervention and control arms, respectively, yielding a non-significant effect on CVD incidence rate (1.92 and 2.01 per 100 person-years, respectively; crude incidence rate ratio = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.74, 1.08; P = 0.259]). We observed significant, but small, differences in the change from baseline to follow-up for systolic blood pressure (−1.44 mm Hg [95% CI: −2.26, −0.62; P < 0.001]) and diastolic blood pressure (−1.29 mm Hg [95% CI: −1.77, −0.80; P < 0.001]) in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. Self-reported adherence to recommended medicines was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared with the control arm at 36 months. No safety concerns were identified. Main study limitations include all participants being informed about their high CVD risk at baseline, non-blinding of participants, and the relatively short follow-up period available for judging potential changes in rates of CVD events. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive package of pharmaceutical and healthy lifestyle interventions did not reduce severe CVD events over 36 months. Improving health system factors such as universal coverage for the cost of essential medicines is required for successful risk-based CVD prevention programmes.

OBJECTIVE: To describe how the existing teleneurology populations at two academic MS Centers changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we captured all in-person and teleneurology visits at two academic MS Centers between January 2019 and April 2020. We compared group differences between the Centers, and COVID-related changes using T-, chi-squared Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: 2268 patients completed 2579 teleneurology visits (mean age 48.3 ± 13.3 years, 72.9% female). Pre-COVID, the Centers’ teleneurology populations were similar for age, sex, MS type, and disability level (all p > 0.1), but differed for race (96.5% vs 80.7% white, p ≤ 0.001), MS treatment (49.1% vs 32.1% infusible, p ≤ 0.001), and median distance from Center (72 vs 186 miles, p ≤ 0.001).

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV in 934 sera and self-collected throat washes and fecal samples from 271 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS managed at a single institution. RESULTS: SARS-CoV detection rates in sera were highest in the first 9 days of illness, whereas detection was highest in throat washes 5–14 days after onset of symptoms. The highest SARS-CoV RT-PCR rates (70.4–86.3%) and viral loads (log(10 )4.5–6.1) were seen in fecal samples collected 2–4 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Fecal samples were frequently SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive beyond 40 days, and occasional sera still had SARS-CoV detected after 3 weeks of illness. CONCLUSION: In the context of an extensive outbreak with major pressure on hospital resources, patient self-collected samples are an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirates for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV infection.","He, Zhongping; Zhuang, Hui; Zhao, Chunhui; Dong, Qingming; Peng, Guoai; Dwyer, Dominic E",Virol J,537,29

However, due to the novel nature of the COVID-19, there is a lack of evidence about the specific risks of the disease in this patient group. This systematic review aims to summarize the current international clinical guidelines to highlight areas where research is needed through critical appraisal of the evidence base of these guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines about the usage of immunosuppressants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic databases including MEDLINE and the websites of relevant professional bodies were searched for English language guidelines that were published or updated between March 2020 and May 2020 in this area. We assessed the quality and consistency of guidelines. The evidence base underpinning these guidelines was critically appraised using GRADE criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-three guidelines were included. Most guidelines (n = 15, 65.2%) informed and updated evidence based on expert opinion. The methodological quality of the guidelines varied, ranging from ‘very low’ to ‘moderate’. Guidelines consistently recommended that high-risk patients, including those who are taking high doses of steroids for more than a month, or a combination of two or more immunosuppressants, should be shielding during the outbreak. Most guidelines stated that steroids usage should not be stopped abruptly and advised on individualized risk–benefit analysis considering the risk of the effect of COVID-19 infection and the relapse of the autoimmune condition in patients. DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines on taking immunosuppressants during the COVID-19 outbreak vary in quality. The level of evidence informing the available guidelines was generally low. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, the guidelines draw on existing knowledge and data, refer to the use of immunosuppressants and risks of serious infections of other aetiologies and have extrapolated these to form their evidence base.","Barlow-Pay, Fenella; Htut, Thura Win; Khezrian, Mina; Myint, Phyo Kyaw",Ther Adv Drug Saf,537,24

RESULTS: Majority of patients are Omani in nationality (n=181, 58%). Multivariate logistic regression identified 8 independent predictors of ICU admission that were included in the clinical score: hospitalization (OR, 1.079; 95% CI, 1.058 - 1.100), absolute lymphocyte count (OR, 0.526; 95%CI, 0.379- 0.729), C-reactive protein (OR, 1.009; 95%CI, 1.006-1.011), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.0008; 95%CI, 1.0004-1.0012), CURB-65 score (OR, 2.666; 95%CI, 2.212-3.213), chronic kidney disease with estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 70 (OR, 0.249; 95%CI, 0.155-0.402), shortness of breath (OR, 3.494; 95%CI, 2.528-6.168), and bilateral infiltrates in chest radiography (OR, 6.335; 95%CI, 3.427-11.713). The mean of area under a curve (AUC) from the development cohort was 0.86 (95%CI, 0.85-0.87) and of the validation cohort was 0.85 (95%CI, 0.82-0.88).

The aim of this review was to study how often and to what extent COVID-19 causes myocardial injury and whether this is an important contributor to outcome with implications for management. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline and Embase. Myocardial injury was defined as elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with at least one value > 99th percentile of the upper reference limit. The primary outcome measure was mortality, whereas secondary outcome measures were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Four studies and one review were included. The presence of myocardial injury varied between 9.6 and 46.3%. Myocardial injury was associated with a higher mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 5.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.48–8.80) and more ICU admissions (RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.07–6.89). The results regarding length of hospital stay were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Patients with myocardial injury might be classified as high-risk patients, with probably a higher mortality rate and a larger need for ICU admission. cTn levels can be used in risk stratification models and can indicate which patients potentially benefit from early medication administration. We recommend measuring cTn levels in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital or who deteriorate during admission.

However, the difference in the sociocultural contexts between countries requires the specific adjustment of these estimates to each scenario. This article analyses the main elements used for the construction of models from epidemiological patterns, to describe the interaction, explain the dynamics of infection and recovery, and to predict possible scenarios that may arise with the introduction of public health measures such as social distancing and quarantines, specifically in the case of the pandemic unleashed by the new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 virus.

Predominately identified CD4(+)T cell subsets, Th1, Th2, Th17, as well as regulatory T (Treg) cells, play crucial roles in several immunological and pathological conditions. Considering the variations in cell counts among populations and ethnicities, specific CD4(+)T cell subset reference values need to be locally established to enable meaningful comparisons and accurate data interpretation in clinical and research settings. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish distributions and reference ranges for blood CD4(+)T cell subpopulations in age- and sex-balanced healthy adults of a Han Chinese population in Shanxi Province, North China. METHODS: Peripheral blood CD4(+)T cell subsets were examined in 150 healthy volunteers (75 males, 75 females) aged 20–70 years with a four-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer. RESULTS: Reference value percentages (absolute counts, cells/μl) were defined as 95% of the population for cell types as follows: CD4(+)T, 23.78–51.07 (360–1127); Th1, 0.43–39.62 (2.64–276.21); Th2, 0.27–3.57 (1.80–27.14); Th17, 0.22–2.62 (1.10–19.54); and Treg, 2.17–7.94 (13.47–64.58). The ranges for the Th1:Th2 and Th17:Treg ratios were 0.59–52.37 and 0.04–0.76, respectively. Notably, a significant increase was observed in the values of Treg cells in older individuals, and the numbers of Treg cells in females also tended to decrease when compared to those in males. Therefore, we established the distribution and reference range of CD4(+)T cell subsets based on age and sex, demonstrating the lowest values of Treg cells in younger females. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data provide population-, age-, and sex-specific distributions and reference ranges of circulating CD4(+)T cell subpopulations, which can be adopted to guide clinical decisions and interpretation of immunophenotyping data in the Han Chinese population in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China. In addition, the low expression of peripheral Treg cells in younger females may be associated with the predisposition of females to autoimmune diseases.","Niu, Hong-Qing; Zhao, Xiang-Cong; Li, Wei; Xie, Jian-Fang; Liu, Xiao-Qing; Luo, Jing; Zhao, Wen-Peng; Li, Xiao-Feng",BMC Immunol,537,0

Despite this, rather little is known about when and how to effectively communicate these uncertainties. The focus in the medical literature so far has been on how patients respond to mentions of uncertainty relating to diagnosis or treatment, showing that these can have detrimental effects on trust and satisfaction. On the other hand, how patients are affected by these communications over time, particularly in the face of conflicting information, has received little attention. This is particularly important in the context a novel pandemic where uncertainty is rife and information changes over time. To fill this gap, we conducted an online study with UK participants on hypothetical communications relating to COVID-19 vaccines. Participants first read a vaccine announcement, which either communicated with certainty or uncertainty, and then received information which conflicted with the announcement. Those who were exposed to the certain announcement reported a greater loss of trust and vaccination intention than those who were exposed to the uncertain announcement. This shows that communicating with unwarranted certainty can backfire in the long-term, whereas communicating uncertainties can protect people from the negative impact of exposure to conflicting information.","Batteux, E.; Avri, B.; Johnson, S.

METHODS: In this Institution Review Board approved study, we retrospectively evaluated COVID-19 patients treated in our tertiary center from March to November 2020 who underwent an unenhanced chest CT scan within three weeks from hospitalization.We recorded the mean Hounsfield Unit (Hu) value of the right paravertebral muscle at the level of the 12(th) thoracic vertebra, the hospitalization unit (ICU and COVID-19 wards), clinical symptoms, Barthel Index, and laboratory findings.Logistic regression analysis was applied to assess if muscle loss (Hu<30) is a predictor of ICU admission and outcome.Fisher’s exact and Student’s tests were applied to evaluate if differences between patients with and without muscle loss occurred (p<0.05). RESULTS: One-hundred-fifty patients matched the inclusion criteria (46 females; mean age±SD 61.3±15 years-old), 36 treated in ICU. Patients in ICU showed significantly lower Hu values (29±24 vs 39.4±12, p = 0.001). Muscle loss was a predictor of ICU admission (p = 0.004).Patients with muscle loss were significantly older (73.4±10 vs 56.4±14 years), had lower Barthel Index scores (54.4±33 vs 85.1±26), red blood-cell count (3.9±1 vs 4.6±1×10(12)L(−1)), and Hb levels (11.5±2 vs 13.2±2g/l) as well as higher white blood-cell count (9.4±7 vs 7.2±4×10(9)L(−1)), C-reactive protein (71.5±71 vs 44±48U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (335±163 vs 265.8±116U/L) (p<0.05, each).

Here, we propose how the technology underlying digital contact tracing could be harnessed to boost vaccine coverage among these individuals. In order to assess the impact of this “hot-spotting” proposal we model the spread of disease using percolation theory, a collection of analytical techniques from statistical physics. Furthermore, we introduce a novel measure which we call the efficiency, defined as the percentage decrease in the reproduction number per percentage of the population vaccinated. We find that optimal implementations of the proposal can achieve herd immunity with as little as half as many vaccine doses as a non-targeted strategy, and is attractive even for relatively low rates of app usage.","Penney, Mark D.; Yargic, Yigit; Smolin, Lee; Thommes, Edward W.; Anand, Madhur; Bauch, Chris T.",PLoS One,537,17

We develop and implement an algorithm to provide optimal re-routing strategies to either transfer patients requiring Intensive Care Units (ICU) or ventilators, constrained by feasibility of transfer. We validate our approach with realistic data from the United Kingdom and Spain. In the UK, we consider the National Health Service at the level of trusts and define a 4-regular geometric graph which indicates the four nearest neighbours of any given trust. In Spain we coarse-grain the healthcare system at the level of autonomous communities, and extract similar contact networks. Through random search optimisation we identify the best load sharing strategy, where the cost function to minimise is based on the total number of ICU units above capacity. Our framework is general and flexible allowing for additional criteria, alternative cost functions, and can be extended to other resources beyond ICU units or ventilators. Assuming a uniform ICU demand, we show that it is possible to enable access to ICU for up to 1000 additional cases in the UK in a single step of the algorithm. Under a more realistic and heterogeneous demand, our method is able to balance about 600 beds per step in the Spanish system only using local sharing, and over 1300 using countrywide sharing, potentially saving a large percentage of these lives that would otherwise not have access to ICU.","Lacasa, Lucas; Challen, Robert; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Danon, Leon",PLoS One,537,27

More recently, WT has been included in several Positive Interventions (PI) as a useful tool to promote psychological well-being.

Finally, the novel applications of writing techniques from a positive psychology perspective will be analyzed. Accordingly, the applications of WT for promoting forgiveness, gratitude, wisdom and other positive dimensions will be illustrated. The results of this review show that WT yield therapeutic effects on symptoms and distress, but it also promotes psychological well-being.

As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.","Brett, Tobias S.; O’Dea, Eamon B.; Marty, Éric; Miller, Paige B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.; Rohani, Pejman",PLoS Comput Biol,537,12

Hydroxychloroquine administered orally to COVID-19 patients was ineffective, but its antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions were observed in vitro. The lack of efficacy in vivo could be due to the inefficiency of the oral route in attaining high drug concentration in the lungs. Delivering hydroxychloroquine by inhalation may be a promising alternative for direct targeting with minimal systemic exposure. This paper reports on the characterisation of isotonic, pH-neutral hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQS) solutions for nebulisation for COVID-19. They can be prepared, sterilised, and nebulised for testing as an investigational new drug for treating this infection. The 20, 50, and 100 mg/mL HCQS solutions were stable for at least 15 days without refrigeration when stored in darkness. They were atomised from Aerogen Solo Ultra vibrating mesh nebulisers (1 mL of each of the three concentrations and, in addition, 1.5 mL of 100 mg/mL) to form droplets having a median volumetric diameter of 4.3–5.2 µm, with about 50–60% of the aerosol by volume < 5 µm. The aerosol droplet size decreased (from 4.95 to 4.34 µm) with increasing drug concentration (from 20 to 100 mg/mL). As the drug concentration and liquid volume increased, the nebulisation duration increased from 3 to 11 min. The emitted doses ranged from 9.1 to 75.9 mg, depending on the concentration and volume nebulised. The HCQS solutions appear suitable for preclinical and clinical studies for potential COVID-19 treatment.","Tai, Waiting; Chow, Michael Yee Tak; Chang, Rachel Yoon Kyung; Tang, Patricia; Gonda, Igor; MacArthur, Robert B.; Chan, Hak-Kim; Kwok, Philip Chi Lip",Pharmaceutics,537,5

Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab—or protocol—specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein-coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic variants removed, and we plan to regularly inform the scientific community with our updated results as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are shared (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 and https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-sars-cov-2-alignments/480).

COVID-19 lockdown between March 16th and May 11th of 2020 increased time spent at home by children. MATERIAL: This retrospective, observational study described the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 lockdown on child burns in a pediatric surgery department compared with previous five years. Child burns in the previous five years constituted the “before COVID-19 group” as the reference group. Child burns during the first lockdown formed the “COVID-19 group”. Demographics characteristics, the delay before first attendance at the surgery department, burns characteristics, the place of the incident, need of skin graft, and child reactions to trauma or isolation were recorded for these two groups. RESULTS: A total of thirty-seven children were included, 16 of them in the COVID-19 group. In the COVID-19 group, burned children were mainly boys, with a median age of 18 months. The median time before first attendance was four days. Main burns characteristics were to be deep partial thickness burns, involved lower limbs, caused by scalding. All burns occurred at home. Half parents reported child reactions to trauma or isolation among their children before burn injury. CONCLUSION: The incidence of child burn injuries in the COVID-19 group was higher compared to the before COVID-19 group, but no increased delay to attendance recorded. Time spent at home and psychosocial impact of lockdown might partially explain this high incidence rate of child burns.

However, the over-representation of Europeans in genomic studies not only limits the global understanding of disease risk but also inhibits viable research into the genomic differences between carriers and patients. Whilst the community has agreed that more diverse samples are required, it is not enough to blindly increase diversity; the diversity must be quantified, compared and annotated to lead to insight. Genetic annotations from separate biobanks need to be comparable and computable and to operate without access to raw data due to privacy concerns. Comparability is key both for regular research and to allow international comparison in response to pandemics. Here, we evaluate the appropriateness of the most common genomic tools used to depict population structure in a standardized and comparable manner. The end goal is to reduce the effects of confounding and learn from genuine variation in genetic effects on phenotypes across populations, which will improve the value of biobanks (locally and internationally), increase the accuracy of association analyses and inform developmental efforts.

In many hospital-based health care settings, there is a lack of systems in place to provide the early and intensive nutritional support that is required by these high-risk cancer patients. Our research team conducted a 3-arm parallel randomized controlled trial to test the provision of an early and intensive nutrition intervention to patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers using a synchronous telephone-based delivery approach versus an asynchronous mobile app–based approach delivered using an iPad compared with a control group to address this issue. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the overall acceptability of an early and intensive eHealth nutrition intervention delivered either via a synchronous telephone-based approach or an asynchronous mobile app–based approach. METHODS: Patients who were newly diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal cancer and who consented to participate in a nutrition intervention were recruited. In-depth, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using deductive thematic analysis using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability in NVivo Pro 12 Plus. RESULTS: A total of 20 participants were interviewed, 10 from each intervention group (synchronous or asynchronous delivery). Four major themes emerged from the qualitative synthesis: participants’ self-efficacy, low levels of burden, and intervention comprehension were required for intervention effectiveness and positive affect; participants sought a sense of support and security through relationship building and rapport with their dietitian; knowledge acquisition and learning-enabled empowerment through self-management; and convenience, flexibility, and bridging the gap to hard-to-reach individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Features of eHealth models of nutrition care delivered via telephone and mobile app can be acceptable to those undergoing treatment for upper gastrointestinal cancer. Convenience, knowledge acquisition, improved self-management, and support were key benefits for the participants. Future interventions should focus on home-based interventions delivered with simple, easy-to-use technology. Providing participants with a choice of intervention delivery mode (synchronous or asynchronous) and allowing them to make individual choices that align to their individual values and capabilities may support improved outcomes.

Given its high capacity to change antigenically, acquired immunity is often not effective to limit IFV infection and therefore vaccination must be constantly redesigned to achieve effective protection. Improvement of respiratory and systemic innate immune mechanisms has been proposed to reduce the incidence and severity of IFV disease. In the last decade, several research works have demonstrated that microbes with the capacity to modulate the mucosal immune system (immunobiotics) are a potential alternative to beneficially modulate the outcome of IFV infection. This review provides an update of the current status on the modulation of respiratory immunity by orally and nasally administered immunobiotics, and their beneficial impact on IFV clearance and inflammatory-mediated lung tissue damage. In particular, we describe the research of our group that investigated the influence of immunobiotics on inflammation–coagulation interactions during IFV infection. Studies have clearly demonstrated that hostile inflammation is accompanied by dysfunctional coagulation in respiratory IFV disease, and our investigations have proved that some immunobiotic strains are able to reduce viral disease severity through their capacity to modulate the immune-coagulative responses in the respiratory tract.","Zelaya, Hortensia; Alvarez, Susana; Kitazawa, Haruki; Villena, Julio",Front Immunol,537,21

Conjugation of protein antigens at the particle surface by non-covalent adsorption is the most widely used approach in licensed particulate vaccines. Hence, it is essential to understand proteins’ structural integrity at the material interface in order to develop safe-by-design nanovaccines. In this study, we utilized two model proteins, the wild-type allergen Bet v 1 and its hypoallergenic fold variant (BM4), to compare SiO(2) nanoparticles with Alhydrogel(®) as particulate systems. A set of biophysical and functional assays including circular dichroism spectroscopy and proteolytic degradation was used to examine the antigens’ structural integrity at the material interface. Conjugation of both biomolecules to the particulate systems decreased their proteolytic stability. However, we observed qualitative and quantitative differences in antigen processing concomitant with differences in their fold stability. These changes further led to an alteration in IgE epitope recognition. Here, we propose a toolbox of biophysical and functional in vitro assays for the suitability assessment of nanomaterials in the early stages of vaccine development. These tools will aid in safe-by-design innovations and allow fine-tuning the properties of nanoparticle candidates to shape a specific immune response.","Johnson, Litty; Aglas, Lorenz; Soh, Wai Tuck; Geppert, Mark; Hofer, Sabine; Hofstätter, Norbert; Briza, Peter; Ferreira, Fatima; Weiss, Richard; Brandstetter, Hans; Duschl, Albert; Himly, Martin",Int J Mol Sci,537,16

Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today’s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response; 2. Crisis Management; 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption. Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption. After a disaster, it is critical that the business recovers and resumes normal (pre-event) operations as soon as possible. Customers, shareholders and stakeholders expect nothing less. Executive management has the obligation to ensure contingency planning is properly considered and addressed within their company. The consequences of not planning for contingencies can be catastrophic with numerous liability issues.","Fischer, Robert J.; Halibozek, Edward P.; Walters, David C.",Introduction to Security,537,17

These disease outbreaks naturally inspire a demand for sustained and advanced safety and suppression measures. To protect public health and safety, further research developments on emergency analysis methods and approaches for effective emergency treatment generation are urgently needed to mitigate the severity of the pandemic and save lives. METHODS: To address these issues, a novel case-based reasoning (CBR) system is proposed using three phases. In the first phase, the similarity between the current case and the historical cases is calculated under a variety of heterogeneous information. In the second phase, a filter approach based on grey clustering analysis is created to retrieve relevant cases. In the third phase, the cases retrieved are taken as initial host nests in a cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and our system searches an optimal solution through iteration of this algorithm. RESULTS: The proposed model is compared with a CBR method improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a CBR method improved by a differential evolution algorithm (DE), to confirm the efficiency of our CS algorithm in adapting solutions for public health emergencies. The results show that the proposed model is better than the existing algorithms. CONCLUSION: The proposed model improves the speed of case retrieval using grey clustering and increases solution accuracy with CS algorithms. The present research can contribute to government, CDC, and infectious disease emergency management fields with regard to the implementation of fast and accurate public biohazard prevention and control measures based on a variety of heterogeneous information.","Duan, Jinli; Jiao, Feng",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,537,24

Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. ISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain [1] project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/. Author SummaryThe novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 8.7 million confirmed cases worldwide by June 21, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time. Through June 2020, researchers have obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from over 47,000 samples from infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individuals exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome--so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or ""subtypes"" of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 11 base-long compressed label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or ""ISM"". We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is found to be connected to Europe.","Zhao, Zhengqiao; Sokhansanj, Bahrad A.; Malhotra, Charvi; Zheng, Kitty; Rosen, Gail",bioRxiv,537,8

Educational Technology Research and Development, 64(5), 923–938, 2016) from a practice perspective. Learning analytics (the use of data science methods to generate actionable educational insights) have great potential to impact learning practices during the shift to digital. In particular, they can help fill a critical information gap for students created by an absence of classroom-based cues and the need for increased self-regulation in the online environment, However the adoption of learning analytics in effective, ethical and responsible ways is non-trivial. Ifenthaler and Schumacher (2016) present important findings about students’ perceptions of learning analytics’ usefulness and privacy, signaling the need for a student-centered paradigm, but stop short of addressing its implications for the creation and adoption of learning analytics tools. In this paper we address this limitation by describing the three specific shifts needed in current learning analytics practice for analytics to be accepted by and effective for students: (1) involve students in the creation of analytic tools meant to serve them; (2) develop analytics that are contextualized, explainable and configurable; and (3) empower students’ agency in using analytic tools as part of their larger process of learning. These shifts are currently in different stages of maturity and adoption in mainstream learning analytics practice. The primary implication of this work is a call to action for researchers and practitioners to rethink and reshape how students participate in the creation, interpretation and impact of learning analytics.","Ochoa, Xavier; Wise, Alyssa Friend",Educ Technol Res Dev,537,10

Our project has four aims organised in four work packages: (WP1) To examine the prognosis of ADHD (with and without medication) compared with patients with other psychiatric diagnoses, patients in contact with public sector child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics (without diagnosis) and the general population; (WP2) Examine within-country variation in ADHD diagnoses and medication rates by clinics’ catchment area; and(WP3) Identify causal effects of being diagnosed with ADHD and (WP4) ADHD medication on long-term outcomes. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: Our project links several nationwide Norwegian registries. The patient sample is all persons aged 5–18 years that were in contact with public sector child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics in 2009–2011. Our comparative analysis of prognosis will be based on survival analysis and mixed-effects models. Our analysis of variation will apply mixed-effects models and generalised linear models. We have two identification strategies for the effect of being diagnosed with ADHD and of receiving medication on long-term outcomes. Both strategies rely on using preference-based instrumental variables, which in our project are based on provider preferences for ADHD diagnosis and medication.

This approach requires maintenance of the social license and public trust. The ultimate success of PM programs will thus likely be contingent upon understanding public expectations about data sharing and establishing appropriate governance structures. There is a lack of data on public attitudes towards PM in Asia. Methods: The aim of the research was to measure the priorities and preferences of Singaporeans for sharing health-related data for PM. We used adaptive choice-based conjoint analysis (ACBC) with four attributes: uses, users, data sensitivity and consent. We recruited a representative sample of n = 1000 respondents for an in-person household survey. Results: Of the 1000 respondents, 52% were female and majority were in the age range of 40–59 years (40%), followed by 21–39 years (33%) and 60 years and above (27%). A total of 64% were generally willing to share de-identified health data for IRB-approved research without re-consent for each study. Government agencies and public institutions were the most trusted users of data. The importance of the four attributes on respondents’ willingness to share data were: users (39.5%), uses (28.5%), data sensitivity (19.5%), consent (12.6%). Most respondents found it acceptable for government agencies and hospitals to use de-identified data for health research with broad consent. Our sample was consistent with official government data on the target population with 52% being female and majority in the age range of 40–59 years (40%), followed by 21–39 years (33%) and 60 years and above (27%). Conclusions: While a significant body of prior research focuses on preferences for consent, our conjoint analysis found consent was the least important attribute for sharing data. Our findings suggest the social license for PM data sharing in Singapore currently supports linking health and genomic data, sharing with public institutions for health research and quality improvement; but does not support sharing with private health insurers or for private commercial use.","Lysaght, Tamra; Ballantyne, Angela; Toh, Hui Jin; Lau, Andrew; Ong, Serene; Schaefer, Owen; Shiraishi, Makoto; van den Boom, Willem; Xafis, Vicki; Tai, E Shyong",J Pers Med,537,1

The PNI was calculated for each case and the prognostic value of this index was compared to CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores in predicting in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Patients stratified into the T1 tertile had a lower lymphocyte count, serum albumin level, and PNI values.

In addition, we found that the area under curve (AUC) value of PNI was significantly elevated than that of serum albumin level and total lymphocyte counts alone. [(AUC):0.79 vs AUC:0.75 vs AUC:0.69; respectively). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the PNI is independently related with in-hospital mortality in patient with COVID-19 and cardiovascular risk factors. The power of the PNI was also validated using well-accepted risk scores of COVID-19 such as CURB-65 and 4C mortality risk scores.","Çınar, Tufan; Hayıroğlu, Mert İlker; Çiçek, Vedat; Kılıç, Şahhan; Asal, Süha; Yavuz, Samet; Selçuk, Murat; Yalçınkaya, Emre; Keser, Nurgül; Orhan, Ahmet Lütfullah",Heart Lung,537,20

After adjusting for test performance, seroprevalence was 6.9% for September, 16.9% for October, and 24.0% for November. Of the 37 pregnant women testing SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, only 3 were symptomatic. One symptomatic woman testing SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive had multiple co-morbidities and succumbed to COVID-19 pneumonia. Up to January 31, 2021, 8 women identified as SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive delivered, all without complications. Comparison of test adjusted seroprevalence data with cumulative PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases within the Kingston Metropolitan Area indicated that as many as 44.4 times more people were infected with SARS-CoV-2 than identified with PCR testing. These findings provide the first evidence for the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Jamaica and will inform future SARS-CoV-2 testing strategies.","Chisolm, T.; Walker, J.

However, the molecular mechanism of action of IVM on A. simplex s.s. remains unknown. Herein, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and extensive liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis were used to identify the effect of IVM on the proteome of A. simplex s.s. in vitro. During the study, 3433 proteins, of which 1247 had at least two protein unique peptides, were identified. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 59 proteins were differentially regulated (DRPs) in IVM-treated larvae, of which 14 proteins were upregulated and 38 were downregulated after 12 h of culture, but after 24 h, 12 proteins were upregulated and 22 were downregulated. The transcription level of five randomly selected DRPs was determined by real-time PCR as a supplement to the proteomic data. The functional enrichment analysis showed that most of the DRPs were involved in oxidoreductase activity, immunogenicity, protein degradation, and other biological processes. This study has, for the first time, provided comprehensive proteomics data on A. simplex s.s. response to IVM and might deliver new insight into the molecular mechanism by which IVM acts on invasive larvae of A. simplex s.s.","Polak, Iwona; Łopieńska-Biernat, Elżbieta; Stryiński, Robert; Mateos, Jesús; Carrera, Mónica",Genes (Basel),537,20

CSPS is conceptually similar to the career decision-making difficulty questionnaire (CDDQ) and the career decision self-efficacy (CDSE) scale. CSPS leans towards questions about college students’ perceptions about career planning, rather than intuitions about career decision-making; it also inquires about how participants conceptualize about their career plans to be correct, rather than the more extreme idea about how their intuitions are correct: we developed this scale to capture the latter construct. We included the coronavirus anxiety scale (CAS), CDDQ, the general procrastination scale (GPS), and the CDSE short form (CDSE-SF) as covariates to ensure that CSPS has distinct effects on their career paths. Our findings indicate the CSPS has acceptable psychometric properties and demonstrates a valuable input to those measures.","Wang, Xiaoping; Gray, Magnus A.; Kim, Minsung; Lee, Seungyeon",Exp Results,537,18

Methods: Eleven of 1453 patients with a probable diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively selected for the presence of PE. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. All cross-sectional CT imaging was qualitatively scored for the first 28 days after onset of symptoms. Results: Of 24 patients underwent CTA-PE, 11 were confirmed with PE. All 11 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We observed an evolution pattern of predominant findings with ground-glass opacities (GGO) to GGO with crazy paving in 3 patients, then to consolidation with linear densities, or to reticulation in 9 patients. Lung cysts or traction bronchiectasis could be seen from day 5 to 9 after symptoms and reticulation, subpleural curvilinear lines were more common from day 20. The pulmonary opacities were predominantly peripheral in distribution with relative sparing of nondependent lungs. The severity of lung involvement was high with an average score of 9.7 in the first phase, 18 in the second phase plateauing in the next two phases, with a slight decrease to 16.9 in the late phase. The pulmonary emboli were most common in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Conclusion: The incidence of PE among suspected patients in COVID-19 was high. Our study suggests PE may occur with increased frequency in the ARDS subgroup. The evolution of radiographic abnormalities showed a general pattern, but are also unique with more extensive lung injury and specific imaging features.","Li, T.; Kicska, G.; Kinahan, P.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, multi-centre study analysing self-reported adequacy of PPE and IPC training and correlation to a modified pandemic anxiety scale. Participants were current medical students and FiY1 doctors in the UK. Data were collected by an online survey. RESULTS: Participants reported that they received insufficient PPE information (43%) and IPC training (56%). Significantly, fewer participants identifying as women or BAME/mixed ethnicity reported receiving sufficient PPE information, compared with those identifying as men and White British/White Other, respectively. COVID-19-related anxiety was significantly higher in those without sufficient reported PPE or IPC training, in women compared with men, and in FiY1 doctors compared with medical students. CONCLUSIONS: With medical students currently volunteering in and imminently returning to hospitals in an educational capacity, levels of self-reported PPE and IPC training are sub-optimal. Better training is paramount to avoid harm to patients and healthcare professionals and to reduce COVID-19-related anxiety among medical students and FiY1 doctors.","Norton, Emma Jane; Georgiou, Ioannis; Fung, Alex; Nazari, Armin; Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Saunders, Kate E A",J Public Health (Oxf),537,18

METHODS This is a multicenter, retrospective study. Vaccine related-uveitisdiagnosis was supported by the classification of the World Health Organization Adverse Drug Terminology and the Naranjo criteria. RESULTS Twenty-one patients (23 eyes) with a mean age of 51.3 years (23-78 years) were included. Eight /21 patients had a known history of uveitis, the median time from previous to current attack was 1 year (0.5-15 years). There were 21 anterior uveitis cases, two with bilateral inflammation. Eight cases occurred post first and 13 post second vaccination. All but 3 presented as mild to moderate disease. Two patients developed multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) following the second vaccination. Mean time between vaccination to uveitis onset was 7.5 ± 7.3 days (1-30 days). At final follow-up, complete resolution was achieved in all but two eyes, which showed significant improvement. One case of severe anterior uveitis developed vitritis and macular edema following second vaccination, which completely resolved following an intravitreal dexamethasone injection. CONCLUSION Uveitis may develop after the administration of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The most common complication was mild to moderate anterior uveitis, while less frequent, MEWDS can also occur.","Rabinovitch, Tamar; Ben-Arie-Weintrob, Yael; Hareuveni-Blum, Tamar; Shaer, Boaz; Vishnevskia-Dai, Vicktoria; Shulman, Shiri; Newman, Hadas; Biadsy, Muhammad; Masarwa, Dua; Fischer, Naomi; Yovel, Oren; Ben Zaken, Shalhevet Goldfeather-; Habot-Wilner, Zohar",Retina,537,24

Objective We investigated the risk and prevention of hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to hospitalized urological patients. Design, setting, and participants This is a retrospective study of 319 hospitalized urological patients enrolled between April 20, 2020 and May 11, 2020 from two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Intervention Chest computed tomography (CT) images, nucleic acid tests (NATs), and serum antibody were examined at the outpatient department and 1 wk after admission for all patients. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The chest CT images, NATs, serum antibody results, and clinical data were collected and analyzed. Results and limitations None of the 319 patients was found to be SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive. Ten and four patients were detected to be immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM positive, respectively. The chest CT features of 116 patients showed abnormal lung findings. During the 1-wk isolation, one patient initially being IgG positive only was found to be IgM positive, and another initially IgM-positive patient had a rising IgG level. Through risk assessment, we identified seven patients with very high and high risk for hospital transmission, and delayed the surgery while maintaining close follow-up. Five intermediate-risk patients were operated on successfully under paravertebral block or epidural anesthesia to avoid opening the airway with endotracheal intubation. The remaining 104 low-risk and 203 normal patients underwent normal surgery. Conclusions Of the 319 patients, seven were identified as very high and high risk, which reinforced the importance of epidemic surveillance of discharged COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic infections. Five intermediate-risk patients were operated on successfully under regional anesthesia.

This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23®. These data indicate that short- to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","May, Meghan; Slitzky, Matthew; Rostama, Bahman; Barlow, Deborah; Houseknecht, Karen L.",Brain Behav Immun Health,537,28

These opposing views have rarely been discussed in the hospitality management literature. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to bring these views to the fore in the process of reviewing previous research into ES, and to discuss the major challenges involved for hospitality organizations in employing such a formal approach to ES. The discussion throughout this paper reveals that ES is essential for every organization; however, it is even more complex and difficult to accomplish than portrayed in most previous studies in the hospitality management field. The paper identifies and discusses major challenges and problems in employing a form ES approach in hospitality organizations.

We present a series of five placentas of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive women who had been diagnosed with mild symptoms of COVID-19 or had been asymptomatic before birth. We provide a detailed histopathologic description of morphological changes accompanied by an analysis of presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placental tissue. All placentas were term deliveries (40th and 41st gestational weeks). One SARS-CoV-2-positive patient presented with cough and dyspnoea. This placenta showed prominent lymphohistiocytic villitis and intervillositis and signs of maternal and foetal malperfusion. Viral RNA was present in both placenta tissue and the umbilical cord and could be visualized by in situ hybridization in the decidua. SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative at the time of delivery of 3/5 women, and their placentas did not show increased inflammatory infiltrates. Signs of maternal and/or foetal malperfusion were present in 100% and 40% of cases, respectively. There was no transplacental transmission to the infants. In our cohort, we can document different time points regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection. In acute COVID-19, prominent lymphohistiocytic villitis may occur and might potentially be attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta. Furthermore, there are histopathological signs of maternal and foetal malperfusion, which might have a relationship to an altered coagulative or microangiopathic state induced by SARS-CoV-2, yet this cannot be proven considering a plethora of confounding factors.","Menter, Thomas; Mertz, Kirsten Diana; Jiang, Sizun; Chen, Han; Monod, Cécile; Tzankov, Alexandar; Waldvogel, Salome; Schulzke, Sven M.; Hösli, Irene; Bruder, Elisabeth",Pathobiology,537,26
