Manufacturing was controlled by a common master production batch record, standard operating procedures that included acceptance criteria for deceased donor organ pancreata and critical raw materials, PHPI product specifications, certificate of analysis, and test methods. The process was compliant with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and Current Good Tissue Practices. This report describes the manufacturing process for 75 PHPI clinical lots and summarizes the results, including lot release. The results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a harmonized process at multiple facilities for the manufacture of a complex cellular product. The quality systems and regulatory and operational strategies developed by the CIT Consortium yielded product lots that met the prespecified characteristics of safety, purity, potency, and identity and were successfully transplanted into 48 subjects. No adverse events attributable to the product and no cases of primary nonfunction were observed.","Ricordi, Camillo; Goldstein, Julia S.; Balamurugan, A.N.; Szot, Gregory L.; Kin, Tatsuya; Liu, Chengyang; Czarniecki, Christine W.; Barbaro, Barbara; Bridges, Nancy D.; Cano, Jose; Clarke, William R.; Eggerman, Thomas L.; Hunsicker, Lawrence G.; Kaufman, Dixon B.; Khan, Aisha; Lafontant, David-Erick; Linetsky, Elina; Luo, Xunrong; Markmann, James F.; Naji, Ali; Korsgren, Olle; Oberholzer, Jose; Turgeon, Nicole A.; Brandhorst, Daniel; Chen, Xiaojuan; Friberg, Andrew S.; Lei, Ji; Wang, Ling-jia; Wilhelm, Joshua J.; Willits, Jamie; Zhang, Xiaomin; Hering, Bernhard J.; Posselt, Andrew M.; Stock, Peter G.; Shapiro, A.M.

3078,3078,3078,TANK-Binding Kinase 1-Dependent Responses in Health and Autoimmunity,19.035889,2.8603337,2018-03-06,"The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is driven by genetic predisposition and environmental triggers that lead to dysregulated immune responses. These include the generation of pathogenic autoantibodies and aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines. Current therapies for RA and other autoimmune diseases reduce inflammation by targeting inflammatory mediators, most of which are innate response cytokines, resulting in generalized immunosuppression. Overall, this strategy has been very successful, but not all patients respond, responses can diminish over time and numerous side effects can occur. Therapies that target the germinal center (GC) reaction and/or antibody-secreting plasma cells (PC) potentially provide a novel approach. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is an IKK-related serine/threonine kinase best characterized for its involvement in innate antiviral responses through the induction of type I interferons. TBK1 is also gaining attention for its roles in humoral immune responses. In this review, we discuss the role of TBK1 in immunological pathways involved in the development and maintenance of antibody responses, with particular emphasis on its potential relevance in the pathogenesis of humoral autoimmunity. First, we review the role of TBK1 in the induction of type I IFNs. Second, we highlight how TBK1 mediates inducible T cell co-stimulator signaling to the GC T follicular B helper population. Third, we discuss emerging evidence on the contribution of TBK1 to autophagic pathways and the potential implications for immune cell function. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of TBK1 inhibition in autoimmunity.","Louis, Cynthia; Burns, Chris; Wicks, Ian",Front Immunol,320,5

With the exception of three species of conifers, all natural polyploid species of gymnosperms belong to Ephedra, in which more than half of the species show polyploid cytotypes. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of polyploids of Ephedra distributed in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and neighbouring areas. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to measure the ploidy levels of the sampled species that are represented by multiple individuals from different populations, and then, two single‐copy nuclear genes (LFY and DDB2) and two chloroplast DNA fragments were used to unravel the possible origins and maternal donors of the polyploids. The results indicate that the studied polyploid species are allopolyploids, and suggest that allotetraploidy is a dominant mode of speciation in Ephedra. The high percentage of polyploids in the genus could be related to some of its biological attributes such as vegetative propagation, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation, and a small genome size relative to most other gymnosperms. Significant ecological divergences between allotetraploids and their putative progenitors were detected by PCAs and anova and Tukey's tests, with the exception of E. saxatilis. The overlap of geographical distributions and ecological niches of some diploid species could have provided opportunities for interspecific hybridization and allopolyploid speciation.","Wu, Hui; Ma, Zhen; Wang, Ming‐Ming; Qin, Ai‐Li; Ran, Jin‐Hua; Wang, Xiao‐Quan",Mol Ecol,320,5

RECENT FINDINGS: Heart retransplantation is associated with inferior short-term and long-term survival when compared with primary heart transplantation and its use remains controversial although less so in the pediatric heart transplant population. SUMMARY: In the most recent era of heart transplantation, patients retransplanted for CAV, greater than 1 year from their primary transplant, and who are not in critical condition have improved survival compared with other retransplant recipients. Survival with retransplantation can approach that of primary transplantation when patients are appropriately selected. More research is needed regarding the optimal timing for retransplantation and the optimal management for patients after retransplantation.","Barghash, Maya H.; Pinney, Sean P.",Curr Transplant Rep,320,1

NAVA provides proportional ventilator support based on electrical activity of the diaphragm. When the NAVA level is 0 cmH(2)0/mcV, the patient receives minimal support above PEEP when breathing and backup ventilation when apneic. This study compares number of clinically significant events on CPAP versus noninvasive NAVA level 0. METHODS: Retrospective study of preterm neonates having apnea of prematurity on nasal CPAP. Patients were then placed on NAVA level 0. The number of events on each mode was collected. Statistics were paired t-test. RESULTS: Seventeen subjects with gestational age 26.1 ± 1.7 weeks, study age 19.5 ± 12.5 days. Events decreased from 17.9 ± 7.8 on CPAP to 10.2 ± 8.1 events on NAVA level 0 (p = 0.00047).

11655,11655,11655,Re: Reflections on the COVID-19 Pandemic,19.015335,2.734349,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND: Rotaviruses (RVs) are recognized as a major cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in infants and young children worldwide. Here we summarize the virology, disease burden, prevalence, distribution of genotypes and seasonality of RVs, and the current status of RV vaccination in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) from 2008 to 2018. METHODS: Rotavirus infection in Children in Southeast Asia countries was assessed using data from Pubmed and Google Scholars. Most countries in Southeast Asia have not yet introduced national RV vaccination programs. We exclude Brunei Darussalam, and Timor Leste because there were no eligible studies identified during that time. RESULTS: According to the 2008–2018 RV surveillance data for Southeast Asia, 40.78% of all diarrheal disease in children were caused by RV infection, which is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years old in Southeast Asia. Mortality was inversely related to socioeconomic status. The most predominant genotype distribution of RV changed from G1P[8] and G2P[4] into the rare and unusual genotypes G3P[8], G8P[8], and G9P[8]. Although the predominat strain has changed, but the seasonality of RV infection remains unchanged. One of the best strategies for decreasing the global burden of the disease is the development and implementation of effective vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The most predominant genotype distribution of RV was changed time by time. Rotavirus vaccine is highly cost effective in Southeast Asian countries because the ratio between cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is less than one. These data are important for healthcare practitioners and officials to make appropriate policies and recommendations about RV vaccination.","Lestari, Fajar Budi; Vongpunsawad, Sompong; Wanlapakorn, Nasamon; Poovorawan, Yong",J Biomed Sci,320,24

In this study, our aim was to compare the subjective (self-reported) and objective (test-based) cognitive functioning of senior choir singers and matched control subjects, coupled with assessment of mood, QOL, and social functioning. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study in 162 healthy older (age ≥ 60 years) adults (106 choir singers, 56 controls), including measures of cognition, mood, social engagement, QOL, and role of music in daily life. The choir singers were divided to low (1–10 years, N = 58) and high (>10 years, N = 48) activity groups based on years of choir singing experience throughout their life span. A subcohort of 74 participants (39 choir singers, 35 controls) were assessed also with a neuropsychological testing battery. RESULTS: In the neuropsychological testing, choir singers performed better than controls on the verbal flexibility domain of executive function, but not on other cognitive domains. In questionnaires, high activity choir singers showed better social integration than controls and low activity choir singers. In contrast, low activity choir singers had better general health than controls and high activity choir singers. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In healthy older adults, regular choir singing is associated with better verbal flexibility. Long-standing choir activity is linked to better social engagement and more recently commenced choir activity to better general health.","Pentikäinen, Emmi; Pitkäniemi, Anni; Siponkoski, Sini-Tuuli; Jansson, Maarit; Louhivuori, Jukka; Johnson, Julene K.; Paajanen, Teemu; Särkämö, Teppo",PLoS One,320,23

We investigated seroprevalence of and seroconversion to Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. and relation to tick-bites, weather and clinical manifestations in Denmark. METHODS: Blood donors were enrolled at the Hospital of Southern Jutland in June–July with follow-up November–February of 2018 and 2019. Blood samples were collected, and a questionnaire regarding tick bites, potential exposures and symptoms was completed at each visit. Samples were tested for presence of IgM and IgG antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi and Rickettsia spp. using R. helvetica and R. felis as antigens. Data were examined for correlation between tick bites, serological results, potential exposures and symptoms. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fourteen (93 follow-ups) and 130 (38 follow-ups) blood donors were included in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The total borrelia seroconversion rate was 6.3% (CI 2.1–10.5), while the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies was 7.8% (CI 4.9–10.6) and 6.7% (CI 4–9.3), respectively. Seroconversion to Rickettsia spp. was detected in one participant. Tick bites and seroconversion were not significantly associated with the reported unspecific symptoms, but unspecific symptoms were common in the study population. There was no significant difference in number of tick bites or seroconversion/prevalence between seasons with highly alternating weather. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that weather conditions in an individual year have a limited impact. Anti-Borrelia-antibodies do not seem to persist in serum for several years.

The P, V, and W proteins are generated by transcriptional slippage. This process results in the insertion of non-templated guanosine nucleosides into the mRNA at a conserved edit site. The P protein is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase and is encoded by a faithful copy of the gene in the majority of paramyxoviruses. However, in some cases, the non-essential V protein is encoded by default and guanosines must be inserted into the mRNA in order to encode P. The number of guanosines inserted into the P gene can be described by a probability distribution, which varies between viruses. In this article, we review the nature of these distributions, which can be inferred from mRNA sequencing data, and reconstruct the evolutionary history of cotranscriptional editing in the paramyxovirus family. Our model suggests that, throughout known history of the family, the system has switched from a P default to a V default mode four times; complete loss of the editing system has occurred twice, the canonical zinc finger domain of the V protein has been deleted or heavily mutated a further two times, and the W protein has independently evolved a novel function three times. Finally, we review the physical mechanisms of cotranscriptional editing via slippage of the viral RNA polymerase.","Douglas, Jordan; Drummond, Alexei J; Kingston, Richard L",Virus Evol,320,1

METHODS: A pooled analysis was performed of data from five published studies. The primary outcome was tolerability as evaluated by the severity of hyperemia. The secondary objectives were patient tolerance based on a composite ocular surface disease (OSD) score arising from ocular signs and symptoms, patient and investigator satisfaction, and a comparison of IOP-lowering efficacy. RESULTS: There were three randomized controlled trials and two observational studies included in the analysis. Conjunctival hyperemia improved significantly in 25.6% (388) of patients switched to the PFL group versus 11.7% (117) of patients switched to the PCL group (p < 0.001). PFL was two times superior to PCL in reducing ocular hyperemia (odds ratio = 1.96; p < 0.001). The mean OSD composite score decreased by 32.2% in patients switched to the PFL group and 14.1% in the PCL group (p < 0.001). At 3 months, the mean IOP was similar between groups (p = 0.312). CONCLUSION: This post hoc pooled analysis confirmed the findings of the individual studies that PFL is as efficacious at reducing IOP as PCL but better tolerated. After switching to PFL, there was twice the improvement in the OSD composite score. PFL was twice as effective at reducing ocular hyperemia and other ocular signs. These findings suggest that PFL has features that may improve patient compliance, thereby potentially improving the IOP-lowering efficacy on a long-term basis.","Harasymowycz, Paul; Hutnik, Cindy; Rouland, Jean-François; Negrete, Francisco J.

Our study aimed to analyze the impact of the additional burden of pelvic fractures in severely injured elderly. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained trauma registry from 2012 to 2018 at an American College of Surgeons (ACS) verified Level I Trauma Center. Trauma patients aged ≥ 65 years with ISS ≥ 16 and AIS severity score ≥ 3 in at least two body regions were divided in two groups: group I, consisted of elderly polytrauma patients without pelvic fractures, and group II elderly who had concomitant pelvic fractures. We used a double-adjustment method using propensity score matching (PSM) with subsequent covariate adjustment to minimize the effect of confounding factors, and give unbiased estimation of the impact of pelvic fractures. Balance assessment was conducted by computing absolute standardized mean differences (ASMDs) and ASMD < 0.10 reflects good balance between groups. RESULTS: Of 12,774 patients admitted during this time, 411 (3.2%) elderly with a mean age of 77.75 ± 8.32 years met the inclusion criteria. Of this cohort, only 92 patients (22.4%) had pelvic fractures. Females outnumbered males (55 vs. 45%). Comparing characteristics of group I and group II using ASMDs, pelvic trauma patients were more likely to have higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), head injuries, lower extremity injuries, anticoagulant therapy, and cirrhosis. Fewer variables differed significantly after matching. We observed few instances of worse outcomes associated with pelvic trauma using PSM with and without covariate adjustment. Crude PSM without covariate adjustment, showed a significantly higher rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for pelvic trauma (p < 0.001). Crude PSM also showed a significantly higher rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in group II (p = 0.006). PSM with covariate adjustment did not confirm differences on these outcomes. PSM both without and with covariate adjustment found lower ventilator days and ICU length of stay among patients with pelvic trauma. No significant differences were seen on 12 outcomes: death, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism (PE), unplanned intubation, unplanned admission to intensive care unit (ICU), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: At a Level I Trauma Center the additional burden of pelvic fractures in seriously injured elderly did not translate into higher mortality. PSM without covariate adjustment suggests worse rates among pelvic trauma patients for DVT and VAP but covariate adjustment removed statistical significance for both outcomes. Pelvic trauma patients had shorter time on ventilator and in the ICU. Whether similar analytic methods applied to patients from larger data sources would produce similar findings remains to be seen.","Gogna, Shekhar; Latifi, Rifat; Samson, David J.; Butler, Jonathan",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,320,5

Many attempts have been made to reduce the use of low-value imaging. However, the comparative effectiveness of interventions to reduce low-value imaging is unclear. Thus, the objective of this systematic review was to provide an overview and evaluate the outcomes of interventions aimed at reducing low-value imaging. METHODS: An electronic database search was completed in Medline – Ovid, Embase-Ovid, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for citations between 2010 and 2020. The search was built from medical subject headings for Diagnostic imaging/Radiology, Health service misuse or medical overuse, and Health planning. Keywords were used for the concept of reduction and avoidance. Reference lists of included articles were also hand-searched for relevant citations. Only articles written in English, German, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, and Swedish were included. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to appraise the quality of the included articles. A narrative synthesis of the final included articles was completed. RESULTS: The search identified 15,659 records. After abstract and full-text screening, 95 studies of varying quality were included in the final analysis, containing 45 studies found through hand-searching techniques. Both controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after studies, time series, chart reviews, and cohort studies were included. Most interventions were aimed at referring physicians. Clinical practice guidelines (n = 28) and education (n = 28) were most commonly evaluated interventions, either alone or in combination with other components. Multi-component interventions were often more effective than single-component interventions showing a reduction in the use of low-value imaging in 94 and 74% of the studies, respectively. The most addressed types of imaging were musculoskeletal (n = 26), neurological (n = 23) and vascular (n = 16) imaging. Seventy-seven studies reported reduced low-value imaging, while 3 studies reported an increase. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-component interventions that include education were often more effective than single-component interventions. The contextual and cultural factors in the health care systems seem to be vital for successful reduction of low-value imaging. Further research should focus on assessing the impact of the context in interventions reducing low-value imaging and how interventions can be adapted to different contexts.

In this situation, the supranational institutions and their models of action are evidently under pressure, seeming incapable of leading the EU out of the stormy waters of the present crisis. The article frames the first months of management of the COVID-19 crisis at EU level as characterised by the limited increase in the level of steering capacity by supranational institutions, due to the reaffirmed centrality of the intergovernmental option. To explain this situation, the article considers the absence of the institutional capacity/legitimacy to extract resources from society(ies), and the subsequent impossibility of guaranteeing an effective and autonomous process of political (re)distribution, the key factors accounting for the weakness of vertical political integration in the response to the COVID-19 challenge. This explains why during the COVID-19 crisis as well, the pattern followed by the EU is rather similar to past patterns, thus confirming that this has fed retrenchment aimed at the enforcement of the intergovernmental model and the defence of the most sensitive core state powers against inference from supranational EU institutions.","Salvati, Eugenio",Chin,320,1

This paper proposes to study the change in how people are experiencing a pandemic very differently and what such changes imply with respect to social connections and human interactions. The networked digital citizens come together in the time of crisis, sharing a sense of nostalgia as well as perseverance on Facebook. The paper will refer to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in order to explain the human need for the sense of belonging. A pandemic has not been experienced in earlier time as a global phenomenon with far reaching consequences as in the present context. People across the world are experiencing a similar form of loneliness, boredom, and anxiety irrespective of which profession one belongs to. The absence of physical movement has suddenly caused a great shift of interaction on to the Facebook platform. The corner stone for virtual social interaction had already been laid down with the rise of a ‘convergence culture’. Social communities depicting shared interests like music, dance, photography, food, and other aspects of life have been redesigned and restructured as a result of the lockdown. More and more people are sharing videos of activities they are engaging in during this time of immobility. A greater focus of family experiences are being shared by celebrities, creating a semblance of solidarity in fighting against the psychological effects of a long term lockdown. The provision of the care button on Facebook also intensifies this sense of a shared trauma and the human desire to overcome all hurdles together. The paper will focus on a number of Facebook trends, beginning from Dalgona coffee and its perception to music covers of popular songs such as ‘Dance Monkey’ and Bella Ciao. The historical meaning associated with the term ‘crisis’ is being redefined in a social context which greatly based on a networked population. This has an entirely different social and psychological implication. Analysing the Facebook updates will go a long way in understanding the term ‘crisis’ with respect to the time of Corona.","Nandy, Rimi",Hu Arenas,320,2

On the basis of O(3) isopleths from a series of air quality simulations under different levels of NO(x) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reductions, we found that such concerns are not necessary. As NO(x) emissions have been reduced in recent years for particulate matter control, future NO(x) reductions are generally favorable for summertime maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) O(3) reductions. Decreases in summertime O(3) due to NO(x) reductions will also lead to lower atmospheric oxidation capacity, characterized by decreased OH and NO(3) concentrations, resulting in further reduction of secondary inorganic aerosols (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium ion, NSA) formation. VOC emission reductions help to further reduce MDA8 O(3) and are needed to control HCHO and primary air toxics simultaneously, but they are ineffective in reducing NSA. This study indicates that a nationwide NO(x) emission reduction policy has great potential in controlling O(3) and PM(2.5) simultaneously. However, its effectiveness could be greatly reduced when applied on a limited spatial scale.","Kang, Mingjie; Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Hongliang; Ying, Qi",Environ Sci Technol Lett,320,7

In March 2020, the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. The primary diagnostic test is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but chest X-ray and computed tomography have become the typical diagnostic tools used to detect abnormal lung changes. Within the framework of the SENTAD COVID Study clinical trial, an observational and analytical study was conducted, where the patients received nebulization therapy with the use of autologous stem cells (group A) compared to the control arm (group B). Both groups received the UAE SARS-CoV-2 standard management. Radiological images of each patient were collected within 24 h of inclusion in the trial and during follow-up. Herein, we describe and evaluate the radiological findings and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 139 subjects were included in our analysis, 69 in group A and 70 in group B. The most common finding was ground glass opacifications, followed by patchy consolidations, with 20% normal radiological images scored 3 from admission until discharge (p < 0.0001). Our results suggest a significant improvement in radiological images after treatment secondary to the stem cell effect of reducing inflammation and stimulating the pneumological healing process. CONCLUSIONS: The use of novel therapies, such as stem cells, shows efficacy not only in terms of the control of clinical and paraclinical signs but also in the radiological changes described in the disease.

Given the short shelf-life of 3–5 days and a highly volatile supply and demand pattern, platelet inventory allocation is a challenging task. This is especially prevalent in emerging economies where demand variability is more pronounced due to neglected tropical diseases, and a perpetual shortage of supply. The consequences of which have given rise to an illegal ‘red market’. Motivated by experience at a regional hospital in India, we investigate the problem of platelet allocation among three priority-differentiated demand streams. Specifically we consider a central hospital which, in addition to internal emergency and non-emergency requests, faces external demand from local clinics. We analyze the platelet allocation decision from a social planner’s perspective and propose an allocation heuristic based on revenue management (RM) principles. The objective is to maximize total social benefit in a highly supply-constrained environment. Using data from the aforementioned Indian hospital as a case study, we conduct a numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the allocation heuristic. The performance of the RM-based policy is evaluated against the current sequential first come, first serve policy and two fixed proportion-based rationing policies. It is shown that the RM-based policy overall dominates, serves patients with the highest medical urgency better, and can curtail patients’ need to procure platelets from commercial sources.","Ødegaard, Fredrik; Roy, Sudipendra Nath",J Heuristics,320,12

The healthcare players have recognized it as a potential area for economic diversification. The major factors affecting medical tourism in a country are cost, quality, language, and ease of travel. The healthcare services in India cost significantly lower than in western countries and the middle east. That is one of the reasons behind India attracting customers from these countries. The government promotes India as a premier healthcare destination and has made policies to ease travel for medical tourism purposes. Quality has been one of the important criteria for the selection of healthcare providers even for price-conscious customers. This study uses the case of the eastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh to investigate the reason behind the low penetration of medical tourism in the region. The study identifies factors affecting medical tourism in post-COVID times and maps them with enablers using a focus group discussion.

In the interstices between “work time” and “leisure/training time”, some important characteristics of current body politics (the ways in which societies accept the distribution and use of bodies and their energies) become visible. Specifically, we explore here the emerging phenomenon of “fit-influencers”, contemporary referents of the “virtual” scene (social networks) through the promotion of sports and eating routines. In this sense, our corpus of analysis has been constructed from an ethnographic work located in Argentina, from which narratives that these actors present in social networks (Virtual Ethnography), and in situations of in-depth interviews, are recovered. These narratives allow us to understand the social sensibilities associated with these practices, enabling us to link the emergence and expansion of fit-influencers with a process of renewal of the “spirit of capitalism” (sensu Weber), which would translate into an updating of the “political economy of morality” (Scribano in ¡Disfrútalo! Una aproximación a la economía política de la moral desde el consumo, Elalephcom, Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires, 2015). To be clearer, “political economy of morality” refers to a series of mechanisms of social domination and exploitation of bodily energies, which are legitimised as moral principles associated with enjoyment through consumption. The final reflections we present are oriented towards thinking about how the new “digital gurus” of routines and “homemade” prescriptions become guarantors of the organisation of work, by establishing parameters for the management of bodies and emotions that are associated to a “renewed” order of accumulation.","Lisdero, Pedro Matías; Duperré, Jorge Luis",SN Soc Sci,320,1

Sex Workers who Use NUM Opt out of Sharing Victimisation with Police,18.721664,2.978,2021-09-01,"STUDY QUESTION: Is the emotional experience of patients during IVF different since the start of the global Covid-19 pandemic? SUMMARY ANSWER: Tracking data since re-opening demonstrated patients lower positive challenge emotions but no significant change in harm, threat, or stress. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Covid-19 caused widespread shutdown of fertility centres, including in the UK, when the HFEA mandated closure from March until May 2020. Research shows clinic closure and an uncertain future were a significant psychological burden for patients anticipating treatment. However, emotional experiences before, during and after closure have not yet been compared, which is the aim of the study. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective single-centre analysis of anonymised emotional tracking data entered by 707 patients using the MediEmo smartphone app alongside their IVF cycle, from May 2017-September 2020. MediEmo includes medication timeline/ notifications, coping tools and emotional tracking. Patients rate 2 questions daily in each emotion domain (challenge, threat, harm, e.g. ‘I am feeling tense’) on a 0-3 scale and indicate coping ability (‘I am unable to cope with the stress I am experiencing’) on a binary scale. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Egg donor, recipient and fertility preservation cycles were excluded. First, mood scores were analysed by 2020 month of entry to capture the emotional impact of closure. Second, “Pre-Covid” (May 2017-Feb 2020) and “After Re-opening” (May 2020–Sept 2020) emotional experiences were compared, using student t-tests. Mean and standard deviation of scores in each mood domain entered on each cycle day were calculated, centred on luteal day 0/ egg collection, from cycle day -14 to + 14. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Graphical presentation of emotional data by month clearly demonstrates the significant increase in threat, harm and stress emotions and reduced positive emotions experienced immediately prior to and during mandatory clinic closure. Of patients entering emotional data during closure in March/April 2020, 40% (14/35) stated they felt unable to cope with the stress they were currently experiencing. From May 2020 after the clinic reopened, analysis of in-cycle emotional tracking data showed there are no significant differences in harm or threat emotion levels or numbers reporting intolerable stress during IVF, compared to cycles pre-pandemic (May17-Feb 2020). Patients undertaking IVF cycles since closure are logging lower challenge scores (confident, encouraged, positive, hopeful), demonstrating less optimism, particularly in the ‘two-week wait’ phase of the cycle. The mean (s.d) of challenge scores pre-Covid was 1.50 (1.07), compared to 1.38 (1.04) after re-opening, p = 0.00085. The women who had treatment cycles post re-opening from May 2020 onwards were older (33.4(5.2) vs 32.6(4.4)), which may reflect clinical treatment prioritisation decisions. There was no significant differences in number of eggs collected (mean(s.d) Pre-Covid 12.08 (8.0) vs After re-opening 11.83 (9.4), p = 0.84) or live birth/ ongoing pregnancy rates for undelivered pregnancies (p = 0.69) between the groups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Emotional data was only available for those who chose to use MediEmo, entered emotional tracking data and who gave consent for use of their clinical data in research. As such, this analysis may not fully reflect all patients’ experiences. Most of the available data were entered prior to the pandemic. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: For Covid-19 safety reasons, patients currently have less in-person staff contact when undertaking IVF. The findings reassuringly suggest emotional wellbeing was not markedly different in most domains. However, daily ratings did show the emotional fall-out of clinic closures which for most threatened attainability of parenthood goals (e.g., less hope).

The two most common causes are alcohol and gallstones. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on service delivery and patient management throughout all surgical specialties. In this study, the primary aim was to ascertain the incidence of COVID-19 in acute pancreatitis patients. Secondary objectives were to study aetiology, demographics, severity, 30-day mortality, outcomes and management of acute pancreatitis patients from 1st March, 2020 till 31st August, 2020. Methods A retrospective observational review of all patients admitted under the General Surgical team was performed. Information regarding demographics, severity of AP (using Glasgow score, Atlanta classification and CT severity index score), ICU admission and organ support, treatment modalities and follow-up data for outcomes was collected based on data collection tool used by COVID-PAN study and results were compared to outcomes results of COVID-PAN study. Results Forty-three (43) patients were admitted with AP. Only one patient (2.3%) was diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of pancreatitis. Gallstones were noted to be the most common cause of AP in our population. Mortality was 7% (3 patients). Five patients (11%) needed ITU admission due to organ dysfunction. Three patients (7%) developed ARDS. Conclusion The overall incidence of COVID-19 in pancreatitis in our population of the study was low. The incidence of COVID-19 during the first wave in Derry/Londonderry area was low and this may explain why the incidence was low in our study as well. Patients with AP in our target population were mostly elderly, one in five had moderate to severe or severe pancreatitis and in 16.3% the aetiology could not be identified. As observed in other centres globally, urgent cholecystectomy for gallstone pancreatitis faced significant delays with no patients being offered index cholecystectomy and only 4 out of 19 patients having undergone interval cholecystectomy within six months of index admission for gallstone pancreatitis in our centre.","Yawar, Bakhat; Marzouk, Ahmed; Ali, Heba; Asim, Ayeisha; Ghorab, Tamer; Bahli, Zahid; Abousamra, Mohammad; Fleville, Samara",,320,30

I focus primarily on the “alternative” narrative put forth by the Plandemic case; however, the (Western/US) “mainstream” narrative becomes clear as well. Both call upon the same sets of binary oppositions, chief among them, science vs. blind faith, truth vs. deception, and evidence vs. supposition. Audiences, who are themselves fragmented and differentiated, are exposed to multiple narrative paths. Within the mainstream, they encounter an apocalyptic-turned romantic story, in which science, evidence, and the truth, the sacred trio, will lift humanity out of perilous danger. Plandemic’s alternative narrative begins in a tragic tone and builds apocalyptically into a tale of terror, waged by the very same forces of science, truth, and evidence, to create a “plague of corruption” that will “kill millions.” To conclude, I reflect on the potential implications of the increasing popularity of conspiracy theorizing about Covid-19.","Jaworsky, Bernadette Nadya",Am J Cult Sociol,320,22

The perceptive aspects of spirituality such as wondering awe are of relevance for both, religious and non-religious persons. These perceptions were related to perceiving the Sacred in life, mindful awareness of nature, others and self, to compassion, meaning in life, and emotional wellbeing.

Methods: Data from 7,928 participants were analyzed with respect to the frequency of Awe/Gratitude perceptions (GrAw-7 scale), while for the second part of the study responses of a heterogeneous group of 82 persons what caused them to perceive moments of wondering awe were analyzed with qualitative content analysis techniques. Results: Persons who experience Awe/Gratitude to a low extend were the youngest and had lowest wellbeing and lowest meditation/praying engagement, while those with high GrAw-7 scores were the oldest, had the highest wellbeing, and were more often meditating or praying (p<0.001). Gender had a significant effect on these perceptions, too (Cohen’s d=0.32). In the qualitative part, the triggers can be attributed to four main categories, Nature, Persons, Unique Moments, and Aesthetics, Beauty, and Devotion. Some of these triggers and related perceptions might be more a matter of admiration than wondering awe, while other perceptions could have more profound effects and may thus result in changes of a person’s attitudes and behaviors. Conclusion: Emotionally touching experiences of wondering awe may result in feelings of interconnectedness, prosocial behavior, mindful awareness, and contribute to a person’s meaning in life and wellbeing and can also be a health-relevant resource. These perceptions can be seen as a perceptive aspect of spirituality, which is not exclusively experienced by religious people but also by non-religious persons.","Büssing, Arndt",Front Psychol,320,31

Thirty-two Santa Inês male sheep uncastrated with initial body weight of 22.61 ± 7.2 kg were allocated to a completely randomized design with four treatments: (1) WBR silage without additive (WBRS), (2) WBR silage with milled corn (WBRS + MC), (3) WBR silage with wheat bran (WBRS + WB), and (4) WBR silage with cassava flour (WBRS + CF) and eight replicates. WBRS + WB resulted in lower cold carcass weight than WBRS + CF; however, this reduction was not sufficient to alter the carcass commercial yield or loin-eye area. The leg cut of animals fed WBRS + WB showed less value than those animals fed with WBRS + CS. The meat lightness of WBRS was higher that of WBRS + MC, WBRS + WB, and WBRS + CF. The cooking loss for WBRS + WB was less than those animals fed with WBRS + CS. However, meat protein, meat cholesterol, and shear force were similar among treatments (17.69%, 42.46 mg/100 g of meat, and 2.48 kgf/cm2, respectively). The use of additives in wet brewery residue silage does not improve carcass characteristics or the quality of sheep meat, and it is therefore recommended to use WBR silage without additives.","de Abreu, Karen S F; Guim, Adriana; Carvalho, Francisco F F; Ferreira, Marcelo de A; Monnerat, João Paulo I Dos S; Fernandes, João V C; Lima, Ana C C P; Dos Santos, Caio C C; da Silva Neto, José F",Tropical animal health and production,320,16

Fifty-three liver allograft samples from unique HCV LT recipients were studied using microarrays, including a training set (n = 32) and a validation set (n = 19). Two no-HCV-ACR samples from LT recipients were also included. Probe set intensity values were obtained using the robust multiarray average method (RMA) method. Analysis of variance identified statistically differentially expressed genes (P ≤ 0.005). The limma package was used to fit the mixed-effects models using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was fit with HCVrec versus ACR as the dependent variable predicted. N-fold cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased estimate of generalization error. A total of 179 probe sets were differentially expressed among groups, with 71 exclusive genes between HCVrec and HCV-ACR. No differences were found within ACR group (HCV-ACR vs. no-HCV-ACR). Supervised clustering analysis displayed two clearly independent groups, and no-HCV-ACR clustered within HCV-ACR. HCVrec-related genes were associated with a cytotoxic T-cell profile, and HCV-ACR-related genes were associated with the inflammatory response. The best-fitting LASSO model classifier accuracy, including 15 genes, has an accuracy of 100% in the training set. N-fold cross-validation accuracy was 78.1%, and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 50.0%, 90.9%, 71.4% and 80.0%, respectively. Arginase type II (ARG2), ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1), transmembrane protein 176A (TMEM176A) and TMEM176B genes were significantly confirmed in the validation set.

Moreover, there are no large studies evaluating the trends of RACS at the national level. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009-2010 was retrospectively reviewed for robotic-assisted and laparoscopic colorectal procedures performed for cancer, benign polyps, and diverticular disease. Trends in different settings, indications, and demographics were analyzed. Multivariate regression analysis was used to compare selected outcomes between RACS and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS). RESULTS An estimated 128,288 colorectal procedures were performed through minimally invasive techniques over the study period, and RACS was used in 2.78 % of cases. From 2009 to 2010, the use of robotics increased in all hospital settings but was still more common in large, urban, and teaching hospitals. Rectal cancer was the most common indication for RACS, with a tendency toward its selective use in male patients. On multivariate analysis, robotic surgery was associated with higher hospital charges in colonic ($11,601.39; 95 % CI 6,921.82-16,280.97) and rectal cases ($12,964.90; 95 % CI 6,534.79-19,395.01), and higher rates of postoperative bleeding in colonic cases (OR = 2.15; 95 % CI 1.27- 3.65). RACS was similar to CLS with respect to length of hospital stay, morbidity, anastomotic leak, and ileus. Conversion to open surgery was significantly lower in robotic colonic and rectal procedures (0.41; 95 % CI 0.25-0.67) and (0.10; 95 % CI 0.06-0.16), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The use of RACS is still limited in the United States. However, its use increased over the study period despite higher associated charges and no real advantages over laparoscopy in terms of outcome. The one advantage is lower conversion rates.","Halabi, Wissam J; Kang, Celeste Y; Jafari, Mehraneh D; Nguyen, Vinh Q; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Stamos, Michael J; Pigazzi, Alessio",World journal of surgery,320,16

The aim of the current meta-analysis was to compare the incidence of hypoxemia associated with standard monitoring alone during gastrointestinal endoscopy to that associated with standard monitoring with the addition of capnography. Methods The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials scientific databases were searched to identify relevant studies. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials undertaken up to January 2018 that met our predefined inclusion criteria. The study outcome measures were incidence of hypoxemia, severe hypoxemia, apnea, the use of assisted ventilation, the use of supplemental oxygen, and change in vital signs. Results We included nine trials assessing a total of 3,088 patients who underwent gastrointestinal procedural sedation. Meta-analysis of study outcome revealed that capnography significantly reduced the incidence of hypoxemia (odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.77) and severe hypoxemia (odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81). However, there were no significant differences in other outcomes including incidence of apnea, assisted ventilation, supplemental oxygen, and changes in vital signs. Early procedure termination and patient satisfaction-related outcomes did not differ significantly in the capnography group and the standard monitoring group. Conclusion This study indicates that capnography monitoring is an important addition with regard to the detection of hypoxemia during gastrointestinal procedural sedation, and should be considered in routine monitoring during gastrointestinal endoscopy.","Kim, Seung Hyun; Park, Minsu; Lee, Jinae; Kim, Eungjin; Choi, Yong Seon",Therapeutics and clinical risk management,320,1

We found de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to be significantly enriched in gene promoters in SLE patients compared with healthy controls at a level corresponding to 26 de novo promoter SNVs more in each patient than expected. We identified 12 de novo SNVs in promoter regions of genes that have been previously implicated in SLE, or that have functions that could be of relevance to SLE. Furthermore, we detected three missense de novo SNVs, five de novo insertion-deletions, and three de novo structural variants with potential to affect the expression of genes that are relevant for SLE. Based on enrichment analysis, disease-affecting de novo SNVs are expected to occur in one-third of SLE patients. This study shows that de novo variants in promoters commonly contribute to the genetic risk of SLE. The fact that de novo SNVs in SLE were enriched to promoter regions highlights the importance of using whole-genome sequencing for identification of de novo variants.","Almlöf, Jonas Carlsson; Nystedt, Sara; Mechtidou, Aikaterini; Leonard, Dag; Eloranta, Maija-Leena; Grosso, Giorgia; Sjöwall, Christopher; Bengtsson, Anders A; Jönsen, Andreas; Gunnarsson, Iva; Svenungsson, Elisabet; Rönnblom, Lars; Sandling, Johanna K; Syvänen, Ann-Christine",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,320,7

Despite the importance of lysosomal proteases in both coronavirus entry and cell metabolism, the correlation between lysosomal proteases and cell tropism of coronaviruses has not been established. Here, we examined the roles of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus surface spike proteins for membrane fusion, using the spike proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) as the model system. To this end, we controlled the contributions from receptor binding and other host proteases, thereby attributing coronavirus entry solely or mainly to the efficiency of lysosomal proteases in activating coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion. Our results showed that lysosomal proteases from bat cells support coronavirus spike-mediated pseudovirus entry and cell-cell fusion more effectively than their counterparts from human cells. Moreover, purified lysosomal extracts from bat cells cleave cell surface-expressed coronavirus spikes more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. Overall, our study suggests that different lysosomal protease activities from different host species and tissue cells are an important determinant of the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are capable of colonizing new species, as evidenced by the recent emergence of SARS and MERS coronaviruses; they can also infect multiple tissues in the same species. Lysosomal proteases play critical roles in coronavirus entry by cleaving coronavirus surface spike proteins and activating the fusion of host and viral membranes; they also play critical roles in cell physiology by processing cellular products. How do different lysosomal protease activities from different cells impact coronavirus entry? Here, we controlled the contributions from known factors that function in coronavirus entry so that lysosomal protease activities became the only or the main determinant of coronavirus entry. Using pseudovirus entry, cell-cell fusion, and biochemical assays, we showed that lysosomal proteases from bat cells activate coronavirus spike-mediated membrane fusion more efficiently than their counterparts from human cells. Our study provides the first direct evidence supporting lysosomal proteases as a determinant of the species and tissue tropisms of coronaviruses.","Zheng, Yuan; Shang, Jian; Yang, Yang; Liu, Chang; Wan, Yushun; Geng, Qibin; Wang, Michelle; Baric, Ralph; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,320,1

Investigating the formation of the cytoskeleton, we find that katanin p60-like 1 (kat-60L1), a neuronal type of microtubule-severing enzyme, serves two functions. First, it amplifies the mass of microtubules to form the dense microtubule arrays inside the sensory cilia. Second, it generates short microtubules that are required to build the nanoscopic cytoskeleton at the mechanotransduction site. Additional analyses further reveal the functional roles of Patronin and other potential factors in the local regulatory network.

However, there are few reports on the synchronous detection of BPV, BCoV and BPIV. The present article aimed to develop a quick and accurate RT-PCR assay to synchronously detect BPV, BCoV and BPIV based on their specific probes. One pair universal primers, one pair specific primers and one specific probe was designed and synthesized. After the concentrations of primer and probe and annealing temperature were strictly optimized, the specificity, sensitivity and repeatability of the established triplex probe qRT-PCR were evaluated, respectively. The results showed the recombinant plasmids of pMD18-T-BPV, pMD18-T-BCoV and pMD18-T-BPIV were 554bp, 699bp and 704bp, respectively. The optimal annealing temperature was set at 45.0°C for triplex qRT-PCR. The triplex probe qRT-PCR can only synchronously detect BPV, BCoV and BPIV. Detection sensitivities were 2.0×102, 2.0×102 and 2.0×101 copies/μL for BPV, BCoV and BPIV, being 1000-fold greater than that in the conventional PCR. Detection of clinical samples demonstrated that triplex probe qRT-PCR had a higher sensitivity and specificity. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation were lower than 2.0%. Clinical specimens verified that the triplex qRT-PCR had a higher sensitivity and specificity than universal PCR. In conclusion, this triplex probe qRT-PCR could detect only BPV, BCoV and BPIV. Minimum detection limits were 2.0×102 copies/μL for BPV and BCoV, and 2.0×101 copies/μL for BPIV. The sensitivity of this triplex probe qRT-PCR was 1000-fold greater than that in the conventional PCR.

METHODS We prospectively enrolled 112 patients with pathologically confirmed NETs of gastroenteropancreatic or pulmonary origin. All patients underwent both PET/CT with (64)Cu-DOTATATE and SPECT/CT with (111)In-DTPA-OC within 60 d. PET scans were acquired 1 h after injection of 202 MBq (range, 183-232 MBq) of (64)Cu-DOTATATE after a diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT scan. Patients were followed for 42-60 mo for evaluation of discrepant imaging findings. The McNemar test was used to compare the diagnostic performance. RESULTS Eighty-seven patients were congruently PET- and SPECT-positive. No SPECT-positive cases were PET-negative, whereas 10 false-negative SPECT cases were identified using PET. The diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of (64)Cu-DOTATATE (97% for both) were significantly better than those of (111)In-DTPA-OC (87% and 88%, respectively, P = 0.017). In 84 patients (75%), (64)Cu-DOTATATE identified more lesions than (111)In-DTPA-OC and always at least as many. In total, twice as many lesions were detected with (64)Cu-DOTATATE than with (111)In-DTPA-OC. Moreover, in 40 of 112 cases (36%) lesions were detected by (64)Cu-DOTATATE in organs not identified as disease-involved by (111)In-DTPA-OC.

In their postfusion forms, the three fusion subunits form trimers of hairpins consisting of a central coiled coil (formed by the N-terminal helices), an intervening sequence, and a region containing the C helix (and flanking strands) that runs antiparallel to and packs in the grooves of the N-terminal coiled coil. For filoviruses and most retroviruses, the intervening sequence includes a ""chain reversal region"" consisting of a short stretch of hydrophobic residues, a Gly-Gly pair, a CX(6)CC motif, and a bulky hydrophobic residue. Maerz and coworkers (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J.

Here, we used mutagenesis and pseudovirus entry assays to test this model for the avian retrovirus avian sarcoma/leukosis virus (ASLV) and the filovirus ebolavirus Zaire. Our results are generally consistent with the model proposed for HTLV-1 Env. In addition, we show with ASLV EnvA that the bulky hydrophobic residue following the CX(6)CC motif is required for the step of prehairpin target membrane insertion, whereas other residues are required for the foldback step of fusion. We further found that a His residue that is unique to the chain reversal region of ASLV EnvA controls the pH at which ASLV entry occurs.","Delos, Sue E; La, Bonnie; Gilmartin, Allissia; White, Judith M",Journal of virology,320,5

STUDY DESIGN A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases for articles published between December 2019 and April 29, 2020 using a combination of the keywords such as COVID-19, coronavirus 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pregnancy, vaginal delivery, cesarean section, vertical transmission, management, and guidelines. Peer-reviewed case studies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 women who delivered were included to determine mode of delivery, indications for cesarean section, and maternal and neonatal characteristics. RESULTS A review of 36 total articles revealed deliveries in 203 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. A comparable severity of disease in pregnant versus nonpregnant women was noted, as previously determined. Overall, 68.9% of women delivered via cesarean section, with COVID-19 status alone being a common indication. Maternal COVID-19 may also be associated with increased risk of preterm labor, although neonatal outcomes were generally favorable. Despite eight of 206 newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, there remains no definitive evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION COVID-19 status alone became a common indication for cesarean delivery early in the pandemic, despite lack of evidence for vertical transmission. The increase in cesarean rate in this data may reflect obstetricians attempting to serve their patients in the best way possible given the current climate of constantly evolving guidelines on safest mode of delivery for the mother, infant, and provider.

The study aim was to compare ET to ST in physiologically fit patients with cT1a adenocarcinoma (EAC). METHODS Review of two prospective databases yielded 100 patients presenting with clinical cT1a EAC between 2000 and 2013. Only physiologically fit patients who were candidates for either treatment were analyzed. RESULTS Presenting patient characteristics were similar between ET (n = 36) and ST groups (n = 49). Surgical patients were less likely to be staged with EMR (43 vs 100 %) and were associated with mass lesions >1 cm at EGD (p = 0.01), multifocal EAC (p = 0.03), and positive margins for EAC on EMR (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, only multifocal HGD was an independent factor for surgery. Following esophagectomy, R0 resection rates for Barrett's esophagus and cancer were 100 %. Incidence of surgery decreased over the study period from 85 to 25 %. All ET patients had EMR, and 28 patients underwent additional ablative therapies for Barrett's esophagus. Following ET, eradication rates of EAC, dysplasia, and BE were 92, 81, and 53 %, respectively. Morbidity rates were comparable between groups (ST 51 % vs ET 39 %, p = 0.31). In-hospital mortality rate was zero in each group. Recurrence rates in ST and ET group were 2 and 11 % (p = 0.08). In the ET group, two patients with endoluminal cancer recurrence after complete eradication underwent esophagectomy. Age-adjusted overall survival was comparable. CONCLUSION In high-volume esophageal centers, ST and ET provide equally safe and effective treatment for cT1a EAC in medically fit patients. While the results of this study provide a historical perspective and clearly demonstrate an evolution toward ET over time, the appropriate treatment modality is best selected in a multidisciplinary fashion with EMR providing the most accurate staging. In endoscopically treated patients, indefinite endoscopic follow-up required, however, standardized long-term follow-up protocols are needed.","Schmidt, Henner M; Mohiuddin, Kamran; Bodnar, Artur M; El Lakis, Mustapha; Kaplan, Stephen; Irani, Shayan; Gan, Ian; Ross, Andrew; Low, Donald E",Surgical endoscopy,320,19

The purpose of this review is to describe key physical properties that stents have and how they affect cerebral aneurysms. We performed a two-step screening process. First, a structured search was performed using the PubMed database. The following search terms and keywords were used: ""Hemodynamics,"" ""wall shear stress (WSS),"" ""velocity,"" ""viscosity,"" ""cerebral aneurysm,"" ""intracranial aneurysm,"" ""stent,"" ""flow diverter,"" ""stent porosity,"" ""stent geometry,"" ""stent configuration,"" and ""stent design."" Reports were considered if they included original data, discussed hemodynamic changes after stent-based treatment of cerebral aneurysms, examined the hemodynamic effects of stent deployment, and/or described the geometric characteristics of both stents and the aneurysms they were used to treat. The search strategy yielded a total of 122 articles, 61 were excluded after screening the titles and abstracts. Additional articles were then identified by cross-checking reference lists. The final collection of 97 articles demonstrates that the geometric characteristics and configurations of deployed stents influenced hemodynamic parameters such as aneurysmal WSS, inflow, and pressure. The geometric characteristics of the aneurysm and its position also had significant influences on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics after treatment. In conclusion, changes in specific aneurysmal hemodynamic parameters that result from stenting relate to a number of factors including the geometric properties and configurations of deployed stents, the geometric properties of the aneurysm, and the pretreatment hemodynamics.","Alkhalili, Kenan; Hannallah, Jack; Cobb, Mary; Chalouhi, Nohra; Philips, Jessica L; Echeverria, Angela B; Jabbour, Pascal; Babiker, M Haithem; Frakes, David H; Gonzalez, L Fernando",Asian journal of neurosurgery,320,1

Studies using this technique have shown that schizophrenia is characterized by a lower level of fractional anisotropy of the tissue compartment (FAt) and higher free-water fractional volume (FW). It is unknown, however, whether such abnormalities are an expression of pre-existing (genetic) risk for schizophrenia or a manifestation of the illness. To investigate the contribution of familial risk factors to white matter abnormalities, we used the free-water imaging technique to assess FAt and FW in a large cohort of 471 participants including 161 patients with schizophrenia, 182 non-psychotic siblings, and 128 healthy controls. In this sample, patients did not show significant differences in FAt as compared to controls, but did exhibit a higher level of FW relative to both controls and siblings in the left uncinate fasciculus, superior corona radiata and fornix / stria terminalis. This increase in FW was found to be related to, though not solely explained by, ventricular enlargement. Siblings did not show significant FW abnormalities. However, siblings did show a higher level of FAt as compared to controls and patients, in line with results of a previous study on the same data using conventional DTI. Taken together, our findings suggest that extracellular free-water accumulation in patients is likely a manifestation of established disease rather than an expression of familial risk for schizophrenia and that super-normal levels of FAt in unaffected siblings may reflect a compensatory process.","Chang, Xiao; Mandl, René C W; Pasternak, Ofer; Brouwer, Rachel M; Cahn, Wiepke; Collin, Guusje",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,320,16

METHODS An online survey using three validated scales was conducted in France, the UK, Italy, Mainland China, Taiwan, Egypt and Belgium. FINDINGS The proportion of respondents who screened positive on the three scales across the countries was 16-49% for depression, 60-86% for insomnia and 17-35% for post-traumatic stress disorder. The authors also identified an increase in the scores with longer time spent in personal protective equipment, female gender, advancing age and redeployed status.

The assessment of their uptake in tissues is mandatory but, to date, available technology does not allow to track and quantify incorporation in real-time. To fill this knowledge gap, the present study was intended to develop an innovative technology to determine kinetics of fluorescent MSC-EV uptake by means of time-lapse quantitative microscopy techniques. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs)-EVs were fluorescently labeled and tracked during their uptake into chondrocytes micromasses or cartilage explants, both derived from OA patients. Immunofluorescence and time-lapse coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, second harmonic generation and two-photon excited fluorescence were used to follow and quantify incorporation. EVs penetration appeared quickly after few minutes and reached 30-40 μm depth after 5 h in both explants and micromasses. In explants, uptake was slightly faster, with EVs signal overlapping both extracellular matrix and chondrocytes, whereas in micromasses a more homogenous diffusion was observed. The finding of this study demonstrates that this innovative technology is a powerful tool to monitor EVs migration in tissues characterized by a complex extracellular network, and to obtain data resembling in vivo conditions.","Mortati, Leonardo; de Girolamo, Laura; Perucca Orfei, Carlotta; Viganò, Marco; Brayda-Bruno, Marco; Ragni, Enrico; Colombini, Alessandra",Pharmaceutics,320,27

We conducted a systematic review to summarise the evidence of breastfeeding outcomes following exposure to IPV. DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS We searched for published studies without study design or language restrictions (up to July 2019) in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS and The Global Health Library. Studies assessing various breastfeeding outcomes (initiation, duration and exclusive breastfeeding) in women exposed to IPV in any form (physical, psychological or sexual) and at any stage (1 year pre-pregnancy, during or post-pregnancy) were included. Two authors independently selected the studies and conducted the quality appraisal by use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results were summarised taking precision and quality into account. RESULTS A total of 16 studies (participants n=414 393) were included and they adjusted for a total of 48 different confounders. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n=11) and most studies were judged to be fair/low quality. Four out of seven studies found that IPV exposure shortened breastfeeding duration (adjusted ORs/aORs=0.22 (95% CI: 0.05-0.85), 1.18 (95% CI: 1.01-1.37), 5.92 (95% CI: 1.72-27.98), 1.28 (95% CI: 1.18-1.39)). Further, 5/10 studies found that IPV led to early termination of exclusive breastfeeding (aORs=1.53 (95% CI: 1.01-23.1), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71-0.96), 1.35 (95% CI: 1.07-1.71), 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07-0.4), 1839 (95% CI: 1.61-2911)) and 2/6 studies found that IPV significantly reduced breastfeeding initiation (aORs=2.00 (95% CI: 1.2-3.3), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.7-0.93)). CONCLUSION IPV exposure appears to associate negatively with some breastfeeding outcomes. Individual patient data meta-analysis is required to quantify the magnitude of the association for specific IPV-outcome combinations. More high-quality studies and definition of core confounders are warranted.

With an increasing prevalence of diabetes and an aging population, the risks of infection of internal fixation devices are expected to grow. Although numerous retrospective clinical studies have identified a relationship between diabetes and infection, currently there are few animal models that have been used to investigate postoperative surgical-site infections associated with internal fixator implantation and diabetes. The authors therefore refined the protocol for inducing hyperglycemia and compared the bacterial burden in controls to pharmacologically induced type 1 diabetic rats after undergoing internal fracture plate fixation and Staphylococcus aureus surgical-site inoculation. Using an initial series of streptozotocin doses, followed by optional additional doses to reach a target blood glucose range of 300 to 600 mg/dl, the authors reliably induced diabetes in 100 percent of the rats (n = 16), in which a narrow hyperglycemic range was maintained 14 days after onset of diabetes (mean ± SEM, 466 ± 16 mg/dl; coefficient of variation, 0.15). With respect to their primary endpoint, the authors quantified a significantly higher infectious burden in inoculated diabetic animals (median, 3.2 × 10 colony-forming units/mg dry tissue) compared with inoculated nondiabetic animals (7.2 × 10 colony-forming units/mg dry tissue). These data support the authors' hypothesis that uncontrolled diabetes adversely affects the immune system's ability to clear Staphylococcus aureus associated with internal hardware.","Brown, Nga L; Rose, Michael B; Blueschke, Gert; Cho, Eugenia H; Schoenfisch, Mark H; Erdmann, Detlev; Klitzman, Bruce",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,320,1

The authors retrospectively investigated adverse events (AEs) by data-mining a self-reporting database to better understand toxicities, especially since it has been used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS A reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect the risk signals from the data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database (FAERS). The definition relied on system organ class (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). RESULTS The search retrieved 1,598 baricitinib-associated cases within the reporting period: 86 PTs with significant disproportionality were retained. Infections including ""herpes zoster"", ""oral herpes"" and ""herpes virus infection"" were found at a similar rate to those reported in trials, and such events were rare. Reports emerged for several thrombotic adverse events, while these events were also rare. Unexpected safety signals as opportunistic infections were detected. Serious outcomes as death and life-threatening outcomes accounted for 9.76% of the reported cases. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of these AEs does not appear above the background expected.

Antisense and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technologies have gained attention as potential antiasthma and antiviral approaches. In this study we analyzed whether gene silencing of interleukin (IL)-4 expression and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication by RNA interference is able to suppress allergen- and virus-induced responses in a mouse model of virus-induced asthma exacerbation. Knockdown efficacy of IL-4 siRNA molecules was analyzed in the human HEK293T cell line by cotransfection of six different siRNAs with a plasmid carrying mouse IL-4. The most potent siRNA was then used in a mouse model of RSV-induced asthma exacerbation. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (OVA) and then infected 12 days later intranasally with RSV Long strain (1×10(6) TCID50/mouse), followed 1 day later by intranasal challenge with OVA for 3 days. Mice were pretreated intranasally three times with either siRNA to IL-4 or GFP control, 2 days before, and on the first two OVA challenge days. siRNAs to RSV or rhinovirus control were inoculated intranasally once, 3 hr before RSV infection. Combined anti-IL-4 and anti-RSV siRNAs were able to significantly reduce total cell counts and eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, development of airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation and to downregulate IL-4 mRNA expression and RSV viral RNA, but to upregulate IFN-γ levels in lung tissues. We conclude that anti-helper T cells type 2 and antiviral siRNAs may constitute a new therapeutic approach for treatment of virus induced asthma exacerbations.","Khaitov, Musa R; Shilovskiy, Igor P; Nikonova, Aleksandra A; Shershakova, Nadezda N; Kamyshnikov, Oleg Y; Babakhin, Alexander A; Zverev, Vitaly V; Johnston, Sebastian L; Khaitov, Rakhim M",Human gene therapy,320,29

METHODS Forty participants were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The experimental group did the VR exercises while smelling the lavender oil scents. The control group did the VR exercises without it. Both groups did the exercises in ten 45-min sessions. We assessed the participants with the timed up and go (TUG) test, Berg balance scale (BBS), fall efficacy scale - international (FES-I), and the 29-item multiple sclerosis impact scale (MSIS-29). We did the tests at the baseline and after the last exercise session.

X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. Deep learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large data sets. However, data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for COVID-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification [collaborative or sparse representation (SR)] might provide satisfactory performance with limited size data sets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to the neural network (NN)-based methods. To address this deficiency, convolution support estimation network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between representation-based and NN approaches by providing a noniterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally SR coefficient support, which is critical information for class decision in representation-based techniques. The main premises of this study can be summarized as follows: 1) A benchmark X-ray data set, namely QaTa-Cov19, containing over 6200 X-ray images is created. The data set covering 462 X-ray images from COVID-19 patients along with three other classes; bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and normal. 2) The proposed CSEN-based classification scheme equipped with feature extraction from state-of-the-art deep NN solution for X-ray images, CheXNet, achieves over 98% sensitivity and over 95% specificity for COVID-19 recognition directly from raw X-ray images when the average performance of 5-fold cross validation over QaTa-Cov19 data set is calculated. 3) Having such an elegant COVID-19 assistive diagnosis performance, this study further provides evidence that COVID-19 induces a unique pattern in X-rays that can be discriminated with high accuracy.","Yamac, Mehmet; Ahishali, Mete; Degerli, Aysen; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E H; Gabbouj, Moncef",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,320,16

Six participants walked carrying buckets containing various weights. The weight was either carried in one hand or distributed evenly between both hands. Electromyography, force plate and body kinematic data were input to a three-dimensional anatomically detailed model of the spine to calculate spine loading. Carrying loads in one hand resulted in more load on the low back than when the load was split between both hands. When carrying 30 kg in one hand, the low back compression exceeded 2800 N; however, splitting the load between hands reduced low back compression to 1570 N (reduction of 44%). Doubling the total load by carrying 30 kg in each hand actually produced lower spine compression than when carrying 30 kg in one hand. Balancing the load between both hands when carrying material has merit and should be considered when designing work. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY Carrying a load in one hand (30 kg) resulted in more spine load than splitting the same load between both hands (15 kg). When carrying double the load in both hands (30 kg in each hand vs. 30 kg in one hand), spine load decreased, suggesting merit in balancing load when designing work.","McGill, Stuart M; Marshall, Leigh; Andersen, Jordan",Ergonomics,320,31

Our laboratory is pioneer in studying effect of hyperoxia on cardiac pathophysiology. In this study for the first time, we are reporting the sequence of cardiac pathophysiological events in mice under hyperoxic conditions in time-dependent manner. C57BL/6J male mice, aged 8-10 weeks, were treated with either normal air or >90% oxygen for 24, 48, and 72 h. Following normal air or hyperoxia treatment, physical, biochemical, functional, electrical, and molecular parameters were analyzed. Our data showed that significant reduction of body weight observed as early as 24 h hyperoxia treatment, whereas, no significant changes in heart weight until 72 h. Although we do not see any fibrosis in these hearts, but observed significant increase in cardiomyocyte size with hyperoxia treatment in time-dependent manner. Our data also demonstrated that arrhythmias were present in mice at 24 h hyperoxia, and worsened comparatively after 48 and 72 h. Echocardiogram data confirmed cardiac dysfunction in time-dependent manner. Dysregulation of ion channels such as Kv4.2 and KChIP2; and serum cardiac markers confirmed that hyperoxia-induced effects worsen with each time point. From these observations, it is evident that electrical remodeling precedes structural remodeling, both of which gets worse with length of hyperoxia exposure, therefore shorter periods of hyperoxia exposure is always beneficial for better outcome in ICU/critical care units.","Rodgers, Jennifer L; Vanthenapalli, Sahit; Panguluri, Siva K",Journal of cellular physiology,320,26

This study compared three clinical recommendations (dilution, rinsing and wiping) on plaque pH after formula consumption. METHODS Eighteen subjects were recruited. The five interventions with 2-week washout between visits included: Rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s (UF); rinse with 50% diluted formula for 30 s (DF); rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s, followed by rinsing with water for 1 minute (UF/R); rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s, followed by wiping (UF/W); rinse with 10% sucrose for 30 s as control (C). Plaque samples were collected at baseline, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min after the intervention and pH measured using the plaque sampling method. RESULTS UF/R resulted in significantly smaller pH drops at 5, 10 and 20 min compared to UF. It also resulted in higher minimum pH (UF/R: 6.34 ± 0.36 Vs UF: 6.06 ± 0.40, p = 0.02), smaller maximum pH drop (UF/R: 0.63 ± 0.35 Vs UF: 0.90 ± 0.49, p = 0.03), smaller sum of change of hydrogen ion concentration (UF/R: 9.22 × 10-7 ± 7.8 × 10-7 Vs UF: 2.30 × 10-6 ± 2.6 × 10-6, p = 0.04), and smaller area under the curve (UF/R: 7.70 ± 5.44 Vs UF: 13.44 ± 9.44, p = 0.02). DF and UF/W did not result in any significant pH change compared to UF. CONCLUSIONS Of the three clinical recommendations, only rinsing with water for 1 min after undiluted formula reduced plaque acidogenicity. Teeth wiping with a moist cloth and 50% dilution of infant formula did not have an effect on plaque acidity.","Koh, S G S; Sim, Y F; Sim, C J; Hu, S; Hong, C H L; Duggal, M S",European archives of paediatric dentistry : official journal of the European Academy of Paediatric Dentistry,320,1

METHODS To study lymphatic flow, C57BL/6 mice underwent lymphadenectomy (n = 5), sham lymphadenectomy (n = 5), or no intervention (n = 5), followed by methylene blue injection. Mice were dissected to determine whether methylene blue traveled to the iliac LN. To study host response to skin transplantation, C57BL/6 mice underwent allogeneic skin transplantation with LN excision (n = 6), allogeneic skin transplantation alone (n = 6), or syngeneic skin transplantation (n = 4). Skin grafts were placed distal to the popliteal fossa and mice were euthanized at day 10. Grafts were stained for endothelial cell and proliferation markers (CD31 and Ki67, respectively). Secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, ipsilateral axillary LN, and contralateral inguinal LN) were removed and rechallenged with BALB/c alloantigen in vitro with subsequent assay of interferon-γ and interleukin 4 cell expression using ELISPOT technique. RESULTS Mice that underwent LN excision had no evidence of methylene blue in the iliac nodes; mice without surgical intervention or with sham LN excision consistently had methylene blue visible in the ipsilateral iliac nodes. Mice treated with allogeneic skin transplantation and LN excision had lower expression of interferon-γ and interleukin 4 in the secondary lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS Lymph node excision completely interrupts lymphatic flow of the hind limb. This model of lymphatic isolation impairs the ability of the transplant recipient to acutely mount a Th1 or Th2 response to allogeneic skin transplants.","Agarwal, Shailesh; Loder, Shawn; Wood, Sherri; Cederna, Paul S; Bishop, D Keith; Wang, Stewart C; Levi, Benjamin",Annals of surgery,320,12

This may lead to confusion and delays in the enablement of multicentre research projects. This study explores the effect of differing processes for Ethics and Governance in the establishment of the CovidSurg-Cancer study during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS An anonymous, structured web-based questionnaire was designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) platform to capture consultant surgeons, fellows, and trainees experience in the ethics application process. 'CovidSurg-Cancer' was an international multicentre collaborative study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The ethics process to set up this observational study was used as to explore the differing processes applied across Australia. RESULTS The CovidSurg-Cancer study was successfully set up in 14 hospitals. Four hospitals approved the study directly as an audit. Of the remaining sites, 10 ethics applications underwent Human Research Ethics Committee review following which two (14%) were subsequently approved as an audit activity and eight hospitals (57%) were given formal ethical approval with waiver of consent. Ethics application acceptance from another Australian Human Research Ethics Committee was provided with six applications; however, only three were reciprocated without the requirement for further agreements. A third of (30%) respondents suggested that the details of the application pathway, process and documentation were unclear. CONCLUSION Ethics processes are varied across Australia with considerable repetition. A centralized, harmonized application process would enhance collaborative research.","Dudi-Venkata, Nagendra N; Cox, Daniel R A; Marson, Nicholas; Tan, Lorwai; Pockney, Peter; Muralidharan, Vijayaragavan; Watson, David I; Richards, Toby",ANZ journal of surgery,320,5

To date, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been observed only in patients with severe renal insufficiency.The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a prolonged circulation time of GBCAs caused by reduced renal clearance on the long-term retention of Gd in the skin of rats after administration of different GBCAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS Renally impaired Han Wistar Rats (5/6-nephrectomized rats) were injected with Omniscan, OptiMARK, Magnevist, or Gadovist. The contrast agents were administered once daily for 5 consecutive days into the tail vein at a dose of 2.5 mmol Gd/kg b.w. Skin biopsies were taken at various time points, and the gadolinium (Gd) concentration was determined by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) over an observation period of 168 days post injection (p.i.). RESULTS Differences in the skin Gd concentrations were observed between the 4 investigated GBCAs. For the nonionic linear compounds, Omniscan and OptiMARK, high Gd concentrations were maintained in the skin over the observation period of up to 168 days p.i. For the ionic linear compound, Magnevist, comparatively lower Gd retention in the skin was observed over time. For the macrocyclic compound, Gadovist, the Gd values in the skin were even lower, and significantly lower than Gd values in the skin in Omniscan and OptiMARK treated animals. CONCLUSION The results of this preclinical study support the use of 5/6-nephrectomized rats as a model for prolonged circulation time of GBCAs as seen in patients with severe renal impairment. Surgically induced severe renal impairment resulted in delayed clearance of the administered GBCAs in the study animals. The highest amount of Gd was observed in the skin after treatment with the nonionic linear GBCAs, whereas the lowest Gd values were observed after treatment with the macrocyclic agent. This suggests that the difference in the Gd values observed in rat skin tissue after treatment with the different GBCAs is caused of a different propensity of the different GBCAs to release Gd in vivo. However, the analytical method used does not distinguish between chelated and unchelated Gd.","Pietsch, Hubertus; Lengsfeld, Philipp; Steger-Hartmann, Thomas; Löwe, Andrea; Frenzel, Thomas; Hütter, Joachim; Sieber, Martin A",Investigative radiology,320,1

Free flap and VTE thromboprophylaxis may coincide but tend to vary from surgeon to surgeon. This study identifies VTE prophylaxis patterns and perceptions among H&N microsurgeons in the United States. METHODS An online survey on VTE prophylaxis practice patterns and perceptions was emailed to 172 H&N microsurgeons in the United States using an anonymous link. RESULTS There were 74 respondents (43% response rate). These surgeons completed residencies in otolaryngology (59%), plastic surgery (31%), and oral maxillofacial surgery (7%). Most underwent fellowship training (95%) and have practiced at an academic center (97%) for at least 6 years (58%), performing an average of 42 ± 31 H&N free flap cases per year (range = 1-190). Most adhered to general VTE prophylaxis guidelines (69%) while 11% did not and 20% were unsure. Nearly all surgeons (99%) would provide prophylactic anticoagulation, mostly in the form of subcutaneous heparin (51%) or enoxaparin (44%); 64% additionally used aspirin, while 4% used aspirin alone. The majority of surgeons (68%) reported having postoperative VTE complications, with six surgeons (8%) reporting patient deaths due to pulmonary embolism. A third of the surgeons have encountered VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events, but most still believe that chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention (92%). While 35% of surgeons were satisfied with their current practice, most would find it helpful to have official prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines specific to H&N free flap cases. CONCLUSION The majority of microsurgeons experienced postoperative VTE complications after H&N free flap reconstruction despite the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Though bleeding events are a concern, most surgeons believe chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention and would welcome official guidelines specific to this high-risk population.","Venkatesh, Kaushik P; Ambani, Shoshana W; Arakelians, Aris R L; Johnson, Jonas T; Solari, Mario G",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,320,8

This study was aimed to determine the effects of sorafenib on inducing autophagy and immunomodulatory activity and its implication on graft rejection. METHODS Cell viability and surface antigens were examined by 7-amino-actinomycin D and flow cytometric analysis. Autophagy was characterized using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy for morphology, Western blotting for LC3B-I lipidation and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling molecules, and immunofluorescence staining for endogenous LC3B, GFP-LC3 transfection, and acidic component vacuoles. Skin allograft in mice was used as an experimental transplantation rejection model. Soluble factors contained in culture medium and serum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS We found that sorafenib inhibited the viability of dendritic cells accompanied by morphologic changes characteristic of autophagy and immature differentiation. This autophagic effect induced by sorafenib was validated by LC3B-I lipidation and autophagosome accumulation. Sorafenib treatment was associated with the down-regulation of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin and its downstream substrate p70S6K. We next performed skin graft model to testify the role of sorafenib-induced immature and autophagic dendritic cells. Intriguingly, sorafenib prolonged the survival of skin allograft without major toxicity. Blockade of autophagic flux by chloroquine partially diminished the protective effect of sorafenib, indicating an autophagy-related mechanism in vivo. CONCLUSION This study suggests that sorafenib, in addition to being an anticancer agent, may have potential to be developed as a new category of immunosuppressant drugs acting via autophagy induction of dendritic cells.","Lin, Jiunn-Chang; Huang, Wei-Pang; Liu, Chien-Liang; Lee, Jie-Jen; Liu, Tsang-Pai; Ko, Wen-Chin; Huang, Yu-Chuen; Hsu, Ming-Ling; Wu, Chih-Hsiung; Chen, Yu-Jen",Transplantation,320,1

Shortcomings of LESS surgery include loss of triangulation, instrument collisions, and poor ergonomics, making advanced laparoscopic tasks especially challenging. We compared a LESS system with a robotic single-site surgery platform in performance of a suturing and knot-tying task under clinically simulated conditions. METHODS Each of five volunteer minimally invasive surgeons was tasked with suturing a 5 cm longitudinal enterotomy in porcine small intestine with square knots at either end, using a laparoendoscopic or da Vinci robotic single-site surgery platform, within a 20 min time limit. A saline leak test was then performed. Each surgeon performed the task twice using each system. The time to completion of the task and presence of a leak were noted. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the overall completion rate within the defined time limit, and a Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare the specific times to complete the task. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS All surgeons were able to complete the task on the first try within 20 min using the robot system; 60% of surgeons were able to complete it after two attempts using the LESS surgery system. Time to completion using the robot system was significantly shorter than the time using the standard LESS system (p < 0.0001). There were no leaks after closure with the robot system; the leak rate following the standard LESS system was 90%. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons demonstrated significantly better suturing and knot-tying capabilities using the robot single-site system compared to a standard LESS system.

RECENT FINDINGS There is ample evidence to support elevated Lp(a) levels, present in approximately 20% of the general population, as a causal, independent risk factor for CVD and its role as a significant risk enhancer. Several guidelines and position statements have been published to assist in the identification, treatment and follow-up of adults with elevated levels of Lp(a). There is growing interest in Lp(a) screening and strategies to improve health behaviors starting in youth, although published recommendations for this population are limited. In addition to the well established increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and valvular aortic stenosis, data from the coronavirus pandemic suggest adults with elevated Lp(a) may have a particularly high-risk of cardiovascular complications. Lp(a)-specific-lowering therapies are currently in development. Despite their inability to lower Lp(a), use of statins have been shown to improve outcomes in primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY Considerable differences exist amongst published guidelines for adults on the use of Lp(a) in clinical practice, and recommendations for youth are limited. With increasing knowledge of Lp(a)'s role in CVD, including recent observations of COVID-19-related risk of cardiovascular complications, more harmonized and comprehensive guidelines for Lp(a) in clinical practice are required. This will facilitate clinical decision-making and help define best practices for identification and management of elevated Lp(a) in adults and youth.","Wilson, Don P; Koschinsky, Marlys L; Moriarty, Patrick M","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",320,1

Referrals are the usual management performed for HDP women in primary care and the primary care providers' practice is challenged by three identified themes: (i) providers' limited confidence to perform HDP management, (ii) fragmented continuity of care, and (iii) community beliefs. Many participants also desired to have more focused guidance to improve HDP management in primary care practice. CONCLUSION Even though Indonesian antenatal care and referrals are generally accessible, there are many challenges and fragmentation of HDP management. The most prominent challenge is the primary care providers' lack of confidence in performing the management and the 'elephant' of an urgent need of practice guidelines in primary care that has never been appropriately described in the literature. Further development of an evidence-based primary care-focused guidance will potentially improve primary care providers' skills to perform optimal HDP management and provide appropriate education to their patients.","Ekawati, Fitriana Murriya; Emilia, Ova; Gunn, Jane; Licqurish, Sharon; Lau, Phyllis",BMC family practice,320,20

In these patients, we performed mycological culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for isolation of Aspergillus sp. We followed the AspICU algorithm to diagnose putative IPA. Moreover, we considered relevant the positivity of galactomannan in BAL. We diagnosed putative IPA in 3 patients. The common features of these 3 patients were: more than 21 days of stay in ICU, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and treatment with steroids (1mg/kg per day). Therefore, CAPA has to be systematically considered although a new algorithm to diagnose it is needed to treat patients in early stages in order to avoid catastrophic outcomes.","Sánchez Martín, C; Madrid Martínez, E; González Pellicer, R; Armero Ibáñez, R; Martínez González, E; Llau Pitarch, J V",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,320,1

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to identify interventions to support transitional care for older people living with dementia and concomitant multimorbidity and their caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN: Systematic review was completed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search from 2000 to January 2018 of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Academic Search Complete databases for studies which implemented a transitional care intervention for older people living with dementia and multimorbidity. The search terms used were: ""dementia,"" ""multi-morbidity,"" ""multiple chronic conditions,"" ""transitional care,"" and ""care coordination"". RESULTS: Out of the 6053 identified abstracts, 11 studies and 13 papers were included. These studies included 1861 people living with dementia, mean age 80 years (SD 3) and 1503 caregivers, with a mean age of 69 years (SD 5). The heterogeneity of study interventions and outcome measures precluded a meta-analysis being conducted. Therefore, narrative synthesis was undertaken identifying six elements of care that optimise outcomes for people living with dementia and/or their carers; 1) unmet needs; 2) depression; 3) education and support; 4) physical decline; 5) poor quality of life and; 6) access and knowledge of community services. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates the paucity of interventions available to improve essential elements and reduce frequency, impact and experiences of transitions for this vulnerable population. There is an increasing need for further research and development in transitional care for these vulnerable people.

In the HBV animal model, woodchucks, the application of DNA vaccine expressing woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) core antigen (WHcAg) in combination with antivirals led to the prolonged control of viral replication. However, it became clear that the use of more potent vaccines is required to overcome WHV persistence. Therefore, we asked whether stronger and more functional T-cell responses could be achieved using the modified vaccines and an optimized prime-boost vaccination regimen. We developed a new DNA plasmid (pCGWHc) and recombinant adenoviruses (AdVs) showing high expression levels of WHcAg. Mice vaccinated with the improved plasmid pCGWHc elicited a stronger WHcAg-specific CD8(+) T-cell response than with the previously used vaccines. Using multicolor flow cytometry and an in vivo cytotoxicity assay, we showed that immunization in a DNA prime-AdV boost regimen resulted in an even more vigorous and functional T-cell response than immunization with the new plasmid alone. Immunization of naïve woodchucks with pCGWHc plasmid or AdVs induced a significant WHcAg-specific degranulation response prior to the challenge, this response had not been previously detected. Consistently, this response led to a rapid control of infection after the challenge. Our results demonstrate that high antigen expression levels and the DNA prime-AdV boost immunization improved the T-cell response in mice and induced significant T-cell responses in woodchucks. Therefore, this new vaccination strategy may be a candidate for a therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV infection.","Kosinska, Anna D; Johrden, Lena; Zhang, Ejuan; Fiedler, Melanie; Mayer, Anja; Wildner, Oliver; Lu, Mengji; Roggendorf, Michael",Journal of virology,320,1

Many oncologists are having challenging conversations with their patients about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting cancer care and may desire evidence-based communication guidance. Objectives To identify the clinical scenarios that pose communication challenges, understand patient reactions to these scenarios, and develop a communication guide with sample responses. Design, Setting, and Participants This qualitative study that was conducted at a single Midwestern academic medical center invited physicians to respond to a brief semistructured interview by email or telephone and then disseminated an anonymous online survey among patients with cancer. Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios were identified by the physicians, and potential reactions to these scenarios were gleaned from the patient responses to the survey. Health communication experts were invited to participate in the iterative development of a communication guide, comprising 3 essential communication principles and strategies and informed by insights from physicians and patients. This study was conducted from March 25, 2020, to April 2, 2020. Interventions Expert review, interviews, and surveys assessing challenging situations specific to cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures Oncology-specific, COVID-19-related clinical scenarios from physician interviews; responses to each scenario from patient surveys; and applicable communication principles from health communication expert literature review. Results Of the 8 physicians who participated in interviews, 4 were men (50%) and 4 were women (50%). These physicians represented the following disciplines: internal medicine (n = 1), hematology/oncology (n = 2), radiation oncology (n = 3), and surgical oncology (n = 2). Their disease site specialization included cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. A total of 48 patients with cancer completed the online survey; no demographic information was collected from the patients. The physicians identified 8 oncology-specific, COVID-19-related scenarios in which communication might be challenging: (1) worse outcomes from COVID-19, (2) delay in cancer screening, (3) delay in diagnostic workup, (4) delay in initiation of treatment, (5) offer of nonstandard treatment, (6) treatment breaks, (7) delay in follow-up imaging or care, and (8) inability to be admitted into the hospital for management. Potential patient reactions to each of these scenarios were compiled from survey responses. For most scenarios, patient reactions involved anger, fear, and anxiety (eg, ""I'm scared""; ""This isn't fair. I am upset.""). These emotional patient responses informed the selection of the 3 general communication principles, which suggested language and strategies that physicians can use to respond to patients. Conclusions and Relevance In this qualitative study, physicians and patients identified communication needs used by health communication experts to inform the development of a practical, evidence-based communication guide for oncology care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gharzai, Laila A; Resnicow, Kenneth; An, Lawrence C; Jagsi, Reshma",JAMA oncology,320,1

When the amount of accessible cholesterol in the PM exceeds a threshold level, the excess cholesterol moves to the ER where it regulates the SREBP2 pathway and undergoes esterification. We reported previously that the Aster/Gramd1 family of sterol transporters mediates nonvesicular movement of cholesterol from the PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in multiple mammalian cell types. Here, we investigated the PM pool of accessible cholesterol in cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts with a knockdown of Aster-A and in mouse macrophages from Aster-B and Aster-A/B-deficient mice. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses revealed an expansion of the accessible cholesterol pool in cells lacking Aster expression. The increased accessible cholesterol pool in the PM was accompanied by reduced cholesterol to the ER, evident by increased expression of SREBP2-regulated genes. Co-sedimentation experiments with liposomes revealed that the Aster-B GRAM domain binds to membranes in a cholesterol concentration-dependent manner and that the binding is facilitated by the presence of phosphatidylserine. These studies reveal that the Aster-mediated nonvesicular cholesterol transport pathway controls levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM as well as the activity of the SREBP pathway.","Ferrari, Alessandra; He, Cuiwen; Kennelly, John Paul; Sandhu, Jaspreet; Xiao, Xu; Chi, Xun; Jiang, Haibo; Young, Stephen G; Tontonoz, Peter",Molecular and cellular biology,320,20

Unlike their physician counterparts, MAs rarely receive financial incentives as a part of their compensation. This exploratory study aims to understand MA acceptability of financial incentives and perceived MA control over common population health measures. METHODS We conducted semistructured focus groups between August and December of 2019 across 10 clinics affiliated with 3 institutions in California and Utah. MAs' perceptions of experienced and hypothetical financial incentives, their potential influence on workflow processes, and perceived levels of control over population health measures were discussed, recorded, and qualitatively analyzed for emerging themes. Perceived levels of control were further quantified using a Likert survey; measures were grouped into factors representing vaccinations, and workflow completed in the same day or multiple days (multiday). Mean scores for each factor were compared using repeated 1-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer adjustment. RESULTS MAs reported little direct experience with financial incentives. They indicated that a hypothetical bonus representing 2% to 3% of their average annual base pay would be acceptable and influential in improving consistent performance during patient rooming workflow. MAs reported having greater perceived control over vaccinations (P <.001) and same-day measures (P <.001) as compared with multiday measures. CONCLUSIONS MAs perceived that relatively small financial incentives would increase their motivation and quality of care. Our findings suggests target measures should focus on MA work processes that are completed in the same day as the patient encounter, particularly vaccinations. Future investigation is needed to understand the effectiveness of MA financial incentives in practice.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Brown-Johnson, Cati; Kling, Samantha M R; Veruttipong, Darlene; Amano, Alexis; Bohman, Bryan; Daines, William P; Overton, David; Srivastava, Raj; Asch, Steven M",Annals of family medicine,320,1

Subjects were classified as having sepsis if they had a modified SOFA score ≥2 within 24 hours of admission. Serum was stored and later tested for malaria parasites using a nested PCR assay. Presence of severe malaria was defined using modified World Health Organization criteria. Of 4,989 patients enrolled, 153 patients (3%) were PCR positive for either Plasmodium falciparum (74 [48%]), P. vivax (69 [45%]), or both organisms (10 [7%]). Of 153 malaria patients, 80 were severe malaria patients presenting with sepsis, 70 were non-severe malaria patients presenting with sepsis, and three were non-severe malaria patients presenting without sepsis.

This study identified barriers and enablers associated with intersectoral coordination at an early stage of the pandemic. The study focused on the roles played by the academic and private sector in different areas of public health planning and delivery concerning COVID-19 in Colombia. METHODS A qualitative approach was used to understand stakeholders' experiences and perceptions of intersectoral working in response to COVID-19 in three Colombian cities (Bogotá, Cali and Cartagena). Between March and November 2020, data was collected via semi-structured interviews conducted online with 42 key actors, including representatives of governmental bodies, universities, and professional associations. The dataset was analysed thematically using a combination of inductive and deductive methods. RESULTS Organizations adjacent to the health system, including universities and the private sector, supported responses to COVID-19 by providing evidence to inform decision-making, additional service capacity, and supporting coordination (eg, convening intersectoral ""roundtables""). The academic and private sector involvement in intersectoral coordination was stimulated by solidarity (being the ""right thing to do"") and motivation for supporting local companies (reopening the economy). Intersectoral working was influenced by pre-existing (substantive) and emerging (situational) enablers and barriers. CONCLUSION This study showed that intersectoral coordination has played an important role in responding to COVID-19 in Colombia. Coordination was influenced by substantive and situational enablers and barriers. Based on our findings, policy-makers should focus on addressing substantive barriers to coordination, including the pre-existing tensions and mistrust among national and local healthcare actors, strict regulations and limited financial and human resources, while providing support for situational enablers, including alignment of public and private actors' interests, intersectoral government support and establishing frequent communication channels and formal spaces of interaction among sector, in processes of decision-making.","Turner, Simon; Ulloa, Ana María; Niño, Natalia; Valencia Godoy, Vivian",International journal of health policy and management,320,16

Children were grouped according to detection of bacterial otopathogen in their middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of VTI, and outcomes for future otorhinolaryngology surgery compared. RESULTS Age, gender, pneumococcal vaccination status, antibiotic usage, day-care attendance, number of siblings and number of AOM episodes were similar between groups. Of the 63 children who had PCR +ve MEE, 58.7% required repeat VTI compared with 31.4% of the 51 children with no otopathogen detected in their MEE (odds ratio = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [1.4-6.8]; P = 0.004). Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) was the predominant otopathogen in MEE (79% of all PCR +ve MEE). Respiratory virus detection was not associated with repeat VTI.

METHODS A Medline search using the keywords (adrenalectomy, laparoscopy, adrenal masses/tumours) was done for reports published between 1990 and 2011. Key articles were used to find more relevant references on the evaluation and laparoscopic management of adrenal masses. RESULTS The hormonal evaluation is not standardised, but initial screening tests are recommended and followed with confirmatory ones when positive, equivocal or the clinical presentation suggest adrenal hyperfunction. The imaging studies had, and continued to, advance, especially computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography/CT. These advances have increased the accuracy of the diagnosis of adrenal masses, with a reported high sensitivity and specificity of 95-100%. The introduction of laparoscopy has resulted in more adrenal lesions being removed, especially incidental lesions smaller than the 5-6 cm that was previously the indication for surgical excision. The technique has developed and larger lesions of >6 cm are now considered for LA in the proper setting. The transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches are currently widely practised, with minor differences in the outcome. The reported outcome, although mostly retrospective, is excellent and with fewer complications. The role of LA for adrenal malignancy should be considered cautiously. Preoperative imaging signs of invasion into surrounding structures should be considered a contraindication for LA. CONCLUSION LA is the standard procedure for most adrenal lesions of appropriate size and no signs of surrounding tissue invasion, giving an excellent outcome.","Al-Zahrani, Hassan Mesfer",Arab journal of urology,320,17

Human cardiosphere-derived cells (hCDCs) are taken into consideration as a promising cell resource in cell therapy in recent years. In this study, we designed an electrochemical stimulation system, which sends square pulses to the hCDCs and records their electrical response. Morphology, viability and differentiation of hCDCs are monitored at certain time courses of the treatment. Differentiating hCDCs aligned perpendicularly with respect to the direction of applied electric current, and obtained a spindle-like morphology, while they remained viable. At the same time, specific cardiac marker genes including GATA4, cTnT and α-MHC showed a considerable up-regulation. Our findings confirm that hCDCs differentiate to committed cardiomyocytes when hCDCs receive an electrical energy of 0.06 - 0.12 Wh. This amount of electrical energy could be applied to the stem cells using versatile electrical stimulation patterns via commercially available devices.","Nazari, Hojjatollah; Kehtari, Mousa; Rad, Iman; Ashtari, Behnaz; Joghataei, Mohammad Taghi",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,320,29

Diagnosis and optimal management of MR requires integration of valve disease and heart failure specialists, MV cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists with expertise in structural heart disease, and imaging experts. The introduction of trans- catheter MV therapies has highlighted the need for a consensus approach to pragmatic clinical trial design and uniform endpoint definitions to evaluate outcomes in patients with MR. The Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium is a collaboration between leading academic research organizations and physician-scientists specializing in MV disease from the United States and Europe. Three in-person meetings were held in Virginia and New York during which 44 heart failure, valve, and imaging experts, MV surgeons and interventional cardiologists, clinical trial specialists and statisticians, and representatives from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered all aspects of MV pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapies, culminating in a 2-part document describing consensus recommendations for clinical trial design (Part 1) and endpoint definitions (Part 2) to guide evaluation of transcatheter and surgical therapies for MR. The adoption of these recommendations will afford robustness and consistency in the comparative effectiveness evaluation of new devices and approaches to treat MR. These principles may be useful for regulatory assessment of new transcatheter MV devices, as well as for monitoring local and regional outcomes to guide quality improvement initiatives.","Stone, Gregg W; Adams, David H; Abraham, William T; Kappetein, Arie Pieter; Généreux, Philippe; Vranckx, Pascal; Mehran, Roxana; Kuck, Karl-Heinz; Leon, Martin B; Piazza, Nicolo; Head, Stuart J; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Vahanian, Alec S",European heart journal,320,4

Online and virtual classrooms have not been able to substitute the hands-on experience and learning via direct interaction with senior colleagues. To overcome these challenges, we organized a hybrid workshop where simulation-based learning modules, direct and virtual interaction with surgeons during live surgeries or didactic lectures were utilized to help delegates in understanding the nuances of neurosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS A 3-day hybrid workshop was held in March 2021, which was attended by 133 delegates. A structured questionnaire was utilized to record their feedback. RESULTS An overwhelming majority of the respondents (94.1%, n=64) found hybrid conferences to be better than an online conference. Most of the respondents (88.3%, n=60) rated the utility of direct face to face interaction to be more satisfying as compared to online interaction with faculty during a webinar. Again, many the respondents (86.8%, n=59) believed that similar hybrid events will be the new normal given the current situation of COVID19 pandemic. Large majority (88.2%, n=60) of the respondents reported that they will prefer a hybrid event over an online conference. CONCLUSIONS In this era of COVID-19 pandemic, 'Hybrid' microneurosurgery workshop offers unique opportunities to enhance surgical skills acquisition by hands-on simulation-based learning and observing live surgical demonstrations, apart from two-way interactions with experts under one roof. This may be a steppingstone for what lies ahead in the future of neurosurgical training.","Garg, Kanwaljeet; Mishra, Shashwat; Raheja, Amol; Verma, Satish; Tandon, Vivek; Agrawal, Siddharth; Suri, Ashish; Chandra, P S; Prada, Francesco; Servadei, Franco; Kale, S S; Srivastava, Padma",World neurosurgery,320,1

In the current era of rapidly emerging technologies, adversaries are not only rediscovering chemical and biological weapons; they are also displaying an increased propensity to employ them to cause strategic instability among deployed forces or nations undergoing conflict. The United States's investments in its Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) can be a critical enabler of the third offset strategy, which is a DOD initiative that seeks to maximize force capability to offset emerging threats. To realize this vision, the CBDP must make fundamental changes in acquiring and employing effective technologies so that enemy use of chemical and biological agents against US assets is no longer a viable option.

In this study, we investigated human T cell recall responses to fully glycosylated spike trimer, recombinant N protein, as well as to S, N, M, and E peptide pools in the early convalescent phase and compared them with influenza-specific memory responses from the same donors. All subjects showed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to at least one Ag. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific and influenza-specific CD4+ T cell responses were predominantly of the central memory phenotype; however SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells exhibited a lower IFN-γ to TNF ratio compared with influenza-specific memory responses from the same donors, independent of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were less multifunctional than influenza-specific T cells, particularly in severe cases, potentially suggesting exhaustion. Most SARS-CoV-2-convalescent subjects also produced IFN-γ in response to seasonal OC43 S protein. We observed granzyme B+/IFN-γ+, CD4+, and CD8+ proliferative responses to peptide pools in most individuals, with CD4+ T cell responses predominating over CD8+ T cell responses. Peripheral T follicular helper (pTfh) responses to S or N strongly correlated with serum neutralization assays as well as receptor binding domain-specific IgA; however, the frequency of pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 was lower than the frequency of pTfh responses to influenza virus. Overall, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are robust; however, CD4+ Th1 responses predominate over CD8+ T cell responses, have a more inflammatory profile, and have a weaker pTfh response than the response to influenza virus within the same donors, potentially contributing to COVID-19 disease.","Law, Jaclyn C; Koh, Wan Hon; Budylowski, Patrick; Lin, Jonah; Yue, FengYun; Abe, Kento T; Rathod, Bhavisha; Girard, Melanie; Li, Zhijie; Rini, James M; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison; Chan, Adrienne K; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Watts, Tania H; A Ostrowski, Mario",Journal of immunology,320,2

MATERIALS AND METHODS An institutional registry was retrospectively reviewed and revealed 16 patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer (median age, 67 y; range, 50-86 y) who underwent percutaneous image-guided ablation to treat 18 metastatic sites. A subgroup of 7 patients with 8 metastases were androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)-naïve and underwent ablation to delay initiation of ADT. Local tumor control, progression-free survival (PFS), ADT-free survival, and procedural complications were analyzed. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 15 of 18 metastases (83%) at a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 5-56 mo). Local tumor recurrence was found in 3 of 18 metastases (17%), with a median time to local recurrence of 3.5 months (range, 3-38 mo). Estimated PFS rates at 12 and 24 months were 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%-76%) and 43% (95% CI, 19%-65%), respectively. In the 7 ADT-naïve patients, local tumor control was achieved in all metastases, and the median ADT-free survival period was 29 months. There were no major procedural complications. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer, percutaneous image-guided ablation was feasible and well tolerated and achieved acceptable local tumor control rates. Percutaneous ablation may be of particular utility in patients who wish to delay initiation of ADT.","Erie, Andrew J; Morris, Jonathan M; Welch, Brian T; Kurup, A Nicholas; Weisbrod, Adam J; Atwell, Thomas D; Schmit, Grant D; Kwon, Eugene D; Callstrom, Matthew R",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,320,20

The respiratory droplets produced from coughing and talking of an infected patient were possible transmission routes of coronavirus between people. To avoid the infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised to wear face masks while maintaining a social distancing of 2 m. Can the social distancing be reduced if people wear masks? To answer this question, we measured the mass of inhaled droplets by a susceptible manikin wearing a mask with different social distances, which was produced by coughing and talking of an index ""patient"" (human subject) also wearing a mask. We also used the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology with a porous media model and particle dispersion model to simulate the transmission of droplets from the patient to the susceptible person with surgical and N95 masks. We compared the CFD results with the measured velocity in the environmental chamber and found that the social distancing could be reduced to 0.5 m when people wearing face masks. In this case, the mass concentration of inhaled particles was less than two people without wearing masks and with a social distancing of 2 m. Hence, when the social distancing was difficult, wearing masks could protect people. We also found that the leakage between the face mask and the human face played an important role in the exhaled airflow pattern and particle dispersion. The verified numerical model can be used for more scenarios with different indoor environments and HVAC systems. The results of this study would make business profitable with reduced social distancing in transportation, education, and entertainment industries, which was beneficial for the reopening of the economy.","Deng, Zhipeng; Chen, Qingyan",Indoor air,320,1

The current study revealed that SNHG14 level was high in the serum of AS patients and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced AS cell lines. Besides, we found that SNHG14 accelerated cell proliferation while inhibited cell apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced AS cell lines. Next, SNHG14 was confirmed to be a sponge for miR-186-5p in AS cells, and it was validated that SNHG14 regulated AS cell proliferation and apoptosis by sponging miR-186-5p. Moreover, we uncovered that WAS-interacting protein family member 2 (WIPF2) was a downstream target of miR-186-5p in AS cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that miR-186-5p modulated AS cell proliferation and apoptosis via targeting WIPF2. To conclude, our research disclosed that SNHG14 affected ox-LDL-induced AS cell proliferation and apoptosis through miR-186-5p/WIPF2 axis, which may provide a theoretical basis for the treatment and diagnosis of AS.","Tao, Z; Cao, Z; Wang, X; Pan, D; Jia, Q",Human & experimental toxicology,320,29

The aim of this study was to compare 6-month outcomes in older adults diagnosed with medical conditions in the ED then admitted inappropriately to surgical wards (defined as outliers), with outcomes in comparable patients admitted to medical wards (controls). METHODS In a matched cohort study, 100 consecutive medical outliers from the ED aged 75 years and over were matched according to age, sex and diagnosis to 200 controls. Collected data included number of diagnoses reported in acute care, level of patient illness severity, length of stay, mortality and destination of patients discharged from acute care units (home, rehabilitation facility, nursing home or palliative care facility). An assessment was made of patient vital status and living environment (home, nursing home or hospital) at 6 months post-ED admission. RESULTS Mean age was 85.6 years. The most common ED diagnoses were gait disorders/falls (18%), neurological disorders (17%) and exhaustion (16%). Outliers displayed lower illness severity levels (0.001) and shorter lengths of stay from ED admission to acute care discharge (p=0.040). Subsequent to acute care, outliers were less commonly discharged home (45% vs 59%) and more commonly discharged to rehabilitation facilities (42% vs 28%). At 6 months post-ED admission, multivariable regression analysis showed that outlier status (OR=0.44 (0.25-0.83); p=0.011) and numbers of diagnoses reported in acute care (OR=0.87 (0.76-0.98); p=0.028) were independently associated with lower probability of living at home. CONCLUSION Outlying of older patients to surgical wards negatively affects their prospects of living at home at 6 months after hospital admission.

OBJECTIVE Identify structural markers that correlate with treatment response by using 3-dimensional (3-D) optical coherence tomography (OCT; 3-D OCT). DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Single teaching hospital. PATIENTS Thirty-three patients, 32 male and 1 female, with short-segment (<3 cm) BE undergoing RFA treatment. INTERVENTION Patients were treated with focal RFA, and 3-D OCT was performed at the gastroesophageal junction before and immediately after the RFA treatment. Patients were re-examined with standard endoscopy 6 to 8 weeks later and had biopsies to rule out BE if not visibly evident. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS The thickness of BE epithelium before RFA and the presence of residual gland-like structures immediately after RFA were determined by using 3-D OCT. The presence of BE at follow-up was assessed endoscopically. RESULTS BE mucosa was significantly thinner in patients who achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia than in patients who did not achieve complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia at follow-up (257 ± 60 μm vs 403 ± 86 μm; P < .0001). A threshold thickness of 333 μm derived from receiver operating characteristic curves corresponded to a 92.3% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and 87.9% accuracy in predicting the presence of BE at follow-up. The presence of OCT-visible glands immediately after RFA also correlated with the presence of residual BE at follow-up (83.3% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 90.6% accuracy). LIMITATIONS Single center, cross-sectional study in which only patients with short-segment BE were examined. CONCLUSION Three-dimensional OCT assessment of BE thickness and residual glands during RFA sessions correlated with treatment response. Three-dimensional OCT may predict responses to RFA or aid in making real-time RFA retreatment decisions in the future.","Tsai, Tsung-Han; Zhou, Chao; Tao, Yuankai K; Lee, Hsiang-Chieh; Ahsen, Osman O; Figueiredo, Marisa; Kirtane, Tejas; Adler, Desmond C; Schmitt, Joseph M; Huang, Qin; Fujimoto, James G; Mashimo, Hiroshi",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,320,1

The aim of this study is to describe healthcare professionals' experiences with teamwork in a surgical ward before and during the implementation of a longitudinal interprofessional team training programme. DESIGN A qualitative descriptive study based on follow-up focus group interviews. SETTING A combined gastrointestinal surgery and urology ward at a hospital division in a Norwegian hospital trust. PARTICIPANTS A convenience sample of 11 healthcare professionals divided into three professionally based focus groups comprising physicians (n=4), registered nurses (n=4) and certified nursing assistants (n=3). INTERVENTIONS The TeamSTEPPS programme was implemented in the surgical ward from May 2016 to June 2017. The team training programme included the three phases: (1) assessment and planning, (2) training and implementation and (3) sustainment. RESULTS Before implementing the team training programme, healthcare professionals were essentially satisfied with the teamwork skills within the ward. During the implementation of the programme, they experienced that team training led to greater awareness and knowledge of their common teamwork skills. Improved teamwork skills were described in relation to a more systematic interprofessional information exchange, consciousness of leadership-balancing activities and resources, the use of situational monitoring tools and a shared understanding of accountability and transparency. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the team training programme provides healthcare professionals with a set of tools and terminology that promotes a common understanding of teamwork, hence affecting behaviour and communication in their daily clinical practice at the surgical ward.

Of them 49% completed the 10-month assessment, and in the iCAN-DO group 85% accessed step 1 and 13% underwent iCBT. iCAN-DO decreased the levels of symptoms of depression (-0.54, 95% CI: (-1.08)- (-0.01), p<.05) and the proportion of individuals with symptoms of depression (p<.01) at 10 months, compared with standard care, according to HADS. There were no significant effects on anxiety, posttraumatic stress, or HRQoL. Internet-based stepped care improves symptoms of depression in individuals with cancer. Further studies are needed to gain knowledge on how to optimize and implement internet-based support in oncology care. This article is protected by copyright.

The receptor binding is the first step of viral infection. Predicting virus-receptor interactions will be helpful for the interaction mechanism of viruses and receptors, and further find some effective ways of preventing and treating viral infectious diseases so as to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses. Some computation algorithms have been proposed for identifying potential virus-receptor interactions. However, a common problem in those methods is the presence of noise in the similarity network. A new computational model (Network Enhancement and the Regularized Least Squares [NERLS]) is proposed to predict virus-receptor interactions based on improving similarities by Network Enhancement (NE). NERLS integrates the virus sequence similarity, the receptor sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions. We compute the virus sequence similarity and known virus-receptor interactions to construct the virus similarity network. The receptor similarity network is constructed by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and the receptor sequence similarity. To obtain the final virus similarity network and the final receptor similarity network, NE is, respectively, applied for reducing the noise of the virus similarity network and the receptor similarity network. Finally, NERLS employs the regularized least squares to predict interactions of viruses and receptors. The experiment results show that NERLS achieves the area under curve value of 0.893 and 0.921 in 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, respectively, which is consistently superior to four related methods [which include Initial interaction scores method via the neighbors and the Laplacian regularized Least Square (IILLS), Bi-random walk on a heterogeneous network (BRWH), Laplacian regularized least squares classifier (LapRLS), and Collaborative matrix factorization (CMF)]. Furthermore, a case study also demonstrates that NERLS effectively predicts potential virus-receptor interactions.","Zhu, Lingzhi; Yan, Cheng; Duan, Guihua",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,320,1

ACE2 receptor is increased among aged, males, and smokers. As smoking upsurges ACE2 expression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are at a higher risk for severe forms of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) once infected. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in asthma patients is identical (or less common) to that of healthy participants. ACE2 especially, tends to be low in patients with strong atopic factors and in those with poor asthma control. Therefore, it could be speculated that asthma patients are not susceptible to COVID-19. Epidemiologically, asthma patients are less likely to suffer from COVID-19, and the number of hospitalized patients due to exacerbation of asthma in Japan is also clearly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, they are not aggravating factors for COVID-19. Related academic societies in Japan and abroad still lack clear evidence regarding asthma treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, and recommend that regular treatment including biologics for severe patients be continued.","Hojo, Masayuki; Terada-Hirashima, Junko; Sugiyama, Haruhito",Global health & medicine,320,30

Over the last decade, robotic lobectomy has shown to be safe, with oncologic efficacy similar to lobectomy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Comparative analysis between these modalities is an active area of investigation. While initially expensive, the costs of a robotic platform decrease as the number of operations performed increases, length of stay is shortened, and postoperative morbidity is reduced. Moreover, the added cost has value which is defined over long periods of time. Areas covered: The clinical technique and optimal conduct of lobectomy is explained in granular detail for all five types of lobectomies. The advantages and disadvantages of a robotic platform are analyzed, including a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary: The number of robotic pulmonary resections performed has tripled in the past two years. Anticipated developments in robotic surgery include improvements in robotic training, continued refinement of robotic instrumentation, and additional adjunctive technologies. The overall costs of robotic surgery will decrease, in part, due to increasing competition as additional companies enter the market.","Chen, Sophia; Geraci, Travis C; Cerfolio, Robert James",Expert review of respiratory medicine,320,11

The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a pandemic that is spreading steadily and soon in most states. Coronavirus genomic characterization showed that it most closely resembled another bat-origin beta-coronavirus. Coronavirus has the largest genome of viruses that have RNA. Spike (S) glycoprotein is present in the virus and is responsible for virus entry into the host cell. COVID-19 can spread through the droplet, direct contact, and aerosol transmission in humans. It can remain in the environment and exists on plastic and steel for the longest time, making it a dangerous and contagious disease that can kill other individuals. The virus has an incubation time of 2 to 14 days. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have evolved exponentially in the world. Possible preventive steps for disease control include more mask use, hand sanitization, and social distancing. There is no antiviral therapy and only symptomatic care. Many inhibitors of HIV protease and other antimalarial drugs have tested. There is currently no vaccine available for COVID-19 prevention, though others are available in clinical trials. Scientists often use spike proteins for vaccine production.

In response, the Division of General Surgery at the University of Washington Department of Surgery in Seattle has designed and implemented an emergency restructuring of the facility's general surgery resident care teams in an attempt to optimize workforce well-being, comply with physical distancing requirements, and continue excellent patient care. This article introduces a unique approach to general surgery resident allocation by dividing patient care into separate inpatient care, operating care, and clinic care teams. Separate teams made up of all resident levels will work in each setting for a 1-week period. By creating this emergency structure, we have limited the number of surgery residents with direct patient contact and have created teams working in isolation from one another to optimize physical distancing while still performing required work. This also provides a resident reserve without exposure to the virus, theoretically flattening the curve among our general surgery resident cohort. Surgical resident team restructuring is critical during a pandemic to optimize patient care and ensure the well-being and vitality of the resident workforce while ensuring the entire workforce is not compromised.","Nassar, Amer H; Zern, Nicole K; McIntyre, Lisa K; Lynge, Dana; Smith, Caitlin A; Petersen, Rebecca P; Horvath, Karen D; Wood, Douglas E",JAMA surgery,320,24

We have previously provided evidence that the MHC congenic chicken lines 331/B2 and 335/B19 differ in susceptibility to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains M41 and ArkDPI in in vivo challenge experiments. Innate immune responses can be difficult to measure in vivo because they are nonspecific and can be triggered by environmental factors. In an attempt to address this issue, we used tracheal organ cultures derived from 331/B2 and 335/B19 birds to study local cytokine production after in vitro challenge with IBV M41. Interferon (IFN)-β, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 gene expression and production were assessed. Tracheal organ cultures derived from 335/B19 birds presented an increased inflammatory response compared to 331/B2. However, it was not possible to discriminate between cytokine responses in IBV-infected and phosphate-buffered saline-treated tracheal organ cultures. Because tracheal processing entails physical damage to the trachea, it is possible that the tracheal organ cultures presented high levels of inflammation regardless of the IBV challenge. To demonstrate the effects of IBV on innate immune responses in the MHC congenic chicken lines, we performed an additional in vivo experiment that focused on cytokine gene expression and production in tracheas up to 60 hr after a challenge with IBV M41. Our results corroborate previous in vivo observations that suggest that detrimental local inflammatory responses in 335/B19 birds might be associated with their susceptibility to IBV and that inflammation does not necessarily lead to the assembly of an appropriate adaptive immune response. This work provides further insight into the increased susceptibility of 335/B19 birds to infectious bronchitis.","da Silva, Ana P; Schat, Karel A; Gallardo, Rodrigo A",Avian diseases,320,14

Despite extensive research focusing on the pathogenesis of PEDV infection, the molecular pathogenesis of PEDV-induced diarrhea in piglets remains unclear. Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), the main exchanger of electroneutral sodium in intestinal epithelial cells, is closely associated with the occurrence of diarrhea. To date, there is no study on whether diarrhea caused by PEDV infection is related to the activity of NHE3. In the present study, it was found that the expression level of cell membrane protein NHE3 significantly decreased after PEDV infection, whereas the total level of protein expression was not significantly changed. The Na+/H+ transport rate and the mRNA abundance of NHE3 decreased; the NHE3 activity decreased gradually with increasing infection time. In vivo, after PEDV infection of newborn piglets, rupture of intestinal villi and interstitial degeneration of intestinal epithelial cells in different intestinal segments were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods were used to observe the decreased expression of NHE3 protein on the membrane of intestinal epithelial cells in the jejunum and ileum. Taken together, these data indicate that PEDV infection reduces NHE3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells, hindering Na+ transport and thus causing diarrhea.","Song, Zhenhui; Yan, Tao; Ran, Ling; Niu, Zheng; Zhang, Yiling; Kan, Zifei; Xu, Shasha; Zhang, Shujuan; Zhang, Jingyi; Zou, Hong; Lei, Chenghong",Virology,320,30

However, DNA methylations in the peripheral blood tissues are usually measured at the bulk level based on a heterogeneous population of white blood cells. Using the bulk level DNA methylation data in mediation analysis might cause confounding bias and reduce study power. Therefore, it is crucial to get fine-grained results by detecting mediation CpG sites in a cell-type-specific way. However, there is a lack of methods and software to achieve this goal. We propose a novel method (Mediation In a Cell-type-Specific fashion, MICS) to identify cell-type-specific mediation effects in genome-wide epigenetic studies using only the bulk-level DNA methylation data. MICS follows the standard mediation analysis paradigm and consists of three key steps. In step1, we assess the exposure-mediator association for each cell type; in step 2, we assess the mediator-outcome association for each cell type; in step 3, we combine the cell-type-specific exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations using a multiple testing procedure named MultiMed [Sampson JN, Boca SM, Moore SC, et al.

Anthropometrics and left ventricular size may influence QRSd and, in turn, may influence the association between QRSd and heart failure outcomes. Methods and Results Using the prospective, multicenter, multinational ASIAN-HF (Asian Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) registry, this study evaluated whether electroanatomic ratios (QRSd indexed for height or left ventricular end-diastole volume) are associated with 1-year mortality in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The study included 4899 individuals (aged 60±19 years, 78% male, mean left ventricular ejection fraction: 27.3±7.1%). In the overall cohort, QRSd was not associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.003; 95% CI, 0.999-1.006, P=0.142) or sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.006; 95% CI, 1.000-1.013, P=0.059). QRS/height was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.165; 95% CI, 1.046-1.296, P=0.005 with interaction by sex pinteraction=0.020) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.270; 95% CI, 1.021-1.580, P=0.032). QRS/left ventricular end-diastole volume was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43, P=0.011) and sudden cardiac death (HR, 1.461; 95% CI, 1.090-1.957, P=0.011) in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy but not in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (all-cause mortality: HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11, P=0.467; sudden cardiac death: HR, 0.734; 95% CI, 0.477-1.132, P=0.162). Conclusions Electroanatomic ratios of QRSd indexed for body size or left ventricular size are associated with mortality in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In particular, increased QRS/height may be a marker of high risk in individuals with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and QRS/left ventricular end-diastole volume may further risk stratify individuals with nonischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

METHODS AND RESULTS We carried out 10 uterine orthotopic allotransplantations in ewes with end-to-side anastomosis of the aortocava donor patch on the left external iliac vessel recipient. The immunosuppressive protocol was a combination of cyclosporine (10 mg/kg/day) and mycophenolic acid (3 g/day). An estimation of the immunosuppressive therapy exposure was performed by measuring the area under the curve (AUC) of immunosuppressive plasma concentrations. The graft was assessed by vaginoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and second look laparotomy at 6, 8 and 10 weeks, respectively. The median (range) times for cold and warm ischemia were 95 min (75-130) and 91 min (55-165), respectively. All the vascular anastomoses were patent at the end of the surgery. The median AUC of cyclosporine and mycophenolic acid were 1.24 mg h/l (0.34-3.85) and 18.40 mg h/l (3.76-42.35), respectively. Of the 10 ewes receiving a transplant, 6 could be assessed. Cervical biopsies showed signs of necrosis in all six ewes. The MRI results correlated with the macroscopic observations of the 'second look' laparotomy. The aortocava vascular pedicles were thrombosed, adding to the peripheral neovascularization. Graft histology showed endometrial tissue in two out of six ewes. CONCLUSIONS Mobility of the transplant within the pelvis, the length of the vascular pedicle and rejection can explain the high rate of transplant necrosis. The particular digestive anatomy and physiology of ruminants makes it difficult to administer an optimal immunosuppressive treatment. MRI appears to be a good non-invasive examination for graft estimation.","Gauthier, T; Bertin, F; Fourcade, L; Maubon, A; Saint Marcoux, F; Piver, P; Marquet, P; Pommepuy, I; Plainard, X; Couquet, C; Cornuejols, M J; Essig, M; Aubard, Y",Human reproduction,320,1

The aim of this paper is to explore the spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and examine risk determinants of the disease among aging populations in a typical region. METHODS Data on TB-registered cases between 2009 and 2014, in addition to social-economic factors, were collected for each district/county in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, a region characterized by an aging population and disparities in social-economic development. A Bayesian space-time hierarchy model (BSTHM) was used to reveal spatio-temporal variation in the incidence of TB among the elderly in this region between 2009 to 2014. GeoDetector was applied to measure the determinant power (q statistic) of risk factors for TB among the elderly. RESULTS The incidence of TB among the elderly exhibited geographical spatial heterogeneity, with a higher incidence in underdeveloped rural areas compared with that in urban areas. Hotspots of TB incidence risk among the elderly were mostly located in north-eastern and southern areas in the study region, far from metropolitan areas. Areas with low risk were distributed mainly in the Beijing-Tianjin metropolitan areas. Social-economic factors had a non-linear influence on elderly TB incidence, with the dominant factors among rural populations being income (q = 0.20) and medical conditions (q = 0.17). These factors had a non-linear interactive effect on the incidence of TB among the elderly, with medical conditions and the level of economic development having the strongest effect (q = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS The findings explain spatio-temporal variation in TB incidence and risk determinants of elderly TB in the presence of disparities in social-economic development. High-risk zones were located mainly in rural areas, far from metropolitan centres. Medical conditions and the economic development level were significantly associated with elderly TB incidence, and these factors had a non-linear interactive effect on elderly TB incidence. The findings can help to optimize the allocation of health resources and to control TB transmission in the aging population in this region.","Wang, Li; Xu, Chengdong; Hu, Maogui; Qiao, Jiajun; Chen, Wei; Li, Tao; Qian, Songbo; Yan, Mingtao",BMC public health,320,27

While endovascular therapy techniques have improved substantially, FPE remains low (24-30%), and new methods to improve reperfusion efficiency are needed. METHODS In a prospective observational cohort study, 40 consecutive patients underwent cyclical aspiration thrombectomy using CLEARTM Aspiration System (Insera Therapeutics Inc., Dallas, TX). Primary outcome included FPE with complete/near-complete reperfusion (TICI 2c/3 FPE). Secondary outcomes included early neurological improvement measured by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), safety outcomes, and functional outcomes using modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Outcomes were compared against published historical controls. RESULTS Among 38 patients who met criteria for LVO, median age was 75 (range 31-96). FPE was high (TICI 3: 26/38 [68%], TICI 2c/3: 29/38 [76%]). Among anterior circulation strokes, core lab-adjudicated FPE remained high (TICI 3: 17/29 [59%], TICI 2c/3: 20/29 [69%]), with excellent final successful revascularization results (Final TICI 3: 24/29 [83%], Final TICI 2c/3: 27/29 [93%]). FPE in the CLEAR-1 cohort was significantly higher compared to FPE using existing devices (meta-analysis) from historical controls (TICI 2c/3: 76% vs. 28%, p = 0.0001). High rates of early neurological improvement were observed (delta NIHSS≥4: 35/38 [92.1%]; delta NIHSS≥10: 27/38 [71%]). Similarly, high rates of good functional outcomes (mRS 0-2: 32/38 [84%]) and low mortality (2/38 [5%]) were observed.

The purpose of this study was to measure the sensitivity and specificity of touch preparation of nasal debridement specimens as a rapid diagnostic tool for invasive fungal sinusitis. A retrospective chart review was performed of 22 patients undergoing nasal debridement due to suspicion for invasive fungal sinusitis over a 10-year period. Thirteen patients had touch preparation of nasal specimens followed by routine histologic processing; two of these patients underwent 2, and 1 patient had 3 separate debridements, for a total of 17 touch preparations performed. The sensitivity and specificity of touch preparation were calculated by correlating the initial results with the presence of fungal invasion on final pathologic analysis. The sensitivity of touch preparation was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23-0.85), specificity was 100% (95% CI: 0.60-1.00), positive predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 0.46-1.00), and negative predictive value was 67% (95% CI: 0.35-0.89). This procedure may be a useful adjunct in situations requiring rapid diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis but should not be used as the sole criteria for determining the need for surgical intervention.","Schuman, Theodore A; Nguyen, Josephine H; Yelverton, Joshua C; Almenara, Jorge A; Powers, Celeste N","Ear, nose, & throat journal",320,1

PURPOSE To identify features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) associated with TACE refractoriness and to develop a prediction model for estimating the risk of TACE refractoriness. MATERIAL AND METHODS Among 1025 patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent TACE as a first-line treatment during 2010-2017, 427 patients who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were analyzed. According to the date of initial TACE, patients were divided into the development cohort (n = 211) and the test cohort (n = 216). TACE refractoriness was determined according to the Japan Society of Hepatology guidelines. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the association between clinical/MRI features and TACE refractoriness. The performance of the prediction model was internally and externally assessed using the C-index of discrimination and a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for calibration. RESULTS By analyzing 427 patients, we constructed a prediction model with the following independent features associated with TACE refractoriness: maximum tumor size; tumor number; peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP); and the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodule on HBP. This system enabled the prediction of TACE refractoriness in the development cohort (C-index, 0.796) and the test cohort (C-index, 0.738) with good discrimination and calibration abilities. CONCLUSION The prediction model based on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI features in addition to the known predictors including tumor size and number can be used to estimate the risk of TACE refractoriness in patients with intermediate-stage HCC.","Byun, Jieun; Kim, So Yeon; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Kim, Min Ju; Yoo, Changhoon; Shim, Ju Hyun; Lee, Seung Soo",Acta radiologica,320,16

Remdesivir, a broad spectrum anti-viral drug, is now under in vitro and in vivo investigation as a potential agent against SARS-CoV-2. However, the results of this therapy were recently equivocal due to no significant benefit in the clinical trial. Herein, combination molecular docking with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations is used to theoretically design angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-containing remdesivir-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. Based on the therapeutic and lung protective effect of ACEI, the classical lisinopril molecule covalently grafted onto PLGA (L-PLGA) has been used to encapsulate remdesivir. A binding model is used to confirm the interactions between lisinopril and ACE on the surface of cells, as well as remdesivir and its intracellular targeting protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)). Furthermore, DPD simulations are applied to study the nano-aggregation of drug-free L-PLGA, and remdesivir loaded in L-PLGA. The lisinopril molecules were directly demonstrated to be on the surface of L-PLGA NPs. Molecular docking proved that hydrogen bonding was decisive for the encapsulation of remdesivir. With an increase in concentration, remdesivir loaded L-PLGA formed spherical NPs, and then underwent precipitation. Similar to the above conditions, high remdesivir loading was also observed to cause precipitation formation. Thus, the optimized remdesivir NPs in our study give insights into a rational platform for formulation design against this global pandemic.","Wu, Juanping; Wang, Hongmei; Li, Bingyu",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,320,30

PATIENTS Women who underwent disc resection for endometriosis at Royal Hospital for Women and Prince of Wales Private Hospital between January 2012 and December 2013 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) score using a validated questionnaire. RESULTS Forty-one women met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 40 ± 10 years (range 22-75 years). All procedures were performed laparoscopically. Eleven women (27%) underwent a hysterectomy in addition to rectal disc resection and endometriosis surgery. Mean operative time for the entire cohort was 158 ± 64 minutes, and mean length of hospital stay was 5 ± 2 days. Completed questionnaires were received from 31 women, a response rate of 76%. The mean length of follow-up was 17 ± 10 months (range 3-34 months). The LARS scores ranged from 0 to 34 (median 15, interquartile range 0-24). Eight women (26%) had a LARS score of 0. Nineteen women (61%) had a LARS score less than 21 (the threshold for LARS). CONCLUSION Conservative treatment of DIE with rectal disc resection is safe and feasible and is associated with mild gastrointestinal dysfunction in the medium to long term.","Ng, Ada; Yang, Phillip; Wong, Shing; Vancaillie, Thierry; Krishnan, Surya",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,320,26

Despite this, it remains grossly underused relative to the prevalence of refractory schizophrenia. The extent of underuse and the degree of regional variation in prescribing in the United Kingdom is unknown. It is also unclear, how the UK compares with other European countries in rates of clozapine prescribing. METHODS We obtained data relating to all clozapine prescribing in the UK from the relevant clozapine registries. We examined regional variation in clozapine use across England, corrected for the known prevalence of Severe Mental Illness (SMI). We also compared the UK rate of clozapine use per 100,000 population to that described in other European countries. FINDINGS There is substantial variation in clozapine prescribing across different regions of England and only about a third of potentially eligible patients were prescribed the drug in the UK. Clozapine prescribing rate in the UK was lower than in several European countries. INTERPRETATION There is clear regional inequity in access to the most effective treatment in refractory schizophrenia in England. Strategies to increase clozapine use, by overcoming both real and perceived barriers, are urgently necessary to reduce treatment inequity for patients with refractory schizophrenia.","Whiskey, E; Barnard, A; Oloyede, E; Dzahini, O; Taylor, D; Shergill, S S",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,320,5

Despite a societal mind shift to educating the public on the prevention of health risk behaviour, behavioural change is not progressing at the rate needed to influence health risk behaviour positively. The project aims to explore behavioural trends and willingness to engage in risky behaviour among senior primary school children. Secondly, to design a health risk behaviour prevention program which adequately equips senior primary school children with the necessary life skills to alter risk behaviour engagement. METHODS The study will make use of an intervention mapping framework and a sequential, explanatory mixed methods design. Stratified random probability sampling will be used to select three primary schools in the region. Nonprobability purposive sampling will be used to select the stakeholders participating in the focus group sessions. Data collection consists of five phases with the results of each stage informing the structure and application of the next. Phase 1 - baseline data collection (needs analysis) using the child health risk behaviour survey. Phase 2 - focus group interviews. Phase 3 - a systematic review of the literature for result analysis triangulation. Phase 4 - the development of the child risk behaviour prevention program based on the outcomes of phases 1,2 and 3. Phase 5 - implementation of the program. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the quantitative data. Chi-square, ANOVA and multiple regression analyses will be used to predict health risk behaviour engagement. Thematic analysis will be used to analyse qualitative data. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the first study that would attempt to establish a health risk behaviour prevention program in youth and young people in South Africa. Overwhelming evidence exists that adolescents engage in risky health behaviour which may potentially negatively impact their lives. This study provides an opportunity to address a gap in the current strategy by developing a prevention program for young people which could later be supported by further booster programs through their adolescents. This project would serve as a baseline prevention program that could assist in the reduction of risky health behaviour among various communities.","Daniels, Kurt John; Pharaoh, Hamilton",BMC public health,320,1

The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated a dramatic change in how HF clinics are delivered, with a reduction in face-to-face contact. The need for in-person appointments remains unknown. We evaluated prepandemic face-to-face clinic appointments in detail, to see what appointments achieved, in order to plan future services. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who had completed 3 years of follow up (1st January 2017 to 31st December 2019) in a specialist HF clinic. Inclusion criteria were a clinician diagnosis of HF or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (from clinic letters and echocardiography), or at least moderate valvular disease with symptoms. Patient electronic health records were reviewed, and for each clinic attendance, the following were noted: •Presence of new or worsening symptoms or signs of HF, or symptoms relating to HF treatment, as assessed by the clinician• Change in cardiovascular medications•Investigations requested•Documented patient education, advice, or discussion of care plan Results 100 patients were included in the cohort. The median age was 68, and patients were predominantly male (80%) with HFrEF (78%). There was a total of 666 appointments over the 3 years of follow up. Patients had a median of 2 appointments per year (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows the frequency of investigations, symptoms and clinician actions in appointments. 21% of appointments documented new or worsening HF or treatment-related symptoms, and cardiovascular therapy was changed in 36% of appointments, ranging from 55% of nurse-led appointments to 31% where the patient saw a junior doctor. Therapy change was more common in appointments when there was a change in symptoms (53% vs 31%, p &lt;0.001). 41% of patients had no documented worsening in HF symptoms throughout the entire 3 year follow up period. Patient education or clinical advice was documented in 32% of appointments. Follow-up duration was shorter following a change in symptoms (127 vs 163 days, p=0.03) and therapy change (128 vs 170 days, p=0.03). 45% of appointments had no documented worsening HF symptoms, change in cardiovascular therapy, specialist referral or specialist test (excluding echocardiography and phlebotomy);we consider these to be 'routine' follow-up appointments. Conclusion Most HF patients were seen in a specialist HF clinic at least 6-monthly, but worsening symptoms and therapy change at the time of consultation were uncommon. Investigations other than phlebotomy and echocardiography, which may be performed outside of specialist centres, were rarely performed. Many appointments may therefore be suitable for community services or by telemedicine, thus freeing up capacity and responsiveness of in-person specialist clinics for patients with more complex needs, worsening symptoms or new diagnoses.","Singhal, A.; Pan, J.; Cassimon, B.; Cowie, M.",Heart,320,20

RiVax® is a thermostable, lyophilized RT subunit vaccine adsorbed to aluminum salt adjuvant intended for use by military personnel and first responders. Phase 1 studies indicated that RiVax is safe and immunogenic, while a three dose, intramuscular vaccination regimen in non-human primates elicited protection against lethal dose RT challenge by aerosol. Here we investigated, in a mouse model, the durability of RiVax-induced antibody responses and corresponding immunity to lethal dose RT challenge. Groups of mice were subcutaneously administered 3 or 1 μg of RiVax on days 0 and 21 and challenged with 10 × LD50 RT by injection at six different intervals over the course of twelve months. Serum antibody titers and epitope-specific competition assays were determined prior to each challenge. We report that the two-dose, 3 μg regimen conferred near complete protection against RT challenge on day 35 and complete protection thereafter (challenge days 65, 95, 125, 245, and 365). The two-dose, 3 μg regimen was superior to the 1 μg regimen as revealed by slight differences in survival and morbidity scores (e.g., hypoglycemia, weight loss) on challenge days 35 and 365. In separate experiments, a single 3 μg RiVax vaccination proved only marginally effective at eliciting protective immunity to RT, underscoring the necessity of a prime-boost regimen to achieve full and long-lasting protection against RT. IMPORTANCE Ricin toxin (RT) is a notorious biothreat, as exposure to even trace amounts via injection or inhalation can induce organ failure and death within a matter of hours. In this study, we advance the preclinical testing of a candidate RT vaccine known as RiVax®. RiVax is a recombinant non-toxic derivative of RT’s enzymatic subunit that has been evaluated for safety in Phase I clinical trials and efficacy in a variety of animal models. We demonstrate that two doses of RiVax is sufficient to protect mice from lethal dose RT challenge for up to one year. We describe kinetics and other immune parameters of the antibody response to RiVax and discuss how these immune factors may translate to humans.","Novak, Hayley; Doering, Jennifer; Ehrbar, Dylan; Donini, Oreola; Mantis, Nicholas J.",bioRxiv,320,12

Pro-inflammatory cytokines storm generated by Covid-19 infection hyper-activates inflammatory response in host body, resulting in elevated release of inflammatory biomarkers. Present article describes the characteristic profile of these inflammatory and related biomarkers in a total of 48 critically ill Covid-19 patients, (Male = 38, F = 10), with mildly ill to severe, critically ill status and thus grouped accordingly. Inflammatory Biomarkers, Ferritin, ProCalcitonin, CReactive Protein, coagulation marker-D-Dimer, chemical analytes, Protein, Albumin, BUN, Bilirubin, Creatinine, and enzymes, Lactate Dehydrogenase, P-Glutamyl transpeptidases, Alkaline phosphatase were routine analyzed by standard methods described earlier. D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP and Procalcitonin exhibited variable alterations (P<0.05 to P<0.001), more markedly in critically ill patients than in the mild and severe. Biochemical analytes and enzymatic parameters showed elevated levels (P<0.05 to P<0.01) mostly in critically ill category of patients when compared with mild or severe, except total protein and albumin, which remained non-significant. It is concluded that cytokine, chemokines and pro-inflammatory markers, which released in abnormally high concentrations in Covid-19 patients of variable syndrome intensity, are significant indicators of disease severity, progression and success of treatments. As the pharmacological options may vary with the different stages of the disease therefore identifying the correct stage of the disease may be very useful in selecting the best option.","Alam, J.

Herein, we describe a multiplexed bioluminescent repair reporter (BLRR) for non-invasive monitoring of DSB repair pathways in living cells and animals. The BLRR approach employs secreted Gaussia and Vargula luciferases to simultaneously detect homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), respectively. BLRR data are consistent with next-generation sequencing results for reporting HDR (R2 = 0.9722) and NHEJ (R2 = 0.919) events. Moreover, BLRR analysis allows longitudinal tracking of HDR and NHEJ activities in cells, and enables detection of DSB repairs in xenografted tumours in vivo. Using the BLRR system, we observed a significant difference in the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing with guide RNAs only 1-10 bp apart. Moreover, BLRR analysis detected altered dynamics for DSB repair induced by small-molecule modulators. Finally, we discovered HDR-suppressing functions of anticancer cardiac glycosides in human glioblastomas and glioma cancer stem-like cells via inhibition of DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 1 (RAD51). The BLRR method provides a highly sensitive platform to simultaneously and longitudinally track HDR and NHEJ dynamics that is sufficiently versatile for elucidating the physiology and therapeutic development of DSB repair.","Chien, Jasper Che-Yung; Tabet, Elie; Pinkham, Kelsey; da Hora, Cintia Carla; Chang, Jason Cheng-Yu; Lin, Steven; Badr, Christian Elias; Lai, Charles Pin-Kuang",bioRxiv,320,25

Gaussian processes can be viewed as infinite-dimensional probability distributions over smooth functions and also provide a natural basis for additive decomposition of time series, since we can sum mutually independent Gaussian processes with a simple and elegant algebra involving covariance kernels. The component estimation algorithm we propose in this paper is general and does not depend on the number of components, nor on the correlation structure and interpretation of each component. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is based on nonparametric Bayesian Gaussian process regression, where the log-likelihood covariance is suitably structured to account for the presence of additive subcomponents. The numerical parameter estimation procedure finds MAP estimates by maximizing the unnormalized log-posterior density, with a great advantage in terms of computational cost and efficiency. We apply our proposal to real data based on a time series of daily COVID-19 confirmed cases and daily swabs administered in Italy. The curve of daily new cases follows an oscillatory pattern, as the ratio between the number of new cases and the number of tested individuals is locally constant, while the number of daily new cases is systematically lower on some days of the week, as fewer swabs are performed. This wavelike pattern must be considered a nuisance that does not reflect the true dynamics of contagion, as it is the result of variability in human activities. We show how such a cyclic component can be successfully filtered out using the proposed algorithm. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bilancia, M.; Manca, F.; Sansaro, G.","21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications, ICCSA 2021",320,1

We focus on the COVID-19 pandemic period as the most violate in the history of the oil market. The static and dynamic conditional copula methodology is used to measure the tail dependence coefficient (TDC) between the variables. We found a strong relationship in the tail dependence between negative returns on crude oil and OVX changes and the tail independence for positive returns. The time-varying copula discloses the strongest tail dependence of negative oil price shocks and the index changes during the COVID-19 health crisis. The findings indicate the ability of the OVX index to be a fear gauge with respect to the oil market. However, we cannot confirm the ability of OVX to improve one day-ahead forecasts of the Value at Risk.

Since the chest computed tomography (CT) image diagnosis requires medical experts and more time, an automated intelligent model needs to be developed for effective COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper presents a new automated COVID-19 diagnosis model using optimal grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based feature extraction and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classification. The input chest images undergo pre-processing to improve the image quality. Next, the optimal GLCM features are derived by the use of Elephant Herd Optimisation (EHO) algorithm. Then, the ELM model is applied to perform the classification task. The performance of the OGLCM-ELM model has been validated using the benchmark dataset and the experimental outcome ensured the superior performance of the proposed model over the compared methods.

This study investigates the cerebral volumetric differences in adolescents with NF1 as compared to typically developing controls and how working memory task performance is associated with these differences. Methods: 31 adolescents aged 11-17 years were compared to age and sex-matched controls. NF1 subjects were assessed using detailed multimodal measurement of working memory at baseline followed by a 3T MR scan. A voxel-based morphometry approach was used to estimate the total and regional gray matter(GM) volumetric differences between the NF1 and control groups. The working memory metrics were subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) approach. Finally, we examined how the components derived from PCA correlated with the changes in GM volume in the NF1 group, after adjusting for age, sex and total intracranial volume. Results: The NF1 cohort showed increased GM volumes in the thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate, putamen, dorsal midbrain and cerebellum bilaterally as compared to controls. The PCA yielded three independent behavioural components reflecting high memory load, low memory load and auditory working memory. Correlation analyses revealed that increased volume of the inferior lateral parietal cortex was associated with poorer performance on the high working memory load tasks. Increased volume of posterior cingulate cortex, a key component of the default mode network (DMN) was significantly associated with poorer performance on low working memory load tasks. Discussion: This is the first study to examine the neuroanatomical correlates of working memory in NF1 adolescents. Consistent with prior literature we show larger subcortical brain volumes in in the NF1 cohort. The strong association between posterior cingulate cortex volume and performance on low memory load conditions supports previously suggested hypotheses of deficient DMN structural development, which in turn may contribute to the cognitive impairments in NF1.","Sawyer, C.; Green, J.; Lim, B.; Pobric, G.; Jung, J.; Vasallo, G.; Evans, D.

For maximum impact, multi-modal MRI protocols will be needed to measure the effects of SARS-CoV2 infection on the brain by diverse potentially pathogenic mechanisms, and with high reliability across multiple sites and scanner manufacturers. Methods: A multi-modal brain MRI protocol comprising sequences for T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, diffusion MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), susceptibility-weighted imaging (swMRI) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) was defined in close approximation to prior UK Biobank (UKB) and C-MORE protocols for Siemens 3T systems. We iteratively defined a comparable set of sequences for General Electric (GE) 3T systems. To assess multi-site feasibility and between-site variability of this protocol, N=8 healthy participants were each scanned at 4 UK sites: 3 using Siemens PRISMA scanners (Cambridge, Liverpool, Oxford) and 1 using a GE scanner (Kings College London). Over 2,000 Imaging Derived Phenotypes (IDPs) measuring both data quality and regional image properties of interest were automatically estimated by customised UKB image processing pipelines. Components of variance and intra-class correlations were estimated for each IDP by linear mixed effects models and benchmarked by comparison to repeated measurements of the same IDPs from UKB participants. Results: Intra-class correlations for many IDPs indicated good-to-excellent between-site reliability. First considering only data from the Siemens sites, between-site reliability generally matched the high levels of test-retest reliability of the same IDPs estimated in repeated, within-site, within-subject scans from UK Biobank. Inclusion of the GE site resulted in good-to-excellent reliability for many IDPs, but there were significant between-site differences in mean and scaling, and reduced ICCs, for some classes of IDP, especially T1 contrast and some dMRI-derived measures. We also identified high reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) IDPs derived from swMRI images, multi-network ICA-based IDPs from resting-state fMRI, and olfactory bulb structure IDPs from T1, T2-FLAIR and dMRI data. Conclusion: These results give confidence that large, multi-site MRI datasets can be collected reliably at different sites across the diverse range of MRI modalities and IDPs that could be mechanistically informative in COVID brain research. We discuss limitations of the study and strategies for further harmonization of data collected from sites using scanners supplied by different manufacturers.

It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, quickly spreading worldwide. Patients’ clinical features vary, and secondary infections represent a constant risk of increased mortality among those who need hospitalization. Damaged respiratory epithelium and dysregulation of the immune response are the main pathophysiological mechanisms of increased microbial adhesion to the airway epithelial cells and the development of secondary infections. However, the exact incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is not thoroughly known (3.2%–80%) due to limited and heterogeneous studies that lead to conflicting or non-comparable results. Infection-risk stratification in critically ill patients includes early ICU admission (within 48 hours from hospitalization), age, comorbidity, immunosuppressive drugs administration, and disease severity indexes (oxygenation, inflammation, and cytolysis score). In treating secondary infections, the local epidemiology (which usually includes multidrug-resistant strains) and the modification of any antibiotic regimen according to the cultures’ results are critical.

Spillover and spillback of viral pathogens between these managed, feral, and native bees is generating increasing interest. In this case study, we provide evidence suggesting that FHB colonies play an important role in viral pathogen dynamics of southern California pollinator communities because they act as reservoirs, of viral pathogens such as acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and deformed wing virus (DWV). Surprisingly, even though FHB are not treated for diseases or parasites, they harbor similar pathogen loads to MHB, which are usually highly treated, suggesting the need for future studies to determine if FHB resist or are more resilient to viruses.","Geffre, Amy; Travis, Dillon; Kohn, Joshua; Nieh, James",bioRxiv,320,23

Method We use an interrupted time-series design to analyze weekly counts of residential and non-residential burglary from 2018 to 2020 in four Michigan cities: Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, and Lansing. Results Findings demonstrate that the relationship between the lockdown and weekly counts of burglary vary by the type of burglary and the city being analyzed. Residential burglaries in half of the sampled cities declined during the Michigan lockdown order. Commercial burglaries increased during the lockdown order in only one of the four cities examined. Conclusions City-wide crime trends following lockdown orders during the pandemic are not shared equally and vary according to the type of burglary under examination. In studying the effects of COVID-19 on crime, researchers should account for crime- and city-specific dynamics which may influence crime trends.

Gene expression and DNA methylation patterns on the X chromosome were driven primarily by sex chromosome content, not gonadal sex. The majority of DNA methylation changes involved hypermethylation in the XX genotypes (as compared to XY) in the CpG context, with the largest differences in CpG islands, promoters, and CTCF binding sites. Autosomal gene expression and DNA modifications demonstrated regulation by sex chromosome complement and gonadal sex. These data demonstrate the importance of sex chromosomes themselves, independent of hormonal status, in regulating hippocampal sex effects. Future studies will need to further interrogate specific CNS cell types, identify the mechanisms by which sex chromosome regulate autosomes, and differentiate organizational from activational hormonal effects.","Ocañas, Sarah R.; Ansere, Victor A.; Tooley, Kyla B.; Hadad, Niran; Chucair-Elliott, Ana J.; Stanford, David R.; Rice, Shannon; Wronowski, Benjamin; Hoffman, Jessica M.; Austad, Steven N.; Stout, Michael B.; Freeman, Willard M.",bioRxiv,320,17

From diagnosis to treatment, COVID-19 has posed a significant threat to journalists, researchers, physicians, and organizations all over the world. Analysts are working nonstop to gain proper knowledge in order to monitor the pandemic in their respective areas. As a result, it is critical to incorporate an intelligent system as an alternative option for preventing COVID-19-related effects or death in society. The determination of the level of risk, with the aid of various Artificial Intelligence methodologies, may be one of the answers to controlling the damage. A number of machine learning models have been developed to diagnose and evaluate the seriousness of a variety of cases. Clinical evidence from patients who have been infected with a virus has been used in the proposed study to predict the seriousness of the disease if the patient has been infected. The signs of the disease (corona virus) as well as other parameters specific to the person's health have been taken into consideration. COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that has been declared a Public Health Emergency and a Pandemic by the World Health Organization. The virus has infected over 25 million people worldwide which has killed over 840, 000 people and threatened the lives of millions more. COVID-19 is characterized by a dry cough, sore throat, and ahigh temperature. It is critical to find quick and accurate results for Covid-19 at this time in order to stop it in its early stages and avoid it from being a problem. Deep learning concepts are being used to analyze and classify symptoms from radiograph images. Chest radiographs are one of the early screening tests to assess the onset of disease since the infection seriously affects the lungs. In this proposal, we used a recurrent neural network model combined with a multilevel thresholding technique to detect Corona virus. One of the machine learning techniques for prediction is the RNN model. A Recurrent Neural Network is used to decide if the given images belong to Covid-19 during the classification process. This implementation is based on a publicly available dataset of radiograph images. © 2021 IEEE.","Mohammed, M.; Krishna Raghavendra, A. V.; Lahari, G.

With the fruitful advancements and purposes, the authenticity and security breaches in digital images are simultaneously increasing because many editing software and tools give easy access to manipulate and temper the images, resulting in the change of complete information. Copy Move Forgery is the simplest way of tempering images in which an object is copied, removed, and replaced in the same image. As the medical field is too sensitive and even a minor manipulation can produce disastrous results, this study proposes an algorithm specifically designed to detect copy move forgery in medical images, especially when the world has gone towards telemedicine due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The proposed algorithm is based on CNN working on the whole image. The algorithm works in three phases, i.e., pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The proposed algorithm has given the accuracy of 89 percent on the dataset that has been created due to the publicly non-availability of forged medical images dataset.

Iran, as one of those countries with the highest number of infected people, has officially reported 1812 deaths from a total number of 23049 confirmed infected cases that we used in the analysis. Materials and Methods: Geographic distribution by the map of calculated incidence rates for COVID -19 in Iran within the period was prepared by GIS 10.6 Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) and hot spot analysis were used to assess COVID -19 spatial patterns. The ordinary least square method was used to estimate the relationship between COVID -19 and the risk factors. The next step was to explore Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models that might better explain the variation in COVID -19 cases based on the environmental and socio-demographic factors. Results: The spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) result showed that COVID-19 cases in the studied area were in clustered patterns. For statistically significant positive z-scores, the larger the z-score is, the more intense the clustering of high values (hot spot), such as Semnan, Qom, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Alborz, and Tehran. Hot spot analysis detected clustering of a hot spot with confidence level 99% for Semnan, Qom, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Alborz, and Tehran, as well. The risk factors were removed from the model step by step. Finally, just the distance from the epicenter was adopted in the model. GWR efforts increased the explanatory value of risk factor with better special precision (adjusted R-squared = 0.44) Conclusion: The highest CIR was concentrated around Qom. Also, the greater the distance from the center of prevalence (Qom), the fewer the patients. Hot spot analysis also implies that the neighboring provinces of prevalence centers exhibited hot spots with a 99% confidence level. Furthermore, the results of OLS analysis showed the significant correlation of CIR is with the distance from epicenter (Qom). The GWR can result in the spatial granularity providing an opportunity to well understand the relationship between environmental spatial heterogeneity and COVID-19 risk as entailed by the infection of CIR with COVID-19, which would make it possible to better plan managerial policies for public health.

Objectives: To describe outcomes among children and young people with underlying RMD who acquire COVID-19 infection. Methods: All children and young people <18 years of age with COVID-19 (presumptive or confirmed) reported to the EULAR COVID-19 Database, which collects details regarding RMD diagnosis and treatment, COVID infection and outcomes, between 27 March 2020 and 29 January 2021 (cutoff date for this analysis) were included. Patient characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes are presented. Results: A total of 151 children and young people (age range 2-17 years;Table 1) have been reported to the database from 12 countries;mostly Spain (N=30), France (N=29), Israel (N=29), and Czechia (N=25). Most patients had a diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA;N=92;61%). Other diagnoses were autoinflammatory syndrome (including TRAPS, CAPS, FMF;12%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (4%). There were 14 (9%) hospitalisations and 1 (0.7%) death reported due to COVID-19. The most commonly reported symptoms were fever (46%), cough (34%), anosmia (19%), and headache (19%). Only 19 (13%) patients reported glucocorticoid use. DMARD therapy was used by 104 (69%) patients;67 (44%) were on csDMARDs (methotrexate [N=54], antimalarials [N=7]), 45 (30%) on anti-TNF, 9 (6%) on IL-6 inhibitors, and 7 (5%) on IL-1 inhibitors. Among the 145 patients with hospitalisation data, patients on any DMARD therapy (cs/b/tsDMARDs) had similar odds for hospitalisation compared with those not on therapy, adjusted for age (odds ratio 0.7;95% CI 0.2, 2.4). Conclusion: These initial data on outcomes of COVID-19 in paediatric RMDs are very reassuring, with less than 1 in 10 patients reporting hospitalisation. Due to the database design and inherent reporting bias, this is likely an overestimate, suggesting that overall outcomes among this population appear to be generally good, with mild infection. Increasing case reports to the database will allow further exploration of drug-and disease-specific outcomes.","Kearsley-Fleet, L.; Lawson-Tovey, S.; Costello, R.

Bacteria colonize blood vessels, rapidly causing devastating vascular damage despite a neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate. How this pathogen escapes the neutrophil response is unknown. Using a humanized mouse model, we show that vascular colonization leads to the recruitment of neutrophils, partially reducing bacterial burden and vascular damage. This partial effect is due to the ability of bacteria to indiscriminately colonize capillaries, venules and arterioles, as observed in human samples. In venules, potent neutrophil recruitment allows efficient bacterial phagocytosis. In contrast, in infected capillaries and arterioles adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin are not expressed on the endothelium and intravascular neutrophil recruitment is minimal. These results show that colonization of capillaries and arterioles by N. meningitidis create an intravascular niche that preclude the action of neutrophils, resulting in immune escape and subsequent fulminant progression of the infection.","Manriquez, Valeria; Nivoit, Pierre; Urbina, Tomas; Echenique-Rivera, Hebert; Melican, Keira; Flamant, Patricia; Schmitt, Taliah; Bruneval, Patrick; Obino, Dorian; Duménil, Guillaume",bioRxiv,320,5

It will be difficult and costly to develop new drugs that target each of these viruses. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia and influenza, and a statin/ARB combination appeared to dramatically reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak. These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a ""top down"" approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a ""bottom up"" approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system.

METHODS A questionnaire was administered to 1,958 urban workers, 1,909 rural workers, and 4,452 migrant workers in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, in 2004. Blood samples for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis were taken from the migrant and urban workers. RESULTS Migrants were young, worked very long hours, and their living conditions were very basic. Nineteen percent had some form of health insurance and 26% were entitled to limited sick pay compared with 68% and 66%, respectively, for urban workers. Migrants had the best self-rated health and reported the least acute illness, chronic disease, and disability, after controlling for age and education. There were no HIV infections detected in either the migrant or urban workers. However, 15 urban workers (0.68%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.02) and 20 migrants (0.48%, 95% CI 0.26, 0.66, p=0.06) tested positive for syphilis. The high cost of health care in the city was a barrier to health-care access in the last year for 15% of the migrants and 8% of the urban workers. Forty-seven percent of the migrants were unwilling to make contributions to health insurance. CONCLUSIONS These migrants demonstrated the ""healthy migrant effect."" However, poor living conditions and inattention to health may make migrants vulnerable to poor long-term health. Because health insurance schemes will remain limited for the forseeable future, attention should focus on providing affordable health care to both uninsured migrants and the urban poor.","Hesketh, Therese; Ye, Xue Jun; Li, Lu; Wang, Hong Mei",Public health reports,320,1

The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has proven useful for the detection of Reo-3 in rodents and contaminated biological materials. Fluorogenic nuclease reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (fnRT-PCR) combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby potentially enhancing specificity and eliminating post-PCR processing. Therefore, an fnRT-PCR assay specific for Reo-3 was developed by targeting primer and probe sequences to a unique region of the Reo-3 M3 gene.

For determination of which of the viral proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV genome may be exploited as diagnostic antigens for serological assays, the viral proteins were expressed individually in mammalian and/or bacterial cells and tested for reactivity with sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients by Western blot analysis. A total of 81 sera, including 67 from convalescent patients and seven pairs from two time points of infection, were analyzed, and all showed immunoreactivity towards the nucleocapsid protein (N). Sera from some of the patients also showed immunoreactivity to U274 (59 of 81 [73%]), a protein that is unique to SARS-CoV. In addition, all of the convalescent-phase sera showed immunoreactivity to the spike (S) protein when analyzed by an immunofluorescence method utilizing mammalian cells stably expressing S. However, samples from the acute phase (2 to 9 days after the onset of illness) did not react with S, suggesting that antibodies to N may appear earlier than antibodies to S. Alternatively, this could be due to the difference in the sensitivities of the two methods. The immunoreactivities to these recombinant viral proteins are highly specific, as sera from 100 healthy donors did not react with any of them. These results suggest that recombinant N, S, and U274 proteins may be used as antigens for the development of serological assays for SARS-CoV.","Tan, Yee-Joo; Goh, Phuay-Yee; Fielding, Burtram C; Shen, Shuo; Chou, Chih-Fong; Fu, Jian-Lin; Leong, Hoe Nam; Leo, Yee Sin; Ooi, Eng Eong; Ling, Ai Ee; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,320,16

The most 3' conserved domain which is still unique for these viruses encodes a 33-kDA protein in MHV-A59, which is cleaved from a precursor protein. Expression of ORF1b of the pol gene of both virus families occurs by ribosomal frameshifting.

The positive-sense RNA from the 5' end to nucleotide (nt) 2327, which covers the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and a part of the coding region of HCV structural proteins, interacted with HCV core protein, while no interaction was observed in the same region of negative-sense RNA and in other regions of viral and antiviral sense RNAs. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) exists around the 5'UTR of HCV; therefore, the interaction of the core protein with this region of HCV RNA suggests that there is some effect on its cap-independent translation. Cells expressing HCV core protein were transfected with reporter RNAs consisting of nt 1 to 709 of HCV RNA (the 5'UTR of HCV and about two-thirds of the core protein coding regions) followed by a firefly luciferase gene (HCV07Luc RNA). The translation of HCV07Luc RNA was suppressed in cells expressing the core protein, whereas no significant suppression was observed in the case of a reporter RNA possessing the IRES of encephalomyocarditis virus followed by a firefly luciferase. This suppression by the core protein occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of the E1 envelope protein of HCV or beta-galactosidase did not suppress the translation of both HCV and EMCV reporter RNAs. We then examined the regions that are important for suppression of translation by the core protein and found that the region from nt 1 to 344 was enough to exert this suppression. These results suggest that the HCV core protein interacts with viral genomic RNA at a specific region to form nucleocapsids and regulates the expression of HCV by interacting with the 5'UTR.","Shimoike, T; Mimori, S; Tani, H; Matsuura, Y; Miyamura, T",Journal of virology,320,16

This study examines the exudative responsiveness of the subepithelial microvessels in subjects with and without common cold after inoculation with coronavirus. METHODS The airway mucosa was exposed to exudative concentrations of histamine (40 and 400 micrograms/ml) before and six days after inoculation. To assess whether mucosal penetration of a topically applied agent was altered, nasal absorption of chromium-51 labelled ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (51Cr-EDTA, MW 372) was also examined. A nasal pool technique kept the challenge and tracer solutes in contact with the same ipsilateral mucosal surface. Concentrations of albumin in lavage fluids were measured as an index of mucosal exudation of plasma. Nasal absorption of 51Cr-EDTA was determined by the cumulated 24 hour urinary excretion of radioactivity. RESULTS Nine subjects developed common cold after coronavirus inoculation and 10 remained healthy. Histamine produced concentration dependent mucosal exudation of plasma in all subjects before and after coronavirus inoculation. In subjects with common cold, however, the histamine-induced mucosal exudation was significantly augmented compared with the group without common cold. This exudative hyperresponsiveness is not explained by an increased baseline exudation because the lavage regimen used produced comparably low baseline exudation in both groups of subjects, nor is it explained by an increased penetration of topical histamine because the ability of the nasal mucosa to absorb 51Cr-EDTA was not significantly increased in the subjects with common cold. CONCLUSIONS An increased proclivity of the airway subepithelial microcirculation to respond with plasma exudation develops during coronavirus-induced common cold. This specific exudative hyperresponsiveness may be a feature of inflammatory airway diseases.","Greiff, L; Andersson, M; Akerlund, A; Wollmer, P; Svensson, C; Alkner, U; Persson, C G",Thorax,320,24

Nine rabbits were used for this study. The complete necrotic area (CNA), partial necrotic area (PNA), and viable tumor area (VTA) of liver tumors were experimentally induced by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). DCE-MRI data were processed based on the extended Kety model to estimate Ktrans, ve and vp parameters. The boundaries among CNA, PNA, and VTA were delineated based on H&E stain images, and MVD was assessed for each subregion of each VX2 tumor based. There were no correlations between ph-parameters (Ktrans, ve, and vp) and MVD for CNA. For PNA, the Ktrans values were positively correlated with the MVD (r = 0.8124, p < 0.001). For VTA, we found a positive correlation between Ktrans values and the MVD (r = 0.5743, p < 0.05). Measuring from both the PNA and the VTA, mean Ktrans values were positively correlated with mean MVD (r = 0.8470, p < 0.0001). In a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model, Ktrans values correlated well with MVD counts of PNA and VTA in liver tumors.","Moon, Jungwon; Kim, Jae-Hun; Choi, Dongil; Yang, Jehoon; Lee, Min Woo; Choi, Yoon-La; Rhim, Hyunchul",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,320,29

This study, conducted in the midst of the crisis, explores the level of COVID-19-related anxieties and parenting stress of Israeli parents in their first year of parenthood. METHODS: First-time mothers (n = 469) and fathers (n = 137), aged 21-50, completed self-report questionnaires in April, 2020. They were divided into two groups: parents of younger infants (aged 3-6 months); parents of older infants (aged 7-12 months). RESULTS: The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high, with the greatest concern aroused by public transportation and public places, followed by concerns over the possible infection of family members and the infant, going for infant check-ups, getting the virus themselves, and the health of the infant. In both groups, mothers reported higher COVID-19-related anxieties than fathers. Fathers of older infants reported higher parenting stress than mothers. DISCUSSION: The results highlight the need to be attentive to the double stress of new parents in the first year of parenthood in a time of crisis, and to the potentially greater vulnerability of fathers of older infants.","Ben-Yaakov, Ofir; Ben-Ari, Orit Taubman",Psychol Health,320,21

This study proposes a novel measure for the probable pathogenic virus transmission risk of a high-rise drainage stack with the occurrence of positive air pressure. The proposed approach is based on time-variant positive air pressures measured in a 38 m high drainage stack of a full-scale experimental tower under steady flow conditions of flow rate 1-4 Ls-1 discharging at a height between 15 m to 33 m above the stack base. The maximum pressure and probabilistic positive air pressures in the discharging stack ventilation section with no water (Zone A of the discharging drainage stack) were determined. It was demonstrated that the positive air pressures were lower in frequency as compared with those in other stack zones and could propagate along the upper 1/3 portion of the ventilation pipe (H' &#8805; 0.63) towards the ventilation opening at the rooftop. As the probabilistic positive pressures at a stack height were found to be related to the water discharging height and flow rate, a risk model of positive air pressure is proposed. Taking the 119th, 124th, 140th and 11,547th COVID-19 cases of an epidemiological investigation in Hong Kong as a baseline of concern, excessive risk of system overuse was evaluated. The results showed that for a 20-80% increase in the frequency of discharge flow rate, the number of floors identified at risk increased from 1 to 9 and 1 to 6 in the 34- and 25-storey residential buildings, respectively. The outcome can apply to facilities planning for self-quarantine arrangements in high-rise buildings where pathogenic virus transmission associated with drainage system overuse is a concern.","Wong, Ling-Tim; Mui, Kwok-Wai; Cheng, Cheng-Li; Leung, Polly Hang-Mei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),320,16

It takes a sociocultural perspective on teacher development where WhatsApp is a mediating tool in the broader sociocultural landscape. A thematic analysis of the postings and exchanges from the WhatsApp group revealed three main uses of the WhatsApp chat: for interpersonal interactions, for professional development, and for organisational purposes. The analysis suggests the WhatsApp group contributed to the teachers' English language knowledge, provided a platform for them to share and discuss issues related to the challenges of their particular context, enabled them to contribute to the development of some teaching materials and begin to address some of the issues they had in a meaningful way. It also raises issues of participation, access, equity and sustainability. We conclude by suggesting there is good potential for the use of social media tools such as WhatsApp for teacher development in challenging contexts, despite the contextual constraints observed and described. While this specific case involves language teachers, the general findings can potentially be applied to any teacher education or training context where access to training or education might be curtailed for a number of reasons, including the most recent changes enforced by the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Motteram, Gary; Dawson, Susan; Al-Masri, Nazmi",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),320,16

COVID-19 is known to induce an acute immune response which can affect haematological parameters associated with clozapine monitoring, and systemic infection may reduce clozapine clearance. Clozapine, which has been associated with worse outcomes in some pneumonias, may in theory worsen outcomes in COVID-19. Despite these concerns, there are some data to indicate it is safe to continue clozapine in COVID-19 infection. In this retrospective case series, we describe our experiences of clozapine prescribing and disease progression of eight SARS-CoV-2 positive patients on medical wards in a major London teaching hospital. In four cases clozapine was stopped during the hospital admission. A COVID-19 pneumonia developed in four patients: three of these required intensive care unit admission for an average of 34 days. At the time of writing, three patients had died (two directly from COVID-19 pneumonia), two remained in general hospital wards, two were recovering in the community and one had been transferred to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. Follow-up length varied but in each case was not more than 104 days. Delirium was the most common adverse neuropsychiatric event, and in one case a relapse of psychosis occurred after cessation of clozapine. This retrospective case series illustrates the safe use of clozapine during COVID-19 infection. Our experiences suggest that consideration should be made to continuing clozapine even in those most unwell with COVID-19. We also identify areas which require larger scale hypothesis-testing research.","Butler, Matthew; Bano, Felicity; Calcia, Marilia; McMullen, Isabel; Sin Fai Lam, Chun Chiang; Smith, Laura Jane; Taylor, David; Gee, Siobhan",Ther.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including raloxifene, exhibited antiviral activities against EBOV and SARS-CoV-2. Pioglitazone, a PPARÎ³ agonist, also exhibited antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2, and both raloxifene and pioglitazone presented a synergistic antiviral effect. Finally, we demonstrated that SERMs blocked entry steps of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. These findings suggest that the identified FDA-approved drugs can modulate host cell susceptibility against RNA viruses.","Imamura, Keiko; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Enami, Takako; Shibukawa, Ran; Nishi, Yohei; Ohta, Akira; Shu, Tsugumine; Kawaguchi, Jitsutaro; Okada, Sayaka; Hoenen, Thomas; Yasuda, Jiro; Inoue, Haruhisa",FEBS Open Bio,320,24

Specific RNA sequences and structural motifs can also enhance activation of OAS1 through currently undefined mechanisms. To better understand these drivers of OAS activation, we tested the impact of defined sequence changes within a short dsRNA that strongly activates OAS1. Both in vitro and in human A549 cells, appending a 3'-end single-stranded pyrimidine (3'-ssPy) can strongly enhance OAS1 activation or have no effect depending on its location, suggesting that other dsRNA features are necessary for correct presentation of the motif to OAS1. Consistent with this idea, we also find that the dsRNA binding position is dictated by an established consensus sequence (WWN9WG). Unexpectedly, however, not all sequences fitting this consensus activate OAS1 equivalently, with strong dependence on the identity of both partially conserved (W) and non-conserved (N9) residues. A picture thus emerges in which both specific RNA features and the context in which they are presented dictate the ability of short dsRNAs to activate OAS1.","Schwartz, Samantha L; Park, Esther N; Vachon, Virginia K; Danzy, Shamika; Lowen, Anice C; Conn, Graeme L",Nucleic Acids Res,320,14

The scientific community has focused attention and resources on clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia. Few papers analysing the vast spectrum of differential diagnoses have been published. MAIN BODY: Complexity of differential diagnosis lays in the evidence of similar radiological findings as ground-glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and consolidations in COVID-19 pneumonia and a multitude of other lung diseases. Differential diagnosis is and will be extremely important during and after the pandemic peak, when there are fewer COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present COVID-19 pneumonia most frequent differential diagnoses to help the radiologist face the current COVID-19 pneumonia challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical data, laboratory tests and imaging are pillars of a trident, which allows to reach a correct diagnosis in order to grant an excellent allocation of human and economical resources. The radiologist has a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia because he may raise suspicion of the pathology and help to avoid COVID-19 virus spread.","Guarnera, Alessia; Podda, Pierfrancesco; Santini, Elena; Paolantonio, Pasquale; Laghi, Andrea",Insights Imaging,320,5

Advanced statistical workflows permitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated developing an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that utilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary tissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction with V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included none of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is specifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the following performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97, COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92, all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the model maintained high accuracy. The approach can be readily adopted in the clinical setting as a robust tool for radiologists.","Martell, Marc Boubnovski; Chen, Mitchell; Linton-Reid, Kristofer; Posma, Joram M.; Copley, Susan J; Aboagye, Eric O.",,320,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to illustrate the numerical effects of regulatory restrictions of elective surgery at an orthopaedic university hospital. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic all over the world places extraordinary demands on health care systems which are forced to ensure structural and personnel capacities. Consequently, hospitals may only perform urgent interventions. Spine patients, however, often need urgent surgery and, moreover, bear an above-average perioperative risk frequently requiring postoperative surveillance on intensive care units (ICUs). Facing this dilemma, we want to share our practice and its unexpected numerical effects. METHODS: We compare case statistics during normal operation, directly before and after implementation of regulatory measures. We also analyzed the differences in ICU utilization, complexity and duration of interventions and the patient population. RESULTS: Spine surgical interventions have been reduced by 42.7%. Regulatory restriction of ""elective surgeries"" in pandemic situations results in reduced ICU utilization, however in a disproportionate manner. Although other specialized surgeries can be reduced by 59%, surgical spine cases are only diminishable by 24%. The spine surgery-related ICU occupancy has been reduced by 35%. CONCLUSION: The disproportionate effect of case reduction needs to be considered while calculating resources released by regulatory limitation of ""elective surgeries"" on a (inter-)national level.","Laux, Christoph J; Bauer, David E; Kohler, Adrian; Uçkay, Ilker; Farshad, Mazda",Clin Spine Surg,320,24

We aimed to study the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within families with children in Greece. We studied 23 family clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%-100%). An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters. Transmission of infection occurred from an adult to a child in 19 clusters and/or from an adult to another adult in 12 clusters. There was no evidence of child-to-adult or child-to-child transmission. In total 68 household members (62.4%) tested positive. Children were more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults (40% vs 10.5%; P = .021). In contrast, adults were more likely to develop a severe clinical course compared with children (8.8% vs 0%; P = .021).

Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptible-infected-recovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate &#969; initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York state's COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.

Problem-based learning was used as a framework to create a scenario-based activity designed to develop GHD-related skills. The application and effectiveness of this scenario-based activity to develop GHD-related skills were assessed. A mixed-methods approach involving a self-administered survey and one focus group discussion was used. The survey collected baseline participant characteristics as well as understanding and improvements in GHD-related skills using a 5-point Likert scale. The focus group was audio-recorded and thematically analyzed using both inductive and deductive codes. Data integration was achieved by connecting and weaving. Method and investigator triangulation techniques were used. Participants self-reported significantly better postscenario-based activity responses when asked about their understanding of diplomacy, negotiation, communication, and how to address public health emergencies (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Most participants either agreed or strongly agreed that their GHD-related skills improved with participation in the scenario-based activity (diplomacy = 55.6%; negotiation = 66.5%; communication = 72.2%; addressing public health emergencies = 72.1%). Overall, qualitative data were consistent with results obtained using quantitative methods. The scenario-based activity was effective for improving the self-reported understanding of GHD-related skills. The scenario-based activity was also effective for developing the selected GHD-related skills (as self-reported). This scenario-based activity is likely to reduce cognitive load and avoid participant overload, thereby facilitating learning. Further research is required to elucidate its long-term impact on skills development.","Reina Ortiz, Miguel; Sharma, Vinita; Casanova, Jesse; Corvin, Jaime; Hoare, Ismael",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,320,16

An outbreak of acute respiratory illness was proved to be infected by a novel coronavirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from World Health Organization (WHO), was confirmed first in Wuhan, China, and has become endemic worldwide, which was a serious threaten to public health all over the world. Herein, we reported a successful critical case of COVID-19 and shared our experience of treatment, which would do a favor for other COVID-19 patients. CASE SUMMARY: . A 65-year-old man, Wuhan citizen, was infected by COVID-19, and his pulmonary lesions progressed quickly in five days. On admission to Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, the immediate arterial blood gas(ABG) analysis showed the PaO2/FiO2(P/F) ratio was 134.4mmHg, moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) was diagnosed. Emergency tracheal intubation was performed, and the initial ventilator mode and parameters were set up based on the lung-protective ventilation strategy, but the P/F ratio could not be improved, and then the prone position ventilation was carried out for four consecutive days, as long as 16 hours every day, the P/F ratio rose to 180mmHg approximately, which still did not reach to the standard of extubation. And then we found that it was complicated with acute cor pulmonale(ACP) by ultrasound examination, dobutamine and diuretic were used for the treatment of ACP caused by ARDS successfully, and the P/F ratio went up to about 250mmHg. Seven days later after admission, the endotracheal intubation was successfully removed, after extubation, High-Flow nasal cannula(HFNC) oxygen therapy was used as a sequential strategy to prevent reintubation. Ultimately, he was discharged on day 34 after admission. CONCLUSION: . Our case presented the treatment process of a critical COVID-19. Effective therapy was crucial to heal COVID-19, and organ function support therapy, especially the cardiorespiratory function support therapy, was the core of treatment.","Zou, Lei; Sun, Jiakui; Liu, Ying; Zhang, Wenhao; Jiang, Wei; Yuan, Shoutao; Shi, Qiankun",Heart Lung,320,1

With generational changes in learning and the advancement of technology, it is difficult to know if the current method of grand rounds remains relevant and is meeting its audience's needs. Furthermore, surgeons may have different educational needs for grand rounds than other fields of healthcare. This study evaluates the needs of attendees and their attitudes toward modern surgical grand rounds through focus groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Independent focus groups were conducted in the department of surgery at a large academic institution. In total, 19 individuals (five professors, three associate professors, three assistant professors, seven senior residents, and one junior resident) participated in the focus groups. Thematic analysis was conducted through a process of independent coding and defining of themes followed by joint revision until consensus was reached. RESULTS: Four major themes arose from the discussion: current design and format of grand rounds, audience attitudes and needs, perceived barriers to meaningful grand rounds, and suggestions and improvements to grand rounds. Further subthemes also emerged. These themes were present in both faculty and resident responses, with 115 individual data pieces coded in total. CONCLUSIONS: Grand rounds is an opportunity for social interaction, networking, professional and personal identity formation, and learning meaningful and relevant content. Audience diversity, desire for more audience engagement, and changes in the modern learning environment provide the largest challenges to meaningful grand rounds.

The current Australian temporary criteria advise that if the fasting glucose is &#8804;4.6 mmol/L, then no glucose tolerance test (GTT) is required. AIMS: The aim of this study is to examine the extent of underdiagnosis of GDM using a fasting glucose &#8804;4.6 mmol/L as a cut-off to determine that a GTT is not necessary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: De-identified data from pregnant women having a GTT test in the Illawarra area during a six-year period was used to determine the number of women with GDM and the proportion of positive cases that would be missed for different fasting glucose values. RESULTS: There were 16 522 results identified and GDM was diagnosed in 12.2%. The majority of women were more than 30 years of age (85.2%) and diagnosed at &#8805;20 weeks gestation (81.1%). Of those diagnosed with GDM, 29% had a fasting glucose of &#8804;4.6 mmol/L and would have been missed.

Although this is a plausible hypothesis, there is no evidence that complications or mortality rates in neuromuscular patients are higher than in the general population. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and outcome of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders. METHODS: A registry of children with neuromuscular conditions and laboratory-confirmed-SARS-CoV-2 infection was set up by the Neuromuscular Working Group of the Spanish Pediatric Neurology Society (SENEP). Data to be collected were focused on the characteristics and baseline status of the neuromuscular condition and the course of COVID-19. RESULTS: Severe complications were not observed in our series of 29 children with neuromuscular disorders infected by SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-nine percent of patients were clinically categorized as asymptomatic or mild cases and 10% as moderate cases. Patients with a relatively more severe course of COVID-19 had SMA type 1 and were between 1 and 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The course of COVID-19 in children with neuromuscular disorders may not be as severe as expected. The protective role of young age seems to outweigh the risk factors that are common in neuromuscular patients, such as a decreased respiratory capacity or a weak cough. Further studies are needed to know if this finding can be generalized to children with other chronic diseases.","Natera-de Benito, Daniel; Aguilera-Albesa, Sergio; Costa-Comellas, Laura; García-Romero, Mar; Miranda-Herrero, María Concepción; Rúbies Olives, Júlia; García-Campos, Óscar; Martínez Del Val, Elena; Martinez Garcia, Maria Josefa; Medina Martínez, Inmaculada; Cancho-Candela, Ramón; Fernandez-Garcia, Miguel A; Pascual-Pascual, Samuel Ignacio; Gómez-Andrés, David; Nascimento, Andres",J. neurol,320,16

As a test bed, a representative antibody of immunoglobulin G is immobilized on the metasurfaces through microfluidic paths and then is directly detected in a scaled manner even at a very low concentration of 5 pg mL-1, i.e., 34 fM. Moreover, a cancer marker of p53 antibody is indirectly detected on the SC metasurfaces at a low concentration of 50 pg mL-1, which is significantly lower than the medical diagnosis criterion of a few ng mL-1. Furthermore, single-strand DNAs that are oligonucleotides and complementary to SARS-CoV-2 RNA are detected with 1 h immobilization time in the range of fmol mL-1 in a scaled manner.

We wonder why surfactants are still not tried for prophylaxis or therapy against COVID-19? That too when many of them have proven antiviral properties. Moreover, lung surfactants have already shown benefits in respiratory viral infections. Therefore, we postulate that surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy would be promising. We believe that our hypothesis would stimulate debate or new research exploring the possibility of surfactant-based prophylaxis and therapy against COVID-19.

After learning policy and advocacy material individually through a self-paced online curriculum, faculty gathered the students for a synchronous online event where they formed collaborative groups. In interprofessional teams, students prepared and presented advocacy briefs that were critiqued by the faculty. Post-event evaluation results showed that most students strongly agreed that the interprofessional event was very effective, and they all would recommend the program to other students.

The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral related. In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In most cases, these episodes of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review provides a brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and provide information geared for both providers and patients. Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on medical resources and the nature of this pandemic remains dynamic.","Soler, Zachary M; Patel, Zara M; Turner, Justin H; Holbrook, Eric H",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,320,32

Network analysis provides a new methodology to uncover the topology and evolution of the population flow and understand its influence on the early dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. In this paper, we simulated 42 transmission scenarios to show the distribution of the COVID-19 outbreak across China. We predicted some original epicenters (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen) had higher total aggregate population outflows than Wuhan, indicating larger spread scopes and faster growth rates of COVID-19 outbreak. We built an importation risk model to identify some major cities (Dongguan and Foshan) with the highest total importation risk values and the highest standard deviations, indicating the core transmission chains (Dongguan-Shenzhen, Foshan-Guangzhou). We built the population flow networks to analyze their Spatio-temporal characteristics and identify the influential sub-groups and spreaders.

However, provider knowledge, experience, and comfort level with delivering mental health care services, such as PE, via CVT is critical to ensure a smooth, safe, and effective transition to virtual care. Further, some of the limitations associated with the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders and physical distancing, require that providers become adept at applying principles of exposure therapy with more flexibility and creativity, such as when assigning in vivo exposures. The present paper provides the rationale and guidelines for implementing PE via CVT during COVID-19 and includes practical suggestions and clinical recommendations.","Wells, Stephanie Y; Morland, Leslie A; Wilhite, Emily R; Grubbs, Kathleen M; Rauch, Sheila A M; Acierno, Ron; McLean, Carmen P",J Trauma Stress,320,23

The cytoarchitectonic V-V analyses yielded two maps of the human cerebral cortex, the famous map of Brodmann (Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues. Barth, Leipzig, 1909), Brodmann (in: Bruns P (ed) Neue deutsche Chirurgie, Enke, Stuttgart, 1914), and the less known, but more detailed map of Sarkisov et al. (Cytoarchitecture of the human cortex cerebri. Medgiz, Moscow, 1949). Sarkisov et al. used in their cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the cortex the same numbering scheme as Brodmann. They confirmed the presence of most of the areas delineated by the latter, but they subdivided several of these areas into two or more separate areas or subareas. Within the realm of the myeloarchitectonic V-V analyses, numerous meticulous studies of the cortex of individual cerebral lobes were carried out, but these were not united into a single map. Consequently, the envisioned integration of cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic data mentioned above was never realized. Some years ago, we (Nieuwenhuys et al. in Brain Struct Funct 220:2551-2573, 2015a, Nieuwenhuys et al. in Brain Struct Funct 220:3753-3755, 2015b) reanalyzed the V-V myeloarchitectonic data, and succeeded in constructing a complete myeloarchitectonic map of the human neocortex from these data. Because the data provided by the V-V school were derived from many different brains, a standard brain had to be introduced as a template to which all data available could be transferred. As such the MNI305 template was selected. Having made available now the cytoarchitectonic maps of Brodmann and Sarkisov et al. and the recently prepared myeloarchitectonic map, an attempt is made here to realize at last the original aim of the V-V school, viz. the preparation of a single, combined (cyto + myelo) architectonic map of the human cortex. To this end, the following three steps have been made. First, Brodmann's (BR) map, and the map of Sarkisov et al. (SA) were harmoniously transferred to the same template brain as the one used during the construction of our myeloarchitectonic map. Second, the standardized BR and our myeloarchitectonic (NI) map were compared, and the data contained within these maps were integrated into a single standardized combined BR-NI map (Fig. 11). The standardized SA and NI maps were subjected to the same procedure (Fig. 12). Finally, the standardized combined BR-NI and SA-NI maps were united into a single combined BR-SA-NI map (Fig. 13). This map renders it possible to make direct comparisons between the results of the architectonic studies of the V-V school and current parcellations of the human neocortex.","Nieuwenhuys, Rudolf; Broere, Cees A J",Brain Struct Funct,320,23

To evaluate the development risk of psychiatric symptoms in patients who manifested COVID 19 symptoms during the quarantine period acute phase of the disease and the aggravation of some patients` symptoms after this infectious disease. Methods: We have conducted a study on 28 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and who have received psychopathological follow up during the quarantine through telemedicine, patients selected for a period of 3 month. Results: The average age of the patients was of 46,89 years old, with an associated standard deviation of 18,68 years and with a predominance in female gender (60,7%). 85,4% of the subjects developed psychopathologies, depending on the type of the experienced quarantine (especially home quarantine – sig = 0,042) or on the presence of sensory disorders as symptomatology (sig.=0,046). Conclusions: Adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, that could be related either to the intensity of the COVID 19 symptoms (headache, cough, fever, gastrointestinal disorders, dyspnea, anosmia and ageusia) or to the disruption of personal and social healthcare and lifestyle. © Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology, Messina, Italy","Moroianu, L.

(i) The analyses on the subset of SARS-CoV-2 literature identified studies published prior to 2020 that have now proven highly instrumental in the development of various clusters of publications linked to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, the so-called sleeping beauties of the coronavirus literature with an awakening in 2020 were identified, i.e., previously published studies of this literature that had remained relatively unnoticed for several years but gained sudden traction in 2020 in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. (ii) The subset of 2020 SARS-CoV-2 articles is bibliographically distant from the rest of this literature published prior to 2020. Individual articles of the SARS-CoV-2 segment with a bridging role between the two bodies of articles (i.e., before and after 2020) are identifiable. (iii) Furthermore, the degree of bibliographic coupling within the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 cluster is much poorer compared to the cluster of articles published prior to 2020.

Therefore, further research is required to achieve a lasting solution against this deadly disease. Repurposing available drugs and evaluating natural product inhibitors against target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 could be an effective approach to accelerate drug discovery and development. With this strategy in mind, we derived Marine Natural Products (MNP)-based drug-like small molecules and evaluated them against three major target proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus replication cycle. A drug-like database from MNP library was generated using Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET descriptors. A total of 2,033 compounds were obtained and were subsequently subjected to molecular docking with 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;, PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;, and RdRp. The docking analyses revealed that a total of 14 compounds displayed better docking scores than the reference compounds and have significant molecular interactions with the active site residues of SARS-CoV-2 virus targeted proteins. Furthermore, the stability of docking-derived complexes was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations. The analyses revealed two hit compounds against each targeted protein displaying stable behavior, binding affinity, and molecular interactions. Our investigation identified two hit compounds against each targeted proteins displaying stable behavior, higher binding affinity and key residual molecular interactions, with good in silico pharmacokinetic properties, therefore can be considered for further in vitro studies.","Kumar, V.; Parate, S.; Yoon, S.; Lee, G.; Lee, K.

At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (&#8805;20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (&#8805;20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.","Kannan, Saathvik R; Spratt, Austin N; Cohen, Alisha R; Naqvi, S Hasan; Chand, Hitendra S; Quinn, Thomas P; Lorson, Christian L; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Singh, Kamal",J Autoimmun,320,24

This study estimated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian Radiation Oncology departments and the coping measures used in the country. Methods and Materials: The Brazilian Radiotherapy Society (SBRT) developed a questionnaire with 14 questions, sent to all heads of Radiation Oncology departments in the country, between May and June 2020. These data were evaluated regarding cases confirmed and deaths by COVID-19 in epidemiological week 28, on July 11, 2020. Results: One hundred twenty-six questionnaires from different regions were answered, representing 44% of the country's services. A drop in the number of patients was observed in 61% of services. This drop was observed both in patients from the public and supplementary private health insurance systems. Regarding patients and employees with COVID-19, we observe that services that primarily treat SUS patients reported significantly fewer cases of the disease. About half of the services had collaborators and patients during radiotherapy with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the coping measures, the services used intensified hygiene and cleanliness, distance, restrictions on access to companions and other changes in daily practice. Conclusions: Thus, there was an important drop in the number of radiotherapy patients in the country during the pandemic, and this impact happened in a similar way among the services, regardless of their characteristics and coping measures adopted during the pandemic.","Oliveira, Harley F; Yoshinari, Gerson H; Veras, Igor M; de Almeida, Wilson J; Freitas, Nilceana M A; Castilho, Marcus S; de A Pellizzon, Antônio C; Erlich, Felipe; Affonso, Renato J; de Carvalho, Ícaro T; Leite, André C C; Kuhnen, Felipe Q; Najas, Rosa M X F; Rosa, Arthur Accioly",Adv Radiat Oncol,320,29

Cu is involved in the functions of critical immune cells such as T helper cells, B cells, neutrophils natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages. These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single- or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS-CoV-2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.","Raha, Syamal; Mallick, Rahul; Basak, Sanjay; Duttaroy, Asim K",Med Hypotheses,320,15

OBJECTIVES: To explore the possibility of predicting final body height at maturity based on associating parameters at the time of diagnosing adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), while examining the effect of curve magnitude and deterioration. METHODS: A total of 284 female patients with AIS (mean age 12.2 ± 1.1 years, 52.5% premenarchal) were followed till skeletal maturity, indicated by &#8805;Risser stage 4, static body height and arm span over the past 6 months, and postmenarche 2 years. Standing body height, arm span, menarchal status, Risser staging, distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification, Sanders staging (SS), Cobb angles (major and minor curves), and Lenke curve types at initial presentation were examined. Patients with/without curve deterioration were compared. Multiple linear regression was used for predicting final body height (cm), and remaining height increase (%). RESULTS: Baseline body height was 152.1 ± 7.1 cm and major curve Cobb angle was 27.1° ± 7.4°, whereas at maturity they were 159.5 ± 5.4 cm and 32.5° ± 9.3°, respectively. For patients presented at Risser stage 0 or 1, radius grade (R) 6, ulnar grade (U) 5, or SS3, those with curve deterioration exhibited greater height increase potential at initial presentation (P < .05) than those without deterioration. No intergroup difference was found for patients presented at &#8805;Risser 2, R7, U6, SS4. Predictive baseline parameters were age, body height, Cobb angle (major curve), curve type, and DRU grades. Prediction models of final body height (R 2 = 0.735, P < .001) and remaining height increase (R 2 = 0.742, P < .001) were established. CONCLUSIONS: Final body height prediction model was derived for female patients with AIS, with baseline body height and ulnar grading having larger impacts than other parameters.","Cheung, Prudence Wing Hang; Mannem, Abhishek; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin",Global Spine J,320,25

Citywide lockdowns with stay-at-home orders and mass closings quickly became the “new normal.” With these new mandates, routine activity, mental health and financial securities all began to experience major deviations, and it became clear that this could prove to be rather valuable in providing the opportunity for large-scale criminology experiments. This study aims to explore New York City's (NYC) crime patterns during this unique social situation. Specifically, has crime as a whole increased or decreased, and have particular crimes increased or decreased during these stressful fluid times? Design/methodology/approach: The authors briefly review previous crises and worldwide trends but focus on NYC crime as collected by the New York Police Department's statistics unit, “CompStat.” An analysis of 13 crime types from March 30 to July 5 was completed, including percent differences and individual weekly incidence rates in citywide crimes compared to the same time in 2019. Findings: The analysis demonstrated that all crimes analyzed, except for murder and burglary, exhibited a statistically significant difference during COVID-19 conditions compared to the same time the previous year. Grand larceny auto and gun violence crimes significantly increased during COVID-19 weeks, whereas rape, other sex crimes, robbery, felony assault, grand larceny, transit, housing, misdemeanor assault and petit larceny all significantly decreased. Originality/value: Due to the ongoing nature of the pandemic, this is amongst the first studies to examine trends in NYC crime during pandemic mandates. Expanding our knowledge in these situations can inform natural disaster responses, as well as criminal justice policy and practice to better protect the public in future crises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Esposito, M.

However, little is known about the clinical outcomes among hospitalized patients with active COVID-19 after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). AIM: We aimed to characterize outcomes from IHCA in patients with COVID-19 and to identify patient- and hospital-level variables associated with 30-day survival. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study across 11 academic medical centres in the U.S. Adult patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or defibrillation for IHCA between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 who had a documented positive test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 were included. The primary outcome was 30-day survival after IHCA. RESULTS: There were 260 IHCAs among COVID-19 patients during the study period. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range 60-77), 71.5% were male, 49.6% were White, 16.9% were Black, and 16.2% were Hispanic. The most common presenting rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (45.0%) and asystole (44.6%). ROSC occurred in 58 patients (22.3%), 31 (11.9%) survived to hospital discharge, and 32 (12.3%) survived to 30 days. Rates of ROSC and 30-day survival in the two hospitals with the highest volume of IHCA over the study period compared to the remaining hospitals were considerably lower (10.8% vs. 64.3% and 5.9% vs. 35.7% respectively, pâ¯<â¯0.001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: We found rates of ROSC and 30-day survival of 22.3% and 12.3% respectively.

Our objectives are to evaluate the clinic-radiological spectrum of pediatric patients with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CC). METHODS: Children (0-18 years) admitted between February 2017 and May 2020 with splenial lesions showing diffusion restriction on MRI, either isolated or within involvement of other parts of the brain, were included retrospectively. The primary lesions of the CC (e.g. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute ischemic infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme) were excluded. CLOCCs were divided into infection-associated, metabolic disorder-associated, and trauma-associated lesions, as well as CLOCCs involving other entities. Data were collected from the medical databases. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were determined to have CLOCCs. Twenty-five (61%) were infection-associated, nine (22%) were trauma-associated, and three (7%) were metabolic disorder-associated cases, including 2 inherited disorders of metabolism. There were four (10%) patients with other entities, three with epilepsy, and one had an apparent life-threatening event. Six patients had a known etiology among the infection-associated group; one had multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19 and one had been infected by COVID-19 without any complications. All the infection-associated patients with isolated splenial lesions recovered totally, although six patients required intensive care hospitalization. Four trauma-associated patients had sequela lesions. CONCLUSIONS: CLOCCs are associated with a spectrum of diseases, including the new coronavirus, COVID-19 infection. Infection-associated CLOCCs has the best prognosis, although severe cases may occur. Sequelae are possible based on the etiology.","Aksu Uzunhan, Tugçe; Maras Genç, Hülya; Kutlubay, Büsra; Kalin, Sevinç; Bektas, Gonca; Yapici, Özge; Çiraci, Saliha; Sözen, Hatice Gülhan; Sevketoglu, Esra; Palabiyik, Figen; Gör, Zeynep; Çakar, Nafiye Emel; Kara, Bülent",Brain dev,320,0

Generally, the homogeneity of a battery pack is evaluated by characterizing the cells individually in terms of capacity, mass, impedance. Particularly, high quality electrochemical data heavily relies on the availability of high precision current source to minimize the discrepancy induced by the channel-to-channel variation. Here, a facile and precise measurement method is reported for screening cell-to-cell variations, in which voltage is the only indicator parameter independent of high precision current source. In detail, by connecting the cells in series (CiS), the measurement error of electrochemical data caused by stability and discrepancy of current sources among different charge/discharge equipment can be effectively avoided. The findings of this work showed that the cell-to-cell variations can be simply and sensitively detected with CiS configuration. For example, the relative standard deviation, which is the evaluation criterion of battery homogeneity, was 2.14% based on CiS while it was 0.43% based on individual measurements. The simple and precise CiS measurement is promising for evaluation of cell quality or module integration quality. In addition, this work can also provide a solid foundation for the development of detection algorithms for battery management systems to rapidly monitor battery homogeneity.","Xie, Leqiong; Ren, Dongsheng; Wang, Li; Chen, Zonghai; Tian, Guangyu; Amine, Khalil; He, Xiangming",Sci Rep,320,10

Low-dose colchicine combines anti-inflammatory action with a favorable safety profile. Objective: To evaluate the effect of treatment with colchicine on cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial (the Greek Study in the Effects of Colchicine in COVID-19 Complications Prevention), 105 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were randomized in a 1:1 allocation from April 3 to April 27, 2020, to either standard medical treatment or colchicine with standard medical treatment. The study took place in 16 tertiary hospitals in Greece. Intervention: Colchicine administration (1.5-mg loading dose followed by 0.5 mg after 60 min and maintenance doses of 0.5 mg twice daily) with standard medical treatment for as long as 3 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end points were (1) maximum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin level; (2) time for C-reactive protein to reach more than 3 times the upper reference limit; and (3) time to deterioration by 2 points on a 7-grade clinical status scale, ranging from able to resume normal activities to death. Secondary end points were (1) the percentage of participants requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) all-cause mortality, and (3) number, type, severity, and seriousness of adverse events. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 105 patients were evaluated (61 [58.1%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 64 [54-76] years) with 50 (47.6%) randomized to the control group and 55 (52.4%) to the colchicine group. Median (interquartile range) peak high-sensitivity cardiac troponin values were 0.0112 (0.0043-0.0093) ng/mL in the control group and 0.008 (0.004-0.0135) ng/mL in the colchicine group (P = .34). Median (interquartile range) maximum C-reactive protein levels were 4.5 (1.4-8.9) mg/dL vs 3.1 (0.8-9.8) mg/dL (P = .73), respectively. The clinical primary end point rate was 14.0% in the control group (7 of 50 patients) and 1.8% in the colchicine group (1 of 55 patients) (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.96; P = .02). Mean (SD) event-free survival time was 18.6 (0.83) days the in the control group vs 20.7 (0.31) in the colchicine group (log rank P = .03). Adverse events were similar in the 2 groups, except for diarrhea, which was more frequent with colchicine group than the control group (25 patients [45.5%] vs 9 patients [18.0%]; P = .003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received colchicine had statistically significantly improved time to clinical deterioration. There were no significant differences in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin or C-reactive protein levels. These findings should be interpreted with caution.

The clinical use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the assessment of inflammation and infection is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to achieve an Italian consensus document on [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases, such as osteomyelitis (OM), prosthetic joint infections (PJI), infective endocarditis (IE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), cardiac implantable electronic device infections (CIEDI), systemic and cardiac sarcoidosis (SS/CS), diabetic foot (DF), fungal infections (FI), tuberculosis (TBC), fever and inflammation of unknown origin (FUO/IUO), pediatric infections (PI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), spine infections (SI), vascular graft infections (VGI), large vessel vasculitis (LVV), retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF) and COVID-19 infections. Methods: In September 2020, the inflammatory and infectious diseases focus group (IIFG) of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) proposed to realize a procedural paper about the clinical applications of [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases. The project was carried out thanks to the collaboration of 13 Italian nuclear medicine centers, with a consolidate experience in this field. With the endorsement of AIMN, IIFG contacted each center, and the pediatric diseases focus group (PDFC). IIFG provided for each team involved, a draft with essential information regarding the execution of [18F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI scan (i.e., indications, patient preparation, standard or specific acquisition modalities, interpretation criteria, reporting methods, pitfalls and artifacts), by limiting the literature research to the last 20 years. Moreover, some clinical cases were required from each center, to underline the teaching points. Time for the collection of each report was from October to December 2020. Results: Overall, we summarized 291 scientific papers and guidelines published between 1998 and 2021. Papers were divided in several sub-topics and summarized in the following paragraphs: clinical indications, image interpretation criteria, future perspectivess and new trends (for each single disease), while patient preparation, image acquisition, possible pitfalls and reporting modalities were described afterwards. Moreover, a specific section was dedicated to pediatric and PET/MRI indications. A collection of images was described for each indication. Conclusions: Currently, [18F]FDG PET/CT in oncology is globally accepted and standardized in main diagnostic algorithms for neoplasms. In recent years, the ever-closer collaboration among different European associations has tried to overcome the absence of a standardization also in the field of inflammation and infections. The collaboration of several nuclear medicine centers with a long experience in this field, as well as among different AIMN focus groups represents a further attempt in this direction. We hope that this document will be the basis for a ""common nuclear physicians' language"" throughout all the country.

We evaluated 3 tools for detection of feline coronavirus (FCoV) in aqueous humor: 1) a 7b gene reverse-transcription real-time PCR (7b-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect FCoV RNA, 2) a spike gene mutation RT-rtPCR (S-RT-rtPCR) assay to detect 2 point mutations in the spike gene of FCoV in cats positive by 7b-RT-rtPCR, and 3) immunocytochemistry (ICC) for detection of FCoV antigen in aqueous humor macrophages. We studied 58 cats, including 31 cats with FIP and 27 control cats. FIP was excluded by postmortem examination and negative immunohistochemistry (IHC). Aqueous humor samples obtained postmortem were assessed using 7b-RT-rtPCR in all cats, and positive samples were evaluated with S-RT-rtPCR. ICC evaluation of aqueous humor samples from 36 of the 58 cats was done using an avidin-biotin complex method and monoclonal anti-FCoV IgG 2A. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were calculated including 95% CIs. 7b-RT-rtPCR had a specificity of 100.0% (95% CI: 87.2-100.0) and sensitivity of 35.5% (95% CI: 19.2-54.6). Specificity of S-RT-rtPCR could not be determined because there were no FCoV 7b-RT-rtPCR-positive samples in the control group. Sensitivity of S-RT-rtPCR was 12.9% (95% CI 3.6-29.8). Sensitivity and specificity of ICC were 62.5% (95% CI: 40.6-81.2) and 80.0% (95% CI: 44.4-97.5), respectively.

We performed a systematic review on the oncological effects of delayed surgery for patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the targeted therapy (TT) era. METHOD: The protocol of this review is registered on PROSPERO(CRD42020190882). A comprehensive literature search was performed on Medline, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL using MeSH terms and keywords for randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the topic. Risks of biases were assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. For localised RCC, immediate surgery [including partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN)] and delayed surgery [including active surveillance (AS) and delayed intervention (DI)] were compared. For metastatic RCC, upfront versus deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) were compared. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included for quantitative analysis. Delayed surgery was significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.23-2.27, p < 0.01) in T1a RCC, but no significant difference was noted for overall survival. For localised &#8805; T1b RCC, there were insufficient data for meta-analysis and the results from the individual reports were contradictory. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN was associated with better overall survival when compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Noting potential selection bias, there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that delayed surgery is safe in localised RCC. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by deferred CN should be considered.","Chan, Vinson Wai-Shun; Tan, Wei Shen; Leow, Jeffrey J; Tan, Wei Phin; Ong, William Lay Keat; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Gurung, Pratik; Pirola, Giacomo Maria; Orecchia, Luca; Liew, Matthew Ping Chao; Lee, Hsiang-Ying; Wang, Yuding; Chen, I-Hsuan Alan; Castellani, Daniele; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Mayor, Nikhil; Sathianathen, Niranjan J; Braga, Isaac; Liu, Zhenbang; Moon, Dora; Tikkinen, Kari; Kamat, Ashish; Meng, Max; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Giannarini, Gianluca; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",World j. urol,320,1

The alarming speed at which SARS-CoV-2 has spread, and the high mortality rate of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has required both basic science and clinical research to move at an unprecedented pace. Models previously developed to study the immune response against SARS-CoV have been rapidly deployed to now study SARS-CoV-2. To date, both small and large animal models are remarkably consistent when infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, certain models have proven more useful when answering specific immunological questions than others. Small animal models, such as Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and mice carrying the hACE2 transgene, appear to reliably recapitulate the initial cytokine surge seen in COVID-19 as well as show significant innate and adaptive cell infiltration in to the lung early in infection. Additionally, these models develop strong antibody responses to the virus, are protected from reinfection, and genetically modified versions exist that can be used to ask specific immunological questions. Large animal models such as rhesus and cynomologus macaques and African green monkeys are critical to understanding how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection because they are considered to be the most similar to humans. These models are considered the gold standard for assessing vaccine efficacy and protection, and recapitulate the initial cytokine surge, immune cell infiltration into the lung, certain aspects of thrombosis, and the antibody and T-cell response to the virus. In this review, we discuss both small and large animal model studies previously used in SARS-CoV-2 research that may be useful in elucidating the immunological contributions to hallmark syndromes observed with COVID-19.","Veenhuis, Rebecca T; Zeiss, Caroline J",ILAR j,320,20

If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them. SEARCH METHODS: Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","Burton, Martin J; Clarkson, Janet E; Goulao, Beatriz; Glenny, Anne-Marie; McBain, Andrew J; Schilder, Anne Gm; Webster, Katie E; Worthington, Helen V",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,320,33

ALTR due to MACC at the head-neck junction has primarily been reported in association with cobalt chromium alloy femoral heads. As pain following total hip arthroplasty may have various intrinsic and extrinsic causes, a systematic approach to evaluation (risk stratification algorithm) based on the currently available data is recommended to optimize patient management. Evaluation should begin by ruling out common causes of pain, including component loosening and periprosthetic joint infection. While specialized tests such as blood metal analysis and metal artifact reduction sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MARS MRI) are useful modalities in evaluating for ALTRs, over-reliance on any single investigative tool in the clinical decision-making process should be avoided. There should be a low threshold to perform a systematic evaluation for ALTR due to MACC in patients with metal-on-polyethylene total hip arthroplasty as early recognition and diagnosis is critical, as delays in appropriate treatment initiation may result in soft-tissue damage, which complicates surgical treatment and is associated with a higher risk of complications and poorer patient outcomes.","Kwon, Young-Min; Della Valle, Craig J; Lombardi, Adolph V; Garbuz, Donald S; Berry, Daniel J; Jacobs, Joshua J","J. bone jt. sur.

AIM: This study evaluated the psychosocial and behavioural changes related to oral health in adolescents immediately before and during the pandemic period of COVID-19, enabling a longitudinal assessment of the perceived changes. DESIGN: This cohort study evaluated 290 adolescents from November 2019 to February 2020 (T1-before the pandemic in Brazil) and from June to July 2020 (T2) in southern Brazil. Sociodemographic, behavioural, and psychosocial variables were measured before and during the pandemic. Issues related to social distancing and job loss were also collected. The differences between the variables in T1 and T2, as well as the effect of social distancing, were assessed using a multilevel-adjusted logistic regression model for repeated measures. RESULTS: A total of 207 adolescents were re-evaluated at T2 (a response rate of 71.3%). During the pandemic, the frequency of toothbrushing, the use of dental services, and the self-perceived need for dental treatment significantly decreased. Sugar consumption, bruxism, and quality of sleep did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Behavioural and psychosocial factors showed significant changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents.","Brondani, Bruna; Knorst, Jessica Klöckner; Tomazoni, Fernanda; Cósta, Marina Dutra; Vargas, Andressa Weber; Noronha, Thaís Gioda; Mendes, Fausto Medeiros; Ardenghi, Thiago Machado",Int. j. paediatr. dent,320,1

Studies indicate that RAAS imbalance worsens the prognosis in COVID-19. We present a consecutive retrospective COVID-19 cohort with findings of frequent pulmonary thromboembolism (17%), high pulmonary artery pressure (60%) and lung MRI perfusion disturbances. We demonstrate, in swine, that infusing angiotensin II or blocking ACE2 induces increased pulmonary artery pressure, reduces blood oxygenation, increases coagulation, disturbs lung perfusion, induces diffuse alveolar damage, and acute tubular necrosis compared to control animals. We further demonstrate that this imbalanced state can be ameliorated by infusion of an angiotensin receptor blocker and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this work, we show that a pathophysiological state in swine induced by RAAS imbalance shares several features with the clinical COVID-19 presentation. Therefore, we propose that severe COVID-19 could partially be driven by a RAAS imbalance.","Rysz, Susanne; Al-Saadi, Jonathan; Sjöström, Anna; Farm, Maria; Campoccia Jalde, Francesca; Plattén, Michael; Eriksson, Helen; Klein, Margareta; Vargas-Paris, Roberto; Nyrén, Sven; Abdula, Goran; Ouellette, Russell; Granberg, Tobias; Jonsson Fagerlund, Malin; Lundberg, Johan",Nat Commun,320,23

Research on the lives of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly relevant to meet potential challenges regarding their physical and mental well-being. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how AYA cancer patients and survivors experience social isolation during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Individual semistructured telephone interviews were performed with 13 AYA cancer patients and survivors aged 18-29 years. All participants were users of Kræftværket, a youth support center and social organization for AYAs with cancer at The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Denmark. Data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. Results: The following themes were found. The need for giving and receiving support, Difficulty of the community spirit, The lockdown's effect on recovery, Disrupted youth, and Being alone. Conclusion: The participants in this study experienced loneliness, anxiety, lack of psychosocial support, and lack of physical contact. In addition, lack of rehabilitation and lack of support during hospital visits, which may specifically influence the disease trajectory, were reported. Thus, health care professionals have an important task to follow up on the AYA's well-being during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. A positive side effect of the lockdown period was the experience of getting a respite to recover physically and mentally after cancer.","Hanghøj, Signe; Pappot, Nina; Hjerming, Maiken; Taarnhøj, Gry Assam; Boisen, Kirsten A; Pappot, Helle",J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,320,20

Estimates of community-based CT/NG prevalence are lacking among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). METHODS: Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit GBM in Montréal, Canada between February 2017 and June 2018. Specimens provided from urogenital, rectal and pharyngeal sites were analyzed using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to detect CT/NG. Prevalence estimates of CT/NG, overall and by anatomical site were calculated. All estimates are RDS-adjusted. RESULTS: Among 1177 GBM, the prevalence of rectal, urogenital, pharyngeal and overall were respectively 2.4%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 2.8% for CT infections, and 3.1%, 0.4%, 3.5% and 5.6% for NG infections. If testing had been limited to the urogenital site, 80% and 94% of CT and NG infections, respectively, would have been missed. CONCLUSIONS: This community-based study among GBM shows that the CT prevalence was about half of that observed for NG. A large part of CT/NG infections involves only the extragenital sites, highlighting the need for systematic multisite screening regardless of symptoms. In the mist of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited CT/NG screening capacity due to test kits shortage, it might be considered to prioritize rectal and pharyngeal CT/NG testing over urogenital testing in asymptomatic GBM.","Harvey-Lavoie, Simonne; Apelian, Herak; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Cox, Joseph; Messier-Peet, Marc; Moodie, Erica; Fourmigue, Alain; Moore, David; Lachowsky, Nathan J; Grace, Daniel; Hart, Trevor A; Jollimore, Jody; Fortin, Claude; Lambert, Gilles",Sex. transm. dis,320,24

The current paper aims to discuss the impact of two different sampling methodologies when executing a drive through COVID-19 survey on the quality of estimated disease burden measures. Secondary data analysis of a pilot cross-sectional survey targeting Qatar's primary health care registered population was done. Two groups with different sampling methods were compared for estimating COVID-19 point prevalence using molecular testing for nasopharyngeal swabs. The first group is a stratified random sample non-proportional to size (N = 260). A total of 16 population strata based on age group, gender, and nationality were sampled. The second group is the Open invitation group (N = 841). The results showed that the two groups were obviously and significantly different in age and nationality. Besides, reporting of COVID-19 symptoms was more frequent in the open invitation group (28.2%) than the random sample (16.2%). The open invitation group overestimated the symptomatic COVID-19 prevalence rate by more than four times, while it overestimated the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases by a small margin. The overall prevalence rate of active COVID-19 cases in the open invitation sample (13.3%) was almost double that of the random sample (6.9%). Furthermore, using population sampling weights reduced the prevalence rate to 0.8%. The lesson learned here is that it is wise to consider the magnitude of bias introduced in a surveillance system when relying on convenient sampling approaches in response to time constraints.","AQotba, Hamda Abdulla; Al Nuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; Al Mujalli, Hanan; Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif; Khudadad, Hanan; Marji, Tamara; Veettil, Shajitha Thekke; Syed, Mohamed Ahmed",Front Public Health,320,33

The incubation period for the virus is ~1-14 days and all age groups may be susceptible to a fatality rate of about 5.9%. COVID-19 is caused by a novel single-stranded, positive (+) sense RNA beta coronavirus. The development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent need worldwide. Immunoinformatics approaches are both cost-effective and convenient, as in silico predictions can reduce the number of experiments needed. In this study, with the aid of immunoinformatics tools, we tried to design a multi-epitope vaccine that can be used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The epitopes were computed by using B cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTL) base on the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine was devised by fusing together the B cell, HTL, and CTL epitopes with linkers. To enhance the immunogenicity, the ß-defensin (45 mer) amino acid sequence, and pan-HLA DR binding epitopes (13aa) were adjoined to the N-terminal of the vaccine with the help of the EAAAK linker. To enable the intracellular delivery of the modeled vaccine, a TAT sequence (11aa) was appended to C-terminal. Linkers play vital roles in producing an extended conformation (flexibility), protein folding, and separation of functional domains, and therefore, make the protein structure more stable. The secondary and three-dimensional (3D) structure of the final vaccine was then predicted. Furthermore, the complex between the final vaccine and immune receptors (toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I), and MHC-II) were evaluated by molecular docking. Lastly, to confirm the expression of the designed vaccine, the mRNA of the vaccine was enhanced with the aid of the Java Codon Adaptation Tool, and the secondary structure was generated from Mfold. Then we performed in silico cloning. The final vaccine requires experimental validation to determine its safety and efficacy in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Dong, Rong; Chu, Zhugang; Yu, Fuxun; Zha, Yan",Front Immunol,320,25

Pulmonary involvement and PCR confirmed the diagnosis. The block persisted after recovery of the patient for more than 1 month. Pathophysiology of advanced AVB following COVID-19 infection is not well understood. Several factors including inflammatory response, immune system over activity, myocarditis, and medications have been underlined.

Estimating the overall health effects of this is difficult as most disease surveillance systems have also been substantially affected during the pandemic. For some diseases, this effect is mitigated by the methods enacted to fight the pandemic, such as use of facial coverings, social distancing and quarantine, but measles is infectious to the degree that this mitigation is likely to be limited. Thus, outbreaks and an increase in global measles mortality are expected. However, the severity of this impact is not yet known. In early 2020, a study by Roberton and colleagues predicted an additional 12,360 to 37,920 deaths in children under-five worldwide from measles over the coming year based on three potential levels of vaccine coverage reductions ranging from 18.5 to 51.9%. Our study investigates the magnitude of the increase in measles mortality due to decreased vaccine coverage because of COVID-19, based on official estimates of 2020 measles vaccine coverage from WHO/UNICEF released in July 2021. Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), an interventions modeling program, we estimated measles mortality for low/middle income countries (LMICs) based on the 2020 WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC). Because these calculations use actual reported vaccine coverage, they provide a more accurate picture of measles mortality related to COVID-19 disruptions in 2020. Using the WUENIC data, LiST predicted fewer additional deaths in 2020 due to decreases in measles vaccine coverage than estimations made by LiST based on Roberton, 2020 due to remarkable recovery efforts by national immunization programmes in the second half of 2020.","Gregory, Lucy Claire",,320,24

In this study, we investigated the host-guest interaction between the popular supramolecule calix[4]arene derivatives and the favipiravir drug by using the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method. The B3LYP hybrid method and 6-31G (d,p) basis set were utilized to determine the optimized structures of the host and guest molecules and their complexes. The negative adsorption energy (&#8710;E) and adsorption enthalpy (&#8710;H) calculated for the complexes formed between calix[4]arene compounds and favipiravir drug molecule mentioned that adsorption of favipiravir molecule was an exothermic process on calix[4]arene structures. On the other hand, among the calixarene derivatives in the study, Gibbs free energy change (&#8710;G) value for the adsorption was only negative on calix[4]arene4 molecule. The infrared spectroscopy (IR) calculations were performed by examining the C=O, O-H and NH2 vibrational frequencies to see the adsorption behavior in the favipiravir-calix[4]arene complex. After adsorption of the favipiravir molecule, HOMO-LUMO gap values decreased significantly for the structures and therefore electrical conductivity increased proportionally. In addition, sensor response factors, Fermi energy levels and workfunction changes of calix[4]arene derivatives were calculated and examined. Charge transfer between the four calix[4]arene compounds and the favipiravir molecule has occurred after adsorption. This attributes that calix[4]arene derivatives can be used as a well-suited favipiravir sensor (electronic and workfunction) and adsorbent at room temperature. Based on the calculations made to see the solvent effect on the adsorption of favipiravir it was determined that it did not affect the interaction between the drug molecule and the calix[4]arene compound too much and the adsorption energy turned into a slightly less negative value.","Yuksel, Numan; Köse, Ahmet; Fellah, M Ferdi",J Incl Phenom Macrocycl Chem,320,24

Spain's National Conference of Medical School Deans coordinates an objective, structured clinical competency assessment called the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), which consists of 20 face-to-face test sections for students in their sixth year of study. As a result of the pandemic, a computer-based case simulation OSCE (CCS-OSCE) has been designed. The objective of this article is to describe the creation, administration, and development of the test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work is a descriptive study of the CCS-OSCE from its planning stages in April 2020 to its administration in June 2020. RESULTS: The CCS-OSCE evaluated the competences of anamnesis, exploration, clinical judgment, ethical aspects, interprofessional relations, prevention, and health promotion. No technical or communication skills were evaluated. The CCS-OSCE consisted of ten test sections, each of which had a 12-min time limit and ranged from six to 21 questions (mean: 1.1â¯min/question). The CCS-OSCE used the virtual campus platform of each of the 16 participating medical schools, which had a total of 2829 students in their sixth year of study. It was jointly held on two dates in June 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The CCS-OSCE made it possible to bring together the various medical schools and carry out interdisciplinary work. The CCS-OSCE conducted may be similar to Step 3 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination.","García-Seoane, J J; Ramos-Rincón, J M; Lara-Muñoz, J P","Rev. clin. esp.

It is strongly believed that its impact might be worsened by poor outdoor and indoor air qualities, particularly on older adults. The nationwide lockdown measures were imposed between March 23 and June 20, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In this work, the possible effects of the lockdown on the air quality were investigated using meteorological and air quality datasets obtained from eight monitoring stations covering the Eastern Province of the KSA. The studied air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and inhalable particulate matter (PM10). The NO2 was found to be the marker pollutant responding best to the lockdown measures since its concentrations decreased at all sites during- and post-lockdown periods and ranged between 12-86% and 14-81%, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown period, the Eastern Province also experienced significant concentration reductions at varying rates for PM10 (21-70%), CO (5.8-55%), and SO2 (8.7-30%), while O3 concentrations showed increasing rates ranging between 6.3 and 45%. The consequences of these reductions were reflected in easing the outdoor air quality, which might reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, especially on elderly and sensitive groups.","Anil, Ismail; Alagha, Omar",Air Qual Atmos Health,320,16

METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature. RESULTS: Management of drug-drug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician. Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight. CONCLUSIONS: With this article, the authors inform the clinician about the potential interactions of experimental COVID-19 treatments with ISDs used in transplantation. Recommendations regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments in the context of COVID-19 are provided.","Elens, Laure; Langman, Loralie J; Hesselink, Dennis A; Bergan, Stein; Moes, Dirk Jan A R; Molinaro, Mariadelfina; Venkataramanan, Raman; Lemaitre, Florian",Ther Drug Monit,320,32

Given reports of GI involvement and viral shedding in the stool, it is unsurprising there are concerns that endoscopic equipment may be a potential vector of viral transmission. Here, we provide an overview of existing practices for endoscope reprocessing, recent developments in the field, and challenges in the COVID-19 environment. Current multi-society guidelines do not advise any change to endoscope disinfection protocols but emphasize strict adherence to recommended practices. However, endoscopy reprocessing staff may benefit from supplemental personal protective equipment measures, especially in high risk situations. Because thorough endoscope reprocessing is highly operator dependent, adequate training of personnel is critical for proper manual cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes that have potential to harbor virus. Bacterial contamination of duodenoscopes has caused outbreaks of infection from multidrug resistant organisms, highlighting vulnerable areas. The emphasis of current studies is on optimization of disinfection and drying, minimization of simethicone use, and on quality control of endoscope reprocessing with sampling and microbiological culturing. Recent advances include novel approaches to endoscope sterilization, infection barrier methods, and design of partially or fully disposable duodenoscopes. Overall, the available data indicate that, when correctly executed, current reprocessing practices are sufficient in preventing SARS-COV-2 transmission.","Chua, Tiffany; Halim, Nasir; Reicher, Sofiya",,320,1

The investigation was based on the results of a previous animal test, which was aimed to investigate and confirme the clinical efficacy of Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection in the treatment of COVID-19. The animal test demonstrated that Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection has a significant therapeutic effect on the human coronavirus pneumonia for the model mice. The lung inhibition index reached up to 86.86%. The evaluation was conducted on 40 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Jingzhou Hospital of Infectious Disease(Chest Hospital) of Hubei Pro-vince from January 30~(th) to March 21~(th), 2020. In these cases, patients were treated with other integrated Chinese and Western medicines regimens in the recommended Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection diagnosis and treatment regimen. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, nucleic acid clearance time, and imaging data were compared and analyzed before and after treatment. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the clinical symptoms of 40 cases were alleviated markedly, and their blood analysis and biochemical indexes returned to normal. The lung CT showed more than 50% of lesion absorption rate, and the viral nucleic acid test showed the average clearance time of patients was 16.6 days, and the average length of hospital stay was 25.9 days. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the symptoms of cough and fatigue were alleviated significantly, and the appetite was significantly improved compared with before, especially for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, laboratory indicators, especially absolute value and ratio of lymphocytes and CRP were significantly alleviated. According to the chest CT for short-term review, the absorption of lung lesions was faster than before, especially for grid-like and fibrotic lesions. Compared with antiviral drugs, such as Abidol and Kriging, the nucleic acid clearance time was significantly shorter than the cases treated with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection. The clinical effective rate of 40 cases was 100.0%. We believed that Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection have a good clinical effect in the treatment of COVID-19, and suggested increasing the clinical application and further conducting large-sample-size cli-nical verification.","Yang, Ming-Wei; Chen, Feng; Zhu, Ding-Jun; Li, Jia-Zhu; Zhu, Jin-Ling; Zeng, Wei; Qu, Shi-Lin; Zhang, Yun",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,320,16

Among all strategies for obtaining safe and potent vaccines, approaches based on attenuated-killed virus and non-replicating RNA viral vectors are demonstrating promising results. However, specificity of viral components targeted by human antibodies so far has not been demonstrated. A consistent strategy for obtaining functional-active antigens from SARS-CoV-2 specific ligands lead us to propose and test a number of synthetic components. From hundreds of starting sequences only fifteen fulfilled the design requirements and were produced as monomer and polymer forms and immuno-chemically tested.

To date, however, no known study has examined changes in mental health during the pandemic in the U.S. military veteran population. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative, prospective cohort survey of 3078 veterans. Pre-to-peri-pandemic changes in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated, as well as pre-pandemic risk and protective factors and pandemic-related correlates of increased psychiatric distress. RESULTS: The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) positive screens increased from pre- to peri-pandemic (7.1% to 9.4%; p < 0.001) and was driven by an increase among veterans aged 45-64 years (8.2% to 13.5%; p < 0.001), but the prevalence of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder positive screens remained stable. Using a continuous measure of psychiatric distress, an estimated 13.2% of veterans reported a clinically meaningful pre-to-peri-pandemic increase in distress (mean = 1.1 standard deviation). Veterans with a larger pre-pandemic social network size and secure attachment style were less likely to experience increased distress, whereas veterans reporting more pre-pandemic loneliness were more likely to experience increased distress. Concerns about pandemic-related social losses, mental health COVID-19 effects, and housing stability during the pandemic were associated with increased distress, over-and-above pre-pandemic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although most U.S. veterans showed resilience to mental health problems nearly 1 year into the pandemic, the prevalence of GAD positive screens increased, particularly among middle-aged veterans, and one of seven veterans experienced increased distress. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","Hill, Melanie L; Nichter, Brandon; Na, Peter J; Norman, Sonya B; Morland, Leslie A; Krystal, John H; Pietrzak, Robert H",Psychol Med,320,0

As there is no effective therapeutic against COVID-19, there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against it. The focused objective of the current study is to propose promising drug candidates against the newly identified potential therapeutic target (endonuclease, NSP15) of SARS-CoV2. NSP15 is an attractive druggable target due to its critical role in SARS-CoV2 replication and virulence in addition to interference with the host immune system. Here in the present study, we integrated the high throughput computational screening and dynamic simulation approach to identify the most promising candidate lead compound against NSP15. 5-fluoro-2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide (favipiravir), (3R,4R,5R)-3,4-Bis(benzyloxy)-5-((benzyloxy) methyl) dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one) remedesivir, 1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl N-[(2S,3S,5S)-3-hydroxy-5-[[(2S)-3-methyl-2-[[methyl-[(2-propan-2-yl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)methyl]carbamoyl]amino]butanoyl]amino]-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate (ritonavir), ethyl (3R,4R,5S)-4-acetamido-5-amino-3-pentan-3-yloxycyclohexene-1-carboxylate (oseltamivir), and (2S)-N-[(2S,4S,5S)-5-[[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)acetyl]amino]-4-hydroxy-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]-3-methyl-2-(2-oxo-1,3-diazinan-1-yl)butanamide (lopinavir) were chosen as a training set to generate the pharmacophore model. A dataset of â¼140000 compounds library was screened against the designed pharmacophore model and 10 unique compounds were selected that passed successfully through geometry constraints, Lipinski Rule of 5, and ADME/Tox filters along with a strong binding affinity for NSP15 binding cavity. The best fit compound was selected for dynamic simulation to have detailed structural features critical for binding with the NSP15 protein. Given our detailed integrative computational analysis, a Small molecule (3,3-Dimethyl-N-[4-(1-piperidinylcarbonyl) phenyl] butanamide) with drug-like properties and high binding affinity with the NSP15 is proposed as a most promising potential drug against COVID-19. The current computational integrative approach may complement high-throughput screening and the shortlisted small molecule may contribute to selective targeting of NSP15 to stop the replication of SARS-CoV2.","Batool, Abida; Bibi, Nousheen; Amin, Farhat; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Eur J Pharmacol,320,16

Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.","Imazio, Massimo; Klingel, Karin; Kindermann, Ingrid; Brucato, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Adler, Yehuda; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria",Heart,320,16

Here, we report the application of this newly developed advanced type of operating theater for the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), along with an evaluation of our initial experiences. METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients with parasellar tumor. All patients underwent surgery via the EEA in SCOT®. During all procedures, various types of intraoperative information, including electrophysiological monitoring, anatomical orientation with navigation system, intraoperative MRI, and endoscopic images of the operative field, were collected and stored by OPeLiNK®. Furthermore, the intraoperative information was shared with the surgical strategy desk, where a senior neurosurgeon can direct and manage the surgical procedure in real-time. RESULTS: We successfully completed the surgical procedures in SCOT® in all cases. Using OPeLiNK®, operators in SCOT® were able to share various data, such as images obtained intraoperatively and surgical instrument position from navigation systems, as well as images of the surgical field with senior neurosurgeons at the surgical strategy desk in all cases. Surgically relevant information from these sources was transmitted through an application and displayed to all surgical staff. The necessary nuances were reflected in the surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The SCOT®, which is considered an innovative operation system in neurosurgery, enables both quality and safety in the EEA. Furthermore, the use of SCOT® may also contribute to the education of young neurosurgeons.","Ogiwara, Toshihiro; Goto, Tetsuya; Fujii, Yu; Nakamura, Takuya; Suzuki, Yota; Hanaoka, Yoshiki; Ito, Kiyoshi; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro",World neurosurgery (Online),320,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bedside examinations by an experienced intensive care unit examiner using a multi-frequency probe (C1-6âMHz) with B-mode and CEUS to assess pleural-near changes in severe cases of COVID-19 infection with respiratory failure. CEUS with bolus delivery via a central venous catheter of 2.4âml Sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles from the arterial phase (10-15âs) to the late phase of 5âmin. Digital storage of cine sequences of the lung sound with abdomen for independent assessment with the subsequently performed contrast-enhanced dual-source CT. RESULTS: In 11 intubated and ventilated patients (arithmetic mean 62 years, 48 to 78 years, 3 women) with confirmed severe COVID-19 infections, a peripherally accentuated consolidation with irregular hyperemia was found in the CEUS and also in the CT examination. Of the 5 cases with pulmonary arterial embolisms, signs of right ventricular failure were found. In all cases, using CEUS low perfused areas of the pleura with adjacent hyperemia could be detected, while, with CT segmental contrast medium, gaps with subpleural compressions were found. Interstitial changes near the pleura led to B-lines and to ground glass opacities in the CT. Near the diaphragm a delayed arterial contrast of the liver was observed. In addition, in 2 cases partial atelectasis, in 3 cases marginal pleural effusions were found. CONCLUSION: CEUS opens up new possibilities for bedside monitoring of pleural reactive inflammatory or peripheral thrombus embolism in severe cases of COVID-19 infection.","Jung, E M; Stroszczynski, C; Jung, F",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,320,16

METHODS: Enrolled participants were interviewed online via a phone call after obtaining their informed consent. Quantification of smell, taste, and other sensations before, during, and after COVID-19 infection was correlated with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 500 patients with (mild-severe) COVID-19 completed the survey. A total of 26.4% were asymptomatic, and 21.4% were classified as paucisymptomatic with less severe symptoms. Almost equal proportions of the studied population experienced extreme taste sensation reductions (43%) and loss of smell sensation (44%). Statistically significant drastic decreases in smell and taste senses were seen among younger individuals. The magnitude of reduction in both sense changes increased steeply from the asymptomatic group to the paucisymptomatic group to the symptomatic group.

Many published commentaries have proposed plans for pandemic control that are primarily based on mortality rates among older individuals without considering long-term morbidity among individuals of all ages. Reliable estimates of such morbidity are important for patient care, prognosis, and development of public health policy. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Evidence Review: A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, that examined persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Persistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalization or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, long-term, after recovery, long-haul, persistent, outcome, symptom, follow-up, and longitudinal. All English-language articles that presented primary data from cohort studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that had clearly defined and sufficient follow-up were included. Case reports, case series, and studies that described symptoms only at the time of infection and/or hospitalization were excluded. A structured framework was applied to appraise study quality. Findings: A total of 1974 records were identified; of those, 1247 article titles and abstracts were screened. After removal of duplicates and exclusions, 92 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 47 studies were deemed eligible, and 45 studies reporting 84 clinical signs or symptoms were included in the systematic review. Of 9751 total participants, 5266 (54.0%) were male; 30 of 45 studies reported mean or median ages younger than 60 years. Among 16 studies, most of which comprised participants who were previously hospitalized, the median proportion of individuals experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom was 72.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 55.0%-80.0%). Individual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36.0%; IQR, 27.6%-50.0%), fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40.0%; IQR, 31.0%-57.0%), and sleep disorders or insomnia (8 studies; median 29.4%, IQR, 24.4%-33.0%). There were wide variations in the design and quality of the studies, which had implications for interpretation and often limited direct comparability and combinability. Major design differences included patient populations, definitions of time zero (ie, the beginning of the follow-up interval), follow-up lengths, and outcome definitions, including definitions of illness severity. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life. Current studies of symptom persistence are highly heterogeneous, and future studies need longer follow-up, improved quality, and more standardized designs to reliably quantify risks.","Nasserie, Tahmina; Hittle, Michael; Goodman, Steven N",JAMA Netw Open,320,5

In the last years, advances in functional and genetic testing have improved the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to immune dysregulation syndromes. CTLA-4 deficiency is a rare disease with variable phenotype, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe multisystem manifestations and complications. We describe a rare case of CTLA-4 deficiency in a boy with gastric cancer, very early onset inflammatory bowel disease and polyautoimmunity, the second-ever reported in the literature with the same characteristics. A 17-year-old boy was referred to Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital of Rome, a tertiary care center, for a gastric mass and a long-term history of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus type 1, polyarthritis and psoriasis. Histology of gastric biopsies revealed the presence of neoplastic signet ring cells. Imaging staging showed localized cancer; therefore, the patient underwent subtotal gastrectomy with termino-lateral gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Immunological work up and genetic testing by next-generation sequencing panels for primary immunodeficiencies led to the diagnosis of CTLA-4 deficiency. Good disease control was obtained with the administration of Abatacept. The patient experienced an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection without any concern. Eighteen months after treatment initiation, the patient is alive and well. Immunologic and genetic testing, such as next-generation sequencing, should always be part of the diagnostic approach to patients with complex immune dysregulation syndrome, severe clinical course, poor response to treatments or cancer.

These cases highlight the importance of careful clinical reasoning and demonstrate how cognitive errors may impact clinical reasoning. They also underscore the limitations of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 testing and illustrate the ways in which difficulty interpreting results may also influence clinical reasoning.

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are inherently somewhat hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of less than 86°. When they are arranged in a textured manner on substrates having different surface topographies, different wettabilities are exhibited. These range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, and even superhydrophobic, and with isotropic to anisotropic contact angle (CA) hysteresis. If chemical modification is involved, the wettability can be adjusted from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic on a certain structured ACNTs. Here, we first examine the structural influence of isotropic roughness on this effect (including nano-structures and hierarchical structures), where isotropic wetting (including wetting and anti-wetting) is observed. Water can wet the nano-structured CNT alignment, resulting in self-assembly; on the other hand, superhydrophobicity is durable on hierarchical and chemically-modified nano-structured alignments. Secondly, the effects of anisotropic roughness on wetting behavior are discussed.

A large number of studies have recently used deep learning in the field of medical imaging for the detection and identification of various diseases including COVID19. In this work, we have investigated an ECG based approach for detection of COVID-19 and heart diseases using deep learning. Deep learning requires a lot of data and image augmentation is a way to enhance the size of data. In this study, we specifically examined the impact of augmenting ECG images for disease detection. Our study indicates that augmentation improves the detection accuracy to a certain extent and can adversely impact beyond that. Without augmentation, we achieved accuracy and F1 score of 0.818 and 0.776 which is reduced to 0.764 and 0.768 respectively, when multiple augmentation techniques are applied. © 2021 IEEE.","Anwar, T.; Zakir, S.","2021 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2021",320,13

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and related risk factors for anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Sino-French New City branch of Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January to February 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety and Depression Scales were used to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. Demographic, clinical, and sociological data were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: In the current study, 183 patients were enrolled (mean age = 53 ± 9 years; 41.1% women). The prevalences of anxiety and depression were 56.3% and 39.3%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, female sex, being divorced or widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, renal disease, and depression were identified as independent risk factors for anxiety in patients with COVID-19. Factors that were associated with depression were female sex, being widowed, COVID-19 disease duration, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China. The identification of demographic, clinical, and social factors may help identify health care professionals to provide psychological care as part of treatment for patients with COVID-19 and other life-threatening infectious diseases.","Li, Tao; Sun, Siwei; Liu, Bao; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Yalan; Gong, Cheng; Duan, Jun",Psychosom Med,320,20

We use a state-of-the-art Earth system model and ensembles of tightly constrained simulations to evaluate the effect of the reductions in aviation traffic on contrail radiative forcing and climate in 2020. In the absence of any COVID-19-pandemic-caused reductions, the model simulates a contrail effective radiative forcing (ERF) of 62 ± 59 mW m-2 (2 standard deviations). The contrail ERF has complex spatial and seasonal patterns that combine the offsetting effect of shortwave (solar) cooling and longwave (infrared) heating from contrails and contrail cirrus. Cooling is larger in June–August due to the preponderance of aviation in the Northern Hemisphere, while warming occurs throughout the year. The spatial and seasonal forcing variations also map onto surface temperature variations. The net land surface temperature change due to contrails in a normal year is estimated at 0.13 ± 0.04 K (2 standard deviations), with some regions warming as much as 0.7 K. The effect of COVID-19 reductions in flight traffic decreased contrails. The unique timing of such reductions, which were maximum in Northern Hemisphere spring and summer when the largest contrail cooling occurs, means that cooling due to fewer contrails in boreal spring and fall was offset by warming due to fewer contrails in boreal summer to give no significant annual averaged ERF from contrail changes in 2020. Despite no net significant global ERF, because of the spatial and seasonal timing of contrail ERF, some land regions would have cooled slightly (minimum -0.2 K) but significantly from contrail changes in 2020. The implications for future climate impacts of contrails are discussed.","Gettelman, Andrew Chen Chieh-Chieh Bardeen Charles G.",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,320,26

Some studies have focused on the relationship between religiosity and personality disorders. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between religiosity domains and pathological traits of the borderline (BPD) and schizotypal (SZPD) personality disorders. METHODS: Participants were 751 adults from the general population who answered the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being (MI-RSWB-E), the Attachment to God Inventory (AGI), and factors of the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). Pearson's correlation and regression analysis were conducted with pathological traits as independent variables and religiosity domains as dependent variables. RESULTS: Correlation and regression analyses indicated slightly higher associations between religiosity domain and BPD traits in comparison to SZPD traits. BPD traits showed higher associations with the hope immanent, forgiveness and hope transcendent domains, while SZPD presented higher associations with connectedness. The SZPD-related paranormality factor presented the highest correlation observed in the study and was the best SZPD predictor of religiosity domains. The BPD-related hopelessness factor was the predictor with significant contribution to most regression models. BPD traits presented slightly higher average association with religiosity domains, whereas spiritual-related domains (e.g., connectedness) tended to show higher associations with SZPD traits. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings help explain the relationship between specific pathological traits and religiosity domains.","Carvalho, Lucas de Francisco; Sagradim, Daniele Elvira Vaz; Pianowski, Giselle; Gonçalves, André Pereira",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,320,1

Measures adopted to mitigate risk from the pandemic have had severe impacts on tourism, remittances, and international trade, among other aspects of the political economy of the region, and are thus impacting on food systems, food security and livelihoods. Of particular concern will be the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these challenging times. The great diversity among Pacific Island Countries and Territories in their economies, societies, and agricultural potential will be an important guide to planning interventions and developing scenarios of alternative futures. Bolstering regional production and intraregional trade in a currently import-dependent region could strengthen the regional economy, and provide the health benefits of consuming locally produced and harvested fresh foods - as well as decreasing reliance on global supply chains. However, significant production, processing, and storage challenges remain and would need to be consistently overcome to influence a move away from shelf-stable foods, particularly during periods when human movement is restricted and during post-disaster recovery.","Farrell, Penny; Thow, Anne Marie; Wate, Jillian Tutuo; Nonga, Nichol; Vatucawaqa, Penina; Brewer, Tom; Sharp, Michael K; Farmery, Anna; Trevena, Helen; Reeve, Erica; Eriksson, Hampus; Gonzalez, Itziar; Mulcahy, Georgina; Eurich, Jacob G; Andrew, Neil L",Food Secur,320,26

The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures.

Early sequencing of the viral genome and knowledge from past coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS) has led to rapid advances in knowledge of how the virus spreads and infects human hosts. Unfortunately, advancing knowledge has not yet produced a treatment that substantially lowers morbidity or mortality and only recently resulted in the development of a vaccine that prevents severe disease. Mounting evidence supports the notion that dietary supplementation of key essential nutrients may contribute to the body's defenses against infection as well as bolster the body's responses to infection. Evidence supporting the potential beneficial roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and B3 vitamins is reviewed here, revealing a combination of basic research elucidating underlying mechanisms of action, preclinical studies and human intervention studies has led to the proliferation of registered clinical trials on COVID-19.

We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the structural basis for their potent neutralizing activity remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG-form or in both IgG-form and Fab-form bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBDs in the “up” conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of a large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides a structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and its correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","Renhong, Yan Wang Ruoke Ju Bin Yu Jinfang Zhang Yuanyuan Liu Nan Wang Jia Zhang Qi Chen Peng Zhou Bing Li Yaning Shen Yaping Zhang Shuyuan Long Tian Guo Yingying Lu Xia Zhong Xinyue Cheng Lin Ge Xiangyang Zhao Juanjuan Hong-Wei Wang Wang Xinquan Zhang Zheng Zhang Linqi Zhou Qiang",Cell Research,320,16

METHODS: Using data from 96 out of 167 health facilities offering ART services, we compared four ART program indicators: (1) count of HIV visits; (2) proportion of ART dispenses in community-based settings (DAC); (3) proportion of multi-month dispensing of ART medications > 6 months (> 6 m MMD); and (4) proportion of timely ART refills. We used uncontrolled interrupted time series (ITS) models to estimate slope and level changes in each indicator with the arrival of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From week 1 to week 16, the average number of HIV visits fell from 121.5 to 92.5 visits, the proportion of DAC rose from 22.7% to 36.7%, the proportion of > 6 m MMD rose from 29.4% to 48.4%, and the proportion of timely ART refills fell from 51.9% to 43.8%. The ITS models estimated abrupt increases of 36% in > 6 m MMD (p < 0.001) and 37% in DAC (p < 0.001) at the time of COVID-19 arrival, and no change after arrival of COVID-19. The was an abrupt decline of 18% in timely ART refills with the arrival of COVID-19 and a decline of 1% per week thereafter, both non-statistically significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: The sudden changes in HIV service utilization represent dramatic adaptations needed to mitigate primary and secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV.

The Seattle Washington metropolitan area was one of the first in the United States affected by the pandemic. As a result, the anatomic pathology services at the University of Washington experienced significant changes in operational volumes early in the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and both state and institutional policies implemented to mitigate viral transmission (including institutional policies on non-urgent procedures) on anatomic pathology volumes. DESIGN: Accessioned specimens from January 2020 to June 2020 was evaluated as COVID-19 and institutional policies changed. The data were considered in these contexts: subspecialty, billable CPT codes, and intraoperative consultation. Comparable data were retrieved from 2019 as a historical control. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall accessioned volume (up to 79%) from pre-pandemic levels, during bans on non-urgent procedures when compared to 2020 pre- COVID-19 volumes and historical controls. The gastrointestinal and dermatopathology services were most impacted, while breast and combined head&neck/pulmonary services were least impacted. CPT code 88305, for smaller/biopsy specimens, had a 63% reduction during non-urgent procedure bans. After all bans on procedures were lifted, the overall volume plateaued at 89% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease in specimen volume was most strongly associated with bans on non-urgent procedures. While all departmental areas had a decrease in volume, the extent of change varied across subspecialty and specimen types. Even with removing all bans, service volume did not reach pre-pandemic levels.","Miller, Timothy Isaac; Smith, Kelly D; Gonzalez-Cuyar, Luis Francisco; Swanson, Paul E",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

A sample of 53 adolescents and 239 parents completed the survey. Adolescents were ages 13-18 years old (45.3% female). Most parents were between 35 and 55 years old (84.9% female). While 53.6% of the parents reported no positive effects of the lockdown, 92.5% of the adolescents expressed favorable consequences. The increased time spent with family members was judged positively by 27.2% of parents and by 64.2% of adolescents. Concern for their child's disability was expressed by 47.3% of parents, while 73.6% of adolescents expressed concerns regarding the ban on meeting friends.

We summarize some of the effects of lockdown orders on clients, family caregivers, and staff of adult day service programs throughout the United States, which may serve as a counterpoint to scientific evidence suggesting a lack of efficacy of these programs. Given the ramifications of state lockdown orders for users and staff of the long-term services and support system, we provide recommendations to better support community-based programs and those they serve. Specifically, (1) adult day programs should be classified as essential, (2) a focus on the value of adult day and similar programs is needed, and (3) an exploration of new ways to finance home and community-based services is warranted. Such advances in policy and science would help to integrate adult day services more effectively into the broader health care landscape.","Gaugler, Joseph E; Marx, Katherine; Dabelko-Schoeny, Holly; Parker, Lauren; Anderson, Keith A; Albers, Elizabeth; Gitlin, Laura N",J Am Med Dir Assoc,320,20

The COVID-19 represents a global concern of public health caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in which there is not actually any specific therapy. MSCs exert an immunomodulation effect due to the secretion of endogenous factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11.

We aimed to determine the impact of the lockdown on physical activity levels (PAL) in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Starting in May 2018, we are conducting an observational study with a 1-year follow-up on PAL in patients from 4 hemodialysis clinics in New York City. Patients active in the study as of March 22, 2020, were included. PAL was defined by steps taken per day measured by a wrist-based monitoring device (Fitbit Charge 2). Average steps/day were calculated for January 1 to February 13, 2020, and then weekly from February 14 to June 30. RESULTS: 42 patients were included. Their mean age was 55 years, 79% were males, and 69% were African Americans. Between January 1 and February 13, 2020, patients took on average 5,963 (95% CI 4,909-7,017) steps/day. In the week prior to the mandated lockdown, when a national emergency was declared, and in the week of the shutdown, the average number of daily steps had decreased by 868 steps/day (95% CI 213-1,722) and 1,222 steps/day (95% CI 668-2300), respectively. Six patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Five of them exhibited significantly higher PAL in the 2 weeks prior to showing COVID-19 symptoms compared to COVID-19 negative patients. CONCLUSION: Lockdown measures were associated with a significant decrease in PAL in hemodialysis patients. Patients who contracted COVID-19 had higher PAL during the incubation period. Methods to increase PAL while allowing for social distancing should be explored and implemented.","Han, Maggie; Preciado, Priscila; Thwin, Ohnmar; Tao, Xia; Tapia-Silva, Leticia M; Fuentes, Lemuel Rivera; Hakim, Mohamad; Patel, Amrish; Tisdale, Lela; Zhang, Hanjie; Kotanko, Peter",Blood Purif,320,16

The aim of this review is to provide a clinical approach of SARS-CoV-2 neurological complications based on the direct or indirect (systemic/immune-mediated) role of the SARS-CoV-2 in their genesis. Methods: A review of the current literature has been carried out up to May 20th 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines. All case series and reports of adult neurological manifestations associated to SARS-CoV-2 published in English were considered. Review and fundamental research studies on Coronaviruses neuroinvasive potential were analyzed to support pathogenic hypothesis and possible underlying mechanisms. Clinical patterns were subdivided into three groups according to putative underlying mechanisms: direct invasion of central or peripheral nervous system, systemic disorders leading to acute CNS injuries and post-infectious neurological syndromes (PINS). Results: Sixteen case series and 26 case reports for a total of 903 patients were identified presenting with neurological involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hypo/anosmia and dys/ageusia were found in 826 patients and mainly attributed to direct viral invasion. Cerebrovascular complications occurred in 51 patients and related to viral infection associated systemic inflammation. PINS were described in only 26 patients. A wide heterogeneity of these reports emerged concerning the extension of the clinical examination and ancillary exams performed. Conclusions: Neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly related to olfactory and gustatory sensory perception disorders through possible direct nervous system invasion while cerebrovascular disease and PINS are rare and due to distinct and indirect pathophysiological mechanisms.","Scoppettuolo, Pasquale; Borrelli, Serena; Naeije, Gilles","Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health",320,21

METHODS: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1017 residents of Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, sex, and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among five policies restricting local movement and four border control policies) they would support in five randomly assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics, and perceived policy effectiveness. RESULTS: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies but was generally higher for border control policies compared with internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies, while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher-income, and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.","Ozdemir, Semra; Tan, Si Ning Germaine; Chaudhry, Isha; Malhotra, Chetna; Finkelstein, Eric Andrew",Patient,320,1

How open public innovation cases generated public value to the society during the COVID-19 crises in Spain? Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on two in-depth case studies of open innovation in the public sector: the collaborative platform Frena la Curva and the hackathon Vence al Virus, both launched during the first moments of the COVID-19 crisis The methodology is based on 13 semi-structured interviews, content observation and documentary analysis The data were interpreted according to the dimensions described in the analytical framework: descriptive dimensions of both initiatives but also their degree of elaboration, incentives and objectives, characteristics of governance and collaboration between actors and challenges for the accountability processes;and finally, their procedural legitimacy, considering the COVID-19 crisis context Findings: The results of the study show that citizens have played a key role during the hardest stage of the crisis, collaborating with governments and advancing their innovative capabilities, mostly in the digital sphere The analysis also identified different outcomes, including the improvement of citizen’s involvement, deliberation practices or network building Besides, this paper has identified some limitations and barriers to open innovation and collaborative governance processes in terms of accountability and legitimacy of these initiatives Here, their contribution was constrained by the emerging stage of implementation and by the unique circumstances of the lockdown under the COVID-19 crisis Research limitations/implications: Future advancements of open innovation initiatives to consolidate collaborative governance processes will need further exploration Although this paper diversified the contacts and the data collection in the fieldwork to avoid social biases, the results of the interviews might reflect very positive outcomes Despite the case studies that took place during the COVID-19 crisis and their planned actions to maintain their existence, the post-crisis analysis will be needed to assess the impact of these open innovation cases in collaborative governance structures Practical implications: Open innovation is an emerging narrative and practice in the public sector requiring time and energy from public officials and managers The study also highlighted the problem of how to legitimate open innovation cases in the public sector and the implications for their institutionalization Public managers involved in these types of initiatives need to keep the momentum both inside and outside their organizations Regarding the utilization of information and communications technologies (ICTs), open innovation processes do not need technology to develop their full potential, whereas the COVID-19 crisis and the ongoing digitalization of work settings, accessibility, etc , could transform ICTs into a critical tool for public managers leading innovation initiatives within their organizations Social implications: The social implications of this paper are manifold This study provides evidence of one of the future avenues of public management: open innovation New avenues for the involvement and collaboration of citizens with public authorities are another social implication pinpointed by this paper Democratic legitimacy and procedural accountability are assessed using the open innovation case studies during the COVID-19 crisis Finally, transforming governments using collaborative platforms deserves social oversight understanding if they really contribute to build trust in political institutions Originality/valu : Despite their differences, both Frena la Curva and Vence al Virus demonstrated the potential and limitations of public innovation and collaborative governance to cope with an unprecedented crisis such as the COVID-19 The special features of this emergency, including the long period of confinement, posed challenges and also opportunities to develop these initiatives: as several interviewees stated, these projects helped to channel the civic energy to co-produce solutions in collaboration with a wide range of actors Data allow us to identify the key features of collaborative governance that guided open innovation initiatives in the Spanish public sector during the COVID-19 crisis © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Criado, J.

Thus, this study examined the effect of Information Literacy Competency (ILC) in curtailing the spread of fake news among Library and Information Science (LIS) undergraduates in Nigeria.Design/methodology/approachSurvey research design of the descriptive type was used to generate data from a group of LIS undergraduates online. The population of the study consisted of 138 LIS undergraduate students who participated in the survey (thus, n = 138). The data retrieved was subjected to descriptive analysis.FindingsThe study revealed that the students had high level of ILC (x ¯ = 3.42), and there was low prevalence level of COVID-19 pandemic fake news (x ¯ = 2.35) among them. The major causes of COVID-19 fake news were too much information in circulation concerning COVID-19 (x ¯ = 3.44) and the resultant inability to discern or spot fake news from verified and authentic news (x ¯ = 3.28). The study also revealed that ILC had a significant effect in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 fake news with a grand mean of 3.28 against the criterion mean of 2.5. It is implied that LIS undergraduates are educationally position to acquire ILC which is crucial to their identification of fake news and helps to curtail its spread.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited in its use of online group for data elicitation within a limited period of three weeks. Also, in its adoption of self-evaluation scale to measure ILC instead of standard information literacy test. Also, the high chances of social desirability bias in sections C and E serve as a limitation to the study.Practical implicationsThe study reinforces the need to enhance structures that flags fake news on social media platforms and integrating IL into schools’ curriculum at all levels.Originality/valueThis study seeks to pioneer a new area of focus on the relevance of ILC to different global issues that concern the health and well-being.","Magnus Osahon, Igbinovia Omorodion Okuonghae Adebayo John Oluwaseye",Reference Services Review,320,25

To separate the effects of chronological age and birth cohort from biological age, longitudinal studies investigating the associations of GDF15 levels with adverse health outcomes are needed. We investigated changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years in an age-stratified sample of the general population and their relation to the risk of acute hospitalization and death. Serum levels of GDF15 were measured three times in 5-year intervals in 2176 participants aged 30, 40, 50, or 60 years from the Danish population-based DAN-MONICA cohort. We assessed the association of single and repeated GDF15 measurements with the risk of non-traumatic acute hospitalizations. We tested whether changes in GDF15 levels over 10 years differed according to the frequency of hospitalizations within 2 years or survival within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement. The change in GDF15 levels over time was dependent on age and sex. Higher GDF15 levels and a greater increase in GDF15 levels were associated with an increased risk of acute hospitalization in adjusted Cox regression analyses. Participants with more frequent admissions within 2 years, and those who died within 20 years, after the last GDF15 measurement already had elevated GDF15 levels at baseline and experienced greater increases in GDF15 levels during the study. The change in GDF15 levels was associated with changes in C-reactive protein and biomarkers of kidney, liver, and cardiac function. Monitoring of GDF15 starting in middle-aged could be valuable for the prediction of adverse health outcomes.","Tavenier, Juliette; Andersen, Ove; Nehlin, Jan O; Petersen, Janne",Geroscience,320,21

METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, observational study. All consecutive patients admitted with primary diagnosis of ischemic/ hemorrhagic stroke between March1st -May10th 2020 were included and compared with the same time period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 41.9% increase in stroke admissions in 2020 (148 vs 210,P = .001). When comparing all ischemic strokes, higher rate of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (18.3% vs 33.8%,P = .008) and significant delay in initiation of mechanical thrombectomy after hospital arrival (67.75 vs 104.30 minutes,P = .001) was observed in 2020. When comparing all hemorrhagic strokes, there were no differences between the two years. Among 591 COVID-19 admissions, 31 (5.24%) patients with stroke including 19 with ischemic (3.21%) and 12 with hemorrhagic stroke (2.03%) were identified. Patients with COVID-19 and ischemic stroke were significantly younger (58.74 vs 48.11 years,P = .002), predominantly male (68.18% vs 94.74%,P = .016), had lesser vascular risk factors, had more severe clinical presentation (NIHSS 7.01 vs 17.05,P < .001), and higher rate of LVO (23.6% vs. 63.1%,P = .006). There was no difference in the rate of endovascular thrombectomy, but time to groin puncture was significantly longer in COVID-19 patients (83.41 vs 129.50 minutes,P = .003). For hemorrhagic stroke, COVID-19 patients did not differ from non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke continues to occur during this pandemic and stroke pathways have been affected by the pandemic. Stroke occurs in approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 associated ischemic stroke occurs in predominantly male patients who are younger, with fewer vascular risk factors, can be more severe, and have higher rates of LVO. Despite an increase in LVO during the pandemic, treatment with mechanical thrombectomy has not increased.

Behavioural changes in human activities/responses are indispensable for achieving the interdependent SDGs. Using root cause analysis approach, we have developed a yearly assessment framework for viably analysing and identifying requisite region-specific downstream/upstream socio-economic policies to reach the SDGs. The framework makes use of an infographic bar chart representation based on the normalised values of 20 human activity/impact parameters classified under three categories as - negative, limiting and positive. With a holistic view encompassing the SDGs, we illustrate through this framework the impact and urgent need of region-specific human behavioural reforms. This framework enables the foresight about policies regarding their potential in bringing down the negative parameter values to the desired zero level for accomplishing the SDGs through planetary health.","Banerjee, Pradipta; Choudhury, Subhrabrata",,320,20

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly impacted PR programs and their delivery to patients. Owing to fears of viral transmission and resultant outbreaks of COVID-19, institution-based PR programs have been forced to significantly reduce enrolment or in some cases completely shut down during the pandemic. As a majority of COPD patients are elderly and have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, they are notably susceptible to severe complications of COVID-19. As such, patients have been advised to stay at home and avoid social contact to the maximum extent possible. This has increased patients' vulnerability to physical deconditioning, depression, and social isolation. To address this major gap in care, some traditional hospital or clinic-centered PR programs have converted some or all of their learning contents to home-based telerehabilitation during the pandemic. There are, however, some significant barriers to this approach that have impeded its implementation in the community. These include variable access and use of technology (by patients), a lack of standardization of methods and tools for evaluation of the program, and inadequate training and resources for health professionals in optimally delivering telerehabilitation to patients. There is a pressing need for high-quality studies on these modalities of PR to enable the successful implementation of PR at home and via teleconferencing technologies. Here, we highlight the importance of telerehabilitation of patients with COPD in the post-COVID world and discuss various strategies for clinical implementation.","Tsutsui, Mai; Gerayeli, Firoozeh; Sin, Don D",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,320,1

National testing initially focused on symptomatic care home residents, before extending to asymptomatic cohorts. AIM: The aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission of COVID-19 in outbreak free care homes. METHODS: A two-point prevalence survey of COVID-19, in 34 Liverpool care homes, was performed in April and May 2020. Changes in prevalence were analysed. Associations between care home characteristics, reported infection, prevention and control interventions, and COVID-19 status were described and analysed. FINDINGS: No resident developed COVID-19 symptoms during the study. There was no significant difference between: the number of care homes containing at least one test positive resident between the first (17.6%, 95%CI 6.8-34.5) and second round (14.7%, 95%CI 5.0-31.1) of testing (p>0.99); and the number of residents testing positive between the first (2.1%, 95%CI 1.2-3.4) and second round (1.0%, 95%CI 0.5-2.1) of testing (p=0.11). Care homes providing nursing care (RR 7.99, 95%CI 1.1-57.3) and employing agency staff (RR 8.4, 95%CI 1.2-60.8) were more likely to contain test positive residents. Closing residents shared space was not associated with residents testing positive (RR 2.63, 95%CI 0.4-18.5). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic COVID-19 care homes showed no evidence of disease transmission or development of outbreaks; suggesting that current infection prevention and control measures are effective in preventing transmission. Repeat testing at 2-3 weeks had limited or no public health benefits over regular daily monitoring of staff and residents for symptoms. These results should inform policies calling for regular testing of asymptomatic residents.","Green, R; Tulloch, J S P; Tunnah, C; Coffey, E; Lawrenson, K; Fox, A; Mason, J; Barnett, R; Constantine, A; Shepherd, W; Ashton, M; Beadsworth, M B J; Vivancos, R; Hall, I; Walker, N; Ghebrehewet, S",J. hosp. infect,320,11

Here, we reported the immune response of 76 frontline medical workers and 152 controls from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. The frontline medical workers were involved in the care for Wuhan COVID-19 patients from February 8 to March 31, 2020 in Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The controls were medical workers of our hospital who had not been in contact with COVID-19 patients during the same period. Demographic and clinical data, including routine blood test data were extracted from the electronic health examination record and retrospectively analyzed. The post-stress frontline medical workers had higher lymphocyte (LYM) count compared with controls or pre-stress. However, the post-stress frontline medical workers had lower monocyte (MONO) count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and neutrophil (NEUT) ratio than controls or pre-stress.

We derive a hyperdegree-based mean-field equation to describe the contagion dynamics, and illustrate its applicability with the example of a hypergraph where contagion is mediated by both links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We consider two different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and healing, and the cases where links and triangles connect preferentially to the same nodes, or are chosen independently of each other. We find that, when links and triangles are chosen independently, heterogeneity in the link degree distribution can suppress explosive transitions. In addition, explosive transitions are more likely to occur when node and triangle connections are positively correlated when compared to the case when they are chosen independently of each other. We verify these results with microscopic simulations of the contagion process and with analytic predictions derived from the mean-field model. Our results show that the structure of higher-order interactions can have important effects on contagion processes on hypergraphs.","Landry, Nicholas; Restrepo, Juan G.",,320,19

The level of vulnerability was measured through a Weighted Scoring Method (WSM), which considered various aspects that set Rusunawa apart, such as elderly population, occupancy rate, overcrowding, the number of confirmed positive cases in an area, access to clean water service and jobs vulnerable to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results showed that each of the Rusunawa had different levels of vulnerability, which was categorized into 4 clusters: Most Vulnerable (Dupak Bangunrejo and Siwalankerto), Vulnerable (Wonorejo, Pesapen, Jambangan and Dukuh Menanggal), Slightly Vulnerable (Penjaringansari, Keputih and Bandarejo) and Least Vulnerable (Romokalisari, Gununganyar and Tambak Wedi). Dupak Bangunrejo Rusunawa was identified to be one of the most vulnerable Rusunawa towards COVID-19 transmission in comparison to other Rusunawa due to a high amount of older people, high occupancy rate and population density. In contrast, Siwalankerto Rusunawa was caused due to a higher amount older people in conjunction with its residents working in job sectors vulnerable to the virus and the number of confirmed COVID--19 positive case in its area.","Septanaya, I.

This study reports the volume of surgical activity and the number of cancelled surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used hospital episode statistics for all adult patients undergoing surgery between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 in England and Wales. We identified surgical procedures using a previously published list of procedure codes. Procedures were stratified by urgency of surgery as defined by NHS England. We calculated the deficit of surgical activity by comparing the expected number of procedures from 2016 to 2019 with the actual number of procedures in 2020. Using a linear regression model, we calculated the expected cumulative number of cancelled procedures by December 31, 2021. RESULTS: The total number of surgical procedures carried out in England and Wales in 2020 was 3 102 674 compared with the predicted number of 4 671 338 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 218 740-5 123 932). This represents a 33.6% reduction in the national volume of surgical activity. There were 763 730 emergency surgical procedures (13.4% reduction) compared with 2 338 944 elective surgical procedures (38.6% reduction). The cumulative number of cancelled or postponed procedures was 1 568 664 (95% CI: 1 116 066-2 021 258). We estimate that this will increase to 2 358 420 (95% CI: 1 667 587-3 100 808) up to December 31, 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of surgical activity in England and Wales was reduced by 33.6% in 2020, resulting in more than 1.5 million cancelled operations. This deficit will continue to grow in 2021.","Dobbs, Thomas D; Gibson, John A G; Fowler, Alex J; Abbott, Tom E; Shahid, Tasnin; Torabi, Fatemeh; Griffiths, Rowena; Lyons, Ronan A; Pearse, Rupert M; Whitaker, Iain S",Br J Anaesth,320,16

However, the effect of DCT on pandemic mitigation remains to be demonstrated. Objective: To estimate key populations and performance indicators along the exposure notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app in a clearly defined regional and temporal context. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study was based on a simulation informed by measured data from issued quarantine recommendations and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results after DCT exposure notifications in the canton of Zurich. A stochastic model was developed to re-create the DCT notification cascade for Zurich. Population sizes at each cascade step were estimated using triangulation based on publicly available administrative and observational research data for the study duration from September 1 to October 31, 2020. The resultant estimates were checked for internal consistency and consistency with upstream or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic sampling from data-informed parameter distributions was performed to explore the robustness of results. Subsequently, key performance indicators were evaluated to assess the potential contribution of DCT compared with manual contact tracing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receiving a voluntary quarantine recommendation and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result after exposure notification. Results: In September 2020, 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in Zurich, 324 of whom received and entered an upload authorization code. This code triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 (95% simulation interval [SI], 932-2586) proximity contacts and led to 722 information hotline calls, with an estimated 170 callers (95% SI, 154-186) receiving a quarantine recommendation. An estimated 939 (95% SI, 720-1127) notified app users underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 30 (95% SI, 23-36) had positive results after an app notification. Key indicator evaluations revealed that the DCT app triggered quarantine recommendations for the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. For every 10.9 (95% SI, 7.6-15.6) upload authorization codes entered in the app, 1 contact had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 after app notification. Longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrated bottlenecks in the notification cascade, because capacity limits were reached owing to an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation study of the notification cascade of the SwissCovid DCT app, receipt of exposure notifications was associated with quarantine recommendations and identification of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. These findings in notified proximity contacts reflect important intermediary steps toward transmission prevention.","Menges, D.; Aschmann, H. E.; Moser, A.; Althaus, C.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on a web-based survey applied to physiotherapists living in Portugal. The survey included sociodemographic, health status and clinical practice questions. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (personal, work- and patient-related burnout), the Resilience Scale, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. RESULTS: A total of 511 physiotherapists (median 33 years old, 82% females) completed the survey. The participants worked mainly in private practice (50%) and wards (35%). During COVID-19, 52% were working directly with patients, but only 18% were working with COVID-19 patients. Personal (42%), work- (42%) and patient-related burnout (25%) was observed. Three significant models explained personal- (R2 = 51%), work- (R2 = 31%) and patient-related burnout (R2 = 16%). Lower levels of resilience and higher levels of depression and stress were significantly associated with personal, work- and patient-related burnout. Being female and working directly with patients were additionally associated with both personal and work-related burnout. Having health problems and working with COVID-19 patients were only associated with personal burnout. CONCLUSIONS: More than 40% of physiotherapists experienced personal and work-related burnout and 25% patient-related burnout, with resilience, depression and stress having a relevant role in the three burnout dimensions. Early detection and management strategies need to be implemented to address physiotherapists' physical and psychological fatigue and exhaustion.","Jácome, Cristina; Seixas, Adérito; Serrão, Carla; Teixeira, Andreia; Castro, Luísa; Duarte, Ivone",Physiother Res Int,320,4

Methods: The literature at home and abroad on the treatment of ONFH with vascularized bone grafting was reviewed, and the mechanism, operating methods and effectiveness, indications, and complications were summarized. Results: Vascularized bone grafting is a commonly used clinical hip-preserving operation. By replacing necrotic bone tissue with vascularized bone, it can rebuild the blood circulation system, promote the healing of the necrotic area, and provide biomechanical support for the necrotic area of the femoral head, prevent the joint surface collapse. The main operations include the vascularized iliac bone flap grafting, the vascularized greater trochanter bone flap grafting, and the vascularized fibular grafting. The clinical application has achieved certain effectiveness, and the different procedures are suitable for different types of patients. The procedures need to be selected based on the patient's overall condition, the cause of ONFH, the necrosis stage, and the degree of the evaluation. Conclusion: Vascularized bone grafting has a definite effectiveness in the treatment of ONFH in the young and middle-aged.

GRP78 acts as a sensor of endoplasmic reticulum stress and is an essential chaperone required for the life cycle of all mammalian viruses. We and others previously demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that AR12 increases autophagosome formation and autophagic flux, enhances virus protein degradation, preventing virus reproduction, and prolonging the survival of infected animals. In this report, we determined whether AR12 could act against SARS-CoV-2. In a dose-dependent fashion AR12 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in transfected or infected cells. AR12 suppressed the production of infectious virions via autophagosome formation, which was also associated with degradation of GRP78. After AR12 exposure, the colocalization of GRP78 with spike protein was reduced. Knock down of eIF2&#945; prevented AR12-induced spike degradation and knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 caused the spike protein to localize in LAMP2+ vesicles without apparent degradation. HCT116 cells expressing ATG16L1 T300, found in the majority of persons of non-European descent, particularly from Africa, expressed greater amounts of GRP78 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 compared to ATG16L1 A300, predominantly found in Europeans, suggestive that ATG16L1 T300 expression may be associated with a greater ability to be infected and to reproduce SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that AR12 represents a clinically relevant anti-viral drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Rayner, Jonathan O; Roberts, Rosemary A; Kim, Jin; Poklepovic, Andrew; Roberts, Jane L; Booth, Laurence; Dent, Paul",Biochem Pharmacol,320,20

Plerixafor and Pradimicin A have a glide score of -3.7 kcal/mol and -2.4 kcal/mol, respectively, which is lower than the co-crystallized ligand with a glide score of -5.3 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics confirmed that the ligands maintained their interaction with the protein with lower RMSD fluctuations over the trajectory period of 100 nsecs and that GLU166 residue is pivotal for binding. On the whole, present study specifies the repurposing aptitude of these molecules as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with higher binding scores and forms energetically stable complexes with Mpro.

We discuss the potential risk of transmission and potential improvements. Methods We investigated and described the air circulation into GI endoscopes proposed by companies (Fujifilm©,Olympus©, Pentax ©). Results The light source box contains a lamp, either Xenon or LED. The temperature of light is high and is regulated by aforced-air cooling system to maintain a stable temperature in the middle of the box. The air used by the forced-air coolingsystem is sucked from the closed environment of the patient through an aeration port, located close to the light source andevacuated out of the box by one or two ventilators. No filter existed to avoid the dispersion of particles outside of theprocessor box. The light source box also contains an insufflation air pump. The air is sucked from the light source boxthrough one or two holes of the air pump and pushed from the air pump into the air pipe of the endoscope through a plastictube. As the air pump did not had no dedicated HEPA filter, microorganisms transmission cannot be excluded. Conclusions Changes are necessary to prevent airborne transmission: exclusive use of an external CO2 pump andwrapping the endoscope platform by a plastic film that will limit microorganism scattering. In the era of pandemic virus withairborne transmission, improvement of GI ventilation system are necessary to avoid patients and health care workerscontamination.","Chaussade, S.; Abou Ali, E.; Hallit, R.; Belle, A.; Barret, M.; Coriat, R.",Endoscopy,320,26

Thus, it is also important to explore how loneliness relates to the regulation of psychological needs. This study aims to explore the relationships between loneliness, symptomatology, and the regulation of psychological needs. 142 individuals (M age=32.7, SD=10.9), answered self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Results show that loneliness is positively correlated with symptomatology and difficulties in the regulation of psychological needs, with these relationships being mediated by psychological distress and psychological well-being.

The main aim of this study was to analyse the impact of lockdown (imposed in March and continued in April 2020) on the existing air quality in three megacities of India (Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata) by assessing the trends of PM10 and NO2 concentrations. A comparison of the percentage reduction in concentrations of lockdown period with respect to same period in year 2019 and pre-lockdown period (February 14-March 24) was made. It was observed from the study that an overall decrease of pollutant concentrations was in the ranges of 30-60% and 52-80% of PM10 and NO2, respectively, in the three cities during lockdown in comparison with previous year and pre-lockdown period. The overall decrease in concentrations of pollutants at urban sites was greater than the background sites. Highest decline in concentrations of PM10 were observed in Kolkata city, followed by Mumbai and Delhi, while decline in NO2 was highest in Mumbai. Results also highlighted that capital city Delhi had the worst air quality amongst three cities, with particulate matter (PM10) being the dominant pollutant. Although COVID-19 has significantly affected the human life considering the mortality and morbidity, lockdowns imposed to control the pandemic had significantly improved the air quality in the selected study locations, although for the short amount of period.","Ganguly, Rajiv; Sharma, Divyansh; Kumar, Prashant",Environ Dev Sustain,320,1

In the first patient, LUS revealed extensive atelectatic areas. A recruitment maneuver was applied, resulting in some reaeration of areas that showed atelectasis, and some improvement in oxygenation was observed. Oxygenation improved further with the use of prone positioning. In the second patient, LUS showed diffuse abnormalities without atelectatic areas, and ventilation proceeded without a recruitment maneuver but with prone positioning. These two cases illustrate how LUS could be useful in identifying different lung morphologies early after the start of invasive ventilation and help decide on adjunctive therapies. This has possible implications for ventilator management in resource-limited settings, with limited availability of chest computed tomography and blood gas analyzers. Tailoring invasive ventilation based on LUS findings early after the start of invasive ventilation is feasible, but this should be further evaluated in future studies.","Pierrakos, Charalampos; Attou, Rachid; Iesu, Enrica; Baelongandi, Hugues; Honore, Patrick M; Bos, Lieuwe D J; Schultz, Marcus J; De Bels, David",Am J Trop Med Hyg,320,20

Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existing drugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need. Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression. Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis. Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients. Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage. Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde. More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesic and antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain. The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials.","El-Ashmawy, Nahla E; Lashin, Abdel-Halim A; Okasha, Kamal M; Abo Kamer, Amal M; Mostafa, Tarek M; El-Aasr, Mona; Goda, Ahmed E; Haggag, Yusuf A; Tawfik, Haytham O; Abo-Saif, Mariam A",Med Hypotheses,320,16

However, during such health disaster events, stakeholders tend to give more precedence to the socio-economic and biomedical health consequences at the expense of mental health. Meanwhile, studies show that regardless of the kind of disaster/antecedent, all traumatic events trigger similar post-traumatic stress symptoms among survivors, families, and frontline workers. Thus, our study investigated the prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among survivors of the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease that plagued the West African sub-region. METHODS: We systematically retrieved peer-reviewed articles published between 1970 and 2019 from seven electronic databases, including Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Springer Link, Web of Science on Ebola and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. A comprehensive hand search complemented this literature search. Of the 87 articles retrieved, only 13 met the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. RESULTS: After heterogeneity, influence, and publication bias analysis, our meta-analysis pooled proportion effects estimates showed a moderate to a high prevalence of anxiety (14%; 99% CI: 0.05-0.30), depression (15%; 99% CI: 0.11-0.21), and insomnia (22%; 99% CI: 0.13-0.36). Effect estimates ranging from (0.13; 99% CI: 0.05, 0.28) through to (0.11; 99% CI: 0.05-0.22), (0.15; 99% CI: 0.09-0.25) through to (0.13; 99% CI: 0.08-0.21) and (0.23; 99% CI: 0.11-0.41) to (0.23; 99% CI: 0.11-0.41) were respectively reported for anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. These findings suggest a significant amount of EVD survivors are struggling with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the first-ever meta-analysis evidence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms among EVD survivors, and suggest that the predominant biomedical health response to regional and global health disasters should be complemented with trauma-related mental health services.","Acharibasam, Jeremiah W; Chireh, Batholomew; Menegesha, Hayelom G",PLoS One,320,20

Unbiased transcriptome profiling is now widely used for a deeper understanding of a drug's mechanisms of action, off target effects, and cytotoxicity. Although currently available high-throughput RNA-Seq (HT RNA-Seq) methods such as PLATE-Seq, DRUG-Seq, and BRB-Seq serve these purposes, the inherent nature of these methods does not allow sample-wise sequencing library quality control. Here, we describe an HTR method called High-throughput CellulAr RNA Sequencing (HiCAR-Seq). HiCAR-Seq was optimized to work directly on cultured cells (as little as 1,000 cells) or 10 ng of total RNA. HiCAR-Seq involves reverse transcription from cultured cells or total RNA using oligo-dT primers followed by the PCR amplification of full-length cDNAs using sample-specific barcode primers in individual plate wells. Amplification of cDNA from every sample can be verified using Bioanalyzer. This step not only reveals cDNA amplification but also provides greater precision for pooling equal concentrations of cDNA from different samples. A single pooled cDNA library is made suitable for sequencing on Illumina sequencers using a tagmentation kit. Because HiCAR-Seq targets a small region at the 3' of the mRNAs, as little as 3 to 4 million reads/sample are enough to infer changes in gene expression in human or mouse cells. We believe that HiCAR-Seq represents a robust and competitive addition to the existing set of transcriptome-based high-throughput screening methods. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

COVID-19 is typically an acute self-limited disease that can rarely be fatal with a 5.6% case mortality rate (May, 2020), mainly due to substantial damage to pulmonary alveolar structures, and subsequent respiratory failure. Given the previous experience, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proven to be an effective therapy in the treatment of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). On the basis of similar principle, ECMO may also be an effective therapy in the treatment of severe COVID-19. However, due to huge cost, it is not common to apply ECMO continuously for a long time. We, herein, describe a COVID-19 pneumonia patient, a 77-year female, who was treated with ECMO for 26 days. The hospitalisation costs of the patient were highest in Jilin Province.","Zhang, Chi Shi Bo Ma HaiChun Dong NaiFu","JCPSP, Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan",320,5

This situation thus highlights the significance of balancing the economy with safety and health. Safety economics, considering the interdependencies between safety and micro-economics, is ideal for supporting this kind of decision-making. Although economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis have been used in safety management, little attention has been paid to the fundamental issues and the primary methodologies in safety economics. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic study on safety economics to analyze the foundational issues and explore the possible approaches. Firstly, safety economics is defined as a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research focusing on the interdependencies and coevolution of micro-economies and safety. Then we explore the role of safety economics in safety management and production investment. Furthermore, to make decisions more profitable, economic approaches are summarized and analyzed for decision-making about prevention investments and/or safety strategies. Finally, we discuss some open issues in safety economics and possible pathways to improve this research field, such as security economics, risk perception, and multi-criteria analysis.","Chen, Chao Reniers Genserik Khakzad Nima Yang Ming",Safety Science,320,26

With lower economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, we find that existing climate policy measures could overshoot the current 40% EU target in 2030. If policymakers consequently relax climate policy measures to maintain the 2030 target, the opportunity will be missed to align EU climate policy with longer-term Paris emissions mitigation goals. Our analysis highlights that although existing climate policy measures will likely reduce emissions more than 40% by 2030 in the wake of the pandemic, they will not be enough to meet the Paris agreement. More stringent measures, such as those proposed under the Green New Deal, will still be needed and may be less costly than previously estimated.","Meles, Tensay Hadush; Ryan, Lisa; Wheatley, Joe",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),320,20

Because wearing a mask mixes expired air with the subject's inspired air stream, the concentration of inspired carbon dioxide [CO2] is elevated, resulting in mild hypercapnia. Changes in the inspired gas mixture have been demonstrated to alter R2*-weighted Blood Oxygen Dependent (BOLD) contrast. In this study, we investigate a potential for face masking to alter BOLD contrast during a sensory-motor task designed to activate visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices in 8 subjects. We utilize a nasal cannula to supply air to the subject wearing a surgical mask in on-off blocks of 90s to displace expired CO2, while the subject performs the sensory-motor task. While only a small fraction (2.5%) of the sensory-motor task activation is related to nasal air modulation, a 30.0% change in gray matter BOLD signal baseline is found due to air modulation. Repeating the scan with mask removed produces a small subject-specific bias in BOLD baseline signal from nasal air supply, which may be due to cognitive influence of airflow or cannula-induced hypoxia. Measurements with capnography demonstrate wearing a mask induces an average increase in ETCO2 of 7.4%. Altogether, these results demonstrate that wearing a face mask during gradient-echo fMRI can alter BOLD baseline signal but minimally affects task activation.","Law, Christine S W; Lan, Patricia S; Glover, Gary H",Neuroimage,320,33

The physiopathology of this virus is very much in semblance with the previously known SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the unprecedented transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 has been puzzling the scientific efforts. Though the virus harbors much of the genetic and architectural features of SARS-CoV, a few differences acquired during its evolutionary selective pressure is helping the SARS-CoV-2 to establish prodigious infection. Making entry into host the cell through already established ACE-2 receptor concerted with the action of TMPRSS2, is considered important for the virus. During the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2, the innate immunity witnesses maximum dysregulations in its molecular network causing fatalities in aged, comorbid cases. The overt immunopathology manifested due to robust cytokine storm shows ARDS in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2. A delayed IFN activation gives appropriate time to the replicating virus to evade the host antiviral response and cause disruption of the adaptive response as well. We have compiled various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its unique structural features and ability to modulate innate as well adaptive response in host, aiming at understanding the dynamism of infection.","Minakshi, Rinki; Jan, Arif Tasleem; Rahman, Safikur; Kim, Jihoe",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,320,11

At the same time, the collapse of the boundaries between these domains imposed by the pandemic created unique opportunities for intersectoral planning and collaboration. While the challenge of integration is not unique to oncology, the organisation of cancer care and its linkages to palliative care and to global health may allow it to be a demonstration model for how the problem of integration can be addressed. Before the pandemic, the large majority of individuals with cancer in need of palliative care in low- and middle-income countries and the poor or marginalised in high-income countries were denied access. This inequity was highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals in impoverished or population-dense settings with weak health systems have been more likely to become infected and to have less access to medical care and to palliative and end-of-life care. Such inequities deserve attention by government, financial institutions and decision makers in health care. However, there has been no framework in most countries for integrated decision-making that takes into account the requirements of public health, clinical medicine and palliative and end-of-life care. Integrated planning across these domains at all levels would allow for more coordinated resource allocation and better preparedness for the inevitability of future systemic threats to population health.","Rodin, Gary; Zimmermann, Camilla; Rodin, Danielle; Al-Awamer, Ahmed; Sullivan, Richard; Chamberlain, Charlotte",Eur J Cancer,320,0

Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial to prevent the further spread of the disease and reduce its mortality. Chest Computed tomography (CT) is an effective tool for the early diagnosis of lung diseases including pneumonia. However, detecting COVID-19 from CT is demanding and prone to human errors as some early-stage patients may have negative findings on images. Recently, many deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance in this regard. Despite their effectiveness, most of these methods underestimate the rich spatial information preserved in the 3D structure or suffer from the propagation of errors. To address this problem, we propose a Dual-Attention Residual Network (DARNet) to automatically identify COVID-19 from other common pneumonia (CP) and healthy people using 3D chest CT images. Specifically, we design a dual-attention module consisting of channel-wise attention and depth-wise attention mechanisms. The former is utilized to enhance channel independence, while the latter is developed to recalibrate the depth-level features. Then, we integrate them in a unified manner to extract and refine the features at different levels to further improve the diagnostic performance. We evaluate DARNet on a large public CT dataset and obtain superior performance. Besides, the ablation study and visualization analysis prove the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method.","Shi, Jun; Yi, Huite; Ruan, Shulan; Wang, Zhaohui; Hao, Xiaoyu; An, Hong; Wei, Wei",,320,24

We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, to conduct rapid evidence synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control in 3 days. METHODS: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries (n=3), public agencies (n=6), multilateral institutions (n=3), COVID-19 resource aggregators (n=5) and preprints (n=1) (without language restrictions) for articles on CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles. Most of the evidence was from low-and middle-income countries with well-established CHW programmes. Evidence from CHW programmes initiated during pandemics and for CHW involvement in pandemic response in high-income countries was scant. CHW roles and tasks change substantially during pandemics. Clear guidance, training for changed roles and definition of what constitutes essential activities (ie, those that must to be sustained) is required. Most common additional activities during pandemics were community awareness, engagement and sensitisation (including for countering stigma) and contact tracing. CHWs were reported to be involved in all aspects of contact tracing - this was reported to affect routine service delivery. CHWs have often been stigmatised or been socially ostracised during pandemics. Providing PPE, housing allowance, equal training opportunities, transportation allowance, improving salaries (paid on time and for a broad range of services) and awards in high-profile public events contributed to better recruitment and retention. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). CONCLUSIONS: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being. More implementation research on CHWs in pandemics is required.","Bhaumik, Soumyadeep; Moola, Sandeep; Tyagi, Jyoti; Nambiar, Devaki; Kakoti, Misimi",,320,26

Many methods have already been proposed, particularly, to forecast reported cases and deaths at country-level and state-level. Many of these methods are based on traditional epidemiological model which rely on simulations or Bayesian inference to simultaneously learn many parameters at a time. This makes them prone to over-fitting and slow execution. We propose an extension to our model SIkJ$\alpha$ to forecast deaths and show that it can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. We also present an evaluation of our method against seven approaches currently being used by the CDC, based on their two weeks forecast at various times during the pandemic. We demonstrate that our method achieves better root mean squared error compared to these seven approaches during majority of the evaluation period. Further, on a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US.

The strategy relies on several vaccination activities, including preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). However, to what extent PMVCs are associated with a decreased risk of outbreak has not yet been quantified. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method to assess the association between the occurrence of yellow fever outbreaks and the implementation of PMVCs at the province level in the African endemic region. As all time-invariant confounders are implicitly controlled for in the SCCS method, this method is an alternative to classical cohort or case-control study designs when the risk of residual confounding is high, in particular confounding by indication. The locations and dates of outbreaks were identified from international epidemiological records, and information on PMVCs was provided by coordinators of vaccination activities and international funders. The study sample consisted of provinces that were both affected by an outbreak and targeted for a PMVC between 2005 and 2018. We compared the incidence of outbreaks before and after the implementation of a PMVC. The sensitivity of our estimates to a range of assumptions was explored, and the results of the SCCS method were compared to those obtained through a retrospective cohort study design. We further derived the number of yellow fever outbreaks that have been prevented by PMVCs. The study sample consisted of 33 provinces from 11 African countries. Among these, the first outbreak occurred during the pre-PMVC period in 26 (79%) provinces, and during the post-PMVC period in 7 (21%) provinces. At the province level, the post-PMVC period was associated with an 86% reduction (95% CI 66% to 94%, p < 0.001) in the risk of outbreak as compared to the pre-PMVC period. This negative association between exposure to PMVCs and outbreak was robustly observed across a range of sensitivity analyses, especially when using quantitative estimates of vaccination coverage as an alternative exposure measure, or when varying the observation period. In contrast, the results of the cohort-style analyses were highly sensitive to the choice of covariates included in the model. Based on the SCCS results, we estimated that PMVCs were associated with a 34% (95% CI 22% to 45%) reduction in the number of outbreaks in Africa from 2005 to 2018. A limitation of our study is the fact that it does not account for potential time-varying confounders, such as changing environmental drivers of yellow fever and possibly improved disease surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide new empirical evidence of the high preventive impact of PMVCs on yellow fever outbreaks. This study illustrates that the SCCS method can be advantageously applied at the population level in order to evaluate a public health intervention.","Jean, Kévin; Raad, Hanaya; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Hamlet, Arran; Mueller, Judith E; Hogan, Dan; Mengistu, Tewodaj; Whitaker, Heather J; Garske, Tini; Hocine, Mounia N",PLoS Med,320,28

There are many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities that affect disease severity. Since rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we investigated how such data from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients might be used to predict clinical outcomes. Methods: We thus investigated such clinical datasets from COVID-19 patients with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbour and deep learning methods. Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive patients and showed predictive value for later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We thus developed a number of analytic methods that showed accuracy and precision for disease severity and mortality outcome predictions that were above 90%. Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be optimised.","Aktar, Sakifa; Ahamad, Md.

We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders; myoneural junction and muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately); substance use disorder; and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. FINDINGS: Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33·62% (95% CI 33·17-34·07), with 12·84% (12·36-13·33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46·42% (44·78-48·09) and for a first diagnosis was 25·79% (23·50-28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0·56% (0·50-0·63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97-2·23) for ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08-0·14) for parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59-0·75) for dementia, 17·39% (17·04-17·74) for anxiety disorder, and 1·40% (1·30-1·51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2·66% (2·24-3·16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17-7·76) for ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15-0·45) for parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31-2·30) for dementia, 19·15% (17·90-20·48) for anxiety disorder, and 2·77% (2·31-3·33) for psychotic disorder. Most diagnostic categories were more common in patients who had COVID-19 than in those who had influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40-1·47, for any diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68-1·89, for any first diagnosis) and those who had other respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14-1·17, for any diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27-1·36, for any first diagnosis). As with incidences, HRs were higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 (eg, those admitted to ITU compared with those who were not: 1·58, 1·50-1·67, for any diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45-3·35, for any first diagnosis). Results were robust to various sensitivity analyses and benchmarking against the four additional index health events. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides evidence for substantial neurological and psychiatric morbidity in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection. Risks were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. This information could help in service planning and identification of research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, are needed to corroborate and explain these findings.

This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on construction project performance in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative and exploratory approach to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and its policies on project performance in the UAE construction industry in critical areas of the project management body of knowledge (e.g. schedule, cost, resources and contracts). Semi-structured interview questions were asked from ten construction professional to obtain valuable insights into the pandemic’s effects on the UAE construction industry and the effectiveness of policies implemented to rectify the damage and identify the industry’s new normal. Findings: The findings indicate that the construction industry faced several challenges such as schedule delays, disrupted cashflows, delayed permits, approvals and inspections, travel restrictions, serious health and safety concerns, material and equipment shortages, among others which hindered the timely delivery of construction projects. It also indicates that efforts made by the government institutions and the construction industry of the UAE such as economic support programs, digitization of processes, fee and fine waivers, health facilities, among other statutory relaxations proved effective in supporting the construction industry against the adverse effects of the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: The research findings are limited to the literature review and ten semi-structured interviews seeking an expert’s opinion from industry professionals working in the UAE construction industry. The research team did not get access to project documents, contracts and project progress reports which may be required to validate the interview findings, and to perform an in-depth analysis quantifying the impact of COVID 19 on construction projects performance, which is a limitation of this research. Practical implications: The implication is that, owing to the imposed lockdowns and strict precautionary measures to curb the rapid spread of the pandemic, smooth execution of the construction project across the country was affected. The government institutions and stakeholders of the construction projects introduced and implemented various techniques and solutions which effectively handled the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on the construction industry of the UAE. Originality/value: This study has identified the challenges faced by the construction industry of the UAE in the context of the management of project schedule, project cost, construction contracts, health and safety of construction employees and other related aspects of the construction projects. This study also identified the techniques and solutions adopted by various public and private institutions of the country and their implications on construction projects. Therefore, this study provides guidelines for policymakers and future research studies alike. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Sami Ur Rehman, M.; Shafiq, M.

There is also no information as to whether the expression of these mediators is altered in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or preterm birth. This is important because the expression of decidual and placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 across gestation may affect the susceptibility of pregnancies to vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern of specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cell entry genes, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2, in the placenta across human pregnancy and in paired samples of decidua and placenta in pregnancies complicated by preterm birth or preeclampsia compared with those in term uncomplicated pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, 2 separate cohorts of patients, totaling 87 pregnancies, were included. The first cohort was composed of placentae from first- (7-9 weeks), second- (16-18 weeks), and third-trimester preterm (26-31 weeks) and third-trimester term (38-41 weeks) pregnancies (n=5/group), whereas the second independent cohort included matched decidua and placentae from pregnancies from term uncomplicated pregnancies (37-41 weeks' gestation; n=14) and pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (26-37 weeks' gestation; n=11) or preeclampsia (25-37 weeks' gestation; n=42). Samples were subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing or RNA sequencing for next-generation RNA sequencing for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 mRNA expression quantification, respectively. RESULTS: In the first cohort, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2, exhibited a gestational age-dependent expression profile, that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 mRNA was higher (P<.05) in the first-trimester placenta than in second-trimester, preterm birth, and term placentae (P<.05) and exhibited a negative correlation with gestational age (P<.05). In the second cohort, RNA sequencing demonstrated very low or undetectable expression levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in preterm birth, preeclampsia, and term decidua and in placentae from late gestation. In contrast, transmembrane protease serine 2 was expressed in both decidual and placental samples but did not change in pregnancies complicated by either preterm birth or preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: The increased expression of these severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 cell entry-associated genes in the placenta in the first trimester of pregnancy compared with those in later stages of pregnancy suggests the possibility of differential susceptibility to placental entry to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 across pregnancy. Even though there is some evidence of increased rates of preterm birth associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, we found no increase in mRNA expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or transmembrane protease serine 2 at the maternal-fetal interface.","Bloise, Enrrico; Zhang, Jianhong; Nakpu, Jittanan; Hamada, Hirotaka; Dunk, Caroline E; Li, Siliang; Imperio, Guinever E; Nadeem, Lubna; Kibschull, Mark; Lye, Phetcharawan; Matthews, Stephen G; Lye, Stephen J",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,320,26

And such an effect much improves positive bias stability (PBS) and clockwise hysteresis stability to the same tendency. For NH2 and CF3 functional group SAMs with surface energies of 49.4 mJ/m2 and 23.5 mJ/m2, respectively, the IGZO TFT PBS was improved from 2.47 V to 0.32 V after the SAM treatment and the IGZO TFT clockwise hysteresis was also enhanced from 0.23 V to 0.11 V without any deterioration of TFT characteristics. Employing lower surface energy functional group to the SAM, of same head group and body group, does passivate and protect the IGZO backchannel region from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Consequently, the enhanced electrical stability of IGZO TFT can be achieved by the simple and economic SAM treatment.","Lee, Sung-Eun; Na, Hyunjae; Lee, Eun Goo; Park, Jintaek; Kim, Kyungho; Im, Changik; Park, Jun-Woo; Gong, Yong Jun; Kim, Youn Sang",,320,16

Drugs are generally well tolerated in clinical practice; however, both can cause corrected QT prolongation. We aimed to report our experience of QT interval evaluation associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine with concurrent azithromycin among children testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: Our single-centre; retrospective, study evaluated children with coronavirus disease 2019 disease admitted to the Pediatric Department at Sancaktepe Training and Research Hospital Istanbul, Turkey from 10 March, 2020 to 10 April, 2020.

During the crisis, the public's need for web-based information and communication is a subject of focus. Digital inequality research has shown that internet access is not evenly distributed among the general population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a timely understanding of how different people use the internet to meet their information and communication needs and the outcomes they gain from their internet use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to reveal the extent to which gender, age, personality, health, literacy, education, economic and social resources, internet attitude, material access, internet access, and internet skills remain important factors in obtaining internet outcomes after people engage in the corresponding uses. METHODS: We used a web-based survey to draw upon a sample collected in the Netherlands. We obtained a dataset with 1733 respondents older than 18 years. RESULTS: Men are more likely to engage in COVID-19-related communication uses. Age is positively related to COVID-19-related information uses and negatively related to information and communication outcomes. Agreeableness is negatively related to both outcomes and to information uses. Neuroticism is positively related to both uses and to communication outcomes. Conscientiousness is not related to any of the uses or outcomes. Introversion is negatively related to communication outcomes. Finally, openness relates positively to all information uses and to both outcomes. Physical health has negative relationships with both outcomes. Health perception contributes positively to information uses and both outcomes. Traditional literacy has a positive relationship with information uses and both outcomes. Education has a positive relationship with information and communication uses. Economic and social resources played no roles. Internet attitude is positively related to information uses and outcomes but negatively related to communication uses and outcomes. Material access and internet access contributed to all uses and outcomes. Finally, several of the indicators and outcomes became insignificant after accounting for engagement in internet uses. CONCLUSIONS: Digital inequality is a major concern among national and international scholars and policy makers. This contribution aimed to provide a broader understanding in the case of a major health pandemic by using the ongoing COVID-19 crisis as a context for empirical work. Several groups of people were identified as vulnerable, such as older people, less educated people, and people with physical health problems, low literacy levels, or low levels of internet skills. Generally, people who are already relatively advantaged are more likely to use the information and communication opportunities provided by the internet to their benefit in a health pandemic, while less advantaged individuals are less likely to benefit. Therefore, the COVID-19 crisis is also enforcing existing inequalities.","van Deursen, Alexander Jam",J Med Internet Res,320,1

The disruption in medical education and training has adversely impacted traditional medical education and medical students and is likely to have long-term implications beyond COVID-19. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the existing structural and systemic challenges applicable to medical students and teaching/training programs and the impact of COVID-19 on medical students and education. Use of technologies such as telemedicine or remote education platforms can minimize increased mental health risks to this population. An overview of challenges during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed, and targeted recommendations to address acute and systemic issues in medical education and training are presented. During the transition from conventional in-person or classroom teaching to tele-delivery of educational programs, medical students have to navigate various social, economic and cultural factors which interfere with their personal and academic lives. This is especially relevant for those from vulnerable, underprivileged or minority backgrounds. Students from vulnerable backgrounds are influenced by environmental factors such as unemployment of themselves and family members, lack of or inequity in provision and access to educational technologies and remote delivery-platforms, and increased levels of mental health stressors due to prolonged isolation and self-quarantine measures. Technologies for remote education and training delivery as well as sustenance and increased delivery of general well-being and mental health services to medical students, especially to those at high-risk, are pivotal to our response to COVID-19 and beyond.","Sharma, Divyansh; Bhaskar, Sonu",Front Public Health,320,26

The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available.","Dashti, Hesam; Roche, Elise C; Bates, David William; Mora, Samia; Demler, Olga",Sci Rep,320,24

OBJECTIVES: Describe the implications of post-COVID syndrome due to neurological sequelae including treatment and the differences that may exist between this group of patients and those who present these events not associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out in PubMed and Science Direct databases, using the keywords ""Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome""; ""Neurological complications""; ""Neurologic Manifestations"" ""COVID-19â³ and ""Rehabilitation"", as well as synonyms, which were combined with the operators ""AND"" and ""OR"". RESULTS: The COVID-19 viral caustive agent, SARS-CoV-2, has a high affinity for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on type II pneumocytes. This receptor is also expressed in neurons and glial cells. Based on the foregoing and other not so clear mechanisms, it is stated that SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for the nervous system, being evident through the neurological manifestations observed in patients with mild, moderate and severe phenotype of the disease such as anosmia, ageusia, headache, cerebrovascular accidents, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and encephalopathy. This can generate severe sequelae and even fatal outcomes in those affected. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications caused by COVID-19 are frequent and represent a risk that compromises the functional capacity and the life of patients. The suspicion of these conditions, the strict control of metabolic alterations and cardiovascular risk factors, the effective and safe treatment of these entities, are a current challenge throughout the pandemic. The rehabilitation process in these patients is a challenge. This is due to the limitations generated by multi-organ damage, as well as risk of brain death.","Camargo-Martínez, William; Lozada-Martínez, Ivan; Escobar-Collazos, Angie; Navarro-Coronado, Aura; Moscote-Salazar, Luis; Pacheco-Hernández, Alfonso; Janjua, Tariq; Bosque-Varela, Pilar",J Clin Neurosci,320,6

Despite the fact that DT is frequently used as an LVAD indication across other major European countries and the United States, with consistent improvements in quality-of-life and longevity, National Health Service (NHS) England does not currently fund DT, mainly due to concerns over cost-effectiveness. On the basis of the recently published ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial studying DT patients, we assessed for the first time the cost-effectiveness of DT LVADs compared with medical management (MM) in the NHS England. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov multiple-state economic model using NHS cost data. LVAD survival and adverse event rates were derived from the ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial. MM survival was based on Seattle Heart Failure Model estimates in the absence of contemporary clinical trials for this population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3.5% per year was applied to costs and benefits. Deterministic ICER was £46 207 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and utilities were £204 022 and 3.27 QALYs for the LVAD arm vs. £77 790 and 0.54 QALYs for the MM arm. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The implantation of the HeartWare&#8482; HVAD&#8482; System in patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation as DT is a cost-effective therapy in the NHS England healthcare system under the end-of-life willingness-to-pay threshold of £50 000/QALY, which applies for VAD patients.","Schueler, Stephan; Silvestry, Scott C; Cotts, William G; Slaughter, Mark S; Levy, Wayne C; Cheng, Richard K; Beckman, Jennifer A; Villinger, Jonas; Ismyrloglou, Eleni; Tsintzos, Stelios I; Mahr, Claudius",ESC Heart Fail,320,1

However, their plasma kinetics necessitate a prolonged ED stay or overnight hospital admission, especially in those presenting early after CP onset. Moreover, ruling out ACS in low-risk patients requires prolonged ED observation or overnight hospital admission to allow serial measurements of c-Tn, adding cost. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a novel marker of myocardial injury with putative advantages over cTn. Being present in abundance in the myocellular cytoplasm, it is released rapidly (<1 h) after the onset of myocardial injury and could potentially play an important role in both earlier diagnosis of high-risk patients presenting early after CP onset, as well as in risk-stratifying low-risk patients rapidly. Like cTn, H-FABP also has a potential role as a prognostic marker in other conditions where the myocardial injury occurs, such as acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). This review provides an overview of the evidence examining the role of H-FABP in early diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with CP and in non-ACS conditions associated with myocardial injury. Key messages Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein is a biomarker that is elevated early in myocardial injury The routine use in the emergency department complements the use of troponins in ruling out acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting early with chest pain It also is useful in risk stratifying patients with other conditions such as heart failure and acute pulmonary embolism.","Goel, Harsh; Melot, Joshua; Krinock, Matthew D; Kumar, Ashish; Nadar, Sunil K; Lip, Gregory Y H",Ann Med,320,1

The aim of the present study was to analyze how physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet among employees participating in the Healthy Cities program have been affected during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample was composed of 297 employees from 40 leading companies based in Spain, who participated in the 5th edition of the Sanitas ""Healthy Cities"" challenge. The participants (148 women and 149 men), aged between 24 and 63 years old (M = 42.76; SD = 7.79) completed the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) questionnaire to measure adherence to the Mediterranean diet before and during the pandemic. Pearson &#967;2 tests revealed that workers were more likely to show sedentary behaviors during the pandemic than before (83.5% vs. 66.7%). Additionally, they were more likely to reach high levels of PA (51.2% vs. 64%), and Wilcoxon tests revealed that energy expenditure measured in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) was higher during the pandemic (4199.03 METs) than before (3735.32 METs), due to an increase in moderate PA. Lastly, a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet during the pandemic (76.4%) than before (54.5%) was reported. The findings of this investigation suggest a positive effect of working from home for employees involved in a health-promotion program, and highlight the relevance of this kind of action among this population.","Franco, Evelia; Urosa, Jesús; Barakat, Rubén; Refoyo, Ignacio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),320,26

We aimed to assess the rate and to describe the clinical features and the outcomes of ARDS COVID-19 patients diagnosed with PE during ICU stay. From March 13th to April 24th 2020, a total of 92 patients (median age: 61 years, 1st-3rd quartiles [55-70]; males: n = 73/92, 79%; baseline SOFA: 4 [3-7] and SAPS II: 31 [21-40]; invasive mechanical ventilation: n = 83/92, 90%; ICU mortality: n = 45/92, 49%) were admitted to our 41-bed COVID-19 ICU for ARDS due to COVID-19. Among them, 26 patients (n = 26/92, 28%) underwent a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography which revealed PE in 16 (n = 16/26, 62%) of them, accounting for 17% (n = 16/92) of the whole cohort. PE was bilateral in 3 (19%) patients and unilateral in 13 (81%) patients. The most proximal thrombus was localized in main (n = 4, 25%), lobar (n = 2, 12%) or segmental (n = 10, 63%) pulmonary artery. Most of the thrombi (n = 13/16, 81%) were located in a parenchymatous condensation. Only three of the 16 patients (19%) had lower limb venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasound. Three patients were treated with alteplase and anticoagulation (n = 3/16, 19%) while the 13 others (n = 13/16, 81%) were treated with anticoagulation alone. ICU mortality was higher in patients with PE compared to that of patients without PE (n = 11/16, 69% vs. n = 2/10, 20%; p = 0.04). The low rate of lower limb venous thrombosis together with the high rate of distal pulmonary thrombus argue for a local immuno-thrombotic process associated with the classic embolic process. Further larger studies are needed to assess the real prevalence and the risk factors of pulmonary embolism/thrombosis together with its prognostic impact on critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Contou, Damien; Pajot, Olivier; Cally, Radj; Logre, Elsa; Fraissé, Megan; Mentec, Hervé; Plantefève, Gaëtan",PLoS One,320,20

The principle that a relatively strong contact allergen will have an enhancing effect on sensitisation to a less potent contact allergen if they are co-administered, may not at first appear relevant to this issue. However, this augmentation effect is thought to be due to the sharing of common or complementary pathways. Here we consider briefly aspects of the shared and complementary pathways between skin sensitisation induced by exposure to a contact allergen and the immune response to viruses, with particular reference to Covid-19. This relationship leads us to explore whether this principle, which we name here as 'cooperative immune augmentation' may extend to include viral vaccination. We consider evidence that even relatively weak contact allergens, used in vaccines for other purposes, can show enhanced sensitisation, which is in keeping with a cooperative augmentation principle. Finally, we consider how the potent contact allergen diphenylcyclopropenone could be employed safely as an enhancer of vaccine responses. This article is protected by copyright.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Community based SARS-CoV-2 testing in England, individually linked with hospital admission data. PARTICIPANTS: 839 278 patients with laboratory confirmed covid-19, of whom 36 233 had been admitted to hospital within 14 days, tested between 23 November 2020 and 31 January 2021 and analysed at a laboratory with an available TaqPath assay that enables assessment of S-gene target failure (SGTF), a proxy test for the B.1.1.7 variant. Patient data were stratified by age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region of residence, and date of positive test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital admission between one and 14 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: 27 710 (4.7%) of 592 409 patients with SGTF variants and 8523 (3.5%) of 246 869 patients without SGTF variants had been admitted to hospital within one to 14 days. The stratum adjusted hazard ratio of hospital admission was 1.52 (95% confidence interval 1.47 to 1.57) for patients with covid-19 infected with SGTF variants, compared with those infected with non-SGTF variants. The effect was modified by age (P<0.001), with hazard ratios of 0.93-1.21 in patients younger than 20 years with versus without SGTF variants, 1.29 in those aged 20-29, and 1.45-1.65 in those aged &#8805;30 years. The adjusted absolute risk of hospital admission within 14 days was 4.7% (95% confidence interval 4.6% to 4.7%) for patients with SGTF variants and 3.5% (3.4% to 3.5%) for those with non-SGTF variants. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the risk of hospital admission is higher for people infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, likely reflecting a more severe disease. The higher severity may be specific to adults older than 30 years.","Nyberg, Tommy; Twohig, Katherine A; Harris, Ross J; Seaman, Shaun R; Flannagan, Joe; Allen, Hester; Charlett, Andre; De Angelis, Daniela; Dabrera, Gavin; Presanis, Anne M",BMJ,320,16

In this study, we performed a longitudinal characterization of vaccination coverage in Brazil and compared the profiles between the distinct regions in the country to test whether there has been a substantial change over the last 5 years. METHODS: De-identified publicly available data were retrieved from the repository of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, comprising detailed information on vaccination coverage in all age groups between 1994 and 2019. The vaccination coverage for the whole country and for each Brazilian region, by year, was examined, and a time-series pattern analysis was performed. RESULTS: A significant decrease in overall vaccination coverage across the country regions was observed between 2017 and 2019, especially in childhood immunization. A reduction in BCG, hepatitis B, influenza, and rotavirus vaccine coverage was observed. Conversely, vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and meningococcus showed an increase in coverage.

This study aimed to explore patients' perspectives, experiences, support needs, and sources of information regarding CAM use during chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with ten adult participants who recently completed chemotherapy treatment at a large hospital in Australia were transcribed verbatim. Three investigators thematically analysed the interviews. RESULTS: These participants receiving chemotherapy valued CAMs as a natural complement to chemotherapy to improve wellbeing, with their use most strongly influenced by past experiences rather than expert advice. CONCLUSION: Health professionals would benefit from education on how to best inform patients of the potential risks, harms and lack of efficacy for CAM use during chemotherapy in a way that does not lead to patient non-disclosure of CAM use.","Crichton, Megan; Strike, Katelyn; Isenring, Elizabeth; McCarthy, Alexandra L; Marx, Wolfgang; Lohning, Anna; Marshall, Skye",Complement Ther Clin Pract,320,16

Apart from other services, this has also impacted healthcare services and the way they are delivered. As endoscopy is an Aerosol generating procedure (AGP) with high risk of transmission, multiple endoscopy societies at the peak of the pandemic published guidelines on prioritizing of endoscopy services according to the urgency, highlighting the clinical indications which could be deferred until a more comprehensive plan is put out to safely perform endoscopy procedures or the infection rates drop down. Aims and Objectives: We give an example of how our unit in a low Human development Index country, worked through the peak of pandemic providing service to patients in a safe manner which can be continued forward until the pandemic runs its course. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was performed at Dr. Ziauddin University Hospital, Karachi. The ethical endorsement was taken from the Ethical Review Committee. Informed consent was secured in writing from each participant. Patients were assessed by a given screening questionnaire and COVID RT PCR of every patient was checked before endoscopy procedures, only those who tested negative were included in the study. The endoscopy consultant, endoscopy trainee, anesthetist and the endoscopy staff along with the patients were reassessed for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 via a telephonic questionnaire, two weeks after the procedure. Results: Total 80 patients were assessed, out of which 60 were males. All the patients had negative COVID-19 PCR at the time of endoscopy. The procedures were performed under propofol sedation with full Personal protective equipment (PPE) both for the endoscopist and the staff in the room. The PPE included N95 masks, hairnet, Face visor, surgical gloves and disposable gowns. 2 weeks post procedure both the patients and the endoscopy staff were assessed via telephonic questionnaire for any signs & symptoms of COVID-19 or any positive COVID PCR since the time of endoscopy.Conclusion: SARS-COVID 19 pandemic is far from over. There is a dire need to restart endoscopy services in a safe and effective way. Ideally full PPE and negative pressure rooms for AGP is the way forward considering that quite a few patients are asymptomatic carriers and the dismissal rate of COVID PCR pick up rate. In low socioeconomic countries these facilities are not readily available. Hence doing a COVID PCR prior to the procedure with adequate PPE can be used as a way forward in COVID era until the pandemic is over.

AIM: To investigate clinical outcomes, distribution of quarantine locations and the infection status of the contacts of COVID-19 patients after discharge. DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. METHODS: Demographics, baseline characteristics of 131 COVID-19 patients discharged from 3 February 2020 to 21 February 2020 in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed by reviewing the medical records retrospectively. Post-hospitalization data related to clinical outcomes, quarantine locations and close contact history were obtained by following up the patients every week up to 4 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-three (40.05%) patients on discharge had cough (29.01%), fatigue (7.63%), expectoration (6.11%), chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), chest pain (3.05%) and palpitation (1.53%). These symptoms constantly declined in 4 weeks post-discharge. Transient fever recurred in 11 (8.4%) patients. Among the discharged patients, 78 (59.5%) underwent chest CT and 2 (1.53%) showed deterioration. A total of 94 (71.8%) patients received SARS-CoV-2 retest and 8 (6.10%) reported positive. Seven (2.29%) patients were readmitted because of fever or positive SARS-CoV-2 retest. After discharge, 121 (92.37%) and 4 (3.05%) patients were self-quarantined at home or community spots, respectively, after a close contact with 167 persons in total who were free of COVID-19 at the endpoint of study. CONCLUSION: The majority of COVID-19 patients after discharge were in the course of recovery. Readmission was required in rare cases due to suspected recurrence of COVID-19. Although no contacted infection observed, appropriate self-quarantine and regular re-examination are necessary, particularly for those who have recurred symptoms.","Wang, X; Xu, H; Jiang, H; Wang, L; Lu, C; Wei, X; Liu, J; Xu, S",QJM,320,24

Many countries especially those in the developing world continue to struggle with scaling up reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 due to scarcity of resources. Alternatives such as antigen rapid diagnostics tests (Ag-RDTs) may provide a solution to enable countries to scale up testing. MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the Panbio and STANDARD Q Ag-RDTs in the laboratory using 80 COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed and 80 negative nasopharyngeal swabs. The STANDARD-Q was further evaluated in the field on 112 symptomatic and 61 asymptomatic participants. ResultsFor the laboratory evaluation, both tests had a sensitivity above 80% (Panbio = 86% vs STANDARD Q = 88%). The specificity of the Panbio was 100%, while that of the STANDARD Q was 99%. When evaluated in the field, the STANDARD Q maintained a high specificity of 99%, however the sensitivity was reduced to 56%. ConclusionUsing Ag-RDTs in low resource settings will be helpful, however, negative results should be confirmed by RT-PCR where possible to rule out COVID-19 infection.","Konstantinus, Iyaloo SN; Chiwara, Douglas; Ndevaetela, Emmy-Else; Ndarukwa-Phiri, Victoria; Garus-oas, Nathalia; Frans, Ndahafa; Ndumbu, Pentikainen; Shiningavamwe, Andreas; Rooyen, Gerhard van; Schiceya, Ferlin; Hlahla, Lindile; Namundjebo, Pendapala; Ndozi-Okia, Ifeoma; Chikuse, Francis; Bantiewalu, Sirak Hailu; Tjombonde, Kapena",,320,6

Based on the data, influence of SARS-CoV-2 on human cells was analyzed and potential therapeutic compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 were screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS: R package ""DESeq2"" was used for differential gene analysis on the data of cells infected or non-infected with SARS-CoV-2. The ""ClusterProfiler"" package was used for GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed through STRING website, and the key subset in the PPI network was identified after visualization by Cytoscape software. Connectivity Map (CMap) database was used to screen known compounds that caused genomic change reverse to that caused by SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: By intersecting DEGs in two datasets, a total of 145 DEGs were screened out, among which 136 genes were upregulated and 9 genes were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that these genes were mainly associated with the pathways involved in viral infection, inflammatory response, and immunity. The CMap research found that there were three compounds with a median_tau_score less than -90, namely triptolide, tivozanib and daunorubicin. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can cause abnormal changes in a large number of molecules and related signaling pathways in human cells, among which IL-17 and TNF signaling pathways may play a key role in pathogenic process of SARS-CoV-2. Here, three compounds that may be effective for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 were screened, which would provide new options for improving treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, W-Y; Fang, Z-X; Lv, X-D; Zhou, Q-H; Yao, M; Deng, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,320,22

Nevertheless, aging also affects the ability of the auditory system to process temporal parameters of the sound stimulus. To explore the precision and reliability of auditory temporal processing during aging, responses to several types of sound stimuli were recorded from neurons of the auditory cortex (AC) of young and aged anaesthetized Fischer 344 rats. In response to broad-band noise bursts, the aged rats exhibited larger response magnitudes, a higher proportion of monotonic units, and also a larger variability of response magnitudes, suggesting a lower stability of the rate code. Of primary interest were the responses to temporally structured stimuli (amplitude-modulated (AM) noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, and click trains) recorded separately in the right and left AC. Significant differences of temporal processing were already found between the neuronal responses in the left and right AC in the young animals: for the click trains, the left hemisphere exhibited a greater responsiveness to higher repetition rates, lower vector strength values, and a lower similarity of responses. The two hemispheres were also affected differently by aging. In the right hemisphere, neurons in the aged animals displayed worse synchronization with the AM noise and clicks, but better synchronization with the FM tone. In the left hemisphere, neuronal synchronization with the stimulus modulation improved at a higher age for all three stimuli. The results show that the ability of the aging auditory system to process temporal parameters of the stimulus strongly depends on the stimulus type and on laterality. Furthermore, the commonly reported age-related decline in the temporal processing ability cannot be regarded as general as, at least at the neuronal level in the AC, objective measures of the temporal representation often exhibit age-related improvement instead of deterioration.","Bures, Zbynek; Pysanenko, Kateryna; Syka, Josef",Hear Res,320,23

However, it is unknown how this influences the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients involved in ongoing clinical research and medical care. For both the current and potential future lockdowns, it is important to determine if PROMs collected during such a period can be interpreted with confidence. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS: This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions. To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment. The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life (QoL), pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment. The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception. Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group. We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616; reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313; reference period group: n = 222). The primary outcome was QoL, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score. Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception. RESULTS: We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0.035; p = 0.98). Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression. There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on QoL and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort. This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research. Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures.

The aim of the present study protocol is to evaluate whether an intervention consisting of guided DMRs, supported by a remote specialist and audit/feedback on care performance will reduce ICU length of stay compared with a control group. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, controlled, cluster-randomised superiority trial including 30 ICUs in Brazil (15 intervention and 15 control), from August 2019 to June 2021. In a parallel assignment, ICUs are randomised to a complex-intervention composed by daily rounds carried out through Tele-ICU by a remote ICU physician; development of local quality indicators dashboards coupled with monthly meetings with local leadership; and dissemination of evidence-based clinical protocols versus usual care. Primary outcome is ICU length of stay. Secondary outcomes include classification of the unit according to the profiles defined by the standardised resource use and the standardised mortality rate, hospital mortality, incidence of healthcare-associated infections, ventilator-free days at 28 days, patient-days receiving oral or enteral feeding, patient-days under light sedation or alert and calm, rate of patients under normoxaemia. All adult patients admitted after the beginning of the study in each participant ICU will be enrolled. Inclusion criteria (clusters): public Brazilian ICUs with a minimum of 8 ICU beds interested/committed to participating in the study. Exclusion criteria (clusters): units with fully established DMRs by an intensivist, specialised or step-down units. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the coordinator centre, and by IRBs of each enrolled hospital/ICU. Statistical analysis protocol is being prepared for submission before the end of patient's enrolment. Results will be disseminated through conferences, peer-reviewed journals and to each participating unit.

Methods: Data of 615 patients discharged from ASST Ovest Milanese (Milan, Lombardy, Italy) with final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were retrospectively extracted from electronical medical records from 21 February to 1 May 2020. Patients were descriptively analyzed with respect to the following variables: sex, age, muscular manifestations (myalgia and/or arthralgia), fatigue, respiratory involvement (SARS pneumonia or respiratory failure) and history of falls. Association between patients' characteristics and CK levels was investigated. In addition, the proportion of patients who died following access to the ER was calculated. Finally, the effect of CK levels and other patients' features on mortality was estimated using a logistic regression model. Results: 176 (28.6%) patients had raised serum CK levels. CK levels were significantly associated with history of falls, male gender, SARS pneumonia, respiratory failure and in-hospital death. No correlation was found between hyperckemia and muscular manifestations. Conclusions: Our study provides preliminary evidence that hyperckemia is associated with respiratory failure and fatal outcome in patients with COVID-19 infection.In these patients, among other testing, CK dosage is recommended.","De Rosa, Anna; Verrengia, Elena Pinuccia; Merlo, Ivan; Rea, Federico; Siciliano, Gabriele; Corrao, Giovanni; Prelle, Alessandro",Acta Myol,320,16

Since the patient refused admission to the hospital and had stable vital signs, we chose to treat him with a safe anti-inflammatory and non-immunosuppressive therapy. To hit two birds with one stone, we considered colchicine, as it has systemic anti-inflammatory effects and is also effective in gout flare. Unexpectedly, 48 hours after treatment, not only did his ongoing fever and toe pain disappear, he also had significant improvements in his general state of health and all his inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels normalized. To our knowledge, the use of colchicine in Covid-19 and CRS has not been reported. This observation merits the consideration of colchicine as a safe, inexpensive and oral medication for the treatment of mild to moderate CRS in Covid-19 patients. More importantly, in Covid-19 patients with early lung involvement colchicine may be an appropriate candidate to prevent CRS in adjunction with routine antiviral agents.

In the academic environment, hypoxia is a current topic of research in biology, physiology, and medicine: in October 2020, there were more than 150,000 occurrences of ""hypoxia"" in the PubMed database. However, the first occurrence is dated to 1945, while the interest for the effects of oxygen lack on the living organisms started in the mid-19th century, when scientists explored high altitude regions and mainly used the terms ""anoxia"" or ""anoxemia."" I therefore researched online through multiple databases to look for the first appearance of ""hypoxia"" and related terms ""hypoxemia"" and ""hypoxybiosis"" in scientific literature published in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. Viault and Jolyet used ""Hypohématose"" in 1894, but this term has not been used since. Hypoxybiosis first appeared in 1909 in Germany, then hypoxemia in 1923 in Austria, and hypoxia in 1938 in Holland. It was then exported to the United States where it appeared in 1940 in cardiology and anesthesiology. The clinical distinction between anoxia and hypoxia was clearly defined by Carl Wiggers in 1941. Hypoxia (decrease in oxygen), by essence variable in time and in localization in the body, in contrast with anoxia (absence of oxygen), illustrates the concept of homeodynamics that defines a living organism as a complex system in permanent instability, exposed to environmental and internal perturbations.","Richalet, Jean-Paul",J Appl Physiol (1985),320,1

A general warning has been issued on the possibility that coinfections can make differential diagnosis and treatment difficult, especially in tropical countries. Some reports have pointed out that the presence of high Dengue antibodies can give a false-negative result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Mucocutaneous manifestations are very frequent, with an apparent overlap among different pathogens. A strong clinicopathologic correlation, however, may provide some clues to address the differential. Waiting for laboratory and instrumental results, the timing and distribution of skin lesions is often pathognomonic. Histopathologic findings characterize certain reaction patterns and provide insights on pathogenetic mechanisms. Unfortunately, skin assessments, especially invasive exams such as biopsy, are less important in severely ill patients.

In the psychological response to the disease some patients may develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and structure of PTSD symptoms in Croatian patients following breast cancer and to identify some medical and psychological predictors of severity of these symptoms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 97 women, who were one month up to six years post-completion of all primary cancer therapy, participated in the study. The present research is cross-sectional with a mixed method approach. For the screening of PTSD symptoms PTSD Checklist - Civilian Version (Weathers et al. 1991) was used, with two open-ended questions added. RESULTS: Using the cutoff method, 21.6% participants met criteria for PTSD diagnosis. Qualitative analysis indicated future-oriented intrusive thoughts about reoccurrence of cancer, multidimensional nature of cancer as stressors, and hyperarousal symptoms related to internal stimuli. In hierarchical multiple regression analyses, identified predictors accounted for 35.2% of variability in PCL-C score. PTSD severity was predicted by stressfulness appraisal of the disease (ß=0.45; p<0.001), external health locus of control (ß=0.17; p<0.05) and self-appraisal of coping with cancer (ß=-0.17; p<0.05). Participants who underwent radical mastectomy (M=44.41, SD=15.5) showed higher levels of PTSD than participants who had partial mastectomy (M=33.47, SD=13.68). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of PTSD symptoms obtained in this study should be considered as significant, taking into account the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general female population. Psychological assessment of women following breast cancer should more often include an assessment of posttraumatic stress reactions. Furthermore, results are in the line with issues of utilizing basic concept of PTSD in the oncology setting, and possible need of reconceptualization of cancer-related PTSD.","Simunovic, Mara; Ljubotina, Damir",Psychiatr Danub,320,16

Many questions remain unanswered regarding the disease course. Key amongst its talking point is the case of asymptomatic patients. This potentially jeopardizes infection control strategy as asymptomatic cases are difficult to identify and hence difficult to isolate. Our study intends to define the clinical and radiological features of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, the disease course as well as highlight the role of chest CT in its management. This is a monocentric study involving 114 asymptomatic adults admitted in our COVID-19 Unit. Clinical, radiological and laboratory findings were retrospectively analyzed. Chi-squared, Fisher exact test and the student test were used for statistical analysis. Asymptomatic patients represent 51.81% of patients. There was a slight male predominance with a mean age of 37.64 years. Patients with abnormal CT had a longer hospital stay than those with unremarkable CT and even more so were older. None of the patients presented severe or critical extension of parenchymal lesions. Only two patients (4.54%) with normal CT on admission presented with abnormalities on control CT. Cases with worsening CT were older with bilateral pulmonary involvement. All patients remained asymptomatic on treatment. Even when asymptomatic, COVID-19 patients present mild lung lesions. The positivity of the initial chest CT imaging is directly correlated to the disease course. Older patients with bilateral pulmonary lesions are more likely to worsen and should be closely monitored. Moreover, it is safe to manage asymptomatic patients with normal CT in a non-hospital setting.","Kolani, S.; Alami, H.; Ibtissam, E. H.; Boujraf, S.; Haloua, M.; Lamrani, Y. A.; Fakir, S.

This has in-turn led to understaffed hospitals unable to handle new patient influx. To help alleviate these problems, we design and develop a contactless patient positioning system that can enable scanning patients in a completely remote and contactless fashion. Our key design objective is to reduce the physical contact time with a patient as much as possible, which we achieve with our contactless workflow. Our system comprises automated calibration, positioning, and multi-view synthesis components that enable patient scan without physical proximity. Our calibration routine ensures system calibration at all times and can be executed without any manual intervention. Our patient positioning routine comprises a novel robust dynamic fusion (RDF) algorithm for accurate 3D patient body modeling. With its multi-modal inference capability, RDF can be trained once and used across different applications (without re-training) having various sensor choices, a key feature to enable system deployment at scale. Our multi-view synthesizer ensures multi-view positioning visualization for the technician to verify positioning accuracy prior to initiating the patient scan. We conduct extensive experiments with publicly available and proprietary datasets to demonstrate efficacy. Our system has already been used, and had a positive impact on, hospitals and technicians on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to see its use increase substantially globally.","Karanam, Srikrishna; Li, Ren; Yang, Fan; Hu, Wei; Chen, Terrence; Wu, Ziyan",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,320,16

The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.","Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Johnson, Bryan A.; Xia, Hongjie; Ku, Zhiqiang; Schindewolf, Craig; Widen, Steven G.; An, Zhiqiang; Weaver, Scott; Menachery, Vineet D; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong",,320,28

In this paper we provide a detailed derivation of the original Bellman Harris process. We introduce generalisations, that allow for time-varying reproduction numbers and the accounting of exogenous events, such as importations. We show how inference on the renewal equation is easy to accomplish within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. Using off the shelf MCMC packages, we fit to South Korea COVID-19 case data to estimate reproduction numbers and importations.

Nosopharyngeal swabs were tested with RT-PCR method for: influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3 virus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, adenowirus, RSV A, RSV B virus and two coronaviruses: OC43 and 229E/NL63. Results. The viral etiology of respiratory tract infection was confirmed in 72 children (62%), in 62 (54%) patients the disease was caused by a single etiological agent, while in 9 (8%) patients there were viral coinfections. The most often found viruses were influenza A and B viruses (35 patients, 30%), and RSV infections (27 patients, 24%). Conclusions. Since influenza viruses are the most common etiological agents of respiratory tract infections in young children, it is strongly recommended to increase the influenza vaccine coverage rates among children younger than 5 years, as the vaccination is the most effective tool in the prevention of the disease.Copyright © 2016 Medpress.

This paper determinates the radiographic features of COVID-19 based on an initial national cohort of patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of swab-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to four different hospitals in Singapore between 22 January and 9 March 2020. Initial and follow-up CXR were reviewed by three experienced radiologists to identify the predominant pattern and distribution of lung parenchymal abnormalities. RESULTS: In total, 347 CXR of 96 patients were reviewed. Initial CXR were abnormal in 41 out of 96 patients (42.7%). The mean time from onset of symptoms to CXR abnormality was 5.3 (range 1-21) days. The predominant pattern of lung abnormality was ground-glass opacity on initial CXR (51.2%) and consolidation on follow-up CXR (51.0%). Multifocal bilateral abnormalities in mixed central and peripheral distribution were seen in 63.4% and 59.2% of abnormal initial and follow-up CXR, respectively. The lower zones were involved in 90.2% of the initial CXR and 93.9% of the follow-up CXR. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of swab-positive patients, including those identified from contact tracing, we found the incidence of CXR abnormality to be lower than previously reported.

For example, whether a practitioner would ever be obliged to seek consent from a substitute decision-maker before providing emergency treatment is not clearly or consistently explained. We suggest the law should be clarified.","Boyle, Sam; Stepanov, Nikola",Emerg. med Australas,320,16

At sufficiently low angles between twisted bilayer graphene and hBN, $\theta_{hBN} \lesssim 2^\circ$, the graphene electronic structure is strongly disturbed. The width of the low energy peak in the density of states changes from $W \sim 5 - 10$ meV for a decoupled system to $\sim 20 - 30$ meV. Spikes in the density of states due to van Hove singularities are smoothed out.

With the vaccine trials still in clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Datta, Manali; Singh, Desh Deepak; Naqvi, Afsar R",Int Rev Immunol,320,24

However, many current technologies require the detailed mechanistic knowledge of specific material-virion interactions before they can be employed, for example, to aid in the purification of vaccine components or in the design of a more effective PPE. Here, we show that an adaption of a polymer microarray method for screening bacterial-surface interactions allows for the screening of polymers for desirable material-virion interactions. Nonpathogenic virus-like particles including fluorophores are exposed to the arrays in an aqueous buffer as a simple model of virions carried to the surface in saliva/sputum. Competitive binding of Lassa and Rubella virus-like particles is measured to probe the relative binding properties of a selection of copolymers. This provides the first step in the development of a method for the discovery of novel materials with promise for viral binding, with the next being development of this method to assess absolute viral adsorption and assessment of the attenuation of the activity of live virus, which we propose would be part of a material scale up step carried out in high containment facilities, alongside the use of more complex media to represent biological fluids.","Blok, Andrew J; Gurnani, Pratik; Xenopoulos, Alex; Burroughs, Laurence; Duncan, Joshua; Urbanowicz, Richard A; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Müller-Kräuter, Helena; Strecker, Thomas; Ball, Jonathan K; Alexander, Cameron; Alexander, Morgan R",Biointerphases,320,14

Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","Li, Junjiang; Giabbanelli, Philippe",JMIR Med Inform,320,24

Urotherapy is recommended in LUTD treatment management. In our country, all citizens under the age of 20 were banned from going out of their homes due to Covid-19 and the homeschooling system has been adopted The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of lockdown and homeschooling on the effectiveness of urotherapy used for LUTD treatment. METHODS: 83 patients were included in the study group. Besides 306 patients were determined as the control group (pre-Covid). The patients in the study group and the control group were compared in terms of improvement in Dysfunctional voiding and incontinence scoring system (DVISS), quality of life scores, bladder diary, Bristol stool scale, and treatment responses at 3rd and 6th months. RESULTS: The study group and control group were compared in terms of DVISS, voiding frequency and incontinence in the voiding diary, quality of life score, and Bristol stool scale at admission visit and the group characteristics were similar. During the 6th month visit, the mean DVISS of the study group was found to be significantly lower (7.12 ± 3.48; 8.58 ± 4.06 respectively (p 0.002)). Daily voiding frequency was similar in the study group and the control group during the 2nd and 3rd visit. The study group's mean number of daily incontinence was significantly lower at visit 3 (0.57 ± 0.9; 0.94 ± 0.27, respectively (p 0.02).After six months of treatment, 13.3% of the study group patients had a complete response, 44.6% had a partial response, whereas 42.2% non-responders. In the control group, the response rates were as 5.9%, 39.2% and 54.9% respectively (p 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: LUTD is still very common in pediatric urology. Standard urotherapy is widely used in treatment management. According to our results, the success of standard urotherapy increases with lockdown and homeschooling. We have shown that the success of standard urotherapy can be improved by regulating environmental conditions. In terms of LUTD management, environmental conditions can be regulated to provide a better quality of life and a better cure in a more economical way.","Akinci, Aykut; Baklaci, Can Utku; Oguz, Efe Semetey; Kubilay, Eralp; Sanci, Adem; Aydog, Ezel; Hajiyev, Perviz; Soygür, Tarkan; Burgu, Berk",J. pediatr. urol,320,16

Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues playing a key role in their mechanism of action.

This is frequently difficult to realize due to restricted spatial capacities. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the possibility of enabling patients to spend the waiting period outside of the waiting room of the ENT outpatient department, in order to reduce the number of patients in the waiting rooms and therefore observe distancing rules. This was realized by the use of a pager system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the timeframe of 12.5 weeks (04.06.2020-31.08.2020), ENT outpatients were issued with pagers. The patients could thus move freely within the hospital and grounds. The pager system was activated 10-15â¯min before the appointment, to call patients back to the outpatient ENT clinic. questionnaires were used to evaluate the system and examine patients' acceptance and satisfaction. RESULTS: The 137 questionnaires analyzed showed satisfaction with the system, not only regarding distancing rules but also with the more comfortable waiting time. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a pager system for patients could help to meet hygiene and distance rules, and also increase comfort during (often unavoidable) waiting times for patients in the university hospital ENT outpatient department. The long-term use of such a system seems promising.","Vielsmeier, V; Brosig, A; Hauser, A; Bohr, C",HNO,320,21

These structures can sense the environment and play key roles in migration and cell-cell interactions. The growth-retraction cycle of filopodia is a complex process exquisitely regulated by intra- and extra-cellular cues, whose nature remains elusive. Filopodia present wide variation in length, lifetime and growth rate. Here, we investigate the features of filopodia patterns in fixed prostate tumor cells by confocal microscopy. Analysis of almost a thousand filopodia suggests the presence of two different populations: one characterized by a narrow distribution of lengths and the other with a much more variable pattern with very long filopodia. We explore a stochastic model of filopodial growth which takes into account diffusion and reactions involving actin and the regulatory proteins formin and capping, and retrograde flow. Interestingly, we found an inverse dependence between the filopodial length and the retrograde velocity. This result led us to propose that variations in the retrograde velocity could explain the experimental lengths observed for these tumor cells. In this sense, one population involves a wider range of retrograde velocities than the other population, and also includes low values of this velocity. It has been hypothesized that cells would be able to regulate retrograde flow as a mechanism to control filopodial length. Thus, we propound that the experimental filopodia pattern is the result of differential retrograde velocities originated from heterogeneous signaling due to cell-substrate interactions or prior cell-cell contacts.","Senra, Daniela; Páez, Alejandra; Gueron, Geraldine; Bruno, Luciana; Guisoni, Nara",Eur Biophys J,320,20

As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the need to identify genetic risk factors for susceptibility to this serious illness has emerged. Host genetic factors, along with other risk factors may help determine susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. It is hypothesized that the ACE2 gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a genetic risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and is required by the virus to enter cells. Together with ACE2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) also play an important role in disease severity. Evaluating the role of genetic variants in determining the direction of respiratory infections will help identify potential drug target candidates for further study in COVID-19 patients. We have summarized the latest reports demonstrating that ACE2 variants, their expression, and epigenetic factors may influence an individual's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease outcome.","Choudhary, Sarita; Sreenivasulu, Karli; Mitra, Prasenjit; Misra, Sanjeev; Sharma, Praveen",Ann Lab Med,320,1

In Italy, a period of generalized lockdown involving home confinement of the entire population was imposed for almost two months (9 March-3 May 2020). The present is the most extensive investigation aimed to unravel the demographic, psychological, chronobiological, and work-related predictors of sleep disturbances throughout the pandemic emergency. A total of 13,989 Italians completed a web-based survey during the confinement period (25 March-3 May). We collected demographic and lockdown-related work changes information, and we evaluated sleep quality, insomnia and depression symptoms, chronotype, perceived stress, and anxiety using validated questionnaires. The majority of the respondents reported a negative impact of confinement on their sleep and a delayed sleep phase. We highlighted an alarming prevalence of sleep disturbances during the lockdown. Main predictors of sleep disturbances identified by regression models were: female gender, advanced age, being a healthcare worker, living in southern Italy, confinement duration, and a higher level of depression, stress, and anxiety. The evening chronotype emerged as a vulnerability factor, while morning-type individuals showed a lower predisposition to sleep and psychological problems. Finally, working from home was associated with less severe sleep disturbances. Besides confirming the role of specific demographic and psychological factors in developing sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose that circadian typologies could react differently to a particular period of reduced social jetlag. Moreover, our results suggest that working from home could play a protective role against the development of sleep disturbances during the current pandemic emergency.","Salfi, Federico; Lauriola, Marco; D039,; Atri, Aurora; Amicucci, Giulia; Viselli, Lorenzo; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",Sci Rep,320,16

Therefore, fecal sample testing with real-time RT-PCR is highly recommended as a routine test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, varying rates of detection in fecal sample have been reported. The aim of this study was to provide insights into the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients' fecal sample by using four real-time RT-PCR kits and two pretreatment methods (inactive and non-inactive). RESULTS: The detection rate of Trizol pretreatment group was slightly higher than that of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) groups, showing that pretreatment and inactivation by Trizol had no influence to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test (NAT) results. 39.29% detection rate in fecal sample by DAAN was obtained, while Bio-germ was 40.48%, Sansure 34.52%, and GeneoDx 33.33%. The former three kits had no significant difference. The DAAN kit detection rates of ORF1ab and N gene were nearly equal and Ct value distribution was more scattered, while the Bio-germ kit distribution was more clustered. The positive rate of SARS-COV-2 in fecal samples correlated with the severity of the disease, specifically, severe cases were less likely to be identified than asymptomatic infection in the DAAN group (adjusted OR 0.05, 95%CI = 0.00 ~ 0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Trizol should be of choice as a valid and safe method for pretreatment of fecal samples of SARS-CoV-2. All real-time RT-PCR kits assessed in this study can be used for routine detection of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples. While DAAN, with high NAT positive rate, could be the best out of the 4 kits used in this study. SARS-CoV-2 positive rate in fecal sample was related to the severity of illness.","Cao, Ranran; Bao, Lirong; Pan, Ming; Zhang, Cheng; Liao, Hongyu; Liu, Li; Li, Yan; Li, Mingyuan",BMC Microbiol,320,26

The cumulative effect of COVID-19 CFRs in global CVD populations and the extrapolated effect on access to health care services in the CVD population in Canada are not fully known. In this study we explored the relationships of factors that might affect COVID-19 CFRs and estimated the potential indirect effects of COVID-19 on Canadian health care resources. Methods: Country-level epidemiological data were analyzed to study the correlation, main effect, and interaction between COVID-19 CFRs and: (1) the proportion of the population with CVD; (2) the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older; and (3) the availability of essential health services as defined by the World Health Organization Universal Health Coverage index. For indirect implications on health care resources, estimates of the volume of postponed coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, and valve surgeries in Ontario were calculated. Results: Positive correlations were found between COVID-19 CFRs and: (1) the proportion of the population with CVD (ρ = 0.40; P = 0.001); (2) the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older (ρ = 0.43; P = 0.0005); and (3) Universal Health Coverage index (ρ = 0.27; P = 0.03). For every 1% increase in the proportion of the population 65 years of age or older or proportion of the population with CVD, the COVID-19 CFR was 9% and 19% higher, respectively. Approximately 1252 procedures would be postponed monthly in Ontario because of current public health measures. Conclusions: Countries with more prevalent CVD reported higher COVID-19 CFRs.

Many surgical procedures are continuing to be performed during this state of pandemic as is thoracic surgery. We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. Methods: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment. Results: There were a total of six patients enrolled in our study. All these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The surgical indication for the chest tube thoracostomy was tension pneumothorax in all six patents. All patients had lung expansion defects and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention. Unfortunately, all of them succumbed to COVID-19, despite best available treatment. There was no COVID-19 infection reported in the healthcare professionals during this study.

Through the case analysis of Uber in Lisbon, we were able to identify a situation where several ambiguities emerged, some of which are associated with the Portuguese singularity of intermediary platform capitalism. From this analysis, anchored to several interviews with Uber drivers/partners, we observed that the pandemic crisis has aggravated some inequalities and problems generally associated with platform capitalism, but also seen new trends and solutions emerge for a political and socio-economic reformulation of this sector.","Allegretti, Giovanni Holz Sheila Rodrigues Nuno","Work Organisation, Labour & Globalisation",320,16

METHODS: We developed a sequential assessment of the risk reduction provided by face coverings using a step-by-step approach. The UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) Population Survey data were utilised to determine the baseline total number of community-derived infections. These were linked to reported hospital admissions/hospital deaths to create case admission risk ratio and admission-related fatality rate. We evaluated published evidence to establish an infection risk reduction for face coverings. We calculated an Infection Risk Score (IRS) for a number of common activities and related it to the effectiveness of reducing infection and its consequences, with a face covering, and evaluated their effect when applied to different infection rates over 3 months from July 24, 2020, when face coverings were made compulsory in England on public transport/retail outlets. RESULTS: We show that only 7.3% of all community-based infection risk is associated with public transport/retail outlets. In the week of July 24, The reported weekly community infection rate was 29 400 new cases at the start (July 24). The rate of growth in hospital admissions and deaths for England was around -15%/week, suggesting the infection rate, R, in the most vulnerable populations was just above 0.8. In this situation, average infections over the evaluated 13 week follow-up period, would be 9517/week with face covering of 40% effectiveness, thus, reducing average infections by 844/week, hospital admissions by 8/week and deaths by 0.6/week; a fall of 9% over the period total. If, however, the R-value rises to 1.0, then, average community infections would stay at 29 400/week and mandatory face coverings could reduce average weekly infections by 3930, hospital admissions by 36 and deaths by 2.9/week; a 13% reduction. If the R-value rose and stayed at 1.2, then, expected average community-derived hospital admissions would be 975/week and 40% effective face coverings would reduce this by 167/week and reduce possible expected hospital deaths from 80/week to 66/week. These reductions should be seen in the context that there was an average of 102 000/week all-cause hospital emergency admissions in England in June and 8900 total reported deaths in the week ending August 7, 2020. CONCLUSION: We have illustrated that the policy on mandatory use of face coverings in retail outlets/on public transport may have been very well followed, but may be of limited value in reducing hospital admissions and deaths, at least at the time that it was introduced, unless infections begin to rise faster than currently seen. The impact appears small compared with all other sources of risk, thereby raising questions regarding the effectiveness of the policy.","Heald, Adrian H; Stedman, Michael; Tian, Zixing; Wu, Pensee; Fryer, Anthony A",Int J Clin Pract,320,24

Our objective was to describe the Spanish experience of this technique and analyze its reliability and short- to mid-term efficacy. METHODS: National multicenter observational study, which retrospectively recruited all patients (of any age) with VSD (of any location or type) who underwent percutaneous NitOcclud occlusion, using an intention-to-treat analysis, until January 2019. RESULTS: A total of 117 attempts were made to implant at least 1 NitOcclud in 116 patients in 13 institutions. The median [range] age and weight was 8.6 [0.4-69] years and 27 [5.8-97] kg, respectively. In 99 patients (85%), the VSD was an isolated congenital defect. The location was perimembranous in 95 (81%), and 74 (63%) of them were aneurysmatic. The mean fluoroscopy time was 34 [11.4-124] minutes. Of the 117 attempts, 104 were successful (89%) with a follow-up of 31.4 [0.6-59] months. At the last review, final complete occlusion of the defect without residual shunt or with only a minimal shunt was achieved in 92.3% (no shunt, n=73; trivial shunt, n=23). Four patients required a second procedure for residual shunt occlusion. Two devices had to be surgically explanted due to severe hemolysis. There were no deaths or other major complications. CONCLUSIONS: The NitOcclud device can be used successfully for a wide anatomical spectrum of VSD. The main issue is residual shunt, but its incidence decreases over time. The incidence of hemolysis was very low and no permanent changes were detected in atrioventricular conduction.","Solana-Gracia, Ruth; Mendoza Soto, Alberto; Carrasco Moreno, José Ignacio; Del Cerro Marín, María Jesús; Gutiérrez-Larraya Aguado, Federico; Coserría Sánchez, José Félix; Blanco Mata, Roberto; Prada Martínez, Fredy Hermógenes; Pan Álvarez-Ossorio, Manuel; Jiménez Montañés, Lorenzo; Pérez de Prado, Armando; Rodríguez Vázquez Del Rey, María Del Mar; Gutiérrez García, Hipólito; Velasco Bayón, José Manuel; Zunzunegui Martínez, José Luis",Rev. esp. de cardiol.

These health professionals include tutors and resident intern specialists, due to the growing demand for the former and the high work overload of the latter. Mindfulness training programs can support these professionals during times of crisis, such as the current global pandemic caused by the coronavirus-19 disease. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of an abbreviated Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) training program in relation to a standard training program on the levels of mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-perceived empathy in tutors and resident intern specialists of Family and Community Medicine and Nursing. A total of 112 professionals attached to six Spanish National Health System teaching units (TUs) participated in this randomized and controlled clinical trial. Experimental Group (GE) participants were included in the standard or abbreviated MBSR programs. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the Self-Compassion Scale short form (SCS-SF), and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) were administered three times during the study: before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Adjusted covariance analysis (ANCOVA), using pretest scores as the covariate, showed a significant increase in mindfulness (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,91)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.271;p = 0.042;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.067) and self-compassion (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,91)&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.046;p = 0.003;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.117) in the post-test visit, and in self-compassion (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,79)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.880;p = 0.025;eta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.089) in the follow-up visit, attributable to the implementation of the standard training program. The standard MBSR and MSC training program improves levels of mindfulness and self-compassion, and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident intern specialists.

Recently (2019), two extensive reports from preeminent federal authorities - the Chief Public Health Officer and the Mental Health Commission of Canada - have been tabled with detailed, core focus on the phenomenon of 'stigma' and its impacts on substance/opioid use and harms. The reports present extensive descriptions of the nature and effects, as well as a multitude of prescriptions for remedial measures and actions to ""stop the cycle of stigma"". Closer reading of the documents, however, suggests substantial conceptual and empirical limitations in the characterization of the - multi-faceted and challenging - nature and workings of 'stigma' as a socio-political, structural or individual process or force, specifically as it applies to and negatively affects substance use and related outcomes, primarily the wellbeing of substance users. Concretely, it is unclear how the remedial actions proposed will materially alleviate stigma process and impacts, especially given apparent gaps in the issues examined, including essential strategies - for example, reform of drug user criminalization as a fundamental element and driver of structural stigma - for action that directly relate to the jurisdictions and privileged mandates of the report sources themselves as health and policy leaders. The commentary provides some concrete while subjective notes and observations on the dynamics of stigma as applies to and framed for substance/opioid use, as well as strategies and measures necessary to both tangibly address the material health and wellbeing of substance users, and related forces of stigma, in the distinct context of the opioid crisis in Canada.","Fischer, Benedikt",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,320,5

Associations between mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their city and the magnitude of life expectancy disparity in their city are not moderated by the social or fiscal ideology of mayoral officials or the ideology of their constituents. Highly visible and publicized information about mortality disparities, such as that related to COVID-19 disparities, has potential to elevate elected officials' perceptions of the severity of health disparities and influence their opinions about the issue. CONTEXT: A substantive body of research has explored what factors influence elected officials' opinions about health issues. However, no studies have assessed the potential influence of the health of an elected official's constituents. We assessed whether the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity within a city was associated with the opinions of that city's mayoral official (i.e., mayor or deputy mayor) about health disparities in their city. METHODS: The independent variable was the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in US cities. The magnitude was determined by linking 2010-2015 estimates of life expectancy and median household income for 8,434 census tracts in 224 cities. The dependent variables were mayoral officials' opinions from a 2016 survey about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city (n = 224, response rate 30.3%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for characteristics of mayoral officials (e.g., ideology) and city characteristics. FINDINGS: In cities in the highest income-based life expectancy disparity quartile, 50.0% of mayoral officials ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 52.7% believed health disparities were ""very unfair."" In comparison, among mayoral officials in cities in the lowest disparity quartile 33.9% ""strongly agreed"" that health disparities existed and 22.2% believed the disparities were ""very unfair."" A 1-year-larger income-based life expectancy disparity in a city was associated with 25% higher odds that the city's mayoral official would ""strongly agree"" that health disparities existed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; P = .04) and twice the odds that the city's mayoral official would believe that such disparities were ""very unfair"" (OR = 2.24; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their jurisdictions are generally aligned with, and potentially influenced by, information about the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparities among their constituents.","Purtle, Jonathan; Joshi, Rennie; LÊ-Scherban, FÉlice; Henson, Rosie Mae; Diez Roux, Ana V",Milbank q,320,32

Here, we present the findings of an exploratory study that examined what a preventative telemedicine system, based around a centralized platform and connected wearable devices, might look like. The data were collected during 2019, ahead of the pandemic, and include interviews with three key stakeholders: a doctor working in a hospital emergency room, the director of a service providing mobile resuscitation teams, and a user of a wearable device who discovered, through the device, that he had a serious cardiac pathology. The study uses the HINGE digital transformation model both as a methodology, and as a structure for presenting an outline of the key features of our proposed approach. We conclude by highlighting some of the benefits of our system, both in light of the context for the original study, and in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred afterward.","Quévat, Alexandre; Heinze, Aleksej",Global Bus.

Albumin oxidation and breakdown affect interactions with bioactive lipid mediators that play important roles in antimicrobial defense and repair. There is bio-mechanistic plausibility for a causal link between hypoalbuminemia and increased risks of primary and secondary infections. Serum albumin levels have prognostic value for complications in viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and for infectious complications of non-infective chronic conditions. Hypoalbuminemia predicts the development of healthcare-associated infections, particularly with Clostridium difficile. In coronavirus disease 2019, hypoalbuminemia correlates with viral load and degree of acute lung injury and organ dysfunction. Non-oncotic properties of albumin affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobials. Low serum albumin is associated with inadequate antimicrobial treatment. Infusion of human albumin solution (HAS) supplements endogenous albumin in patients with cirrhosis of the liver and effectively supported antimicrobial therapy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence of the beneficial effects of HAS on infections in hypoalbuminemic patients without cirrhosis is largely observational. Prospective RCTs are underway and, if hypotheses are confirmed, could lead to changes in clinical practice for the management of hypoalbuminemic patients with infections or at risk of infectious complications.","Wiedermann, Christian J",Int. j. mol. sci.

We examined the possible complementary role of lab developed class-specific clinical serology in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. Serological tests for IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using samples from real time RT PCR (qRT-PCR)-confirmed in-patient COVID-19 cases. We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed a higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients when compared to IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve (AUC): 0.91; 95%CI 0.89 to 0.93 vs. IgA AUC: 0.97; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98 vs. IgM AUC: 0.95; 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first two weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.","Verkerke, Hans; Horwath, Michael; Saeedi, Bejan; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W; Owens, Joshua; Arthur, Connie M; Nakahara, Hirotomo; Rha, Jennifer; Patel, Kashyap; Wu, Shang-Chuen; Paul, Anu; Yasin, Nini; Wang, Jianmei; Shin, Sooncheon; Brown, DeAndre; Normile, Katherine; Cole, Lisa; Meyers, Mark; Lin, Heather; Woods, Emily; Isaac, Jennifer; Broder, Kari; Wade, Jenna; Kauffman, Robert C; Patel, Ravi; Josephson, Cassandra D; Reynolds, Stacian; Sherman, Melanie; Wrammert, Jens; Alter, David; Guarner, Jeannette; Roback, John D; Neish, Andrew; Stowell, Sean R",J. clin. microbiol,320,1

WhatsApp is being used as an important source of Corona virus related information during the current pandemic. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp has limited studies investigating its role as a source of communication, information or misinformation during crisis situations. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to identify vulnerability of demographic cohorts in a developing country towards Coronavirus related misinformation shared via WhatsApp (vulnerability denoted as K). We also aim at identifying WhatsApp message characteristics associated with increased credibility of misinformation. METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was conducted. A scoring system based on theories supported by existing literature was designed. A ratio of respondent's score to maximum score was calculated as K. Respondents were stratified according to age and occupation and Kmean was calculated and compared among each subgroup using single-factor ANOVA and Hochbergs-GT2 tests. The questionnaire contained questions investigating the respondents' opinion of the veracity of a Coronavirus related WhatsApp message (CRWM). The responses to the false-proven CRWMs were compared using z-test among two groups - CRWMs with an attached link and/or source and those without. RESULTS: We analyzed 1137 responses from WhatsApp users from India. Users over 65 years had highest vulnerability (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI [0.341-0.419]) to misinformation. Respondents in age group 19-25 years had a significantly lower vulnerability (Kmean =0.31, 95% CI [0.301-0.319]) compared to all respondents aged over 25 years (P<.05). Users employed in elementary occupations had the highest vulnerability (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI [0.356-0.404]) and it was significantly higher than that of professionals and students (P<.05). Surprisingly, vulnerability of healthcare workers was not significantly different than any other occupation group (P>.05). We found that false CRWMs with an attached link and/or source were marked true 6 times more often than the false CRWMs without an attached link or source (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that in a developing country. WhatsApp users over 65 years age and those involved in elementary occupations were found to be most vulnerable to false information through WhatsApp. HCWs who are otherwise considered as experts with regards to this global health care calamity, also shared this vulnerability to misinformation with other occupation groups. The study also demonstrates that presence of an attached link and/or source falsely validating an incorrect message adds significant false credibility making it appear true. These results indicate an emergent need to address and rectify current usage patterns of WhatsApp users. The study also provides metrics that can be used by health care organizations and government authorities of developing countries to formulate guidelines to curb WhatsApp related misinformation.","Bapaye, Jay Amol; Bapaye, Harsh Amol",,320,20

Design/methodology/approach: In the spring of 2020, global clothing retailers were advised or ordered to close physical stores due to lockdown measures of the COVID-19 pandemic and many supply chains temporarily halted production. This paper explains how pre-pandemic modern slavery advancements will be detrimentally affected as a result of societal lockdowns and apparel retail closures around the world. Findings: Two consequences of lockdowns are highlighted, which will have negative implications on modern slavery progress. These are the exploitation of vulnerable people, which includes higher exploitation of those already involved in modern slavery and increased risk of exploitation for those susceptible to being drawn (back) into modern slavery and;the need for repetition of previous work completed by external stakeholders or in some cases, a better alternative. Practical implications: The pandemic itself causes friction between immediate response solutions and long-term modern slavery goals. Social implications: In response to modern slavery drivers, governments may need to fill governance gaps, to control the power of corporations and to reconsider migration regulation. Originality/value: The COVID-19 lockdowns and subsequent supply chain disruptions were unforeseen. This paper argues that there are significant negative effects on the developments in modern slavery eradication made in the past 10 years. As businesses struggled for basic survival, the apparel manufacturing sector has been detrimentally affected as upstream labourers are now at higher risk from the increased likelihood of modern slavery violations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cole, R.; Shirgholami, Z.",Supply Chain Management,320,1

The aim of this study is to evaluate differences in the patients referred to exercise stress testing in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and analyse the feasibility and results of these tests wearing a facemask. METHODS: We included all patients referred for an exercise test from 1 June to 30 September 2020 and compared them with the patients attended within the same period in 2019 before and after propensity score matching. All patients referred in 2020 wore a facemask. RESULTS: A total of 854 patients were included: 398 in the 2020 group and 456 in 2019. No significant differences in baseline characteristics of the patients were observed, with the exception of dyspnoea, which was nearly twice as high in 2020 as compared with 2019. Regarding the results of the tests, no differences were observed, with almost 80% of maximal tests, similar functional capacity and over a 20% of positive exercise tests in both groups. These results remained after propensity score matching. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has not changed the clinical profile of patients referred to exercise testing.

However, Covid-19 can serve as a test case of the expected response of the new healthcare system under Vision 2030. This study used data from the thirteen present administrative regions of KSA to simulate the variations in ICU admission as a quality indicator in the five business units proposed by a new Model of Care. METHODS: We determined the rates of ICU admission for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) from March to mid-July 2020. The final sample included 1743 inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Patient characteristics, including demographics, pre-existing chronic conditions, and COVID-19 complications, were collected. Business units (BUs) were compared with respect to the relative odds of ICU admission by using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: After keeping patient and clinical characteristics constant, clear BU differences were observed in the relative odds of ICU admission of COVID-19 patients. Inpatient admission to ICU in our total sample was almost 50%. Compared to the Central BU, the Northern and Western BUs showed significantly higher odds of ICU admission while the Eastern & Southern BUs had significantly lower odds. CONCLUSION: ICU use for COVID-19 patients differed significantly in KSA healthcare BUs, consistent with variations in care for other non-COVID-19-related conditions. These differences cannot be explained by patient or clinical characteristics, suggesting quality-of-care differences. We believe that privatization and the shift to fewer administrative BUs will help lessen or eliminate altogether the present variations in healthcare service provision.","Alharbi, Abdullah A; Alqassim, Ahmad Y; Gosadi, Ibrahim M; Aqeeli, Abdulwahab A; Muaddi, Mohammed A; Makeen, Anwar M; Alhazmi, Abdulaziz H; Alharbi, Ahmad A",J Infect Public Health,320,20

However, absolute death counts can be misleading. Estimating age- and sex-specific mortality rates is necessary in order to account for the underlying population structure. Furthermore, given the difficulty of assigning causes of death, excess all-cause mortality should be estimated to assess the overall burden of the pandemic. METHODS: By estimating weekly age- and sex-specific death rates during 2020 and during the preceding five years, our aim is to get more accurate estimates of the excess mortality attributed to COVID-19 in Sweden, and in the most affected region Stockholm. RESULTS: Eight weeks after Sweden's first confirmed case, the death rates at all ages above 60 were higher than for previous years. Persons above age 80 were disproportionally more affected, and men suffered greater excess mortality than women in ages up to 75 years. At older ages, the excess mortality was similar for men and women, with up to 1.5 times higher death rates for Sweden and up to 3 times higher for Stockholm. Life expectancy at age 50 declined by less than 1 year for Sweden and 1.5 years for Stockholm compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The excess mortality has been high in older ages during the pandemic, but it remains to be answered if this is because of age itself being a prognostic factor or a proxy for comorbidity. Only monitoring deaths at a national level may hide the effect of the pandemic on the regional level.","Modig, Karin; Ahlbom, Anders; Ebeling, Marcus",Eur. j. public health,320,1

Controversy surrounds the lockdown as it is a choice between economic freedom and public health. The ultimate solution to a pandemic is to vaccinate a massive population to achieve herd immunity. However, the whole vaccination programme is a long and complicated process. The virus and the vaccine will persist for quite a long time. How to gradually ease the lockdown based on vaccination progress is an important issue, as both economic and epidemiological issues are involved. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and public health in the process of vaccination rollout. The model provides an approach of vaccine value estimation. Our results provide scientific suggestion for policymakers to make important decisions about when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be over the entire vaccination cycle.","Fu, Yuting; Jin, Hanqing; Xiang, Haitao; Wang, Ning",Financ Res Lett,320,12

A mitoptosis in EAC is characterized by the appearance of many autolyzing mitochondria, the fusion of which leads to rupture of the cell membrane and the ejection of the nucleus from the cell. It is assumed that the polymorphism of EAC destruction patterns is explained by the different physiological state of the cells, which determines the ""choice"" of the cell death mechanism.

Until September 10th, 2020, Indonesia had submitted 54 WGS. In this study, we have analyzed and annotated SARS-CoV-2 mutations in spike protein and main proteases. Materials and Methods: The Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) of Indonesia were obtained from GISAID data base. The 54 data were taken from March to September 10th, 2020. The sequences corresponded to Spike Protein (SP), 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), and papain like protease (PLpro) were selected. The Wuhan genome was used as reference. Results: In total WGS from Indonesia, we found 5 major clades, which dominated as G clade, where the mutation of D614G was found. This D614G was identified as much as 59%, which mostly reported in late samples submitted. Beside D614G mutation, we report three unique mutations: A352S, S477I, and Q677H. Besides, some mutations were also detected in two domains that were expected to be conserved region, the main viral proteases: PLpro (P77L and V205I), 3CLpro (M49I and L50F). Conclusion: The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from WGS Indonesia showed a high genetic variation. The diversity in SARSCoV-2 may epidemiologically enhance virulence and transmission of this virus. The prevalence of D614G over the time in different locations, indicating that changes in this mutation may related to host infection and the viral transmission. However, some mutations that have been reported in this study were not eligible for the most stable conformation. © 2021 The Authors.","Ulfah, M.; Helianti, I.",Iranian Journal of Microbiology,320,1

Psychological preparedness, the primed cognitive awareness and anticipation of dealing with emotional responses in an adverse situation, has assumed a compelling relevance during a health disaster of this magnitude. METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was conducted in India to assess psychological preparedness towards the ongoing pandemic with a focus on knowledge, management of own and others' emotional response and anticipatory coping mechanisms amongst the survey population. An adapted version of the qualitative Psychological Preparedness for Natural Disaster scale validated by the World Health Organization was widely circulated over the internet and various social media platforms for assessment. Results are expressed as median ± standard deviation). Descriptive stats were used and figures downloaded from surveymonkey.com. RESULTS: Of the 1120 respondents (M: F 1.7:1, age 35 years ±14.1) most expressed a high level of perceived knowledge and confidence of managing COVID-19, such as awareness of the symptoms of the illness (95.1%), actions needed (94.4%), hospital to report to (88.9%), and emergency contact number (89.1%). A majority monitored news bulletins and scientific journals regarding COVID-19 regularly (95%). However, nearly one-third (29.2%) could not assess their likelihood of developing COVID-19, and 17.5% were unaware of the difference between a mild and severe infection. Twenty- three per cent (23.3%) were unfamiliar with the materials needed in an acute illness situation. CONCLUSION: Psychological disaster preparedness is reasonable, although lacking in specific domains. Timely but focused interventions can be a cost-efficient administrative exercise which federal agencies may prioritize working on.","Agarwal, Vishwesh; Sharma, Supriya; Gupta, Latika; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Davalbhakta, Samira; Agarwal, Vikas; Goel, Ashish; Aggarwal, Shelley",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,320,1

According to Galatzer-Levy ( 2016 :419), complexity, change, development, creativity and adaptive behaviour only really become possible when a system functions at the edge of chaos. [...]systems that are regulated using a simple set of rules often adapt more efficiently to challenging situations as individual elements in the system are allowed to self-organise and change their behaviours in line with the challenge presented. Continuing the example of the traffic circle cited above, self-organising systems such as a traffic circle might appear chaotic in their functioning;however, they often streamline traffic and the flow thereof much more efficiently than more regulated systems such as traffic lights that are more predictable and regulated in their function but slow down traffic flow, which can lead to traffic congestion during certain parts of the day.","Coetzee, Christo",Jàmbá,320,24

This is the first case of COVID-19 officially confirmed in that country. Several cases have continued to increase since then. President Jokowi began issuing policies on the spread of this virus. This is different from other countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, which responded from the previous month when the Indonesian government still stated that coronavirus does not exist in Indonesia. Our case study is to find a public opinion through social network analysis of Indonesian public policy during the beginning of the Indonesian COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. This research implements text mining and document-based sentiments on Twitter data that is reprocessed through machine learning techniques using the Naïve Bayes method. We found negative opinions in the period more dominant by 46%, while that was 35% positive sentiment and 20% neutral.

Although these vaccines required the co-administration of antigens with adjuvants to induce a strong humoral response, they could only elicit a poor CD8+ T-cell response. In contrast, next-generation nano/microparticle-based vaccines offer several advantages over traditional ones because they can induce a more potent CD8+ T-cell response and, at the same time, are ideal carriers for proteins, adjuvants, and nucleic acids. The fact that these nanocarriers can be loaded with molecules able to modulate the immune response by inducing different effector functions and regulatory activities makes them ideal tools for inverse vaccination, whose goal is to shut down the immune response in autoimmune diseases. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and liposomes are biocompatible materials approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and are, therefore, suitable for nanoparticle-based vaccines. Recently, another candidate platform for innovative vaccines based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been shown to efficiently co-deliver antigens and adjuvants. This review will discuss the potential use of PLGA-NPs, liposomes, and EVs as carriers of peptides, adjuvants, mRNA, and DNA for the development of next-generation vaccines against endemic and emerging viruses in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

We aimed to describe a novel strategy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a tertiary referral proctology center during the first wave of infection in Italy. METHODS: All patients booked appointments at the Proctology Unit between March 9th and May 4th 2020 were identified. Patients booked for a first visit underwent a structured remote consultation. Patients with perianal or sacrococcygeal abscesses, major anorectal bleeding, incoercible anal pain and red flags for malignancy were labelled as 'non-deferrable'. A flowchart was designed to comply with adequate assistance of proctologic patients. Demographics, clinical data and outcomes of in-office procedures were collected. RESULTS: On a total of 548 booked visits, 198 (36.1%) were cancelled before remote consultation. Of the remaining 350, 112 (32.0%) attended a follow-up visit. Among 238 (68.0%) patients undergoing remote consultation, 88 (25.1%) were deemed 'deferrable' and 148 (42.3%) 'nondeferrable'. 2 (0.6%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 while waiting for an outpatient visit. 25/88 (28.4%) deferrable patients cancelled their appointment as felt no longer necessary. A total of 45/148 (30.4%) non deferrable patients (mean age, 46 years; 31% females) underwent in-office procedures, most often related to anal abscess and/or fistula (48.9%). Final diagnosis of malignancy occurred in 4 cases. A 55% increase in the number of in-office procedures was noted compared to the previous year. None of the attending patients nor staff members resulted COVID-19 positive during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the uncertainties accompanying the use of remote consultations in proctology, the results of this study may inform the development of strategies for restructuring activities in response to future emergencies of this magnitude.","Giani, Iacopo; Gallo, Gaetano; Grossi, Ugo; Tanda, Cinzia; Linari, Chiara; Elbetti, Claudio",,320,16

Thus, a web-based survey was conducted to decipher the approach of Indian doctors to the various options for treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire among one lakh doctors across India through email and social media was circulated. After data quality and internal validation, 826 responses were included for analysis. Basic demographic and comparative analysis were performed using the Python3.8.2 software (Windows 10 64 bit, USA). RESULTS: Amongst all the states of India most respondents hailed from the top ten affected states. Overall 76.15% of doctors would either prescribe or consider prescribing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as prophylaxis for health-care providers (HCP). Doctors with experience of managing COVID-19 were more likely to advocate use of HCQ as prophylaxis for HCP (&#967;2 = 4.357, P = 0.037). Intensivists were more likely to advocate HCQ as prophylaxis (&#967;2 = 14.588, P < 0.001) as well as for management of mild to moderate COVID-19 (&#967;2 = 3.91, P = 0.048). In COVID-19, 65.8% doctors overwhelmingly preferred using anti-viral agents in severe cases, continuing ACEi/ARB (60.9%), and routinely screening for COVID-19 as a pre-operative strategy (73.85%). CONCLUSIONS: Indian doctors are largely following the scientific guidance provided by Indian National Task Force for COVID-19 and would consider prescribing HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19.

Individuals with prolonged symptom duration maintained antigen-specific T-cell response magnitudes to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in CD4+ and cTfh populations during late convalescence while those without persistent symptoms demonstrated an expected decline. The prolonged group also displayed increased IgG avidity to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein. Significant correlations between symptom duration and both SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and antibodies were observed. Activation and exhaustion markers were evaluated in multiple immune cell types, revealing few phenotypic differences between prolonged and recovered groups suggesting that prolonged symptom duration is not due to persistent systemic inflammation. These findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are maintained in patients suffering from prolonged post-COVID-19 symptom duration in contrast to those with resolved symptoms and may suggest the persistence of viral antigens as an underlying etiology.","Files, Jacob K; Sarkar, Sanghita; Fram, Timothy R; Boppana, Sushma; Sterrett, Sarah; Qin, Kai; Bansal, Anju; Long, Dustin M; Sabbaj, Steffanie; Kobie, James J; Goepfert, Paul A; Erdmann, Nathan",JCI insight,320,1

Twitter may represent a powerful tool to help achieve this. Here, we explore the role of Twitter as used by Group of Seven (G7) world leaders in response to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a qualitative study with content analysis. Inclusion criteria were as follows: viral tweets from G7 world leaders, attracting a minimum of 500 'likes'; keywords 'COVID-19' or 'coronavirus'; search dates 17 November 2019 to 17 March 2020. We performed content analysis to categorize tweets into appropriate themes and analyzed associated Twitter data. RESULTS: Eight out of nine (88.9%) G7 world leaders had verified and active Twitter accounts, with a total following of 85.7 million users. Out of a total 203 viral tweets, 166 (82.8%) were classified as 'Informative', of which 48 (28.6%) had weblinks to government-based sources, while 19 (9.4%) were 'Morale-boosting' and 14 (6.9%) were 'Political'. Numbers of followers and viral tweets were not strictly related. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter may represent a powerful tool for world leaders to rapidly communicate public health information with citizens.

In developing countries including Ethiopia, about half of children are estimated to be anemic. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence of anemia and its predictor factors among children in Ethiopia. Method: The studies were identified through explicit and exhaustive search of reputable databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Science Direct, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and the hand search of reference lists of previous prevalence studies to retrieve more related articles. Thirty-nine studies were selected based on a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized and pre-tested data extraction checklist, and the analysis was done using STATA 14 statistical software. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistic and I2 tests were used. In our analysis, considerable heterogeneity was observed. Therefore, a random effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of anemia. Moreover, the predictor factors of anemia were examined. Results: The forest plot of 39 included studies revealed that the overall pooled prevalence of anemia among children in Ethiopia was 34.4% (95% CI: 29.1, 39.7%). Sub-group analysis showed that the highest anemia prevalence was observed in Somali Region with a prevalence of 49.4 % (95% CI: 20.9, 77.8). Also, anemia in children was found to be highest in the age group of less than five years (45.2, 95% CI: 39.6,50.8). Low literacy of families: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.7), low family socioeconomic status: 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1,3.01.3), having housewife mothers or with no job: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4, 1.9) and rural residence: 3.3 (95% CI: 1.7,6.1) were found to be predictors of anemia among children. Conclusion: In this study, one in three children were anemic in Ethiopia. It is a moderate public health problem in children in this study. Low literacy, low socioeconomic status as well as rural residence of the families and helminthic infection of the children were found to be predictors of anemia in the children.

To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers);(b) policy (55 papers);(c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study analyzed clinical and biological profiles of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection at admission, including hemostasis tests and quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs). RESULTS: Among 96 consecutive COVID-19-suspected patients fulfilling criteria for hospitalization, 66 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to present with fever (P = .02), cough (P = .03), and pneumonia at computed tomography (CT) scan (P = .002) at admission. Prevalence of D-dimer >500 ng/mL was higher in COVID-19-positive patients (74.2% versus 43.3%; P = .007). No sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation were identified. Adding D-dimers >500 ng/mL to gender and pneumonia at CT scan in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis significantly increased area under the curve for COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19-positive patients had significantly more CECs at admission (P = .008) than COVID-19-negative ones. COVID-19-positive patients treated with curative anticoagulant prior to admission had fewer CECs (P = .02) than those without. Interestingly, patients treated with curative anticoagulation and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had even fewer CECs (P = .007). CONCLUSION: Curative anticoagulation could prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and endothelial lesion.","Khider, Lina; Gendron, Nicolas; Goudot, Guillaume; Chocron, Richard; Hauw-Berlemont, Caroline; Cheng, Charles; Rivet, Nadia; Pere, Helene; Roffe, Ariel; Clerc, Sébastien; Lebeaux, David; Debuc, Benjamin; Veyer, David; Rance, Bastien; Gaussem, Pascale; Bertil, Sébastien; Badoual, Cécile; Juvin, Philippe; Planquette, Benjamin; Messas, Emmanuel; Sanchez, Olivier; Hulot, Jean-Sébastien; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Smadja, David M",J. thromb. haemost,320,1

Most studies on immune responses in COVID-19 have focused on moderately or severely symptomatic patients; however, little is known about the immune response in asymptomatic and re-detectable positive (RP) patients. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 48 COVID-19 patients which included 8 asymptomatic, 13 symptomatic, 15 recovered and 12 RP patients. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified six co-expression modules, of which the turquoise module was positively correlated with the asymptomatic, symptomatic, and recovered COVID-19 patients. The red module positively correlated with symptomatic patients only and the blue and brown modules positively correlated with the RP patients. The analysis by single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed a lower level of IFN response and complement activation in the asymptomatic patients compared with the symptomatic, indicating a weaker immune response of the PBMCs in the asymptomatic patients. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) analysis showed the enrichment of TNF&#945;/NF-&#954;B and influenza infection in the RP patients compared with the recovered patients, indicating a hyper-inflammatory immune response in the PBMC of RP patients.

Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19-EAVE II-database comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 5·4 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices. Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis. A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1-adjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 65·0 years (SD 16·2). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85-94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28-34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75-94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72-89 at 28-34 days post-vaccination). INTERPRETATION: Mass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland. There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.

It begins by tracing two rival competing positions in the sociology of art, derived from Becker and Bourdieu, before taking a closer look at how Hogarth's work conjures up a new vision of the world, providing shape and meaning to the nation's changing understandings of morality, society, and the city. A fundamental transformation in the field of representation appears halfway through the eighteenth century and the interweaving of art theory, national identity, and systems of patronage are at the centre of this dynamic period. It is no accident that in Hogarth's world the main targets are those who seek to transgress their stations in life and cross class barriers. By combining two different sociological approaches to art the study builds a more nuanced picture of the artist and his work.","Carrabine, Eamonn",Br. j. sociol,320,1

Low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, common in people with obesity, is associated with the development of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, well known comorbidities that adversely affect the outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Risk stratification based on the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), which classifies obesity based on the presence of medical, mental, and/or functional complications rather than on body mass index (BMI), has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause mortality and it may well be that EOSS stages may better describe the risk of hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Analyzing a group of metabolic ill patients with obesity (EOSS 2 and 3), we found an increased interleukin-6 and linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.014) and waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) (p = 0.031).

We aimed at summarising the strength of evidence in the published literature on the association of physical and mental health with social connection via social isolation, living alone and loneliness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in April 2020 to identify meta-analyses using the Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases. The search strategy included terms of social isolation, loneliness, living alone and meta-analysis. Eligible meta-analyses needed to report any sort of association between an indicator of social connection and any physical or mental health outcome. The findings were summarised in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty-five meta-analyses met our criteria, of which 10 focused on physical health and 15 on mental health outcomes. The results suggest that lack of social connection is associated with chronic physical symptoms, frailty, coronary heart disease, malnutrition, hospital readmission, reduced vaccine uptake, early mortality, depression, social anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment in later life and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence clearly indicates that social connection is associated with a range of poor physical and mental health outcomes. A potential negative impact on these outcomes needs to be considered in future decisions on physical distancing measures.","Morina, Nexhmedin; Kip, Ahlke; Hoppen, Thole Hilko; Priebe, Stefan; Meyer, Thomas",BMJ Open,320,2

Our objective was to determine the compliance with respiratory hygiene of triage nurses at 2 university hospital centers and to identify factors influencing compliance to the respiratory hygiene principles of emergency health care workers. METHODS: A 2-part, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted at 2 training centers. An anonymous observation of compliance with respiratory hygiene by triage emergency nurses was performed. A self-administered, voluntary questionnaire on attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge of respiratory hygiene guidelines was distributed to the health care workers at the emergency department of the 2 hospital sites. RESULTS: Median objective compliance with respiratory hygiene measures of triage nurses was 22% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-33%). Median perceived compliance of the health care workers was 68% (IQR, 61%-79%). Median actual knowledge score was 75% (IQR, 75%-100%). Overall, 91.9% of respondents believed that the mask was an effective preventive measure. The main obstacles toward mask wearing by the health care worker were “tendency to forget” (37.8%) and “discomfort” (35.1%). CONCLUSION: The compliance rate at our institution is very low.

Here we aimed to characterize the PPFIA4 gene, as a glycolysis-related oncogene in promoting the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells. Using bioinformatical tools including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), we found that PPFIA4 expression and methylation levels were higher in colon cancer tissues of different stages than in normal tissues. Higher PPFIA4 level was also positively correlated with poorer survival of patients. PPFIA4 upregulation also correlated with poor prognosis and higher clinical stages of colon cancer patients. Colon cancer cell viability, migration and migration were enhanced after PPFIA4 overexpression. EMT markers and glycolysis were upregulated after PPFIA4 overexpression. PPFIA4 expression was found to be positively correlated with PFKFB3 and ENO2 levels, while knockdown of PFKFB3 and ENO2 reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. PPFIA4 upregulation is a potential biomarker in colon cancer which promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis. The upregulation of PFKFB3/ENO2 signaling by PPFIA4 is a potential mechanism underlying the oncogenic effects of PPFIA4.","Huang, Jia; Yang, Meiling; Liu, Zhaoxia; Li, Xiaoqian; Wang, Junfeng; Fu, Nian; Cao, Ting; Yang, Xuefeng",Front Oncol,320,16

A wide range of health related factors including Body Mass Index (BMI) is reported to be associated with the disease. In the present study, we analyzed global databases to assess the correlation of BMI and cholesterol with the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: In this ecological study, we used age-standardized BMI and cholesterol levels as well as the incidence and mortality ratio of COVID-19 at the national-levels obtained from the publicly available databases such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC). Bivariate correlation analysis was applied to assess the correlations between the study variables. Mean differences (standard deviation: SD) of BMI and cholesterol levels of different groups were tested using independent sample t-test or Mann–Whitney rank test as appropriate. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify variables affecting the incidence and mortality ratio of COVID-19. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality ratio of COVID-19 were significantly higher in developed (29,639.85 ± 20,210.79 for cases and 503.24 ± 414.65 for deaths) rather than developing (8153.76 ± 11,626.36 for cases and 169.95 ± 265.78 for deaths) countries (P < 0.01). Results indicated that the correlations of BMI and cholesterol level with COVID-19 are stronger in countries with younger population. In general, the BMI and cholesterol level were positively correlated with COVID-19 incidence ratio (β = 2396.81 and β = 30,932.80, p < 0.01,‌ respectively) and mortality ratio (β = 38.18 and β = 417.52, p < 0.05,‌ respectively) after adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors. CONCLUSION: Countries with higher BMI or cholesterol at aggregate levels had a higher ratios of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. The aggregated level of cholesterol and BMI are important risk factors for COVID-19 major outcomes, especially in developing countries with younger populations. We recommend monitoring and promotion of health indicices to better prevent morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

Link workers have been piloted in areas of deprivation, but there remains insufficient evidence to support their effectiveness. Multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence, but there are limited evidence-based interventions. This paper presents the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will test the effectiveness of link workers based in general practices in deprived areas in improving health outcomes for people with multimorbidity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol presents the proposed pragmatic RCT, involving 10 general practitioner (GP) practices and 600 patients. Eligible participants will be community dwelling adults with multimorbidity (≥two chronic conditions) identified as being suitable for referral to a practice-based link worker. Following baseline data collection, the patients will be randomised into intervention group that will meet the link worker over a1-month period, or a ‘wait list’ control that will receive usual GP care. Primary outcomes are health-related quality of life as assessed by EQ-5D-5L and mental health assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes are based on the core outcome set for multimorbidity. Data will be collected at baseline and on intervention completion at 1 month using questionnaires self-completed by participants and GP records. Parallel process and economic analyses will be conducted to explore participants’ experiences and examine cost-effectiveness of the link worker intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Irish College of General Practitioners Ethics Committee. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Initially, a mediation model verified a partially mediated population role in the relationship between landscape pattern and infection number. Adjusted incidence rate (AIR) and community safety index (CSI), two indicators for infection risk in sub-districts, were 25.82∼63.56 ‱ and 3.00∼15.87 respectively, and central urban sub-districts were at higher infection risk. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) performed better than OLS regression with AICc differences of 7.951∼181.261. The adjusted R(2) in GWR models of class-level index and infection risk were 0.697 to 0.817, while for the landscape-level index they were 0.668 to 0.835. Secondly, 16 key landscape metrics were identified based on GWR, and then a prediction model for infection risk in sub-districts and communities was developed. Using principal component analysis (PCA), development intensity, landscape level, and urban blue-green space were considered to be principal components affecting disease infection risk, explaining 73.1 % of the total variance. Cropland (PLAND and LSI), urban land (NP, LPI, and LSI) and unused land (NP) represent development intensity, greatly affecting infection risk in urban areas. Landscape level CONTAG, DIVISION, SHDI, and SHEI represent mobility and connectivity, having a profound impact on infection risk in both urban and suburban areas. Water (PLAND, NP, LPI, and LSI) and woodland (NP, and LSI) represent urban blue-green spaces, and were particularly important for infection risk in suburban areas. Based on urban landscape pattern, we proposed a framework to understand and evaluate infection risk. These findings provide a basis for risk evaluation and policy-making of urban infectious disease, which is significant for community management and urban planning for infectious disease worldwide.","Ye, Yang; Qiu, Hongfei",Urban For Urban Green,320,6

Due to the limited evidence available on the dynamics of the virus and effective treatment options available, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact in terms of morbidity and mortality. The economic impact is still to be assessed. Aims: The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the multiple treatment options available, to consider the future of this global pandemic, and to identify some potential options that could revolutionize the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, this article underscores the sheer importance of repurposing some of the available antiviral and antimicrobial agents that have long been in use so as to have an effective and expeditious response to this widespread pandemic and the need to conduct a multicenter global randomized controlled trial to find an effective single antiviral agent or a cocktail of available antimicrobial agents. Method: We thoroughly searched and reviewed various case reports, retrospective analyses, and in vitro studies published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar regarding the treatment options used for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 since its outbreak in an attempt to highlight treatments with the most promising results. Conclusion: We are currently facing one of the worst pandemics in history. Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat. Unfortunately, no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 or effective drug regimen for COVID-19 currently exists. Drug repurposing of available antiviral agents may provide a respite; moreover, a cocktail of antiviral agents may be helpful in treating this disease. Here, we have highlighted a few available antimicrobial agents that could be very effective in treating COVID-19; indeed, a number of trials are underway to detect and confirm the efficacy of these agents.","Ali, Mukarram Jamat; Hanif, Muhammad; Haider, Muhammad Adnan; Ahmed, Muhammad Umer; Sundas, FNU; Hirani, Arham; Khan, Izhan Ali; Anis, Khurram; Karim, Amin H.",Front Med (Lausanne),320,1

Current findings regarding plasma/serum homocysteine (HCY) levels in AS patients are inconsistent. This study aims to systematically evaluate the association between circulating HCY levels and AS. METHODS: Online electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang data) were used to retrieve all relevant articles published up to May 7, 2020. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the random-effect model, Stata16 software. RESULTS: Nine articles containing 778 AS patients and 522 controls were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in HCY levels were found between AS and control groups (pooled SMD = 0.46, 95% CI = − 0.30 to 1.23, P = 0.23). However, subgroup analysis suggested that HCY levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the AS group treated with methotrexate (MTX) compared with the control group. In contrast, HCY levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the AS group receiving anti-TNF-α treatment compared with the control group. No significant differences were detected between HCY levels and disease activity scores (Bath AS disease activity index, BASDAI), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis indicates that HCY levels are similar between AS and controls, and do not correlate with disease activity. However, different medical treatments cause fluctuations of circulating HCY levels in AS patients. Further and larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Patients with IBD are at increased risk of infection, especially when they have active disease and are taking immunosuppressive therapy. The characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD remain unclear. DESIGN: This Italian prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with an established IBD diagnosis and confirmed COVID-19. Data regarding age, sex, IBD (type, treatments and clinical activity), other comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)), signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and therapies were compared with COVID-19 outcomes (pneumonia, hospitalisation, respiratory therapy and death). RESULTS: Between 11 and 29 March 2020, 79 patients with IBD with COVID-19 were enrolled at 24 IBD referral units. Thirty-six patients had COVID-19-related pneumonia (46%), 22 (28%) were hospitalised, 7 (9%) required non-mechanical ventilation, 9 (11%) required continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 2 (3%) had endotracheal intubation and 6 (8%) died.

To understand what, where and how damage occurs, we collected serum and CSF from patients with COVID-19 and characterised neurological syndromes involving the peripheral and central nervous system (n = 34). We measured biomarkers of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation, and compared these with non-neurological control groups, which included patients with (n = 94) and without (n = 24) COVID-19. We detected increased concentrations of neurofilament light, a dynamic biomarker of neuronal damage, in the CSF of those with central nervous system inflammation (encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) (14800pg/mL [400, 32400]), compared to those with encephalopathy (1410pg/mL [756, 1446], peripheral syndromes (GBS) (740pg/mL [507, 881]) and controls (872pg/mL [654,1200]). Serum neurofilament light levels were elevated across patients hospitalised with COVID-19, irrespective of neurological manifestations. There was not the usual close correlation between CSF and serum neurofilament light, suggesting serum neurofilament light elevation in the non-neurological patients may reflect peripheral nerve damage in response to severe illness. We did not find significantly elevated levels of serum neurofilament light in community cases of COVID-19 arguing against significant neurological damage. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker of astrocytic activation, was not elevated in the CSF or serum of any group, suggesting astrocytic activation is not a major mediator of neuronal damage in COVID-19.","Paterson, Ross W; Benjamin, Laura A; Mehta, Puja R; Brown, Rachel L; Athauda, Dilan; Ashton, Nicholas J; Leckey, Claire A; Ziff, Oliver J; Heaney, Judith; Heslegrave, Amanda J; Benedet, Andrea L; Blennow, Kaj; Checkley, Anna M; Houlihan, Catherine F; Mummery, Catherine J; Lunn, Michael P; Manji, Hadi; Zandi, Michael S; Keddie, Stephen; Chou, Michael; Changaradil, Deepthi Vinayan; Solomon, Tom; Keshavan, Ashvini; Barker, Suzanne; Jäger, Hans Rolf; Carletti, Francesco; Simister, Robert; Werring, David J; Spyer, Moira J; Nastouli, Eleni; Gauthier, Serge; Rosa-Neto, Pedro; Zetterberg, Henrik; Schott, Jonathan M",Brain Commun,320,16

Earlier COVID-19 studies have reported that the pandemic caused widespread impacts on mental health and sleep in the general population. However, it remains largely unknown how the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance developed and interacted in adolescents at different times in the epidemic. METHODS: 831 teenagers (aged 14–19) underwent a longitudinal follow-up study to evaluate the prevalence of mental health problems and sleep disturbance among adolescents before, during, and after the COVID-19 breakout in China and to explore the interaction between mental health and sleep across the three measurements. The chronotype, anxiety and depression level, sleep quality, and insomnia were investigated during each measurement. RESULTS: The adolescents had delayed sleep onset and sleep offset time, longer sleep duration during the quarantine than before and after the epidemic, whereas their chronotype tended to morning type during the epidemic. Yet, the highest prevalence of anxiety, depression, poor sleeper, and insomnia symptoms were observed before but not during the COVID-19 breakout. The females and adolescents who were eveningness type showed significantly higher anxiety and depression levels, poorer sleep quality, and severe insomnia status than the males and the intermediate and morning types. Sleep disturbance was positively associated with mental problems among three measurements. Pre-measured depression level significantly predicted sleep disturbance level at follow-ups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that adolescents' high prevalence of mental health and sleep problems occurred before the COVID breakout and decreased during and after the epidemic. Gender and chronotype were significant risk factors associated with affective and sleep disturbances. Depression positively predicted later sleep problems, but not vice versa.","Li, Yun; Zhou, Ying; Ru, Taotao; Niu, Jiaxing; He, Meiheng; Zhou, Guofu",Sleep Med,320,21

We engineered 25 spike-pseudotyped lentiviruses containing individual and combined mutations, and confirmed that E484K evades antibody neutralization elicited by infection or vaccination, a capacity augmented when complemented by K417N and N501Y mutations. In silico analysis provided an explanation for E484K immune evasion. E484 frequently engages in interactions with antibodies but not with ACE2. Importantly, we identified a novel amino acid of concern, S494, which shares a similar pattern.

DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google up to October 8, 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Tocilizumab vs. placebo or standard of care. METHODS: We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs and adjusted RRs from cohorts, separately. We evaluated between-studies inconsistency with I(2). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1156 citations, 24 studies were eligible (5 RCTs and 19 cohorts). Five RCTs at low risk of bias, with 1325 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on short term mortality; pooled RR was 1.09 (95% CI 0.80-1.49, I(2) = 0 %). Four RCTs with 771 patients examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.52-0.96, I(2) = 0 %), with a corresponding number needed to treat 17 (95% CI 9-100). Among 18 cohorts at moderate risk of bias with 9850 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.58 (95% CI 0.51-0.66, I(2)= 2.5%). This association was observed across all stages of COVID-19 severity. Data from the RCTs did not show higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab; pooled RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.38-1.06, 5 RCTs) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.55-1.24, 5 RCTs), respectively. CONCLUSION: Cumulative moderate certainty evidence shows that tocilizumab reduces the risk of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. While RCTs showed that tocilizumab did not reduce short-term mortality, low certainty evidence from cohort studies suggests an association between tocilizumab and lower mortality. We did not observe a higher risk of infections or adverse events with tocilizumab use. This review will continuously evaluate the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19 treatment.","Tleyjeh, Imad M.; Kashour, Zakariya; Damlaj, Moussab; Riaz, Muhammad; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Altannir, Mustafa; Altannir, Youssef; Al-Tannir, Mohamad; Tleyjeh, Rana; Hassett, Leslie; Kashour, Tarek",Clin Microbiol Infect,320,17

Rapid and accurate detection of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 is vital for the treatment and control of COVID-19. In this study, the comparative sensitivity of different respiratory specimens were retrospectively analyzed using 3552 clinical samples from 410 Guangdong CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) confirmed COVID-19 patients. Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (73.4%∼87.5%), followed by nasal swabs (53.1%∼85.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). Viral RNA could be detected in all BALF from the severe group collected as early as 4 days after illness onset (d.a.o) and lasted up to 46 d.a.o., while none of BALF samples from mild group. Moreover, although viral RNA was negative in the upper respiratory samples, it was also positive in BALF samples in most cases from severe group during treatment. Despite of typical ground-glass opacity observed via computed tomographic (CT) scans, no viral RNA was detected in the first 3 or all upper respiratory tract specimens from some COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, sputum is most sensitive for routine laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, followed by nasal swabs.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional observational study. RMD attended at a rheumatology outpatient clinic in Madrid with Covid-19 that required hospital admission were included. The main outcomes were persistence of symptoms and health consequences related to Covid19 after discharge. Independent variable was RMD group (ARD and NARD) and covariates were sociodemographic, clinical, and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the risk by RMD group on main outcomes. RESULTS: We included 105 patients and 51.5% had ARD. 68.57% reported at least one persistent symptom. The most frequent were dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. 31 patients had consequences. Lung damage was found in 11.4% of the patients, 18% had blood test abnormalities (10% lymphopenia), two died, one developed central retinal vein occlusion and one patient developed optic neuritis. 11 patients required readmission due to Covid-19 problems (16.7% ARD vs 3.9% NARD; p=0.053). No statistically significant differences by RMD groups were found in the final models. CONCLUSION: Many RMD patients have persistent symptoms, similar to other populations. This study also highlights that lung damage is the most frequent consequence. ARD compared to NARD does not seem to differ in terms of persistent symptoms or consequences, although ARD might have a greater number of readmissions due to Covid-19.","Leon, L.; Perez-Sancristobal, I.; Madrid, A.; Lopez Pedraza, L.; Colomer, J.

COVID-19 is known to cause multiple organ complications, including cardiovascular. Cases of myopericarditis have been reported, and believed to be one of the culprits of death in this disease. We present a case of myopericarditis in the setting of post-COVID-19 pneumonia CASE PRESENTATION: 56-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 pneumonia (requiring hospitalization and nasal canula oxygenation one month prior, received 5 days of Remdesivir and 10 days of Dexamethasone);presented with four days of substernal pain, radiating to right neck and chest. On the day of admission, electrocardiogram (ECG) was sinus rhythm without ST changes and troponin was negative two times. During hospitalization, patient had episodes of fever with increased intensity of chest pain. Repeated ECG showed ST elevation in lead I, aVL, V3-V6 with ST depression in lead III;and significantly elevated troponin and pro-BNP. Echocardiogram showed mild diffuse hypokinesis with regional variations, slightly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and normal right ventricle size and function. Patient was started on heparin drip, and underwent emergency left heart catheterization that demonstrated non-obstructive CAD. Cardiac MRI was inconclusive for late gadolinium enhancement due to respiratory motion artifact, but biventricular global hypokinesis and small pericardial effusion were evidenced. Patient persistently had high fever and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP was 406 mg/dL) despite on antibiotics, hence empiric methylprednisolone and IVIG were started. She was planned to get endomyocardial biopsy, however she improved symptomatically with concurrent decreased of inflammatory markers and troponin. Repeat echocardiogram showed normal biventricular function. Patient was discharged from the hospital after 6 days of hospitalization with cardiology and rheumatology follow up. DISCUSSION: Manifestations of myopericarditis are varied, from fatigue and shortness of breath, to severe chest pain and chest tightness. Some patients may develop right-sided heart failure, or even fulminant myocarditis with sepsis. Interestingly, manifestations may occur weeks after recovery from COVID-19. Elevations of both troponin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) are expected, but ECG may not show ST changes. Echocardiogram may show thickening of the wall, dilatation, and pericardial effusion. Gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis is endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), as recommended by AHA. However, practice is limited due to expertise requirement, risk of contagious spread, and false-negative rate. CONCLUSIONS: Differential diagnosis should always include myopericarditis in acute coronary syndrome, especially after viral infection. REFERENCE #1: Zeng J.-H., Liu Y.-X., Yuan J.

Our dataset involves millions of contacts between 12.5% of the adult population, and enabled us to measure the real-world app performance. The technological tracing efficacy was measured at 80%, and we estimated that at least 11.0% of the discovered close contacts could not be identified by manual contact tracing. The overall effectiveness of digital tracing depends strongly on app uptake, but significant impact can be achieved for moderate uptake numbers. Used as a supplement to manual tracing and other measures, digital tracing can be instrumental in controlling the pandemic. Our findings can thus help informing public health policies in the coming months.","Elmokashfi, A.; Sundnes, J.; Kvalbein, A.; Naumova, V.; Reinemo, S.-A.; Florvaag, P. M.; Stensland, H.

DESIGN: Survey study. SETTING: National virtual conference administered by the Orthopaedic Trauma Association. PARTICIPANTS: Attendees of virtual fracture conference. INTERVENTION: Participation at a national virtual fracture conference. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Surveys of perception of quality and value of virtual conferences relative to in-person conferences. RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of participants rated the virtual fracture conference as similar or improved educational quality relative to conventional in-person fracture conference. Participants also felt they learned as much (35%) or more (57%) at each virtual fracture conference compared to the amount learned in-person. The quality of interpersonal interactions at both the resident–faculty level and faculty–faculty level was also perceived to be overall superior to those at participants’ own institutions. Learners felt they were more likely to engage the primary literature as well. Overall, 100% of participants were likely to recommend virtual conference to their colleagues and 100% recommended continuing this conference even after COVID-19 issues resolve. CONCLUSIONS: We found that learners find significant educational value in a national virtual fracture conference compared to in-person fracture conferences at their own institution. COVID-19 has proven to be a disruptor not only in health care but in medical education as well, accelerating our adoption of innovative and novel resident didactics.

Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been reported: UK–B.1.1.7, South Africa–B.1.351 and Brazil–P.1. These variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein which facilitates viral cell entry via the Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their potential for immune escape. Here we describe a structure-function analysis of B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The receptor binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K although K417N and N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases it would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection against this variant.","Zhou, Daming; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Mentzer, Alexander J.; Ginn, Helen M.; Zhao, Yuguang; Duyvesteyn, Helen M.E.; Tuekprakhon, Aekkachai; Nutalai, Rungtiwa; Wang, Beibei; Paesen, Guido C.; Lopez-Camacho, Cesar; Slon-Campos, Jose; Hallis, Bassam; Coombes, Naomi; Bewley, Kevin; Charlton, Sue; Walter, Thomas S.; Skelly, Donal; Lumley, Sheila F.; Dold, Christina; Levin, Robert; Dong, Tao; Pollard, Andrew J.; Knight, Julian C.; Crook, Derrick; Lambe, Teresa; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Bibi, Sagida; Flaxman, Amy; Bittaye, Mustapha; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Gilbert, Sarah; James, William; Carroll, Miles W.; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Dunachie, Susanna J.; Fry, Elizabeth E.; Mongkolspaya, Juthathip; Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I.; Screaton, Gavin R.",Cell,320,30

OBJECTIVE: The current analysis focuses on changes in symptoms of depression in a guided sample of patients with depression who registered for an internet-based intervention, the iFightDepression tool, as well as the extent of intervention use, compared to an unguided sample. The objective is to further understand the effects of guidance and adherence on the intervention’s potential to induce symptom change. METHODS: Log data from two convenience samples in German routine care were used to assess symptom change after 6-9 weeks of intervention as well as minimal dose (finishing at least two workshops). A linear regression model with changes in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score as a dependent variable and guidance and minimal dose as well as their interaction as independent variables was specified. RESULTS: Data from 1423 people with symptoms of depression (n=940 unguided, 66.1%) were included in the current analysis. In the linear regression model predicting symptom change, a significant interaction of guidance and minimal dose revealed a specifically greater improvement for patients who received guidance and also worked with the intervention content (β=–1.75, t=–2.37, P=.02), while there was little difference in symptom change due to guidance in the group that did not use the intervention. In this model, the main effect of guidance was only marginally significant (β=–.53, t=–1.78, P=.08). CONCLUSIONS: Guidance in internet-based interventions for depression is not only an important factor to facilitate adherence, but also seems to further improve results for patients adhering to the intervention compared to those who do the same but without guidance.","Oehler, Caroline; Scholze, Katharina; Reich, Hanna; Sander, Christian; Hegerl, Ulrich",JMIR Ment Health,320,16

We estimate the associated change in the aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere and the surface. To that end, we perform new simulations with the CMIP6 global climate model EC-Earth3. The simulations use the here newly created data for the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated effect on clouds from the simple plumes parameterization (MACv2-SP), based on revised SO(2) and NH(3) emission scenarios. Our results highlight the small impact of the pandemic on the global aerosol radiative forcing in 2020 compared to the CMIP6 scenario SSP2-4.5 of the order of +0.04 Wm(−2), which is small compared to the natural year-to-year variability in the radiation budget. Natural variability also limits the ability to detect a meaningful regional difference in the anthropogenic aerosol radiative effects. We identify the best chances to find a significant change in radiation at the surface during cloud-free conditions for regions that were strongly polluted in the past years. The post-pandemic recovery scenarios indicate a spread in the aerosol forcing of −0.68 to −0.38 Wm(−2) for 2050 relative to the pre-industrial, which translates to a difference of +0.05 to −0.25 Wm(−2) compared to the 2050 baseline from SSP2-4.5. This spread falls within the present-day uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing and the CMIP6 spread in aerosol forcing at the end of the 21st century. We release the new MACv2-SP data for studies on the climate response to the pandemic and the recovery scenarios. Our 2050 forcing estimates suggest that sustained aerosol emission reductions during the post-pandemic recovery cause a stronger climate response than in 2020, i.e., there is a delayed influence of the pandemic on climate.","Fiedler, Stephanie; Wyser, Klaus; Rogelj, Joeri; van Noije, Twan",Atmos Res,320,24

(3) Results: A causal loop analysis suggested that there were risks in prematurely terminating such interventions. Based on this result and the subsequent quantitative modeling, we found that the short-term effectiveness of a short-term pre-emptive stay-at-home request caused a resurgence in the number of positive cases, whereas an additional request provided a limited negative add-on effect for economic measures (e.g., number of electronic word-of-mouth communications and restaurant visits).

This novel coronavirus, caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-), is described as highly infectious. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the novel coronavirus as COVID-19 on February 11, 2020, and declared it as a “pandemic.” Almost all countries have undertaken wide-scale precautions so as to prevent or limit the spread of the virus, with most having practiced some form of “lockdown” along with “social distancing,” as well as dispensed recommendations for proper hand washing, avoiding touching the face, wearing facemasks, and using disposable tissues when either coughing or sneezing. Whereas it is well known that slowing the spread of this new epidemic requires the cooperation of all citizens, some people still seem to willfully disregard the rules and guidelines, and thereby ignore the health risks posed to both themselves and to others they come into contact with. People have responded differently to lockdown rules and social distancing practices. Whilst the majority follow the rules and recommendations with great care, others are more lax or simply refuse to comply. These differences might be accounted for according to a number of factors including personal, social, cultural, mental, and economic variables. Being persuaded to comply with preventive rules, especially those concerned with health-related behaviors, also bring certain other factors into play. Fear is one of those factors, and is one of the most powerful. It is well known that fear-based appeals can be effective in inculcating health behaviors, with many theories having been developed in this area. However, both the content of the message (the level of the fear it contains) and certain personal variables can determine the persuasive power of the fear appeal. It can even have an adverse effect if not properly applied. Many theories have been developed to address the persuasive effectiveness of the fear appeal (e.g., fear-drive theory, protection-motivation theory), and this study aims to discuss these individual differences in precautionary and preventive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic within the framework of the basic assumptions of these theoretical approaches.","Demirtaş-Madran, H.

To look for potential infectious etiologies, we performed a pilot study using multiple-target real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 27 infectious agents, including nine bacterial organisms and 18 respiratory viruses in middle ear fluids (MEFs) from children with OME. QPCR was also performed for the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the current vaccine. RESULTS: Forty-eight MEF samples were obtained and qPCR detected bacterial nucleic acid (NA) in 39/48 (81 %) and viral NA in 7/48 (15 %). Alloiococcus otitidis and S. pneumoniae were both detected in 15/48 (31 %) MEFs, followed by M. catarrhalis in 14/48 (29 %), H. influenzae in 5/48 (10 %) and M. pneumoniae in 4/48 (8 %). Rhinoviruses were most common virus type detected, found in 4/48 (8 %) MEFs. Serotypes included in the current 13-serotype vaccine were detected in only 3/15 (20 %) S. pneumoniae qPCR-positive MEFs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria may play an important role in OME, since over 80 % of MEFs contained bacterial NA. Further research into the role of A. otitidis in OME will be helpful. Serotypes of S. pneumoniae not included in the current 13-serotype vaccine may be involved in OME. Larger studies of OME S. pneumoniae serotypes are needed to help determine which additional serotypes should be included in future vaccine formulations in order to try to prevent OME.","Slinger, Robert; Duval, Melanie; Langill, Jonathan; Bromwich, Matthew; MacCormick, Johnna; Chan, Francis; Vaccani, Jean-Philippe",BMC Res Notes,320,16

Together, participants traveled a total of 27.7 million miles or 44.6 million kilometers. This equates to 58 return trips to the moon. Estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions were 8,646 metric tons or the total weekly carbon footprint of approximately 9,366 average American households. These emissions contribute to climate change and thus may exacerbate many of the global diseases that conference attendees seek to combat. Options to reduce conference travel–associated emissions include 1) alternating in-person and online conferences, 2) offering a hybrid in-person/online conference, and 3) decentralizing the conference with multiple conference venues. Decentralized ASTMH conferences may allow for up to 64% reduction in travel distance and 58% reduction in CO(2)e emissions. Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the clear association between global warming and global health, ways to reduce carbon emissions should be considered.","Bousema, Teun; Selvaraj, Prashanth; Djimde, Abdoulaye A.; Yakar, Derya; Hagedorn, Brittany; Pratt, Abigail; Barret, Didier; Whitfield, Kate; Cohen, Justin M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,320,5

Selecting the right supplier is a critical decision in green supply chain management. We propose a fuzzy green supplier selection model for sustainable supply chains in reverse logistics. We define a novel hierarchical fuzzy best-worst method (HFBWM) to determine the importance weights of the green criteria and sub-criteria selected. The fuzzy extension of Shannon’s entropy, a more complex evaluation method, is also used to determine the criteria weights, providing a reference comparison benchmark. Several hybrid models integrating both weighting techniques with fuzzy versions of complex proportional assessment (COPRAS), multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA), and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are designed to rank the suppliers based on their ability to recycle in reverse logistics. We aggregate these methods’ ranking results through a consensus ranking model and illustrate the capacity of relatively simple methods such as fuzzy COPRAS and fuzzy MOORA to provide robust rankings highly correlated with those delivered by more complex techniques such as fuzzy MULTIMOORA. We also find that the ranking results obtained by these hybrid models are more consistent when HFBWM determines the weights.

The uncontrolled influx of patients in need of emergency care has rapidly brought several national health systems to near-collapse with deadly consequences to those afflicted by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other critical diseases associated with COVID-19. Solid scientific evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 remains scarce; there is an urgent need to expand our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology to facilitate precise and targeted treatments. The capacity for rapid information dissemination has emerged as a double-edged sword; the existing gap of high-quality data is frequently filled by anecdotal reports, contradictory statements, and misinformation. This review addresses several important aspects unique to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the most relevant knowledge gaps and existing windows-of-opportunity. Specifically, focus is given on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis in the context of experimental therapies and preclinical evidence and their applicability in supporting efficacious clinical trial planning.

Objectives To conduct a service evaluation of tele-PrEP, exploring the views and experiences of PrEP-users and sexual health care professionals (HCPs), to understand benefits and drawbacks to inform future service delivery. Methods Parallel, web-based, anonymous surveys of PrEP-users and HCPs were developed using validated questions wherever possible. The PrEP-user survey was offered to people who had a tele-PrEP appointment between 13.11.2020-17.12.2020 and consented to participate. All HCPs conducting tele-PrEP appointments were invited to participate. Basic demographic data was captured. Data were analysed in Excel using descriptive statistics. Free text responses were thematically categorised using the Framework for a Systems Approach to Healthcare Delivery. Results Sixty-two PrEP-users and 8 HCPs completed the surveys (response rate 55% and 89% respectively). Demographic characteristics of PrEP-user respondents were broadly representative of our whole PrEP-cohort. Tele-PrEP was rated 'excellent' or 'good' by 61/62 PrEP-users, and 59/62 would recommend it to friends. PrEP-users identified convenience as a key benefit along with access to PrEP with reduced potential for COVID-19 exposure. Drawbacks were largely technological, including poor connection or issues with online booking. All HCPs felt that tele-PrEP allowed them to assess patients safely and confidently. HCPs also rated its convenience highly and felt it enabled better use of limited face-to-face clinic capacity. However, HCPs thought that tele-PrEP might create barriers for vulnerable patients, particularly those with low digital, health and/or English-language literacy. One HCP and 10/62 PrEP-users expressed a personal preference for face-toface appointments. Conclusion Tele-PrEP is feasible and acceptable. While most respondents rated the service highly, others identified a need/ preference for face-to-face appointments. Therefore, our service will continue tele-PrEP whilst ensuring availability of faceto- face care for those who require or request it..","Henderson, L.; Gibbs, J.; Ramasami, S.; Quinn, J.; Estcourt, C.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,320,20

The first places where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 were met in health institutions were also emergency departments. Emergency departments play an important role in diagnosing the disease and isolating patients (by hospitalization if necessary). The process, which starts with the triage of outpatients admitted to the emergency department and brought by ambulance, continues as isolation of the patients in appropriate areas including physical evaluation, management of laboratory and scanning processes and, if necessary, providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation with airway support. Afterwards, patients can be treated as an outpatient, or hospitalized, or treated at the intensive care unit in line with their preliminary diagnosis and clinical conditions. Disruptions that may occur in one or more of these stages can lead to crowds and lengthy queues in the emergency department by prolonging the follow-up period of the patients. One of the strengths of Turkey at this point is that emergency departments are accustomed to the heavy patient load. The experiences gained from these conditions have facilitated the organization of pre-hospital emergency medical services, pandemic hospitals, and their emergency departments. In this organization, the main goal should be to provide uninterrupted and high-quality patient care through personnel training, personal protection measures, and the creation of physical conditions. Turkey's emergency departments are accustomed to managing the intensive patient flow, as they work at full capacity during normal times. Thanks to the experiences of emergency healthcare workers, health service was provided without any patient being turned away from the door of the emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables, and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used 2-sample MR to assess evidence supporting a causal effect of circulating 25OHD levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 443,734 participants of European ancestry (including 401,460 from the UK Biobank) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, and severe disease from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used as outcome GWASs. These included up to 14,134 individuals with COVID-19, and up to 1,284,876 without COVID-19, from up to 11 countries. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was determined by laboratory testing or medical chart review. Population controls without COVID-19 were also included in the control groups for all outcomes, including hospitalization and severe disease. Analyses were restricted to individuals of European descent when possible. Using inverse-weighted MR, genetically increased 25OHD levels by 1 standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no significant association with COVID-19 susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95; 95% CI 0.84, 1.08; p = 0.44), hospitalization (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.33; p = 0.41), and severe disease (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.22; p = 0.77). We used an additional 6 meta-analytic methods, as well as conducting sensitivity analyses after removal of variants at risk of horizontal pleiotropy, and obtained similar results. These results may be limited by weak instrument bias in some analyses. Further, our results do not apply to individuals with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: In this 2-sample MR study, we did not observe evidence to support an association between 25OHD levels and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, or hospitalization. Hence, vitamin D supplementation as a means of protecting against worsened COVID-19 outcomes is not supported by genetic evidence. Other therapeutic or preventative avenues should be given higher priority for COVID-19 randomized controlled trials.","Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Nakanishi, Tomoko; Mooser, Vincent; Morrison, David R.; Abdullah, Tala; Adeleye, Olumide; Mamlouk, Noor; Kimchi, Nofar; Afrasiabi, Zaman; Rezk, Nardin; Giliberti, Annarita; Renieri, Alessandra; Chen, Yiheng; Zhou, Sirui; Forgetta, Vincenzo; Richards, J.

A rapid and sensitive molecular detection in clinical isolates is quite needed for the appropriate therapy and outbreak control of A. baumannii. Group 2 carbapenems have been considered the agents of choice for the treatment of multiple drug-resistant A. baumannii. But the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) has been steadily increasing in recent years. Here, we developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of A. baumannii in clinical samples by using high-specificity primers of the bla(OXA-51) gene. Then we investigated the OXA-carbapenemases molecular epidemiology of A. baumannii isolates in two comprehensive hospitals in Beijing. The results showed that the LAMP assay could detect target DNA within 60 min at 65°C. The detection limit was 50 pg/μl, which was about 10-fold greater than that of PCR. Furthermore, this method could distinguish A. baumannii from the homologous A. nosocomialis and A. pittii. A total of 228 positive isolates were identified by this LAMP-based method for A. baumannii from 335 intensive care unit patients with clinically suspected multi-resistant infections in two hospitals in Beijing. The rates of CRAB are on the rise and are slowly becoming a routine phenotype for A. baumannii. Among the CRABs, 92.3% harbored both the bla(OXA-23) and bla(OXA-51) genes. Thirty-three pulsotypes were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the majority belonged to clone C. In conclusion, the LAMP method developed for detecting A. baumannii was faster and simpler than conventional PCR and has great potential for both point-of-care testing and basic research. We further demonstrated a high distribution of class D carbapenemase-encoding genes, mainly OXA-23, which presents an emerging threat in hospitals in China.","Li, Puyuan; Niu, Wenkai; Li, Huan; Lei, Hong; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Xiangna; Guo, Leijing; Zou, Dayang; Yuan, Xin; Liu, Huiying; Yuan, Jing; Bai, Changqing",Front Microbiol,320,23

Here, we report the first crystal structure of the arterivirus nsp11 protein from PRRSV, which exhibits a unique structure and assembles into an asymmetric dimer whose structure is completely different from the hexameric structure of coronavirus nsp15. However, the structures of the PRRSV nsp11 and coronavirus nsp15 catalytic domains were perfectly superimposed, especially in the “active site loop” (His129 to His144) and “supporting loop” (Val162 to Thr179) regions. Importantly, our biochemical data demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution. Mutations of the major dimerization site determinants (Ser74 and Phe76) in the dimerization interface destabilized the dimer in solution and severely diminished endoribonuclease activity, indicating that the dimer is the biologically functional unit. In the dimeric structure, the active site loop and supporting loop are packed against one another and stabilized by monomer-monomer interactions. These findings may help elucidate the mechanism underlying arterivirus replication and may represent great potential for the development of antiviral drugs. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales. PRRSV is a major agent of respiratory diseases in pigs, causing tremendous economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease plays a vital role in arterivirus replication, but its precise roles and mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Here, we report the first dimeric structure of the arterivirus nsp11 from PRRSV at 2.75-Å resolution. Structural and biochemical experiments demonstrated that nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution and that nsp11 may be fully active as a dimer. Mutagenesis and structural analysis revealed NendoU active site residues, which are conserved throughout the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) and the major determinants of dimerization (Ser74 and Phe76) in Arteriviridae. Importantly, these findings may provide a new structural basis for antiviral drug development.","Shi, Yuejun; Li, Youwen; Lei, Yingying; Ye, Gang; Shen, Zhou; Sun, Limeng; Luo, Rui; Wang, Dang; Fu, Zhen F.; Xiao, Shaobo; Peng, Guiqing",J Virol,320,20

The protein comprises three domains, an N-terminal macro domain, a central zinc-binding domain and a C-terminal hypervariable domain (HVD). In this article, we review old and new literature about the functions of the three domains. Much progress in recent years has contributed to a picture of nsP3, particularly through its HVD as a hub for interactions with host cell molecules, with multiple effects on the biology of the host cell at early points in infection.

This is both in terms of their health outcomes (mortality and morbidity), care decisions made by health systems and the longer‐term effects such as neurological damage. The International Dementia Alliance is a group of dementia specialists from six European countries and this paper is a summary of our experience of the effects of COVID‐19 on our populations. Experience from England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland highlight the differential response from health and social care systems and the measures taken to maximise support for older people and those with dementia. The common themes include recognition of the atypical presentation of COVID‐19 in older people (and those with dementia) need to pay particular attention to the care of people with dementia in care homes; the recognition of the toll that isolation can bring on older people and the complexity of the response by health and social services to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic. Potential new ways of working identified during the pandemic could serve as a positive legacy from the crisis.","Burns, Alistair; Lobo, Antonio; Olde Rikkert, Marcel; Robert, Philippe; Sartorius, Norman; Semrau, Maya; Stoppe, Gabriela",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,320,32

The goal of this study was to assess the evolving burden of COVID-19 and the timing of associated VTE events in a systems-wide cohort. METHODS: COVID-19 PCR positive hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients ≥18 years of age tested between 1/1/2020 through 12/31/2020 were retrospectively analyzed using electronic medical records from multiple states across the Mayo Clinic enterprise. Radiology reports within 90 days before and after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were examined for VTE outcomes using validated Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. RESULTS: A 29-fold increased rate of VTE compared to the pre-COVID-19 period was noted during the first week following the first positive COVID-19 test (RR: 29.39; 95% CI 21.77-40.03). The rate of VTE steadily decreased and returned to baseline by the 6th week. Among 366 VTE events, most occurred during (n = 243, 66.3%) or after (n = 111, 30.3%) initial hospitalization. Only 11 VTE events were identified in patients who did not require hospitalization (3.0% of total VTE events). VTE and mortality increased with advancing age with a pronounced increased each decade in older patients. CONCLUSION: We observed a profoundly increased risk of VTE within the first week after positive testing for COVID-19 that returned to baseline levels after 6 weeks. VTE events occurred almost exclusively in patients who were hospitalized, with the majority of VTE events identified within the first days of hospitalization.","Pasha, Ahmed K.; McBane, Robert D.; Chaudhary, Rahul; Padrnos, Leslie J.; Wysokinska, Ewa; Pruthi, Rajiv; Ashrani, Aneel; Daniels, Paul; Sridharan, Meera; Wysokinski, Waldemar E.; Houghton, Damon E.",Thromb Res,320,16

Using IBV Arkansas-type (Ark) S protein histochemistry, we show that extension of S1 with the S2 ectodomain improves binding to chicken tissues. Although the S1 subunit is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, vaccination with S1 protein has been shown to confer inadequate protection against challenge. The demonstrated contribution of S2 ectodomain to binding to chicken tissues suggests that vaccination with the ectodomain might improve protection compared to vaccination with S1 alone. Therefore, we immunized chickens with recombinant trimeric soluble IBV Ark-type S1 or S-ectodomain protein produced from codon-optimized constructs in mammalian cells. Chickens were primed at 12 days of age with water-in-oil emulsified S1 or S-ectodomain proteins, and then boosted 21 days later. Challenge was performed with virulent Ark IBV 21 days after boost. Chickens immunized with recombinant S-ectodomain protein showed statistically significantly (P < 0.05) reduced viral loads 5 days post-challenge in both tears and tracheas compared to chickens immunized with recombinant S1 protein. Consistent with viral loads, significantly reduced (P < 0.05) tracheal mucosal thickness and tracheal lesion scores revealed that recombinant S-ectodomain protein provided improved protection of tracheal integrity compared to S1 protein. These results indicate that the S2 domain has an important role in inducing protective immunity. Thus, including the S2 domain with S1 might be promising for better viral vectored and/or subunit vaccine strategies.","Eldemery, Fatma; Joiner, Kellye S.; Toro, Haroldo; van Santen, Vicky L.",Vaccine,320,16

Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately being neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals. METHODS: a cross sectional online based survey was conducted to identify possible factors influencing public willingness to adhere to precautionary measures and preventive guidelines against COVID-19 during the lockdown periods in Sudan. The questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data of study participants, their health beliefs and willingness regarding adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19 based on the constructs of the Health Belief Model. RESULTS: a total of 680 respondents completed and returned the online questionnaire. Significant predictors of the willingness to adhere to the precautionary measures against COVID-19 were gender (β= 3.34, P<0.001), self-efficacy (β= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits (β= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity (β= 0.113, P=0.005). These factors explained 43% of the variance in respondents' willingness to adhere to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures. CONCLUSION: female respondents and respondents having higher self-efficacy, higher perceived benefits and higher perceived severity were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures against COVID-19 in Sudan.","Mehanna, Azza; Elhadi, Yasir Ahmed Mohammed; Lucero-Prisno III, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,320,16

Patients with COVID-19 ARDS present with a hyperinflammatory response characterized by high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor &#945; and ß (TNF&#945; and TNFß). Inflammatory functions of these TNFs can be inhibited by soluble TNF Receptor 2 (sTNFR2). In patients with COVID-19 ARDS, UC-MSC appear to impart a robust anti-inflammatory effect, and treatment is associated with remarkable clinical improvements. We investigated the levels of TNF&#945;, TNFß and sTNFR2 in blood plasma samples collected from subjects with COVID-19 ARDS enrolled in our trial of UC-MSC treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed plasma samples from subjects with COVID-19 ARDS (n=24) enrolled in a Phase 1/2a randomized controlled trial of UC-MSC treatment. Plasma samples were obtained at Day 0 (baseline, before UC-MSC or control infusion), and Day 6 post infusion. Plasma concentrations of sTNFR2, TNF&#945;, and TNFß were evaluated using a quantitative multiplex protein array. RESULTS: Our data indicate that at Day 6 after infusion, UC-MSC recipients develop significantly increased levels of plasma sTNFR2 and significantly decreased levels of TNF&#945; and TNFß, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that sTNFR2 plays a mechanistic role in mediating UC-MSC effect on TNF&#945; and TNFß plasma levels, determining a decrease in inflammation in COVID-19 ARDS.","Kouroupis, D; Lanzoni, G; Linetsky, E; Messinger Cayetano, S; Wishnek Metalonis, S; Leñero, C; Stone, L D; Ruiz, P; Correa, D; Ricordi, C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,320,3

One decision is around managed retreat or the voluntary movement and transition of individuals and communities away from coastal and other climate-vulnerable areas. “Receiving communities” and other low-risk areas where people may choose to relocate must adopt a multi-pronged strategy that addresses the full breadth of services and resources that relocating residents will need in order to adapt to their new communities, such as in areas of health, education, and workforce development. A critical consideration for receiving communities is the provision of adequate and affordable housing for new residents, many of whom have been driven to relocate due to housing insecurity caused by climate change impacts. Climate change can contribute to housing insecurity in multiple ways, such as when insurance rates increase for low-income homeowners living in flood-prone areas, or when disasters destroy existing affordable housing stock. These impacts can trigger the displacement of individual households or entire communities, requiring local governments to plan ahead for community-centered housing solutions. This article (1) explores the affordable housing crisis in the USA and the compounding impacts of climate change; (2) analyzes the concept of receiving communities and the unique considerations for preparing and investing in affordable housing; and (3) recommends how local governments can use new and existing planning, funding, and legal tools to ensure an effective and inclusive housing strategy for receiving communities.","Li, Jennifer; Spidalieri, Katie",J Environ Stud Sci,320,20

Chances of survival after diagnosis differ significantly depending on the stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Extended term periods are required to estimate survival of, e.g., 15–20 years. Moreover, since mortality of the average population changes with time, estimates of survival of cancer patients derived after a long period of observation can become outdated and can be no longer used to estimate survival of patients who were diagnosed later. Therefore, it can be useful to construct analytic functions that describe survival probabilities. Shorter periods of observation can be enough for such construction. We used the data collected by the Lithuanian Cancer Registry for our analysis. We estimated the chances of survival for up to 5 years after patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in Lithuania. Then we found analytic survival functions which best fit the observed data. At the end of this paper, we provided some examples for applications and directions for further research.

Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors on COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX inhibitors. RESULTS: OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95% CI 2.76 – 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients.

PARTICIPANTS: Parents and families of infants hospitalised in the participating centres between 1 May 2020 and 21 August 2020. METHODS: Online-based and/or paper-based survey, querying the visitation policies and their impact on parents’ ability to visit, care for and bond with their infants. RESULTS: A total of 231 responses were received. Visitation limited to a single visitor with no restrictions on duration was the most frequently reported policy; 140/217 (63%). Visitation policies were perceived as being restrictive by 62% (138/219) of the respondents with 37% (80/216) reporting being able to visit less often than desired, 41% (78/191) reporting being unable to bond enough and 27% (51/191) reporting not being able to participate in their baby’s daily care.

This paper aims to synthesize and review all the literature regarding the topic in a systematic manner to eliminate the bias and provide an overall insight, while incorporating some statistical analysis to provide an interval estimate of these studies. This paper addressed the effect of the positive and negative impacts reported in the literature in two categories of AVs: partial automation and full automation. The positive impacts represented in AVs’ possibility to reduce GHG emission can be attributed to some factors, including eco-driving, eco traffic signal, platooning, and less hunting for parking. The increase in vehicle mile travel (VMT) due to (i) modal shift to AVs by captive passengers, including elderly and disabled people and (ii) easier travel compared to other modes will contribute to raising the GHG emissions. The result shows that eco-driving and platooning have the most significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 35%. On the other side, easier travel and faster travel significantly contribute to the increase of GHG emissions by 41.24%. Study findings reveal that the positive emission changes may not be realized at a lower AV penetration rate, where the maximum emission reduction might take place within 60–80% of AV penetration into the network.","Massar, Moneim; Reza, Imran; Rahman, Syed Masiur; Abdullah, Sheikh Muhammad Habib; Jamal, Arshad; Al-Ismail, Fahad Saleh",Int J Environ Res Public Health,320,33

Our results showed 123 brain-related disorders associated with COVID-19 and form a high-density disease-disease network. The brain-disease-gene network revealed five highly clustered modules demonstrating a greater complexity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, we have identified 35 hub proteins of the network which were largely involved in the protein catabolic process, cell cycle, RNA metabolic process, and nuclear transport. Perturbing these hub proteins by drug repurposing will improve the clinical conditions in comorbidity. In the near future, we assumed that in COVID-19 patients, many other neurological manifestations will likely surface. Thus, understanding the infection mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and associated comorbidity is a high priority to contain its short- and long-term effects on human health. Our network-based analysis strengthens the understanding of the molecular basis of the neurological manifestations observed in COVID-19 and also suggests drug for repurposing.

This likely involves all components of the immune system, both innate and adaptive. The impetus for the rapid development of prophylactic treatment options has led to an intense focus on neutralizing antibodies (Abs), and many novel and specialized platforms have been designed to achieve that goal. B-cell immunity relies on the generation of a diverse repertoire of Abs. Their structural variation is defined in terms of amino acid composition that is encoded in the genome or acquired through somatic mutations. Yet, key examples of frequently neglected antibody diversification mechanisms involving post-translational modifications such as N- or O-linked glycosylation are present in significant portions of the population. During the last few years, these and other beyond gene sequence determined humoral immune response mechanisms have in some specific cases revealed their potent immunomodulatory effects. Nonetheless, such more unusual mechanisms have not received much attention in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, with specific focus on the latter, this paper presents, (1) the rationale for considering beyond sequence determined strategies, (2) evidence for their possible involvement in Covid-19 disease evolution, (3) consequences for vaccine design exemplified by one of the vaccine candidates that is currently undergoing trial, and (4) more general implications. Based on a critical interpretation of published literature, the hypotheses developed in this study point to a crucial role of non-genetic antibody diversification mechanisms in disease evolution to counteract unique immunogenicity determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The involvement of post translational mechanisms may also help explain the widely varied immune response observed, not only among different patient groups, but also in terms of their observed incompatibility with SARS-CoV-2 infection in several human cell types. The article highlights potentials and challenges of these refined humoral immune response mechanisms to most optimally target non-genetic viral evasion strategies.","Mueller, Siguna",Front Physiol,320,1

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′→5′exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity. Unique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.","Graepel, Kevin W.; Lu, Xiaotao; Case, James Brett; Sexton, Nicole R.; Smith, Everett Clinton; Denison, Mark R.",bioRxiv,320,29

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether morning serum cortisol is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, lymphocyte subtypes, and mortality. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study performed at a tertiary care centre in south-west Germany between 1997 and 2000. We included 3052 study participants who underwent coronary angiography. The primary outcome measures were cardiovascular risk factors, lymphocyte subtypes, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Serum cortisol was associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, but there was no significant association with coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome. In a subsample of 2107 participants, serum cortisol was positively associated with certain lymphocyte subsets, including CD16+CD56+ (natural killer) cells (P < 0.001). Comparing the fourth versus the first serum cortisol quartile, the crude Cox proportional hazard ratios (with 95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.00-1.47) for all-cause and 1.32 (1.04-1.67) for cardiovascular mortality, respectively. After adjustments for various cardiovascular risk factors, these associations were attenuated to 0.93 (0.76-1.14) for all-cause, and 0.97 (0.76-1.25) for cardiovascular mortality, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant associations with classic cardiovascular risk factors and natural killer cells, serum cortisol was not a significant and independent predictor of mortality in patients referred to coronary angiography. These findings might reflect that adverse cardiovascular effects of cortisol could be counterbalanced by some cardiovascular protective actions.","Pilz, Stefan; Theiler-Schwetz, Verena; Trummer, Christian; Keppel, Martin H; Grübler, Martin R; Verheyen, Nicolas; Odler, Balazs; Meinitzer, Andreas; Voelkl, Jakob; März, Winfried",J Endocr Soc,320,17

Method: This study enrolled a total of 178 patients at Huangshi Central Hospital from January to February, 2020. Among them, 68 patients were SARS-COV-2 infected confirmed with nucleic acid test (NAT) and CT imaging. 9 patients were in the suspected group (NAT negative) with fever and other respiratory symptoms. 101 patients were in the control group with other diseases and negative to SARS-COV-2 infection. After serum samples were collected, SARS-COV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for all patients. Results: The specificity of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 were 99.01% (100/101) and 96.04% (97/101) respectively, and the sensitivity were 88.24% (60/68) and 97.06% (66/68) respectively. The combined detection rate of SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were 98.53% (67/68).

However, there has been substantial variability in the policies and intensity of diagnostic efforts between countries. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the association between national contact tracing policies and case fatality rates of COVID-19 in 138 countries. Our regression analyses indicate that countries that implement comprehensive contact tracing have significantly lower case fatality rates. This association of contact tracing policy and case fatality rates is robust in our longitudinal regression models, even after controlling for the number of tests conducted and non-pharmaceutical control measures adopted by governments. Our results suggest that comprehensive contact tracing is instrumental not only to curtailing transmission but also to reducing case fatality rates. Contact tracing achieves the early detection and isolation of secondary cases which are particularly important given that the peak in infectiousness occurs during the presymptomatic phase. The early detection achieved by contact tracing accelerates the rate at which infected individuals receive medical care they need to maximize their chance of recovery. In addition, the combination of reduced transmission and more rapid recovery diminishes the burden on the healthcare system which in turn ensures that the resources remain available for individuals who do become infected.","Yalaman, Abdullah; Basbug, Gokce; Elgin, Ceyhun; Galvani, Alison P.",Sci Rep,320,33

The identification of possible human activity regions further visualizes the intersection between emission sources and human mobility. The updated spatial distribution of traffic emission could serve as good indicators for better air quality management, as well as the planning of social infrastructures in the neighborhood environment. Further, geo-processed traffic emission figures can systematically be distributed to respective districts via mathematical means, while the correlations of NO(x) and mortality within different case studies range from 0.371 to 0.783, while varying from 0.509 to 0.754 for PM(2.5), with some assumptions imposed in our study.

These interactions will challenge the resilience of societies and systems. A comparison of plausible COVID-19 epidemic trajectories with multi-hazard time-series curves enables delineation of multi-hazard scenarios for selected countries (United States, China, Australia, Bangladesh) and regions (Texas). In multi-hazard crises, governments and other responding agents may be required to make complex, highly compromised, hierarchical decisions aimed to balance COVID-19 risks and protocols with disaster response and recovery operations. Contemporary socioeconomic changes (e.g. reducing risk mitigation measures, lowering restrictions on human activity to stimulate economic recovery) may alter COVID-19 epidemiological dynamics and increase future risks relating to natural hazards and COVID-19 interactions. For example, the aggregation of evacuees into communal environments and increased demand on medical, economic, and infrastructural capacity associated with natural hazard impacts may increase COVID-19 exposure risks and vulnerabilities. COVID-19 epidemiologic conditions at the time of a natural hazard event might also influence the characteristics of emergency and humanitarian responses (e.g. evacuation and sheltering procedures, resource availability, implementation modalities, and assistance types). A simple epidemic phenomenological model with a concurrent disaster event predicts a greater infection rate following events during the pre-infection rate peak period compared with post-peak events, highlighting the need for enacting COVID-19 counter measures in advance of seasonal increases in natural hazards. Inclusion of natural hazard inputs into COVID-19 epidemiological models could enhance the evidence base for informing contemporary policy across diverse multi-hazard scenarios, defining and addressing gaps in disaster preparedness strategies and resourcing, and implementing a future-planning systems approach into contemporary COVID-19 mitigation strategies.

The relationship between fatty liver and severity of the disease was also investigated by measuring the liver attenuation index (LAI). METHODS: This study evaluated the chest CT images of 343 patients (201 male, mean age 48.43 years) who were confirmed to have COVID-19, using nasopharyngeal swab. The chest CTs were analyzed for laterality, number of involved lobes, diffuseness, number of lesions, and lesion types. The CT attenuation values of liver and spleen were measured, and LAI was calculated for the detection of hepatic steatosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify the independent early predictors for severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between genders in terms of clinical course. Liver density and LAI were significantly lower in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The prevalence of severe disease was higher in the patients with hepatic steatosis than in the non-steatotic group (odds ratio [OR] 3.815, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.97–7.37, P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity (OR 3.935, 95% CI 1.77-8.70, P = 0.001). The optimal cut-off value for LAI was calculated as 0.5 for predicting patients who required ICU treatment. CONCLUSIONS: On the initial chest CT images of COVID-19 patients, presence of fatty liver is a strong predictor for severe disease.","Parlak, Selçuk; Çıvgın, Esra; Beşler, Muhammed Said; Kayıpmaz, Afşin Emre",Saudi J Gastroenterol,320,7

Here we provide an initial report on the hypothesis that adaptive T cell based immunity may provide a path for a pan-COVID-19 vaccine that is resilient to viral drift. T cell based adaptive immunity can be based on short peptide sequences selected from the viral proteome that are less subject to drift, and can utilize multiple such epitopes to provide redundancy in the event of drift.

Two different whey protein food matrices were tested: (a) whey protein beverages (WPB) varying in lactose (0.05–12.4% w/v) and fat (0.9–7.2% w/v) levels and (b) whey protein fortified snacks: cupcakes with differing whey protein concentrate (WPC) powders (standard and heat-stable) and scones with varying fat content (with and without cream topping).

Methods This study is a single-institution retrospective case series at New York University Langone Health Manhattan campus evaluating patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized and required thoracic surgery from March 13th—July 18th, 2020. Results From March 13th—August 8th, 2020, 1,954 patients were admitted to our hospital for COVID-19. Of these patients, 13 (0.7%) required thoracic surgery. Two (15%) patients required surgery for complicated pneumothoraces, five (38%) patients underwent pneumatocele resection, one (8%) patient had an empyema requiring decortication, and five (38%) patients developed a hemothorax that required surgery. Three (23%) patients died after surgery, nine (69%) patients were discharged, and one (8%) patient remains in the hospital. No healthcare providers converted to COVID-19 positive after the surgeries. Conclusions Given the 77% survival rate, with a majority of patients already discharged from the hospital, thoracic surgery is feasible for the small percent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent surgery for complex pneumothorax, pneumatocele, empyema, or hemothorax.

Over the past decades, the goal has been to find the best method for monitoring congestive symptoms to prevent hospitalizations. Addressing this task through regular physician visits, blood tests, and imaging has proven insufficient for optimal control and has not decreased enough HF-related hospitalization rates. In recent years, new devices have been developed for this reason and CardioMEMS is one of the therapeutic monitoring options. CardioMEMS has shown to be effective in preventing and reducing HF hospitalizations in patients both with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. CardioMEMS’ versatility has made it a great option for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, both during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic and when the clinic visits have (partially) resumed.

In a few months of the COVID-19 epidemic, CardioMEMS has grown to maturity, making it the new normal for high-quality, high-value remote HF care.","Bayes-Genis, Antoni; Codina, Pau; Abdul-Jawad Altisent, Omar; Santiago, Evelyn; Domingo, Mar; Cediel, Germán; Spitaleri, Giosafat; Lupón, Josep",Eur Heart J Suppl,320,1

Emotions are a powerful and integral aspect of the experience of racism; however, within the field of behavior analysis, we have been hesitant to acknowledge emotion or explore how it relates to behavior and behavioral contingencies. As a result, the scope of our understanding of emotion is limited. To better understand the current experience and perception of practitioners in the field of behavior analysis, as they relate to emotion and racism, a brief survey was conducted. Findings indicated that although many may be comfortable discussing emotion and displaying emotions for themselves and others, this was not the case for everyone. Further, many were uncomfortable discussing racism. Although participants believed that emotions of racism are important and should be addressed by the field of behavior analysis, they think the field has not done enough work in this area. The results of the study lead to several recommendations, including additional antiracism research and the acknowledgment of emotional experience, as well as for how individuals can better understand, and maybe reduce, the negative emotions associated with oppression.","Catagnus, Robyn M.; Griffith, Annette K.; Umphrey, Brandon J.",Behav Anal Pract,320,16

We aimed to see the kidney damages of indoor heat-exposed workers and whether urine specific gravity can predict any kidney damages. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: A shoe-making factory in West Java, Indonesia. PARTICIPANTS: 119 subjects were included. Minimum total sample size was 62. Subjects were indoor heat-exposed workers who were exposed to occupational wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 28°C–30°C for 8 hours daily with 1 hour break, 5 days a week. The inclusion criterion was healthy subjects according to the result from annual medical check-up in 2019. The exclusion criteria were subjects who were taking vitamins and/or supplements that might cause disturbance in urine specific gravity and/or hydration status, pregnant and fasting. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of urine specific gravity for the detection of urinary nephrin and urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) were analysed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and quantitative albuminuria were also measured. RESULTS: WBGT in the work area of the subject was 28°C–30°C. There were 15 (12.6%) subjects who had eGFR <90 mL/min, but ≥60 mL/min. High serum vasopressin levels were found in 79 subjects with a mean of 6.54 (95% CI 5.94 to 7.14) ng/mL. Most subjects had nephrinuria (87.4%) with preserved renal function (87.4%). Several subjects had elevated urinary KIM-1 (10.9%) and albuminuria (7.6%). AUC of urine specific gravity for increased urinary nephrin was 81.7% (95% CI 68.8% to 94.6%) and statistically significant (p<0.001).

To date, little information is available on their ecological interactions. Based on two genomic surveillance surveys conducted on February 18 and March 18, 2021 across the whole Italian territory and covering over 3,000 clinical samples, we found significant co-circulation of B.1.1.7 and P.1. We showed that B.1.1.7 was already dominant on February 18 in a majority of regions/autonomous provinces (national prevalence 54%) and almost completely replaced historical lineages by March 18 (dominant in all regions/autonomous provinces, national prevalence 86%). At the same time, we found a substantial proportion of cases of the P.1 lineage on February 18, almost exclusively in Central Italy (with an overall prevalence in the macro-area of 18%), which remained at similar values on March 18, suggesting the inability by this lineage to outcompete B.1.1.7. Only 9 cases from variant B.1.351 were identified in the two surveys. At the national level, we estimated a mean relative transmissibility of B.1.1.7 (compared to historical lineages) ranging between 1.55 and 1.57 (with confidence intervals between 1.45 and 1.66). The relative transmissibility of P.1 estimated at the national level varied according to the assumed degree of cross-protection granted by infection with other lineages and ranged from 1.12 (95%CI 1.03-1.23) in the case of complete immune evasion by P.1 to 1.39 (95%CI 1.26-1.56) in the case of complete cross-protection.

IFITM3 reduces membrane fusion between cells and virions through a poorly characterized mechanism. Mutation of proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2), a regulator of neurotransmitter release, at glycine-305 was previously linked to paroxysmal neurological disorders in humans. Here, we show that glycine-305 and the homologous site in IFITM3, glycine-95, drive protein oligomerization from within a GxxxG motif. Mutation of glycine-95 (and to a lesser extent, glycine-91) disrupted IFITM3 oligomerization and reduced its antiviral activity against Influenza A virus. An oligomerization-defective variant was used to reveal that IFITM3 promotes membrane rigidity in a glycine-95-dependent and amphipathic helix-dependent manner. Furthermore, a compound which counteracts virus inhibition by IFITM3, Amphotericin B, prevented the IFITM3-mediated rigidification of membranes. Overall, these data suggest that IFITM3 oligomers inhibit virus-cell fusion by promoting membrane rigidity.","Rahman, Kazi; Coomer, Charles A; Majdoul, Saliha; Ding, Selena Y; Padilla-Parra, Sergi; Compton, Alex A",eLife,320,20

Our aim was to characterize skin lesions in elderly patients during late stages of COVID-19 from clinical, histological and immunophenotypic perspectives. CASE SUMMARY: Three patients, admitted for COVID-19, and who developed cutaneous manifestations underwent skin biopsies. Immunophenotypic analysis for CD20, CD3, CD4 and CD8 was performed on skin biopsies to assess immune cell infiltrates. CD1a was used as a marker of Langerhans cells, and CD31 as a marker of endothelial cells. In the three study patients, cutaneous manifestations were evident in the late-stage of COVID-19 (mean time from the first positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swab to rash onset was 35 d). Skin biopsies showed a similar pattern of T lymphocyte infiltration in all patients. Indeed, a chronic dermatitis with perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was observed with predominance of CD3+ T-cell (CD3+). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms previous reports. Histological and immunophenotypic patterns in our patients confirm results described in the two previous reported experiences. This pattern is similar to what is found in some lympho-proliferative disorders. Therefore, since these findings are non-specific, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be suspected.","Mazzitelli, Maria; Dastoli, Stefano; Mignogna, Chiara; Bennardo, Luigi; Lio, Elena; Pelle, Maria Chiara; Trecarichi, Enrico Maria; Pereira, Branca Isabel; Nisticò, Steven Paul; Torti, Carlo",World J Clin Cases,320,26

The Unified Classification System (UCS) advocated a rational approach towards the classification of periprosthetic fractures. We present here an update to the UCS with addition of new fracture pattern encountered in orthopedic practice. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to review the service arthroplasty register for the cases with unique fracture pattern where the periprosthetic fracture around total hip arthroplasty was also associated with fracture of the prosthetic component. The details were retrieved from the medical record and the patients were called for a review. The radiological assessment was done with X-rays and clinical assessment with Harris Hip Scores at the latest follow-up. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2019, 11 patients (7 males and 4 females) were operated for peri-prosthetic fracture with a unique pattern where the fracture of femur was associated with fracture of the femoral stem as well. The mean age of the patient at the time of fracture was 56.8 years (range 42–71 years). All patients were managed with revision hip surgery. One patient died due to malignancy after 7 years of revision surgery. All the surviving patients are doing well with a mean Harris Hip Score of 86.8 at the latest follow-up of 2–9 years (mean 5.0 years). CONCLUSION: With emergence of this new fracture pattern, it is recognition as a separate entity would help in better understanding and augmentation of the existing classification system of periprosthetic fractures.","Malhotra, Rajesh; Gautam, Deepak; Gupta, Saurabh",Indian J Orthop,320,26

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to report and study possible changes in HAI rates as well as their causes after the COVID-19 hospital surge capacity response (HSCR) in an academic referral center. METHODS: This was a before-after observational study. The Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) program (prospective surveillance, prevention bundles, antibiotic stewardship, continuing education, and feedback) was transiently disrupted after the start of HSCR (March 2020). HAI rates were compared before (January 2019-February 2020) and after (April-July 2020) HSCR, and plausible predisposing factors in affected patients were compared. RESULTS: An increase in the HAI rate from 6.2 to 11.8 cases/1000 patient-days was noted between periods due to increases in ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infection (BSI) rates. More critically ill patients were admitted during HSCR, and use of invasive devices increased. Prone positioning and infusion of muscle relaxants became commonplace. The nurse-to-patient ratio in the intensive care unit decreased, and 4 h shifts were introduced to avoid fatigue. The BSI rate decreased after the IPC program with additional measures was reintroduced in May 2020.

In susceptible individuals, however, common respiratory viruses, particularly human rhinoviruses, also can have a major impact on diseases that involve the lower airways, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). Respiratory virus-induced wheezing illnesses in early life are a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of asthma, and virus infections may also play a role in the development and progression of airway remodeling in asthma. It is clear that upper respiratory tract virus infections can spread to the lower airway and trigger acute attacks of asthma, COPD or CF. These exacerbations can be life-threatening, and exert an enormous burden on health care systems. In recent years we have gained new insights into the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses may induce acute exacerbations of lower airway diseases, as well as into host defense pathways that may regulate the outcomes to viral infections. In the current article we review the role of viruses in lower airway diseases, including our current understanding on pathways by which they may cause remodeling and trigger acute exacerbations. We also review the efficacy of current and emerging therapies used to treat these lower airway diseases on the outcomes due to viral infection, and discuss alternative therapeutic approaches for the management of virus-induced airway inflammation.","Leigh, Richard; Proud, David",Pharmacology & Therapeutics,320,1

There is a concern that the pandemic will exacerbate existing disparities in overall healthcare utilization and telehealth utilization. Few national studies have examined changes in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Data on 6.8 and 6.4 million employer-based health plan beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019 were collected in 2020. Unadjusted rates were compared both before and after the week of the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. Trends in weekly utilization were also examined using a difference-in-differences regression framework to quantify changes in telemedicine and office-based care utilization while controlling for the patient's demographic and county-level sociodemographic measures. All analyses were conducted in 2020. Results More than a 20-fold increase in the incidence of telemedicine utilization following March 13, 2020 was observed. Conversely, the incidence of office-based encounters declined almost 50% and was not fully offset by the increase in telemedicine. The increase in telemedicine was greatest among patients in counties with low poverty levels (β=31.70, 95% CI=15.17, 48.23), among patients in metropolitan areas (β=40.60, 95% CI=30.86, 50.34), and among adults compared with children aged 0–12 years (β=57.91, 95% CI=50.32, 65.49).

This lockdown has strictly controlled human activities in the entire India. Although this long lockdown has had a serious impact on the social and economic fronts, it has many positive impacts on environment. During this lockdown phase, a drastic fall in emissions of major pollutants has been observed throughout all the parts of India. Therefore, in this research study we have tried to establish a relationship among the fall in emission of pollutants and their impact on reducing regional temperature. This analysis was tested through the application of Mann–Kendall and Sen’s slope statistical index with air quality index and temperature data for several stations across the country, during the lockdown period. After the analysis, it has been observed that daily emissions of pollutants (PM(10), PM(2.5), CO, NO(2), SO(2) and NH(3)) decreased by − 1– − 2%, allowing to reduce the average daily temperature by 0.3 °C compared with the year of 2019. Moreover, this lockdown period reduces overall emissions of pollutants by − 51– − 72% on an average and hence decreases the average monthly temperature by 2 °C. The same findings have been found in the four megacities in India, i.e., Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai; the rate of temperature fall in the aforementioned megacities is close to 3 °C, 2.5 °C, 2 °C and 2 °C, respectively. It is a clear indicator that a major change occurs in air quality, and as a result it reduced lower atmospheric temperature due to the effect of lockdown. It is also a clear indicator that a major change in air quality and favorable temperature can be expected if the strict implementations of several pollution management measures have been implemented by the concern authority in the coming years.","Pal, Subodh Chandra; Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Saha, Asish; Chakrabortty, Rabin; Roy, Paramita; Ghosh, Manoranjan; Shit, Manisa",Environ Dev Sustain,320,20

Using a Transcriptogram-based top-down approach, we identified three major, differentially-expressed gene sets comprising 219 mainly immune-response-related genes. We identified timescales for alterations in mitochondrial activity, signaling and transcription regulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems and their relationship to viral titer. At the individual-gene level, EGR3 was significantly upregulated in infected cells. Similar activation in T-cells and fibroblasts in infected lung could explain the T-cell anergy and eventual fibrosis seen in SARS-CoV-1 infection.

We exploited the well-established DenseNet121 deep learning architecture for this purpose on 663 X-ray images derived from 528 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts blindly and independently evaluated the same X-ray images for purpose of validation. Results: We found that our deep learning model predicted the need for ventilation with a high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (90.06%, 86.34% and 84.38%, respectively). This prediction was done approximately three days ahead of the actual intubation event. Our model also outperformed two Pulmonary and Critical Care experts who evaluated the same X-ray images and provided an incremental accuracy of 7.24-13.25%. Conclusion: Our deep learning model accurately predicted the need for mechanical ventilation early during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.

AIM: To compare the outcomes of cancer patients admitted due to COVID‐19 and compare them with data of COVID‐19 infected patients without a history of cancer. METHODS: In this case‐controlled study, 93 healthy people and 92 patients with malignancy admitted for COVID‐19 were enrolled. The clinical features and laboratory indicators were assessed at the presentation and both groups were followed‐up for treatment options and outcomes prospectively and compared at the level of P ≤ .05. RESULTS: COVID‐19 related mortality rate in malignant patients was significantly higher than patients without malignancy (41.3% vs 17.2%, P = .0001). The risk of death increased significantly in patients with malignancy (OR = 8.4, P = .007) and mechanical ventilation (OR = 3.3, P = .034) independent of other variables. Fever (64.5% vs 43.5%, P = .004), chill (35.5% vs 14.1%, P = .001), malaise (49.5% and 30.4%, P = .008), dry cough (51.6% vs 26.1%, P = .0001), and vomiting (17.2% vs 5.4%, P = .012) were reported significantly lower in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that cancer patients who were infected by COVID‐19 may present with atypical symptoms are at higher risk of mortality independent of the demographic data, comorbidities, and treatments.","Shahidsales, Soodabeh; Aledavood, Seyed Amir; Joudi, Mona; Molaie, Fatemeh; Esmaily, Habibollah; Javadinia, Seyed Alireza",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),320,33

Older patients with cancer are at risk for lower vaccine immunogenicity and were not included in the registration trials. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity in this special population. Methods: We recruited elderly vaccinated patients from the René Muret hospital between Apr 5, 2021 and May 8, 2021. All were inpatients in a 48-bed geriatric rehabilitation ward, where a cluster of B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/1) variant COVID-19 cases occurred. We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG production in all patients. We observed patients who developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR) despite previous vaccination with mRNA vaccine. Results: Thirty vaccinated patients were enrolled. Mean age was 83 years and 60% were female. The IgG S-protein serology was positive in 16 of 18 (89%) patients without cancer. Immunogenicity among patients with cancer was significantly lower with positive serology in only 7 of 12 (58%, p<0.001). Antibody level was also significantly lower in this group (mean 2946 AU/mL vs. 4447 AU/mL in controls, p<0.001). Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 7 patients included 5 with cancer. Predictors for infection among older patients were: negative serology, haematological cancer (CLL or NHL), lung cancer, and treatment with high dose steroids. Covid-19 related deaths occurred in 5 patients included 4 with cancer. Conclusions: Routine measurement of post-vaccine antibodies in older patients with cancer should be considered.

In this transition, a reduction in mortality is followed by a reduction in fertility, creating larger, older populations in which the main causes of illness and death are no longer acute infections of children but chronic diseases of adults. Since the year 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have provided a framework for accelerating the decline of infectious diseases, backed by a massive injection of foreign investment to low-income countries. Despite the successes of the MDGs era, the inhabitants of low-income countries still suffer an enormous burden of disease owing to diarrhoea, pneumonia, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other pathogens. Adding to the predictable burden of endemic disease, the threat of pandemics is ever-present and global. With a view to the future, this review spotlights five aspects of the fight against infection beyond 2015, when the MDGs will be replaced by a new set of goals for poverty reduction and sustainable development. These aspects are: exploiting the biological links between infectious and non-infectious diseases; controlling infections among the new urban majority; enhancing the response to international health threats; expanding childhood immunization programmes to prevent acute and chronic diseases in adults; and working towards universal health coverage. By scanning the wider horizon now, infectious disease specialists have the chance to shape the post-2015 era of health and development.","Dye, Christopher",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,320,11

We developed a magnetic quantum dot-based dual-mode lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) biosensor for the high-sensitivity simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigens, which is beneficial for improving the detection accuracy and efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the point-of-care testing area. A high-performance magnetic quantum dot with a triple-QD shell (MagTQD) nanotag was first fabricated and integrated into the LFIA system to provide superior fluorescence signals, enrichment ability, and detectability for S/NP antigen testing. Two detection modes were provided by the proposed MagTQD-LFIA. The direct mode was used for rapid screening or urgent detection of suspected samples within 10 min, and the enrichment mode was used for the highly sensitive and quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in biological samples without the interference of the “hook effect.” The simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 S/NP antigens was conducted in one LFIA strip, and the detection limits for two antigens under direct and enrichment modes were 1 and 0.5 pg/mL, respectively.

Voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1.3 type were discovered both in plasma membrane and in inner mitochondrial membrane (mito Kv1.3 channels). For some time Kv1.3 channels located both in plasma membrane and in mitochondria are considered as a potentially new molecular target in several pathologies including some cancer disorders. Lipophilic non-toxic organic inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels may potentially find a clinical application to support therapy of some cancer diseases such as breast, pancreas and lung cancer, melanoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Inhibition of T lymphocyte Kv1.3 channels may be also important in treatment of chronic and acute respiratory diseases including severe pulmonary complication in corona virus disease Covid 19, however further studies are needed to confirm this supposition. Statins are small-molecule organic compounds, which are lipophilic and are widely used in treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Electrophysiological studies performed in our laboratory showed that statins: pravastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin are effective inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels in cancer cells of human T cell line Jurkat. We showed that application of the statins in the concentration range from 1.5 μM to 50 μM inhibited the channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was the most potent in case of simvastatin and the least potent in case of pravastatin. The inhibition was partially irreversible in case of simvastatin and fully reversible in case of pravastatin and mevastatin. It was accompanied by a significant acceleration of the current inactivation rate without any significant change of the activation rate. Mechanism of the inhibition is probably complex, including a direct interaction with the channel protein and perturbation of lipid bilayer structure, leading to stabilisation of the inactivated state of the channels.","Teisseyre, Andrzej; Uryga, Anna; Michalak, Krystyna",J Mol Struct,320,24

It might be involvedin the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure leading to death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the immune-inflammatory biomarkersin COVID-19, then determine optimal thresholds for assessing severe and fatal forms of this disease.153 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL2Rα), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin were measured using chemiluminescence assay. Complete blood count was performed by Convergys 3X® hematology analyzer. Our results demonstrated that the peripheral blood levels of IL6, PCT, CRP, ferritin, IL2Rα, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) were significantly higher in severe forms of COVID-19. The ROC curve analysis showed that IL6 was the most accurate inflammatory biomarker. The calculated cutoff of IL6 (42 pg/ml) could correctly classify more than 90% of patients regarding their risk of severity (area under ROC curve (AUROC) =0.972) and the threshold value of 83 pg/ml was highly predictive of the progression to death (AUROC =0.94, OR=184) after a median of 3 days. Besides, IL-6 was positively correlated with other inflammatory markers and the kinetic analysis highlighted its value for monitoring COVID-19 patients. PCT and NLR had also a high prognostic relevance to assess severe forms of COVID-19 with corresponding AUROC of 0.856, 0.831 respectively. Furthermore the cut-off values of PCT (0.16 ng/ml) and NLR (7.4) allowed to predict mortality with high accuracy (se=96.3%, sp=70.5 %,OR=61.2) , (se=75 %, sp=84 %, OR=14.6).The levels of these parameters were not influenced by corticosteroid treatment, which make them potential prognostic markers when patients are already undergoing steroidtherapy.","Sayah, Wafa; Berkane, Ismahane; Guermache, Imène; Sabri, Mohamed; Zahra Lakhal, Fatma; Yasmine Rahali, Sarah; Djidjeli, Asma; mahammad Lamara, Lydia; Merah, Fatma; Belaid, Brahim; Berkani, Lilya; Zhor Lazli, Nouzha; Kheddouci, Lylia; Kadi, Ahmed; Ouali, Mourad; Khellafi, Rachida; Mekideche, Dalila; Kheliouen, Assia; Malek Hamidi, Réda; Ayoub, Soraya; Beramtane raaf, Nabil; Derrar, Fawzi; Gharnaout, Merzak; Allam, Ines; Djidjik, Réda",Cytokine,320,23

The AXL protein plays an important role in promoting cancer development, such as proliferation, migration, invasion and survival of cancer cells. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify the cancer signaling regulated by AXL activation. Our study identified more than 1000 phosphotyrosine sites and discovered that activation of AXL can upregulate multiple cancer-promoting and cell migration/invasion-related signaling pathways. We also observed significant crosstalk as evidenced by rapid phosphorylation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, including PTPN11 and PTPRA, upon GAS6 stimulation. These discoveries should serve as a potentially useful resource for studying AXL functions as well as for the development of effective therapeutic options to target AXL. ABSTRACT: Overexpression and amplification of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been found in several hematologic and solid malignancies. Activation of AXL can enhance tumor-promoting processes such as cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and survival. Despite the important role of AXL in cancer development, a deep and quantitative mapping of its temporal dynamic signaling transduction has not yet been reported. Here, we used a TMT labeling-based quantitative proteomics approach to characterize the temporal dynamics of the phosphotyrosine proteome induced by AXL activation. We identified >1100 phosphotyrosine sites and observed a widespread upregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by GAS6 stimulation. We also detected several tyrosine sites whose phosphorylation levels were reduced upon AXL activation. Gene set enrichment-based pathway analysis indicated the activation of several cancer-promoting and cell migration/invasion-related signaling pathways, including RAS, EGFR, focal adhesion, VEGFR and cytoskeletal rearrangement pathways. We also observed a rapid induction of phosphorylation of protein tyrosine phosphatases, including PTPN11 and PTPRA, upon GAS6 stimulation. The novel molecules downstream of AXL identified in this study along with the detailed global quantitative map elucidating the temporal dynamics of AXL activation should not only help understand the oncogenic role of AXL, but also aid in developing therapeutic options to effectively target AXL.","Wu, Xinyan; Wang, Li; Pearson, Nicole A.; Renuse, Santosh; Cheng, Ran; Liang, Ye; Mun, Dong-Gi; Madugundu, Anil K.; Xu, Yaoyu; Gill, Parkash S.; Pandey, Akhilesh",Cancers (Basel),320,20

NPIs involve numerous measurements like hygiene rules or contact restriction that are applied during given situations, while so far only limited quantitative data exist to rate the overall effectiveness. Methods Using the official counts of Robert Koch Institute in Berlin/Germany, press reports and Twitter messages, the early phase of the current COVID-19/Sars-CoV2 in Bavaria is being reconstructed. Results The first cases have been observed in Munich by the end of January 2020. While the initial outbreak could be sufficiently covered using isolation and quarantine measurements, the consecutive early spreading falls into three phases, starting with winter school holidays at the end of February, a number of beer festivals in the following week, and general elections on March, 15. The disaster plan on March, 16 indicates the end of the early phase. Using the official case counts, a rather coherent picture evolves although representative epidemiological studies are still missing. The epidemic started with a few cases during the winter holidays, increased exponentially afterwards including significant more cases by beer festivals and another significant excess of cases following the election that occurred in Bavaria only. Compared to other German countries, Bavaria reached the highest prevalence which could not be reversed by even the most restrictive containment measurements.

DESIGN: Validated electronic survey. SETTING: Vanderbilt University Medical Center Department of Plastic Surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Program directors of all ACMGE-accredited General Surgery, Integrated Vascular Surgery, Integrated Thoracic Surgery, and Integrated Plastic Surgery residency programs. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 55.5%. Most PDs (78.1%) disagreed with the scoring change. Only 19.6% believe this change will improve medical student well-being. For 63.5% of PDs, medical school pedigree will become more important, and 52.7% believe it will place international medical graduates at a disadvantage. Only 6.2% believe Step 2 CK should also be pass/fail, while 88.7% will increase the weight of Step 2 CK and 88.4% will now require Step 2 CK score submission with the electronic residency application service. CONCLUSIONS: While well-intentioned, changing USMLE Step 1 to pass/fail may have unintended consequences and may disadvantage certain groups of applicants. The emphasis on Step 1, and resulting test-taking apprehension, will likely shift to Step 2 CK.

However, data on the prevalence, microbiology, and outcomes of co-infection and superinfection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through February 8, 2021. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or superinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines, and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763. RESULTS: Of 6639 articles screened, 118 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-25%, I(2) = 98%) and that of superinfection was 24% (95% CI: 19%-30%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or superinfection were: viral co-infections, 10% (95% CI: 6%-14%); viral superinfections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-10%); bacterial co-infections, 8% (95% CI: 5%-11%); bacterial superinfections, 20% (95% CI: 13%-28%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); and fungal superinfections, 8% (95% CI: 4%-13%). Patients with a co-infection or superinfection had higher odds of dying than those who only had SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.82–5.99). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with superinfections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation (45% [95% CI: 33%-58%] vs. 10% [95% CI: 5%-16%]), but patients with co-infections had a greater average length of hospital stay than those with superinfections (mean = 29.0 days, standard deviation [SD] = 6.7 vs. mean = 16 days, SD = 6.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that as many as 19% of patients with COVID-19 have co-infections and 24% have superinfections. The presence of either co-infection or superinfection was associated with poor outcomes, including increased mortality. Our findings support the need for diagnostic testing to identify and treat co-occurring respiratory infections among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Musuuza, Jackson S.; Watson, Lauren; Parmasad, Vishala; Putman-Buehler, Nathan; Christensen, Leslie; Safdar, Nasia",PLoS One,320,21

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is the first time that a pathogen’s spread across the globe has been extensively monitored by direct detection of the pathogen itself rather just than the morbidity left in its wake, indicates such heterogeneity is not limited to outcomes of infections but whether infection of a particular host occurs at all. This suggests an important role for yet to be discovered environmental (i.e. non-genetic) factors that influence whether an exposure to the virus initiates a productive infection and, moreover, the severity of disease that results. This article discusses the emerging hypothesis that the composition of a host’s commensal microbial communities, i.e. its “microbiome”, may be one such determinant that influences outcomes following encounters with respiratory viral pathogens in general and SARS-CoV-2 in particular. Specifically, we will review the rationales and evidence that supports this hypothesis and, moreover, speculate as to possible approaches to manipulate microbiota to ameliorate disease induced by respiratory viral pathogens.","Ngo, Vu L; Gewirtz, Andrew T",Curr Opin Virol,320,1

Methods: The assessment used the Benefit-Risk Action Team (BRAT) framework. Convalescent plasma treatment in severe COVID-19 was compared to standard of care, placebo or other treatments. A literature search was conducted to identify published papers from January 1st, 2019 until July 8th, 2020. A value tree was constructed which included ranked key benefits and risks. Results: We screened 396 papers from PubMed and 127 papers from Embase. Four studies were eligible for inclusion as they contained comparative data. Results from a randomised controlled trial revealed a non-statistically significant shortening of time to clinical improvement of 2.15 days (95% CI, -5.28 to 0.99 days) in the intervention group compared with the control group, with a possible signal of increased efficacy amongst a small subset of patients with severe disease (but not life threatening disease), however this study may have been underpowered. Interpretation of findings amongst the three controlled non-randomised studies were limited by small patient numbers, lack of randomisation, and confounding by co-administration of other treatments. Limited data availability at the current time precluded construction of a data summary table and further quantitative analysis. Conclusions: There was insufficient evidence from controlled studies to complete a data summary table for a systematic benefit-risk assessment of the use of CP for severe COVID-19 disease at the current time, and as such a benefit-risk conclusion could not be made. Whilst uncontrolled case series have suggested positive findings with CP, results from these studies are very difficult to interpret. We provide a framework which can be updated when further data that have an impact on the benefit-risk become available.","Davies, M.; Lane, S.; Evans, A.; Denyer, J.; Dhanda, S.; Roy, D.; Osborne, V.; Shakir, S.

Drug repurposing is a pragmatic strategy, a faster and cheaper option, compared to the new drug development that has proven successful for many drugs and can be a key tool in emergency situations such as the current one that requires quick action. In addition, considering the limited access to vaccines for developing countries, preventive use of ivermectin can be a palliative that minimizes the risks of infection. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect of the combination Ivermectin / Iota- Carrageenan (IVER/IOTACRC), intensive treatment with repeated administration in oral- and nasal-spray, respectively, as a prophylaxis treatment prior to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, in health personnel at Public Healthcare Centers. PARTICIPANTS, DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled 1-1 clinical trial in Personal Health, n = 234. The subjects were divided into experimental (EG: n=117; 39.6 {+/-} 9.4 years old, 65F) and control groups (CG: n=117; 38.4 {+/-} 7.4 years old, 61F). The EG received Ivermectin orally 2 tablets of 6 mg = 12 mg every 7 days, and Iota-Carrageenan 6 sprays per day for 4 weeks. All participants were evaluated by physical examination COVID-19 diagnosed with negative RT-PCR at the beginning, final, and follow-up of the protocol. Differences between the variables were determined using the Chi-square test. The proportion test almost contagious subject and the contagion risk (Odds Ratio) were calculated using software STATA. The level of statistical significance was reached when p-Value < 0.05. RESULT: The number of subjects who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in EG was lower, only 4 of 117 (3.4%) than subjects in CG: 25 of 117 (21.4%) (P-Value = 1.10-5). Nineteen patients had mild symptoms, 4 were in EG whereas, 15 were in CG (p-Value = 0.001). Seven subjects were moderate, and 3 with severe diagnostics, all them in CG. The probability (Odds Ratio) of becoming ill with COVID-19 was significantly lower in EG with values of 0.13, 95% 0.03 to 0.40; p-Value = 1.10-4, this value (<1) indicates a protective effect of the IVER/IOTACRC in the EG. Logistic regression test demonstrated that treatment was effective to prevent COVID-19 (Odds Ratio 0.11, 95% 0.03 to 0.33; p-Value = 1.10-4). We also found that when increase the age, decrease contagious risk (Odds Ratio 0, 93, 95% 0.88 to 0.98, p-Value= 0, 02). On the other hand, the probability of contracting COVID-19 was dependent on the patient's preexisting comorbidity (Odds Ratio 5.58, 95% 2.20 to 14.16, p-Value = 1.10-5). The other variables sex and designation were independent. CONCLUSION: The intensive preventive treatment (short-term) with IVER/IOTACRC was able to reduce the number of health workers infected with COVID-19. This treatment had also effect in preventing the severity of the disease, since all patients treated were mild. We propose a new therapeutic alternative for prevention and short-term intervention scheme (intensive) that is of benefit of the health worker in this pandemic accelerated time. This intervention did not produce lack of adherence to treatment or adverse effects.","Chahla, R. E.; Medina Ruiz, L.; Ortega, E. S.; Morales, M.

This review aims to summarize the current evidence and treatment guidelines for the management of myocarditis in the active population. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exertion is likely a trigger for dangerous arrythmias and further propagates myocardial damage in athletes with myocarditis. For this reason, abstinence from sports is a critical facet of management in the initial inflammatory period. The use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, specifically late gadolinium enhancement, to guide return to play decisions is becoming more common in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Establishing a stepwise approach for proper diagnosis and risk stratification, with an emphasis on contemporary cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques, in myocarditis is critical. After a diagnosis of myocarditis is made, it is imperative for any athlete or highly active individual to refrain from physical exercise. Additionally, therapy for heart failure should be applied in cases of myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction. Undoubtedly, COVID 19, and its potential to cause myocarditis, is sure to change the landscape of management of this disease.","Hurwitz, Benjamin; Issa, Omar",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,320,5

Limited studies have reported on family members’ experiences and support needs. AIM: To explore the experiences and support needs of family members of ventilated COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members’ experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19’s effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members’ feelings about the patient’s diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: The stress and uncertainty of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were influenced by their inability to feel connected to the patient and informed about care. Healthcare providers should assess each individual family’s burden and preferences, and this should include establishing structured, timely, and consistent communication regarding patient care during the pandemic including early referral to palliative care.","Chen, Chiahui; Wittenberg, Elaine; Sullivan, Suzanne S.; Lorenz, Rebecca A.; Chang, Yu-Ping",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,320,16

The objective of the present study was to focus on the epidemic curves of the COVID 19 epidemic in different centers, and to look at testing and mortality data. Methods: Publicly available datasets were used. The log(10) of the daily cumulated number of cases starting from the day the territory reached 100 cumulated cases was plotted to compare the magnitude, shape and slope of the different curves. The maximum daily testing efforts were plotted for each territory in relation to the maximum daily number of diagnoses. The case fatality rate was computed by dividing the number of COVID 19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. Results: In the Amazonian regions in general the speed of growth was generally lower than in Europe or the USA, or Southern Brazil. Whereas, countries like South Korea or New Zealand “broke” the curve relatively rapidly the log linear trajectory seemed much longer with signs of a decline in growth rate as of early July 2020. After a very slow start, French Guiana had the lowest slope when compared to other Amazonian territories with significant epidemics.

Though preventive vaccines and treatment methods are out on the market, a specific cure for the disease has not been discovered. Recent investigations and research studies primarily focus on the immunopathology of the disease. A healthy immune system responds immediately after viral entry, causing immediate viral annihilation and recovery. However, an impaired immune system causes extensive systemic damage due to an unregulated immune response characterized by the hypersecretion of chemokines and cytokines. The elevated levels of cytokine or hypercytokinemia leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along with multiple organ damage. Moreover, the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 has been linked with race, gender, and age; hence, this viral infection’s outcome differs among the patients. Many therapeutic strategies focusing on immunomodulation have been tested out to assuage the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the diverse signaling pathways triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is essential before contemplating relief measures. This present review explains the interrelationships of hyperinflammatory response or cytokine storm with organ damage and the disease severity. Furthermore, we have thrown light on the diverse mechanisms and risk factors that influence pathogenesis and the molecular pathways that lead to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and multiple organ damage. Recognition of altered pathways of a dysregulated immune system can be a loophole to identify potential target markers. Identifying biomarkers in the dysregulated pathway can aid in better clinical management for patients with severe COVID-19 disease. A special focus has also been given to potent inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines, immunomodulatory and immunotherapeutic options to ameliorate cytokine storm and inflammatory responses in patients affected with COVID-19.","Rabaan, Ali A.; Al-Ahmed, Shamsah H.; Garout, Mohammed A.; Al-Qaaneh, Ayman M.; Sule, Anupam A; Tirupathi, Raghavendra; Mutair, Abbas Al; Alhumaid, Saad; Hasan, Abdulkarim; Dhawan, Manish; Tiwari, Ruchi; Sharun, Khan; Mohapatra, Ranjan K.; Mitra, Saikat; Emran, Talha Bin; Bilal, Muhammad; Singh, Rajendra; Alyami, Salem A.; Moni, Mohammad Ali; Dhama, Kuldeep",Pathogens,320,26

If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. The aim of this study is to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity or reduce length of stay. Methods A stochastic discrete event simulation model is developed to represent the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. Model inputs are aligned to levers available to planners with key outputs including duration of time at maximum capacity (to inform workforce requirements), peak daily deaths (for mortuary planning), and total deaths (as an ultimate marker of intervention efficacy). The model - freely available - is applied to the COVID-19 response at a large hospital in England for which the effect of a number of possible interventions are simulated. Results Capacity-dependent deaths are closely associated with both the nature and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions and availability of intensive care beds. For the hospital considered, results suggest that capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced five-fold through a combination of isolation policies, a doubling of bed capacity, and 25% reduced length of stay. Conclusions Without treatment or vaccination there is little that can be done to reduce deaths occurring when patients have otherwise been treated in the most appropriate hospital setting. Healthcare planners should therefore focus on minimising the capacity-dependent deaths that are within their influence.","Wood, R. M.; McWilliams, C. J.; Thomas, M. J.; Bourdeaux, C.

METHODS: Data sources: eligible studies between 1 November 2019 and 10 August 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, LitCovid, Google Scholar, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, MedRXiv, BioRXiv and Scopus collection databases. English language case reports, case series and cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed pregnant women with data on perinatal outcome, congenital anomalies and mother to child transmission were analysed. RESULTS: 38 case reports, 34 cohort and case series describing 1408 neonates were included for evidence acquisition of mother to child transmission. 29 case reports and 31 case series and cohort studies describing 1318 foetuses were included for the evaluation of perinatal outcome and congenital anomalies. A pooled proportion of 3.67% neonates had positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA nasopharyngeal swab results and 7.1% had positive cord blood samples. 11.7% of the placenta, 6.8% of amniotic fluid, 9.6% of faecal and rectal swabs and none of the urine samples were positive. The rate of preterm labour was 26.4% (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.03 with p=0.03) and caesarean delivery (CS) was 59.9% (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.03 with p=0.002). The most common neonatal symptom was breathing difficulty (1.79%). Stillbirth rate was 9.9 per 1000 total births in babies born to COVID-19 mothers. CONCLUSION: Chances of mother to child transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is low. The perinatal outcome for the foetus is favourable. There is increased chances of CS but not preterm delivery. The stillbirth and neonatal death rates are low.

Although government authorities sought to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by restricting travel and in-person activities, failure to deploy time-sensitive strategies in ramping-up of critical resource production exacerbated the outbreak. Here, we developed a mathematical model to analyze the effects of the interaction between supply chain disruption and infectious disease dynamics using coupled production and disease networks built on global data. Analysis of the supply chain model suggests that time-sensitive containment strategies could be created to balance objectives in pandemic control and economic losses, leading to a spatiotemporal separation of infection peaks that alleviates the societal impact of the disease. A lean resource allocation strategy can reduce the impact of supply chain shortages from 11.91 to 1.11% in North America. Our model highlights the importance of cross-sectoral coordination and region-wise collaboration to optimally contain a pandemic and provides a framework that could advance the containment and model-based decision making for future pandemics.","Li, Xingyu; Ghadami, Amin; Drake, John M.; Rohani, Pejman; Epureanu, Bogdan I.",Sci Rep,320,8

However, there have been case reports of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with the wearing of facemasks during exercise. In this paper, we hypothesize that exercise with facemasks may increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) leading to SCD via the development of acute and/or intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms including increases in adrenergic stimulation and oxidative stress leading to electrophysiological abnormalities that promote arrhythmias via non-reentrant and reentrant mechanisms. Given the interplay of multiple variables contributing to the increased arrhythmic risk, we advise avoidance of a facemask during high intensity exercise, or if wearing of a mask is mandatory, exercise intensity should remain low to avoid precipitation of lethal arrhythmias. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an arrhythmic substrate even with low intensity exercise especially in those with established chronic cardiovascular disease in whom baseline electrophysiological abnormalities may be found.","Lee, Sharen; Li, Guoliang; Liu, Tong; Tse, Gary",Med Hypotheses,320,16

There have been significant improvements in economy, education and technology over the last three decades. Due to substantial investments from all levels of government, the public health system in China has been improved since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. However, infectious diseases still remain a major population health issue and this may be exacerbated by rapid urbanization and unprecedented impacts of climate change. This commentary aims to explore China’s current capacity to manage infectious diseases which impair population health. It discusses the existing disease surveillance system and underscores the critical importance of strengthening the system. It also explores how the growing migrant population, dramatic changes in the natural landscape following rapid urbanization, and changing climatic conditions can contribute to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious disease. Continuing research on infectious diseases, urbanization and climate change may inform the country’s capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Tong, Michael Xiaoliang; Hansen, Alana; Hanson-Easey, Scott; Cameron, Scott; Xiang, Jianjun; Liu, Qiyong; Sun, Yehuan; Weinstein, Philip; Han, Gil-Soo; Williams, Craig; Bi, Peng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,320,33

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to establish the psychometric properties of the Malay version of the Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire among healthcare providers. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The translated Malay version of the Vicarious Traumatization Questionnaire was completed by 352 healthcare providers in Kelantan, Malaysia. The data was entered using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA, 2019), and descriptive analysis was performed. The psychometric properties of the scale were assessed in two phases. The Rasch model to assess the validity and reliability was performed using Winsteps version 3.72.3. The confirmatory factor analysis using the structural equation modeling was performed using AMOS version 23.0. The Rasch analysis showed that the 38 items, in two constructs, had high item reliability and item separation at 0.97 and item separation at 5.36, respectively, while good person reliability and person separation were at 0.95 and 4.58, respectively. The correlations of all persons and items are greater than 0.20. There are no misfitting or overfitting items in the outfit MNSQ. There are four items that are challenging in answering the scale. The final model of the confirmatory factor analysis shows two constructs with 38 items demonstrating acceptable factor loadings, domain to domain correlation, and best fit (Chi-squared/degree of freedom = 4.73; Tucker-Lewis index = 0.94; comparative fit index = 0.94; and root mean square error of approximation = 0.10).

Worldwide many different steps have been taken to increase the engagement of older adults with these technologies. Much of this work has focused on the development of novel digital services that increase wellbeing or tackle social challenges. Aim : The aim of the study was to identify and describe the demands for AAL-services from the perspective of older adults. We also examine the challenges and needs of the ambient assisted living market using a needs based approach. Method : An exploratory case study was conducted with an aim to capture information about older adults’ demands for AAL services. A survey was used to collect the data. The survey study respondents validated the results. Results : The results of the study indicate that the area of AAL needs be studied from a multiple-sided market perspective. Our research suggests there is a need to describe and understand the factors that facilitate or constrain the implementation of services with focus on health and social care. There is also a need to describe and analyze the relationship between policy and practice and its effects on the AAL market. It is necessary to capture expressed demand, to identify market challenges at the macro level and to be able to understand how services should operate and serve older adults in practice. Such research is critical to the development of guidance for policy makers, suppliers and service providers. Discussion : Older adults are asking for intelligent, assistive living solutions that help them to continue to live independent lives and remain socially included in their networks, associations, and communities. The elderly need services that stimulate and maintain their physical and intellectual capital. The development of innovative AAL environments is, however, a complex social process that involves the use and delivery of innovative ICT–based services. The implementation and use of AAL to support older adults involve service providers and elderly consumers. Conclusions : The results of the study may be of interest to policy makers, entrepreneurs, technology suppliers, service providers and health and social care organizations, who are willing to innovate and influence the development of the AAL market through their choices and decisions.","Vimarlund, Vivian; Borycki, Elizabeth M.; Kushniruk, Andre W.; Avenberg, Kerstin",Yearb Med Inform,320,26

This is more than eradicating hunger but considers availability of support and health services and the availability of appropriate foods to meet individual requirements. In particular, this paper considers those in rural communities, from lower socioeconomic groups or underlying health conditions. METHODS: Semistructured professional conversations informed the development of a questionnaire which gathered insights from five organisations involved with the emergency food response in the South East, England, UK. Descriptive themes were derived though inductive analysis and are further discussed in relation to UK government food support measures and early published data. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from conversations, including: (1) increasing demand, (2) meeting the needs of specific groups, (3) awareness of food supply and value of supporting local and (4) concerns over sustainability. All organisations mentioned changes in practice and increased demand for emergency food solutions. Positive, rapid and innovative changes helped organisations to adapt to containment restrictions and to meet the needs of vulnerable people. Although concern was raised with regards to meeting the specific needs of those with underlying health conditions and the sustainability of current efforts. CONCLUSION: Considerable gaps in food provision were identified, as well as concerns regarding increased long-term food and nutrition insecurity. The paper makes recommendations to improve nutrition security for the future and considers the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic. The generalisability of these early insights is unknown but these real-time snapshops can help to direct further research and evaluation.","Macaninch, Elaine; Martyn, Kathy; Lima do Vale, Marjorie",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,320,1

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for a systematic approach for the care of patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a recognition of two major challenges in providing recommendations for AMI care in the COVID-19 era. Cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 are complex with patients presenting with AMI, myocarditis simulating a ST-elevation MI presentation, stress cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary spasm, or nonspecific myocardial injury and the prevalence of COVID-19 disease in the US population remains unknown with risk of asymptomatic spread. This document addresses the care of these patients focusing on 1) the varied clinical presentations; 2) appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE) for health care workers; 3) role of the Emergency Department, Emergency Medical System and the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory; and 4) Regional STEMI systems of care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary PCI remains the standard of care for STEMI patients at PCI capable hospitals when it can be provided in a timely fashion, with an expert team outfitted with PPE in a dedicated CCL room. A fibrinolysis-based strategy may be entertained at non-PCI capable referral hospitals or in specific situations where primary PCI cannot be executed or is not deemed the best option.","Mahmud, Ehtisham; Dauerman, Harold L.; Welt, Frederick GP.; Messenger, John C.; Rao, Sunil V.; Grines, Cindy; Mattu, Amal; Kirtane, Ajay J.; Jauhar, Rajiv; Meraj, Perwaiz; Rokos, Ivan C.; Rumsfeld, John S.; Henry, Timothy D.",J Am Coll Cardiol,320,20

METHODS: To determine the clinic features of patients diagnosed definitely with COVID‐19 and evaluate risk factors for severe outcome, the medical records of hospitalized patients were reviewed retrospectively by us and data were compiled. Laboratory data from 90 cases were analyzed, and COVID‐19 patients were classified into two groups (severe and non‐severe) based on the severity. RESULTS: Severe COVID‐19 cases on admission had higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D‐dimer, fibrinogen, C‐reactive protein levels, and lower lymphocyte counts compared with those of non‐severe cases (p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts, and levels of C‐reactive protein was 0.778, 0.831, and 0.800, respectively. The thresholds were 7.70 × 10(9)/L for leukocyte counts, 5.93 × 10⁹/L for neutrophil counts, and 75.07 mg/L for C‐reactive protein, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05–1.71), neutrophil counts (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06–1.73), and C‐reactive protein levels (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.0–1.04) were several predictive factors for severe outcome. Severe COVID‐19 patients had a reduction in WBC counts, D‐dimer, C‐reactive protein, and fibrinogen upon discharge from hospital, while lymphocyte counts increased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Counts of WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte, NLR, and levels of C‐reactive protein, D‐dimer, and fibrinogen are helpful for prediction of the deterioration trend in patients diagnosed with COVID‐19.","Shi, Shaorui; Nie, Bin; Chen, Xinzu; Cai, Qiang; Lin, Chunxin; Zhao, Guangda; Zhang, Xingying",J Clin Lab Anal,320,14

Periodontal prophylaxis is the most common aerosol-producing procedure conducted in dental practice globally. During COVID-19, many national and international organizations advocated the use of pre-procedural mouth rinsing to prevent the spread of infections from aerosol-generating procedures in the dental setting; however, many questioned the scientific basis for such recommendations. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-procedural rinsing when preforming periodontal prophylaxis in reducing aerosol contamination in the dental setting. Methods: A comprehensive standardized search strategy was employed, informed by a defined PICO question across four electronic databases. The review of the literature was conducted using the PRISMA framework. Agreement between assessors was determined throughout. Synthesis of study characteristics and key outcomes were conducted. Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) was employed to assess the quality/bias among studies. Results: The initial search yielded 731 citations across the four databases; 95 potentially effective studies were identified, with 56 effective studies found. Thirty randomized control trial studies were identified, 21 with a focus on effectiveness of pre-procedural mouth rinsing, involving 984 participants (aged 18–70). Agreement between assessors was high (Kappa >0.80). Various pre-procedural mouth rinses were tested, most frequently chlorhexidine (CHX) in 18 studies. The concentrations, volume, and prescribed duration of rinsing varied among studies, hampering meta-analyses. Nonetheless, all studies identified significant reductions in bacterial contamination, as measured by colony forming units (cfu). The effectiveness of CHX over other agents was evident with more than half of the studies (7/15) reporting over a 70% reduction in bacterial contamination (cfu). There were concerns over the risk of bias in most studies (76.2%); 19.0% had a high risk of bias and 4.8% were of low risk of bias. Conclusion: There is substantial evidence to support pre-procedural mouth rinsing, such as with chlorohexidine, to effectively reduce aerosol contamination when performing periodontal prophylaxis compared to mouth rinsing with water or not rinsing.","Mohd-Said, Shahida; Mohd-Dom, Tuti Ningseh; Suhaimi, Nawal; Rani, Haslina; McGrath, Colman",Front Med (Lausanne),320,28

Working at the front line, emergency department (ED) HCWs are uniquely at high risk. It is unknown if seropositivity in this population is similar to community levels or is substantially higher as a result of work-based exposure to infectious children who may demonstrate mild symptoms. Further, the experience of pediatric HCWs may be disparate from adult focused facilities because prior to implementation of social distancing, children presented for care at pediatric facilities in high numbers with mild illness. Many were evaluated in pediatric EDs which may have put pediatric HCWs at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic before universal personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization became standard practice. The milder nature of COVID-19 in children has also led some to believe that children are not affected, although the emergence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) refutes this notion. However, this belief and the lack of data may result in lax utilization to PPE in pediatric settings. Data describing seropositivity among pediatric HCWs is not yet available. Study Objective: Determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric HCWs. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing data from the baseline visit of a prospective cohort to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs at a large pediatric health care facility in April-May 2020. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and level of anxiety about COVID-19 was determined. Symptomatic or febrile HCWs were excluded. Metrics were analyzed overall and by HCW roles and tested for differences using chi-square estimates of independence. Prevalence of IgG antibodies were compared in ED vs. non-ED HCWs. Results: Of 300 HCWs enrolled from April 16-May 18, 2020, their mean age range is 41-50 years, 83% are female and 75% have no comorbidities. HCWs include 33% physicians, 25% nurses 10% respiratory therapists, 7% advance practice providers, and 25% other. Forty-seven percent were emergency department (ED) staff, 13% worked in pediatric intensive care, 40% elsewhere. Half of all HCWs had children in their home, 45% had traveled outside the state, and 47% reported an illness since January. Overall, 28% had a known COVID-19+ exposure. Most participants (90%) believed they were at high risk to develop COVID-19 as HCWs, and 70% reported high anxiety due to the pandemic. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity in this cohort is 4.7%. Of the 14 HCWs with positive serology, only 3 (21%) had a history of any prior COVID-19 testing, all of which were positive;43% (6/14) had no prior flu-like illness or symptoms. Eighty-six percent of antibody-positive HCWs were ED-based staff;SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were identified in 9% of ED HCWs enrolled compared to 1% in non-ED based HCWs, p=0.003. Conclusions: Overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is low in pediatric HCWs living in a region with high COVID-19 activity. Most cases were found in HCWs from the pediatric ED, and nearly half were asymptomatic. ED-based pediatric HCWs may be uniquely at higher risk of exposure to children with COVID-19, and particularly may have been at higher risk of infection before awareness of the evolving pandemic;ongoing universal PPE utilization is essential.","Morris, C.

Here, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of GRFT against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. In vitro experiments showed that treatment of JEV with GRFT before inoculation of BHK-21 cells inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner, with 99 % inhibition at 100 μg/ml and a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 265 ng/ml (20 nM). Binding assays suggested that binding of GRFT to JEV virions inhibited JEV infection. In vivo experiment showed that GRFT (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally before virus infection could completely prevent mortality in mice challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of JEV. Our study also suggested that GRFT prevents JEV infection at the entry phase by targeting the virus. Collectively, our data demonstrate that GRFT is an antiviral agent with potential application in the development of therapeutics against JEV or other flavivirus infections.","Ishag, Hassan Z.

Packed schedules and little rest time may make student-athletes more susceptible to mental health issues than the general population, but few athletes are fully aware of the effects that nutrition can have on their mental health. While collegiate athletic programs are beginning to recognize the individual contributions of nutrition and mental health to performance and are hiring sport dietitians and psychologists for their athletes, it is unclear whether these topics are ever discussed within the same context. The goal of this study was to understand the perspectives of different athletic personnel on the relationship between nutrition and mental health. 17 athletic personnel (11 Female, 6 Male) from 6 NCAA Division I universities were recruited for a 30–45-min semi-structured WebEx interview. Participants included athletic trainers, coaches, dietitians, sport psychologists, strength and conditioning coaches, and sports medicine physicians. Participants were asked questions about their educational backgrounds, resources, and perspectives on the integration of nutrition and mental health in their programs. Transcribed responses were sorted into four themes: (1) Resources, (2) Education, (3) Department Integration or Collaboration, and (4) Student and Coach Engagement. All participants reported a need for greater monetary resources and staffing. Around 59% of the participants felt they had little more than general or personal interest-level knowledge on topics pertaining to nutrition or mental health, with the exception of sports dietitians or psychologists. Each school varied in the degree to which their athletic staff regularly communicated about their work and athlete health statuses. Athletes were reportedly more or less likely to utilize the resources provided depending on coach attitudes toward nutrition or mental health. Regardless of size, reputation and annual spending, each university was reported to be in the early stages of integrating nutrition and mental health programs into their existing athletic departments. Implications of this work may be to help schools plan for ways to reallocate funding for nutrition or mental health programming.","McCabe, Emma M.; Ketcham, Caroline J.; Hall, Eric E.",Front Sports Act Living,320,20

Both COVID-19 infection and pulmonary emboli can present with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxaemia and an elevated D-dimer. Identifying a pulmonary embolus in a patient with COVID-19 and differentiating it from the typical clinical and biochemical features of COVID-19 is challenging. CASE REPORTS: We report four cases, and reviewed two further cases in the literature, of a pulmonary embolus in patients who presented to the emergency department with COVID-19 and no other risk factor for a pulmonary embolus. CONCLUSION: We identified a series of atypical features that should raise suspicion for a pulmonary embolus: pleuritic chest pain; haemoptysis; atrial fibrillation; tachycardia; hypotension; late onset deterioration; evidence of right heart strain; or a disproportionally elevated D-dimer in comparison to ferritin.","Greenan-Barrett, James; Perera, Adrian",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,320,24

This epidemic had caused 185 laboratory-confirmed cases and 36 deaths in the Republic of Korea until September 2, 2015, which attracted public’s attention. Based on the detailed data of patients released by World Health Organization (WHO) and actual propagation of the epidemic, we construct two dynamical models to simulate the propagation processes from May 20 to June 8 and from June 9 to July 10, 2015, respectively and find that the basic reproduction number R (0) reaches up to 4.422. The numerical analysis shows that the reasons of the outbreak spread quickly are lack of self-protection sense and targeted control measures. Through partial correction analysis, the parameters β (1) and γ have strong correlations with R (0), i.e., the infectivity and proportion of the asymptomatic infected cases have much influence on the spread of disease. By sensitivity analysis, strengthening self-protection ability of susceptible and quickly isolating or monitoring close contacts are effective measures to control the disease.","Xia, Zhi-Qiang; Zhang, Juan; Xue, Ya-Kui; Sun, Gui-Quan; Jin, Zhen",PLoS One,320,33
