6275,Back to the roots: Stehen wir vor einem neuen Zeitalter der Infektionskrankheiten?,2009-10-02,"The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TIPE2 participates in the protective actions of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in a mouse model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Control mice were infected with an adeno-associated virus expressing no transgene. Three weeks later, an animal model of caecal ligation-perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis was established. DEX was administered intravenously 30 min after CLP. Twenty-four hours after sepsis, lung injury was assayed by lung histology, the ratio of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, BALF protein content and the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio. Proinflammatory factor levels in the BALF of mice were measured. The protein expression levels in lung tissues were analysed by Western blotting. The results showed that DEX treatment markedly mitigated sepsis-induced lung injury, which was characterized by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio and total protein levels in the BALF. Moreover, DEX markedly attenuated sepsis-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of PMNs in the BALF, lung MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF. In addition, DEX dramatically prevented sepsis-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice, as reflected by decreases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase 3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, evaluation of protein expression showed that DEX blocked sepsis-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. Similar results were also observed in the TIPE2 overexpression group. Our study demonstrated that DEX inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis in a murine model of sepsis-stimulated ALI via the upregulation of TIPE2 and the suppression of the activation of the NF-κB and JNK signalling pathways.","Kong, Qian; Wu, Xiaojing; Qiu, Zhen; Huang, Qin; Xia, Zhongyuan; Song, Xuemin",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099173/,493

10571,COVID-19: Keine Entwarnung im Sommer?,2020-04-30,"Aim: The most frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants is bronchiolitis. Up to now there is no agreement on the upper limit age of bronchiolitis. Our aim was to identify if there are clinical differences in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis between 0–6 months and 6–12 months of age. A secondary aim was to establish whether there was differences in terms of recurrent wheezing at 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and virological records of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons. From each infant at admission to the hospital nasopharyngeal washing was collected, clinical severity was assessed and clinical data were extracted from a structured questionnaire. At 12–24–36 months after discharge, parents were interviewed seeking information on recurrent wheezing. Results: A total of 773 infants (Group1) were ≤6 months of age, while 51 were >6 months (Group 2). No differences between family history for atopy and passive smoking exposure were observed between the two groups. Respiratory syncyzial virus was detected more frequently in Group 1 and human bocavirus in Group 2. The clinical severity score (p = 0.011) and the use of intravenous fluids (p = 0.0001) were higher in Group 1 with respect to Group 2 infants. At 36 months follow-up 163/106 (39.4%) Group 1 and 9/9 Group 2 infants experienced recurrent wheezing (p = 0.149). Conclusion: We demonstrated that 0-6 months old infants bronchiolitis differs from > 6 months bronchiolitis.","Nenna, Raffaella; Frassanito, Antonella; Petrarca, Laura; Di Mattia, Greta; Midulla, Fabio",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184923/,493

10632,Mitteilungen der DGINA,2020-04-29,"Insertion sequences (ISs), arguably the smallest and most numerous autonomous transposable elements (TEs), are important players in shaping their host genomes. This review focuses on prokaryotic ISs. We discuss IS distribution and impact on genome evolution. We also examine their effects on gene expression, especially their role in activating neighbouring genes, a phenomenon of particular importance in the recent upsurge of bacterial antibiotic resistance. We explain how ISs are identified and classified into families by a combination of characteristics including their transposases (Tpases), their overall genetic organisation and the accessory genes which some ISs carry. We then describe the organisation of autonomous and nonautonomous IS‐related elements. This is used to illustrate the growing recognition that the boundaries between different types of mobile element are becoming increasingly difficult to define as more are being identified. We review the known Tpase types, their different catalytic activities used in cleaving and rejoining DNA strands during transposition, their organisation into functional domains and the role of this in regulation. Finally, we consider examples of prokaryotic IS domestication. In a more speculative section, we discuss the necessity of constructing more quantitative dynamic models to fully appreciate the continuing impact of TEs on prokaryotic populations.","Siguier, Patricia; Gourbeyre, Edith; Chandler, Mick",FEMS Microbiol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190074/,493

14757,Langzeitpflege in COVID-19-Zeiten: Leitfaden zur medizinischen Versorgung,2021-01-21,"Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.","Kloosterman, Alexander M.; Cimermancic, Peter; Elsayed, Somayah S.; Du, Chao; Hadjithomas, Michalis; Donia, Mohamed S.; Fischbach, Michael A.; van Wezel, Gilles P.; Medema, Marnix H.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794033/,493
15172,"Lockdown-Folgen: Die Schlafdauer steigt, die Schlafqualität sinkt",2021-02-04,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this article is to review the clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of lemafulin. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic literature review using the search terms of lefamulin and BC-3781 in the PubMed and EMBASE databases. We also cross-referenced the pertinent articles and searched ClinicalTrials.gov to identify ongoing and nonpublished studies. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Published data from 2005 to 2019 evaluating the clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety studies of lefamulin were analyzed. DATA SYNTHESIS: In phase 3 clinical trials, two multicenter, randomized double-blinded studies—Lefamulin Evaluation Against Pneumonia 1 and 2 (LEAP 1 and 2)—compared the efficacy and safety of lemafulin with moxifloxacin in patients diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Lemafulin given in doses of 600 mg orally or 150 mg intravenously were reported to have comparable efficacy to those of moxifloxacin with or without linezolid in patients with CABP. After the trial, the lefamulin group had an early clinical response (ECR) of 87.3% and the moxifloxacin group had an ECR of 90.2%. The difference of − 2.9% in the ECR was non-significant (CI − 8.5, 2.8). RELEVANCE TO PATIENTS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Lemafulin exhibits a unique binding property; therefore, it possess a potentially lower predisposition for the development of bacterial resistance and cross-resistance to other antimicrobial classes. Lefamulin is active against gram-positive including methicillin-resistant strains and atypical organisms which are often implicated in CABP. Lefamulin may be a safe alternative for adult patients with CABP who may not be candidates for respiratory fluoroquinolones. Lefamulin demonstrates both bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negatives, atypical pathogens, and some gram-negative anaerobes. It is bactericidal in vitro against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (including macrolide-resistant strains) at concentrations of 0.06, 0.5, and 0.008 µg/ml respectively, and bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The agent also demonstrates both time- and concentration-dependent killing against the pathogens S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. In vitro susceptibility testing demonstrated an MIC(50/90) of 0.06/0.12 µg/ml against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program found that at a concentration ≤ 1 µg/ml, lefamulin inhibited 100% S. pneumoniae isolates, 99.8% of S. aureus isolates, and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates. It was not affected by resistance to various antibiotic classes such as beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, or macrolides.","Eraikhuemen, Nathaniel; Julien, Daniel; Kelly, Alandra; Lindsay, Taylor; Lazaridis, Dovena",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7851634/,493
15315,President's Corner (Mitteilungen der SPS),2021-02-09,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the state of the present situation and trends concerning the global use of acupuncture for cancer pain in the past 20 years. METHODS: Searched the Web of Science database from 2000 to 2019 related to acupuncture for cancer pain, and then used CiteSpace to conduct scientometric analysis to acquire the knowledge mapping. RESULTS: Yearly output has increased year by year, and the growth rate has become faster after 2012. According to the cluster analysis of institutions, authors, cited references, and keywords, 4, 4, 15, and 14 categories were obtained, respectively. The most productive countries, institutions, and authors are the USA, Mem Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Mao JJ, whose frequencies are 196, 24, and 17, respectively. However, the most important of them are Australia, Univ. Maryland, and Bao T, owing to their highest centrality, they are 0.90, 0.21, and 0.09 separately. Moreover, cited references that contributed to the most co-citations are Crew KD (2010), however, the most key cited reference is Roscoe JA (2003). Keywords such as acupuncture, pain, breast cancer, palliative care, and quality of life are the most frequently used. But auricular acupuncture is the crucial keyword. In the cluster analysis of institutions, authors, cited references, and keywords, the more convincing research categories are multiple myeloma, placebo effect, neck malignancies, and early breast cancer, with S values of 0.990, 0.991, 0.990, and 0.923, respectively. Therefore, they can be regarded as research hotspots in this field. CONCLUSION: Based on the scientometric analysis in the past 20 years, the knowledge mapping of the country, institution, author, cited reference, and the keyword is gained, which has an important guiding significance for quickly and accurately positioning the trend in this field.","Huang, Li; Zhao, Yanqing; Xiang, Minhong",J Pain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7872910/,493
15316,President´s Corner (Mitteilungen der Deutschen Schmerzgesellschaft e.V.),2021-02-09,"Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis that requires urgent action to stop its spread. To counteract the spread of antibiotic resistance, we must improve our understanding of the origin and spread of resistant bacteria in both community and healthcare settings. Unfortunately, little attention is being given to contain the spread of antibiotic resistance in community settings (i.e., locations outside of a hospital inpatient, acute care setting, or a hospital clinic setting), despite some studies have consistently reported a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the community settings. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli isolates from healthy humans in community settings in LMICs. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we synthesized studies conducted from 1989 to May 2020. A total of 9363 articles were obtained from the search and prevalence data were extracted from 33 articles and pooled together. This gave a pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance (top ten antibiotics commonly prescribed in LMICs) in commensal E. coli isolates from human sources in community settings in LMICs of: ampicillin (72% of 13,531 isolates, 95% CI: 65–79), cefotaxime (27% of 6700 isolates, 95% CI: 12–44), chloramphenicol (45% of 7012 isolates, 95% CI: 35–53), ciprofloxacin (17% of 10,618 isolates, 95% CI: 11–25), co-trimoxazole (63% of 10,561 isolates, 95% CI: 52–73), nalidixic acid (30% of 9819 isolates, 95% CI: 21–40), oxytetracycline (78% of 1451 isolates, 95% CI: 65–88), streptomycin (58% of 3831 isolates, 95% CI: 44–72), tetracycline (67% of 11,847 isolates, 95% CI: 59–74), and trimethoprim (67% of 3265 isolates, 95% CI: 59–75). Here, we provided an appraisal of the evidence of the high prevalence of antibiotic resistance by commensal E. coli in community settings in LMICs. Our findings will have important ramifications for public health policy design to contain the spread of antibiotic resistance in community settings. Indeed, commensal E. coli is the main reservoir for spreading antibiotic resistance to other pathogenic enteric bacteria via mobile genetic elements.","Nji, Emmanuel; Kazibwe, Joseph; Hambridge, Thomas; Joko, Carolyn Alia; Larbi, Amma Aboagyewa; Damptey, Lois Afua Okyerewaa; Nkansa-Gyamfi, Nana Adoma; Stålsby Lundborg, Cecilia; Lien, La Thi Quynh",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873077/,493
15593,Mitteilungen der DGIM,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a critical activator of inflammation. Circulating mtDNA released causes lung injury in experimental models. We hypothesized that elevated plasma mtDNA levels are associated with acute lung injury (ALI) in septic patients. METHODS: We enrolled 66 patients with sepsis admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2019 and October 2019. Respiratory, hemodynamic and bedside echocardiographic parameters were recorded. Plasma mtDNA, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 levels were examined. RESULTS: Plasma mtDNA levels within 24 h after admission were significantly increased in the group of septic patients with ALI [5.01 (3.38–6.64) vs 4.13 (3.20–5.07) log copies/µL, p 0.0172]. mtDNA levels were independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.2052; 95% CI 1.1608–8.8500; p 0.0253) and ALI risk (odds ratio 2.7506; 95% CI 1.1647–6.4959; p 0.0210). Patients with high mtDNA levels had worse outcomes, and post hoc tests showed significant differences in 28-day survival rates. Increased mtDNA levels were seen in patients with abdominal infection. CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma mtDNA levels within 24 h after admission were significantly associated with ALI incidence and mortality in septic patients.","Mao, Jia-yu; Li, Dong-kai; Zhang, Hong-min; Wang, Xiao-ting; Liu, Da-wei",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905766/,493

This cross-sectional study aimed to measure the quality and frequency of smiles in older people living in rural settings using a smile analysis application. The participants comprised 13 females aged over 65 years who lived in Unnan City, Japan, and regularly attended recreational meetings. In this study, the recreational activity that the participants joined was a game called Mattoss. A video camera captured the participants’ faces, while a smile assessment application assessed their facial expressions for smiles and joy. A total of 2767 smiles were recorded. For validity, we calculated the Spearman’s rho score between smile and joy, which was 0.9697 (p < 0.001), while for reliability, we determined the Spearman’s rho score for each participant, which exceeded 0.7 (p < 0.001). Surges of smiles were induced by one’s own mistakes, successes, and big mistakes in the game and by severe or mild judgments by the referee. High validity and reliability of smile evaluation were demonstrated. The study found that smiling increased during recreational activities. Therefore, recreational activities can be encouraged for older people living in rural communities.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Nishida, Megumi; Okuda, Nobuyasu; Sano, Chiaki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914444/,493

METHODS: A total of 159 T1-2 GC patients who had undergone surgery with lymphadenectomy between March 2012 and November 2017 were retrospectively collected and divided into a training cohort (n = 80) and a testing cohort (n = 79). Radiomic features were extracted from both tumor region and No. 3 station LNs based on computed tomography (CT) images per patient. Then, key features were selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and fed into two radiomic signatures, respectively. Meanwhile, the predictive performance of clinical risk factors was studied. Finally, a nomogram was built by merging radiomic signatures and clinical risk factors and evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) as well as decision curve. RESULTS: Two radiomic signatures, reflecting phenotypes of the tumor and LNs respectively, were significantly associated with LN metastasis. A nomogram incorporating two radiomic signatures and CT-reported LN metastasis status showed good discrimination of LN metastasis in both the training cohort (AUC 0.915; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.832–0.998) and testing cohort (AUC 0.908; 95% CI 0.814–1.000). The decision curve also indicated its potential clinical usefulness. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram received favorable predictive accuracy in predicting No.3 LNM in T1-2 GC, and the nomogram showed positive role in predicting LNM in No.4 LNs. The nomogram may be used to predict LNM in T1-2 GC and could assist the choice of therapy.

16358,Mitteilungen der Deutschen Schmerzgesellschaft e.V.,2021-03-26,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with substantial morbidity, especially when it goes undetected. If new-onset AF could be predicted, targeted screening could be used to find it early. We hypothesized that a deep neural network could predict new-onset AF from the resting 12-lead ECG and that this prediction may help identify those at risk of AF-related stroke. METHODS: We used 1.6 M resting 12-lead digital ECG traces from 430 000 patients collected from 1984 to 2019. Deep neural networks were trained to predict new-onset AF (within 1 year) in patients without a history of AF. Performance was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve. We performed an incidence-free survival analysis for a period of 30 years following the ECG stratified by model predictions. To simulate real-world deployment, we trained a separate model using all ECGs before 2010 and evaluated model performance on a test set of ECGs from 2010 through 2014 that were linked to our stroke registry. We identified the patients at risk for AF-related stroke among those predicted to be high risk for AF by the model at different prediction thresholds. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve were 0.85 and 0.22, respectively, for predicting new-onset AF within 1 year of an ECG. The hazard ratio for the predicted high- versus low-risk groups over a 30-year span was 7.2 (95% CI, 6.9–7.6). In a simulated deployment scenario, the model predicted new-onset AF at 1 year with a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 81%. The number needed to screen to find 1 new case of AF was 9. This model predicted patients at high risk for new-onset AF in 62% of all patients who experienced an AF-related stroke within 3 years of the index ECG. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning can predict new-onset AF from the 12-lead ECG in patients with no previous history of AF. This prediction may help identify patients at risk for AF-related strokes.","Raghunath, Sushravya; Pfeifer, John M.; Ulloa-Cerna, Alvaro E.; Nemani, Arun; Carbonati, Tanner; Jing, Linyuan; vanMaanen, David P.; Hartzel, Dustin N.; Ruhl, Jeffery A.; Lagerman, Braxton F.; Rocha, Daniel B.; Stoudt, Nathan J.; Schneider, Gargi; Johnson, Kipp W.; Zimmerman, Noah; Leader, Joseph B.; Kirchner, H.

17113,Aktuelles aus der Diabetologie,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Work stress and compassion fatigue are prevalent among healthcare staff and their negative effects on staff well-being and patient care are well-known. This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation of Schwartz Rounds® (Rounds) in UK healthcare organizations, predominantly part of the National Health Service (NHS). Rounds are one-hour, typically monthly, multidisciplinary forums during which clinical and nonclinical healthcare staff discuss the emotional and social demands of delivering patient care. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of Rounds attendance on the psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection of healthcare staff. METHODS: We used a pre-post control design to assess the effect of Rounds attendance across 10 UK healthcare organizations. This design was most appropriate given the voluntary nature of Rounds and ensured the study had ecological validity. Self-reported data were collected from attenders and non-attenders at baseline and at eight-months follow-up. The outcomes were psychological distress, work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. RESULTS: During the 8 months’ study duration, regular attenders (N = 51) attended Rounds on average 4 times (2–8). Attenders showed a significantly greater decrease in psychological distress (as measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)) than non-attenders (N = 233; odds ratio of 0.197; 95% confidence interval (0.047–0.823)). However, Rounds attendance had no significant effect on work engagement, compassion and self-reflection. CONCLUSIONS: Rounds attendance was linked to a 19% reduction in psychological distress adjusting for covariates. As an organization-wide intervention, Rounds thus constitute an effective, relatively low-cost intervention to assist staff in dealing with the demands of their work and to improve their well-being.

17115,Medikamentöse Thrombose-Prophylaxe bei ambulanten COVID-19-Patienten,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) is a proposed emphysema and airflow obstruction biomarker; however, previous publications have shown inconsistent associations and only one study has investigate the association between sRAGE and emphysema. No cohorts have examined the association between sRAGE and progressive decline of lung function. There have also been no evaluation of assay compatibility, receiver operating characteristics, and little examination of the effect of genetic variability in non-white population. This manuscript addresses these deficiencies and introduces novel data from Pittsburgh COPD SCCOR and as well as novel work on airflow obstruction. A meta-analysis is used to quantify sRAGE associations with clinical phenotypes. METHODS: sRAGE was measured in four independent longitudinal cohorts on different analytic assays: COPDGene (n = 1443); SPIROMICS (n = 1623); ECLIPSE (n = 2349); Pittsburgh COPD SCCOR (n = 399). We constructed adjusted linear mixed models to determine associations of sRAGE with baseline and follow up forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV(1)) and emphysema by quantitative high-resolution CT lung density at the 15th percentile (adjusted for total lung capacity). RESULTS: Lower plasma or serum sRAGE values were associated with a COPD diagnosis (P < 0.001), reduced FEV(1) (P < 0.001), and emphysema severity (P < 0.001). In an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, one SD lower log(10)-transformed sRAGE was associated with 105 ± 22 mL lower FEV(1) and 4.14 ± 0.55 g/L lower adjusted lung density. After adjusting for covariates, lower sRAGE at baseline was associated with greater FEV(1) decline and emphysema progression only in the ECLIPSE cohort. Non-Hispanic white subjects carrying the rs2070600 minor allele (A) and non-Hispanic African Americans carrying the rs2071288 minor allele (A) had lower sRAGE measurements compare to those with the major allele, but their emphysema-sRAGE regression slopes were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Lower blood sRAGE is associated with more severe airflow obstruction and emphysema, but associations with progression are inconsistent in the cohorts analyzed. In these cohorts, genotype influenced sRAGE measurements and strengthened variance modelling. Thus, genotype should be included in sRAGE evaluations.

17324,Eine Monsterpille zur Prophylaxe bei Herzgesunden,2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND: In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells are able to suppress antitumor immunity by competing for essential nutrients, including amino acids. However, whether amino acid depletion modulates the activity of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is unclear. METHOD: In this study, we evaluated the roles of amino acids and the Rag complex in regulating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in CD8(+) TILs. RESULTS: We discovered that the Rag complex, particularly RagD, was crucial for CD8(+) T-cell antitumor immunity. RagD expression was positively correlated with the antitumor response of CD8(+) TILs in both murine syngeneic tumor xenografts and clinical human colon cancer samples. On RagD deficiency, CD8(+) T cells were rendered more dysfunctional, as demonstrated by attenuation of mTORC1 signaling and reductions in proliferation and cytokine secretion. Amino acids maintained RagD-mediated mTORC1 translocation to the lysosome, thereby achieving maximal mTORC1 activity in CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, the limited T-cell access to leucine (LEU), overshadowed by tumor cell amino acid consumption, led to impaired RagD-dependent mTORC1 activity. Finally, combined with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 antibody, LEU supplementation improved T-cell immunity in MC38 tumor-bearing mice in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that robust signaling of amino acids by RagD and downstream mTORC1 signaling were crucial for T-cell receptor-initiated antitumor immunity. The characterization the role of RagD and LEU in nutrient mTORC1 signaling in TILs might suggest potential therapeutic strategies based on the manipulation of RagD and its upstream pathway.","Zhang, Yiwen; Hu, Hongrong; Liu, Weiwei; Yan, Shu-Mei; Li, Yuzhuang; Tan, Likai; Chen, Yingshi; Liu, Jun; Peng, Zhilin; Yuan, Yaochang; Huang, Wenjing; Yu, Fei; He, Xin; Li, Bo; Zhang, Hui",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061841/,493
18072,Die neuesten Studienergebnisse aus der Kardiologie,2021-06-10,"Production networks are integral to economic dynamics, yet dis-aggregated network data on inter-firm trade is rarely collected and often proprietary. Here we situate company-level production networks within a wider space of networks that are different in nature, but similar in local connectivity structure. Through this lens, we study a regional and a national network of inferred trade relationships reconstructed from Dutch national economic statistics and re-interpret prior empirical findings. We find that company-level production networks have so-called functional structure, as previously identified in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Functional networks are distinctive in their over-representation of closed squares, which we quantify using an existing measure called spectral bipartivity. Shared local connectivity structure lets us ferry insights between domains. PPI networks are shaped by complementarity, rather than homophily, and we use multi-layer directed configuration models to show that this principle explains the emergence of functional structure in production networks. Companies are especially similar to their close competitors, not to their trading partners. Our findings have practical implications for the analysis of production networks and give us precise terms for the local structural features that may be key to understanding their routine function, failure, and growth.","Mattsson, Carolina E.

We tested whether the participant and experimenter sex modulated placebo effects on experimentally induced pain and associated stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if (i) participant sex and (ii) experimenter sex influence placebo analgesia and subjective and physiological stress in two experiments employing a within-subjects and a mixed design, respectively. Placebo effects were investigated in pain reports, stress, and blood pressure. METHODS: Participants received painful stimulations and a placebo cream. In Experiment One (N = 59) participants underwent a placebo condition (PC) and a natural history condition (NHC) in random order. A placebo cream was applied in the PC and then the heat stimulation temperature was surreptitiously lowered. Identical stimulations were administered in the NHC, but with no cream, no information, and no lowered temperature. In Experiment Two, participants (N = 93) were randomly assigned to three groups receiving either a placebo cream with surreptitiously lowered intensity of electric stimuli (Placebo, PG), a placebo cream (Cream-Control, CCG) without changing the stimuli, or lowered intensity, but with no cream (Pain-Control, PCG) in a mixed design. All participants in both experiments received the same stimuli in the post-test as in the pre-test. Four experimenters (two females) in Experiment One, and five experimenters (two females) in Experiment Two conducted the studies. RESULTS: No placebo effect was seen on pain. However, there were placebo effects on stress, moderated by participant and experimenter sex: in Experiment One males in the PC had lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared to males in the NHC. Participants in the PC had lower DBP compared to the NHC when tested by a female. In Experiment Two, participants expected more cream effectiveness when a female experimenter administered it, and reported lower stress in the PG compared to the PCG when tested by females. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a distinction between placebo effects on pain and on associated stress. Secondly, female experimenters recorded lower physiological and subjective stress, higher effectiveness expectations, and lower pain from both sexes compared to male experimenters. Possible reasons for the failure to find a pain placebo effect are discussed.","Vambheim, Sara Magelssen; Daniali, Hojjat; Flaten, Magne Arve",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215114/,493

However, to date, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms behind the process. Utilising in vitro assays, we have previously shown that the template-switching event of recombination is a random and ubiquitous process that often leads to recombinant viruses with imprecise genomes containing sequence duplications. Subsequently, a process termed resolution, that has yet to be mechanistically studied, removes these duplicated sequences resulting in a virus population of wild type length genomes. Using defined imprecise recombinant viruses together with Oxford Nanopore and Illumina high throughput next generation sequencing technologies we have investigated the process of resolution. We show that genome resolution involves subsequent rounds of template-switching recombination with viral fitness resulting in the survival of a small subset of recombinant genomes. This alters our previously held understanding that recombination and resolution are independent steps of the process, and instead demonstrates that viruses undergo frequent and continuous recombination events over a prolonged period until the fittest viruses, predominantly those with wild type length genomes, dominate the population.","Bentley, Kirsten; Alnaji, Fadi Ghassan; Woodford, Luke; Jones, Siân; Woodman, Andrew; Evans, David J.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409635/,493

Therefore food becomes an important vehicle for many zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decades has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. One Health formulates clearly both the need for, and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. Here we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food derived from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. Some diseases have global epidemic—or pandemic—potential, resulting in dramatic action from international organizations and national agricultural- and health authorities in most countries, for instance as was the case with avian influenza. Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and have been—in some settings—dealt with efficiently through farm-to-fork preventive action in the animal sector, e.g. Salmonella. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases are ‘neglected diseases’ in poor settings, while they have been basically eradicated in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies in the animal sector, e.g. Brucella. Here we will discuss these three different foodborne disease categories, paying extra attention to the important problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In addition, we present some of the One Health inspired solutions that may help reduce the threat of several of the foodborne diseases discussed.","Wielinga, Peter R.; Schlundt, Jørgen",Confronting Emerging Zoonoses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121645/,493

The aim of our study was to investigate the results of CentriMag™ extracorporeal short-term mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to decision in patients presenting with critical cardiogenic shock in our unit. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 63 consecutive patients from January 2005 to June 2017, who were treated with a CentriMag™ device at our institution as a bridge to decision. Patients requiring extracorporeal support for post-cardiotomy shock and for primary graft dysfunction after heart transplantation were excluded. RESULTS: Patients’ median age was 44 years (IQR 31–52, range 15.4–62.0) and 42 (67%) were male. Primary diagnosis at presentation was ischaemic cardiomyopathy (n = 24; 38.1%), viral myocarditis (n = 19; 30.2%), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 8; 12.7%), and others (n = 12; 19%). The median duration of support was 25 (IQR 9.5–56) days. A total of 7 (11%) patients were supported with peripheral veno-arterial (VA) extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 6 (9%) with central VA ECMO, 8 (13%) with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), 17 (27%) with biventricular assist device (BiVAD), and 25 (40%) with ECMO and then converted to BiVAD. Overall, 22 (34.9%) patients died while on CentriMag™ mechanical circulatory support. Complications included bleeding requiring reoperation/intervention in 24 (38%), renal failure requiring dialysis in 29 (46%), bacterial infections in 23 (37%), fungal infections in 15 (24%), critical limb ischaemia in 6 (10%), and stroke in 8 (13%). The overall survival to successful explant from CentriMag™ was 65.1% (n = 41) and survival to hospital discharge was 58.7% (n = 37). Of these, 10 (16%) had cardiac recovery and were successfully explanted, 20 (32%) were bridged to heart transplantation, 11 (17%) were bridged to long-term left ventricular assist device, 3 (4.7%) were later on transplanted, and 1 (1.6%) recovered to decommissioning. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 55%, 46%, and 23% respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an excellent outcome with the use of the CentriMag™ device in this seriously ill population.

46250,Mitteilungen des GRC,2021-03-02,"Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly being used to predict pathologies and biological traits using neuroimaging data. Here controlling for confounds is essential to get unbiased estimates of generalization performance and to identify the features driving predictions. However, a systematic evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of available alternatives is lacking. This makes it difficult to compare results across studies and to build deployment quality models. Here, we evaluated two commonly used confound removal schemes–whole data confound regression (WDCR) and cross-validated confound regression (CVCR)–to understand their effectiveness and biases induced in generalization performance estimation. Additionally, we study the interaction of the confound removal schemes with Z-score normalization, a common practice in ML modelling. We applied eight combinations of confound removal schemes and normalization (pipelines) to decode sex from resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data while controlling for two confounds, brain size and age. We show that both schemes effectively remove linear univariate and multivariate confounding effects resulting in reduced model performance with CVCR providing better generalization estimates, i.e., closer to out-of-sample performance than WDCR. We found no effect of normalizing before or after confound removal. In the presence of dataset and confound shift, four tested confound removal procedures yielded mixed results, raising new questions. We conclude that CVCR is a better method to control for confounding effects in neuroimaging studies. We believe that our in-depth analyses shed light on choices associated with confound removal and hope that it generates more interest in this problem instrumental to numerous applications.","More, Shammi; Eickhoff, Simon B.; Caspers, Julian; Patil, Kaustubh R.",Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7903939/,493

In Study 2, psychological predictors of the attitude towards vaccines were examined in 593 parents, using the Profile of Emotional Competence and the valence of mental images spontaneously associated with the term “vaccine”. In Study 1, attitudes were aggregated in three independent factors (concerns about vaccine safety; diseases prevented by vaccines; and naturalistic views) that independently predicted vaccine refusal. In Study 2, a significant mediational analysis showed a positive indirect effect of intrapersonal emotional competences on attitudes towards vaccines, through mental images associated with the word “vaccine”. Parents’ intrapersonal emotional competences affected all dimensions of attitudes towards vaccines, suggesting that being able to manage, identify, and recognize one’s own emotions is central to vaccine acceptance. These findings suggest that intervention strategies, rather than stressing the pro-social benefits of vaccinating, should focus on aspects related to one’s own emotions.","Gavaruzzi, Teresa; Caserotti, Marta; Leo, Irene; Tasso, Alessandra; Speri, Leonardo; Ferro, Antonio; Fretti, Elena; Sannino, Anna; Rubaltelli, Enrico; Lotto, Lorella",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005154/,493

RESULTS: Mini c-arm was used for manipulation of closed fractures of forearm (9), tibia (2), distal humerus (1), and foreign body removal (1). 11 procedures performed in ED with intranasal diamorphine and Entonox (5), intravenous Ketamine (5), or local anaesthetic (1), two in fracture clinic under Entonox. Fracture position was on average 7° from the anatomical. 1 Distal humerus required surgical correction. 1 admission after sedation. In the control group, 8 patients underwent manipulation under GA (4 ORIFs) and 2 procedures were done under sedation in ED. All patients were admitted. The quality of reduction varied on average 4º from anatomical. No patients required repeated procedures and all were followed up in a face to the face fracture clinic.

55606,Corona-Maßnahmen in der Praxis - Update,2021-07-23,"For safe operation of active space crafts, the space debris population needs to be continuously scanned, to avoid collisions of active satellites with space debris. Especially the low Earth orbit (LEO) shows higher risks of collisions due to the highest density of orbital debris. Laser ranging stations can deliver highly accurate distance measurements of debris objects allowing precise orbit determination and more effective collision avoidance. However, a laser ranging station needs accurate a priori orbit information to track an orbital object. To detect and track unknown orbital objects in LEO, here, a passive optical staring system is developed for autonomous 24/7 operation. The system is weather-sealed and does not require any service to perform observations. To detect objects, a wide-angle imaging system with 10° field of view equipped with an astronomical CCD camera was designed and set up to continuously observe the sky for LEO objects. The system can monitor and process several passing objects simultaneously without limitations. It automatically starts an observation, processes the images and saves the 2D angular measurements of each object as equatorial coordinates in the TDM standard. This allows subsequent initial orbit determination and handover to a laser tracking system. During campaigns at twilight the system detected up to 36 objects per hour, with high detection efficiencies of LEO objects larger than 1 m(3). It is shown that objects as small as 0.1 m(3) can be detected and that the estimated precision of the measurements is about 0.05° or 7 × the pixel scale.","Wagner, Paul; Clausen, Tim",CEAS Space J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256648/,493

57306,Seminare der FVDZ akademie im 2. Halbjahr,2021-09-09,"STUDY QUESTION: Can human oocytes be cyropreserved when they were previously inseminated while obtaining normal fertilization, embryo development and pregnancies? SUMMARY ANSWER: Cryopreservation of recently inseminated human oocytes produces normal 2PN zygotes, viable embryos and ongoing pregnancies. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Oocyte vitrification is a well-established technique in the infertility field supported by its effectiveness to freeze and thaw embryos at various stages of development. However, it is yet unknown whether cryopreservation performed in a period between conventional in vitro insemination and the appearance of pronuclei, affects any of the steps leading to fertilization, thereby arresting this process. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Case report that includes 5 IVF cycles where cryopreservation and thawing were performed in a pre-zygote stage, 4 hours after the conventional insemination of oocytes. The rationale for this procedure was to comply with a government restriction to circulate and work in order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV–2 virus, unexpectedly 3 days ahead (effective on 03/19/2020). Participants/materials, setting, methods: Off-site embryologists cancelled all pending embryo transfers and returned home (2,000 km away) before the stay-home quarantine. Five couples were informed and consent was obtained on the urgent need to cryopreserve their already inseminated oocytes despite of the limited scientific information. We vitrified 28 oocyte-sperm pairs in vitrification devices containing 2 to 3 inseminated oocytes each. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Eight months later all non-essential activities, including non-urgent procedures in hospital facilities, were permitted again, allowing embryologists to travel and resume their postponed work. We thawed 19 of the so-called “pre-zygotes” corresponding to 4 of the 5 initial couples. Female ages were 29, 39, 38 and 37 years old. Our primary outcomes were detection of pronuclei and the occurrence of fertilization. The secondary outcome was pregnancy success. On day 1, we observed the presence of 2PN in 16 oocytes (84%). Only one patient with 2 oocytes failed to fertilize. We transferred 2 good-to-fair-grade cleaved embryos to each of the 3 patients, obtaining one pregnancy with a positive fetal heartbeat from the 39 years old patient. Two of the couples were also able to cryopreserve 2 and 1 surplus embryos on day 5, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our strategy was used exclusively to overcome an unexpected adverse event while complying with State and County regulations on COVID–19. As a case report, a large sample size is needed to confirm and extend these results including the putative detrimental effects of arresting the fertilization process through vitrification. Wider implications of the findings: Although cryopreservation implies to arrest of any stage of a development continuum, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that both fertilization and pregnancy were achieved after halting the fertilization process long before the appearance of pronuclei (at ∼4 hours after insemination).

57308,Von Messengerdiensten und Videokonferenzen,2021-09-09,"STUDY QUESTION: Which pshycological factors have influenced the choice of infertile couples seeking for ART treatment during Phases 2 and 3 of COVID–19 pandemic in Italy? SUMMARY ANSWER: Couples undergoing ART treatment during Phases 2 and 3 of COVID–19 pandemic in Italy show low levels of anxiety and depression and a problem-centred attitude. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: COVID–19 pandemic has exposed people to psychological and health safety risks, forcing acceptance of important work and social restrictions. In lockdown Phase 1, all ART procedures were suddenly suspended. This was superimposed to the already critical emotional burden carried by infertile couples undergoing ART treatments. In our analysis performed in Phase 1, couples showed a logical consciousness regarding the need of such measures, given the evident risks, but the emotional drive was towards the continuity of the ART procedure. The emotional impact linked to the obligation of ART treatment suspension was in fact superior than that due to the lockdown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: From July 7th to November 28th of 2020, an online form was made available to the patients of the Biogenesi Reproductive Medicine Centre of Monza and of the Eugin Fertility Clinics in Italy (Milano, Modena and Taranto), which was filled anonymously and voluntarily by 326 subjects. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The questionnaire was composed by sociodemographic data, a Zung’s scale for anxiety self-evaluation, a Zung’s scale for depression self-evaluation, the COPE-NVI–25 questionnaire, five specific questions relative to what contributed for the decision of undergoing ART treatment during Phases 2 and 3 of the pandemic, and four specific questions relative to which support measures could have been efficacious to reduce stress. Main results and the role of chance: Of the 326 subjects included in the study, 19.9% were men and 80.1% were women; 77.3% underwent homologous and 22.7% underwent heterologous treatments; 44.5% lived in Lombardy, 20.9% in Liguria and the remaining 34.6% in different parts of Italy; 75.6% were seeking for maternity/paternity for less than 5 years and 24.4% for more than 5 years. The overall level of anxiety was low, as well as the level of depression, without any particular variations for gender or treatment type. The COPE-NVI–25 questionnaire revealed that couple strategies linked to a positive attitude towards the problem prevailed. What mostly contributed to ART treatment start or continuity in Phases 2 and 3 was the support to the couple agreement, couple age and the non-renounceable desire of having a child. Among the possible supporting measures aiming to reduce ART-related stress in this context we identified: greater support from the partner and inclusion of supporting treatments such as nutritional advises, massage and specifically driven physical activity. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The range of the present study is limited by the number of voluntaries and possible unprecise representation of the real ART patient population in Italy. The results presented could have been affected by variables that are uncontrolled for. Wider implications of the findings: The findings contribute to understand the psychological status of infertile couples that start or resume ART treatments under stressful conditions determined by the COVID–19 pandemic. These data shall provide valuable references for multidisciplinary discussion and strategy formulation aiming to improve the overall quality of ART treatments.

209989,Digital Gangrene as a Sign of Catastrophic Coronavirus Disease 2019-related Microangiopathy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Profilin 1 (Pfn1) is likely to be involved in atherogenesis and myocardial infarction (MI). Clinical data on this subject are very limited. The aim of this study was to search for associations between serum Pfn1 and a number of parameters in MI patients: symptom onset to PCI time (OPT), myocardial necrosis markers, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, antiplatelet drugs, heparin administration and typical atherosclerosis risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included patients with type 1 MI (according to the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction) who were able to precisely determine the time of symptom onset. Exclusion criteria involved conditions potentially altering platelet function. We screened 114 patients and included 65. We assessed serum Pfn1 in three time points: on admission (Pfn1_0), 24 hours post PCI (Pfn1_24) and 48 hours post PCI (Pfn1_48) and correlated it with OPT, cardiac necrosis markers (troponin T, CK, CKMB), TIMI flow in the infarct-related artery, pre-hospital P2Y12-antagonist and heparin administration and known atherosclerosis risk factors. RESULTS: Patients with a shorter OPT had higher Pfn1_0 (838.5 vs. 687.1 pg/ml, p=0.007). Patients with impaired coronary flow post PCI had lower Pfn1_24 (748.2 vs. 925.2 pg/ml, p=0.017) and Pfn1_48 (744.5 vs. 879.8, p=0.031. Pfn1_24 and Pfn1_48 were lower in patients who received a P2Y12 antagonist prior to hospital admission. Diabetic patients presented with lower Pfn1_0 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing Pfn1 in type 1 MI patients in relation to the chosen parameters. Pfn1 may be a biochemical tool to objectify information on OPT in MI patients. We found an association between Pfn1 and post-PCI TIMI flow, antiplatelet drug administration and diabetes mellitus.","Paszek, E; Zmudka, K; Plens, K; Legutko, J; Rajs, T; Zajdel, W",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,493
223633,The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Plastic Surgery Training: The Resident Perspective,2020,"Background: Anxiety is a common comorbidity associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no well-recognized method can provide effective relief. Liuzijue Qigong (LQG) is a traditional Chinese fitness method, based on breath pronunciation. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of LQG to relieve anxiety in COPD patients and to explore the factors that influence anxiety, including whether LQG is effective during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. A total of 60 patients with stable COPD were randomly assigned to two groups. Both groups were given routine medical treatment, and the patients in the pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) group were given an extra intervention in the form of LQG, performed for 30 minutes each day for 12 weeks. Data collection was performed at baseline and 12 weeks (during the COVID-19 epidemic). The primary outcomes were the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) scores, and the secondary outcomes were relevant information during the epidemic and analyses of the related factors that influenced SAS scores during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Compared with baseline, patients in both groups demonstrated varying degrees of improvements in their SAS scores (all P &lt; 0.01). An analysis of covariance, adjusted for baseline scores, indicated that the SAS scores improved more dramatically in the PR group than in the control group (F = 9.539, P = 0.004). During the outbreak, the SAS scores for sleep disorder were higher than all other factors, reaching 1.38 ± 0.67, and the scores for “I can breathe in and out easily” for the PR group were lower than the scores for the control group (Z = −2.108, P = 0.035). Significant differences were identified between the two groups for the categories “How much has the outbreak affected your life”, “Do you practice LQG during the epidemic” and “Do you practice other exercises during the epidemic” (all P &lt; 0.05). Compared with current reports, LQG had a relatively high adherence rate (80.95%). A multiple linear regression analysis revealed multiple predictors for SAS scores during the outbreak: group (b = −3.907, t = −3.824, P &lt; 0.001), COPD assessment test score (b = 0.309, t = 2.876, P = 0.006), SAS score at baseline (b = 0.189, t = 3.074, P = 0.004), and living in a village (b = 4.886, t = 2.085, P = 0.043). Conclusion: LQG could effectively reduce the risks of anxiety among COPD patients, even during the COVID-19 outbreak. For those COPD patients with high COPD assessment test and high baseline SAS scores or who live in villages, we should reinforce the management and intervention of psychological factors during the epidemic.","Zhang, Yu-Xuan; Quan, Ying; Chen, Ming-Hu; Zhang, Duo; Zhang, Ying; Zhu, Zhen-Gang",Traditional Med.Res.,,493

In this review we draw on emerging studies of the current pandemic and data from earlier, viral epidemics, to describe possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may influence the prevalence of stroke, with a focus on the thromboinflammatory pathways, which may be perturbed. Some of these potential mechanisms are not novel but are, in fact, long-standing hypotheses linking stroke with preceding infection that are yet to be confirmed. The current pandemic may present a renewed opportunity to better understand the relationship between infection and stroke and possible underlying mechanisms.","South, Kieron; McCulloch, Laura; McColl, Barry W; Elkind, Mitchell Sv; Allan, Stuart M; Smith, Craig J",Int J Stroke,,493

However, there are fewer scientific dissertations about the risk of recurrent positive. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between SARS-COV-2 RNA positive duration (SPD) and the risk of recurrent positive. METHODS: This case-control multi-center study enrolled participants from 8 Chinese hospital including 411 participants (recurrent positive 241). Using unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted logistic regression analyses, generalized additive model with a smooth curve fitting, we evaluated the associations between SPD and risk of recurrent positive. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed to explore the potential interactions. RESULTS: Among recurrent positive patients, there were 121 females (50.2%), median age was 50 years old [interquartile range (IQR): 38-63]. In non-adjusted model and adjusted model, SPD was associated with an increased risk of recurrent positive (fully-adjusted model: OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, P = 0.001); the curve fitting was not significant (P = 0.286). Comparing with SPD < 14 days, the risk of recurrent positive in SPD > 28 days was risen substantially (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.44-6.63, P = 0.004). Interaction and stratified analyses showed greater effect estimates of SPD and risk of recurrent positive in the hypertension, low monocyte count and percentage patients (P for interaction = 0.008, 0.002, 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: SPD was associated with a higher risk of recurrent positive and especially SPD > 28 day had a two-fold increase in the relative risk of re-positive as compared with SPD < 14 day. What's more, the risk may be higher among those with hypertension and lower monocyte count or percentage.","Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Chi; Chen, Xian-Xiang; Zhu, Qi; Huang, Wen-Xiang; Zeng, Yi-Lan; Liu, Ying-Xia; Li, Guo-Jun; Du, Wei-Jun; Yao, Jing; Li, Jia-Wen; Peng, Peng; Wang, Gui-Qiang",Infect Dis Poverty,,493
261507,[Treatment of patients in a corona ambulance],2020,"Persons suffering with systemic neuromuscular disorders or chronic organ failures, spend less time for daily physical activity, aggravating their mobility impairments. From 2020, patients at risk are also older adults, who, though negative for the SARS-Cov-2 infection, suffer with a fatigue syndrome due to home restriction/quarantine. Besides eventual psycological managements, it could be useful to offer to these patients a rehabilitation workouts easy to learn and to independently repeat at home (Full-Body In-Bed Gym). Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation (FES), we suggest for this fatigue syndrome a 10-20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that may recover from muscle weakness the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day activities. Leg muscles could be trained also by an adjunctive neuro-muscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in frail old persons. Many of the exercises could be performed in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), thus hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. Full-Body in-Bed Gym is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-ventilation rehabilitation training performed by patients after heavy surgery. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine of Full-Body in-Bed Gym, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow to major body muscles. Continued regularly, Full-Body in-Bed Gym may help maintaining independence of frail people, including those suffering with the fatigue syndrome related to the restrictions/quarantine imposed to the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carraro, Ugo; Marcante, Andrea; Ravara, Barbara; Albertin, Giovanna; Maccarone, Maria Chiara; Piccione, Francesco; Kern, Helmut; Masiero, Stefano",Aging clin. exp. res,,493

This study evaluated the feasibility of remote HbA1c monitoring via dried blood spot (DBS) testing to support assessment of glycemic control for telemedicine visits and examined clinical and demographic characteristics associated with patient completion of DBS testing. METHODS: Providers could place orders for DBS HbA1c 3 weeks prior to telemedicine visits. Feasibility was assessed by examining DBS completion rates, time to completion, and availability of DBS results prior to telemedicine visits. Chi-square tests and Mann Whitney tests were used to assess whether completion rates were associated with participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 303 DBS orders placed for telemedicine visits in June 2020, 162 patients completed the DBS test for a completion rate of (53.4%). Average time from collection at home to result being reported was 6.9 (3.8) days. The DBS result was available in 67.6% of patients who completed successful DBS, before the telemedicine clinic visit. HbA1c was lower in the DBS completion group as compared to the non-completion group (8.2% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01). No other clinical or demographic characteristics were significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Remote HbA1c monitoring via DBS is feasible and offers an avenue to support assessment of glycemic control for patients seen via telemedicine.

The virus affects the respiratory system, produces an inflammatory storm that causes lung damage and respiratory dysfunction. It infects humans of all ages. The Covid-19 takes a more severe course in individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. This category of persons exhibits weak immune activity and decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants. Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling hormone synthesized and secreted primarily by the pineal gland. It is a potent antioxidant with immunomodulatory action and has remarkable anti-inflammatory effects under a variety of circumstances. Regarding Covid-19 and metabolic syndrome, adequate information about the relationship between these two comorbidities is required for better management of these patients. Since Covid-19 infection and complications involve severe inflammation and oxidative stress in people with obesity and diabetes, we anticipated the inclusion of melatonin, as powerful antioxidant, within proposed treatment protocols. In this context, melatonin is a potential and promising agent to help overcome Covid-19 infection and boost the immune system in healthy persons and obese and diabetic patients. This review summarizes some evidence from recently published reports on the utility of melatonin as a potential adjuvant in Covid-19-infected individuals with diabetes and obesity.","El-Missiry, Mohamed A; El-Missiry, Ziad M A; Othman, Azza I",Eur J Pharmacol,,493

440271,Diabetiker auch in Zeiten von Corona gut versorgen : Editorial,2020,"The emergence and worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 raises new concerns and challenges regarding possible environmental contamination by this virus through spillover of human sewage, where it has been detected. The coastal environment, under increasing anthropogenic pressure, is subjected to contamination by a large number of human viruses from sewage, most of them being non-enveloped viruses like norovirus. When reaching coastal waters, they can be bio-accumulated by filter-feeding shellfish species such as oysters. Methods to detect this viral contamination were set up for the detection of non-enveloped enteric viruses, and may need optimization to accommodate enveloped viruses like coronaviruses (CoV). Here, we aimed at assessing methods for the detection of CoV, including SARS-CoV-2, in the coastal environment and testing the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate oysters, to monitor the contamination of French shores by SARS-CoV-2 using both seawater and shellfish. Using the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a CoV, as surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and Tulane virus, as surrogate for non-enveloped viruses such as norovirus, we assessed and selected methods to detect CoV in seawater and shellfish. Seawater-based methods showed variable and low yields for PEDV. In shellfish, the current norm for norovirus detection was applicable to CoV detection. Both PEDV and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 could contaminate oysters in laboratory settings, with a lower efficiency than a calicivirus used as control. Finally, we applied our methods to seawater and shellfish samples collected from April to August 2020 in France, where we could detect the presence of human norovirus, a marker of human fecal contamination, but not SARS-CoV-2. Together, our results validate methods for the detection of CoV in the coastal environment, including the use of shellfish as sentinels of the microbial quality of their environment, and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 did not contaminate the French shores during the summer season.","Desdouits, Marion; Piquet, Jean-Côme; Wacrenier, Candice; Le Mennec, Cécile; Parnaudeau, Sylvain; Jousse, Sarah; Rocq, Sophie; Bigault, Lionel; Contrant, Maud; Garry, Pascal; Chavanon, Fabienne; Gabellec, Raoul; Lamort, Laure; Lebrun, Luc; Le Gall, Patrik; Meteigner, Claire; Schmitt, Anne; Seugnet, Jean Luc; Serais, Ophélie; Peltier, Cécile; Bressolette-Bodin, Céline; Blanchard, Yannick; Le Guyader, Françoise S",Sci Total Environ,,493
441983,"Je höher der Blutzucker, desto gefährlicher die SARS-CoV-2-Infektion : COVID-19 bei Diabetikern",2020,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of lockdowns in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a system switch to remote primary care consulting at the same time as the incidence of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) increased. Lockdown-specific barriers to disclosure of DVA reduced the opportunity for DVA detection and referral. The PRECODE (PRimary care rEsponse to domestic violence and abuse in the COvid-19 panDEmic) study will comprise quantitative analysis of the impact of the pandemic on referrals from IRIS (Identification and Referral to Improve Safety) trained general practices to DVA agencies in the UK and qualitative analysis of the experiences of clinicians responding to patients affected by DVA and adaptations they have made transitioning to remote DVA training and patient support. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a rapid mixed method design, PRECODE will explore and explain the dynamics of DVA referrals and support before and during the pandemic on a national scale using qualitative data and over four years of referrals time series data. We will undertake interrupted-time series and non-linear regression analysis, including sensitivity analyses, on time series of referrals to DVA services from routinely collected data to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on referrals to the IRIS Programme, and analyse key determinants associated with changes in referrals. We will also conduct an interview- and observation-based qualitative study to understand the variation, relevance and feasibility of primary care responses to DVA before and during the pandemic and its aftermath. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings using rapid analysis and synthesis will enable the articulation of multiscale trends in primary care responses to DVA and complex mechanisms by which these responses have changed during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Our findings will inform the implementation of remote primary care and DVA service responses as services re-configure. Understanding the adaptation of clinical and service responses to DVA during the pandemic is crucial for the development of evidence-based, effective remote support and referral beyond the pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PRECODE is an observational epidemiologic study, not an intervention evaluation or trial. We will not be reporting results of an intervention on human participants.","Szilassy, Eszter; Barbosa, Estela Capelas; Dixon, Sharon; Feder, Gene; Griffiths, Chris; Johnson, Medina; De Simoni, Anna; Wileman, Vari; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Dowrick, Anna",BMC Fam Pract,,493

Methods: Eligible studies were randomized trials evaluating the effect of remdesivir versus placebo or no treatment. We conducted searches in the special L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs regular searches in databases, trial registries, preprint servers and websites relevant to COVID-19. All the searches covered the period until 25 August 2020. No date or language restrictions were applied. Two reviewers independently evaluated potentially eligible studies according to predefined selection criteria, and extracted data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias, using a predesigned, standardized form. We performed meta-analyses using random-effect models and assessed overall certainty in evidence using the GRADE approach. A living, web-based version of this review will be openly available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our search strategy yielded 574 references. Finally, we included three randomized trials evaluating remdesivir in addition to standard care versus standard care alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of remdesivir on mortality (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.05; very low certainty evidence) and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24; very low certainty evidence). On the other hand, remdesivir likely results in a large increase in the incidence of adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.84; moderate certainty evidence). Conclusions: The evidence is insufficient for the outcomes critical for making decisions on the role of remdesivir in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, so it is impossible to balance potential benefits, if there are any, with the adverse effects and costs.

Important ethical concerns arise in the context of the public health interventions. However, while focusing on the forest, the population, attention must also be paid to the trees, the individuals who suffer the illness. This article focuses on the ethical conflicts between the largely public health- driven focus of the Covid19 prevention and containment measures versus patient-centred care for those who suffer the illness and the consequent moral distress of healthcare providers.

Those who care for children (henceforth caregivers) may face the brunt of these changes, but little research has examined the consequences of COVID-19 on eating pathology in caregivers. A community sample of caregivers (N = 140) completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing demographics, stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19, disordered eating (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire-Short Form), and emotional eating (Emotional Eating Scale-Revised). Significant positive relationships emerged between stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 and disordered eating, emotional eating-depression, emotional eating-anger/anxiety, and emotional eating-boredom. Stress and concern about weight gain during, but not before, COVID-19 positively predicted variance in disordered eating and emotional eating. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-boredom when concern about weight gain during COVID-19 was low. Stress was associated with lower emotional eating-depression when concern about weight gain before COVID-19 was low, but when high, stress was associated with higher emotional eating-depression. Stress and concern about weight gain before/during COVID-19 may be relevant to worsened disordered eating and emotional eating in caregivers, a neglected population in the literature. Targeting concern about weight gain may weaken the relationship between stress and emotional eating-depression and emotional eating-boredom among caregivers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jordan, Amy K; Barnhart, Wesley R; Studer-Perez, Emma I; Kalantzis, Maria A; Hamilton, Lindsay; Musher-Eizenman, Dara R",Appetite,,493

Prosumption represents a new message creation and delivery paradigm, where anyone can seamlessly shift from consumer to contributor, to creator. Central to this is the idea of creating ‘use-value’ and re-orientating ‘exchange value’. Perhaps an overlooked facet, but one deeply engrained in its manifestation is that prosumption is inherently relational, involving micro-interaction between consumer and producer. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic, it too being relational in its transmission, has had a paralysing effect on global leisure activities with households and sports organisations experiencing some form of state-enforced residential lockdown.

Access to outpatient specialist and home healthcare services was explored during the pandemic outbreak and the lockdown amongst MS patients in the Lazio region. Adherence to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is also described. METHODS: A population-based study was conducted using regional healthcare administrative databases. A validated algorithm was used to identify MS cases over the period 2011-2018. The numbers of specialist and home-based services were compared between 2019 and 2020. The medication possession ratio was used to measure adherence to DMTs. RESULTS: A total of 9380 MS patients were identified (68% women). A decline in the number of outpatient care services between March and June 2020 compared to the previous year was observed, in particular for rehabilitation (-82%), magnetic resonance imaging (-56%) and neurological specialist services (-91%). Important year-to-year variations were observed in May and June 2020 in home-based nursing and medical care (-91%) and motor re-education services (-74%). Adherence to DMTs was higher in the first 4 months of 2019 compared to the same period of 2020 (67.1% vs. 57.0%). CONCLUSIONS: A notable disruption of rehabilitative therapy and home-based services as well as in DMT adherence was observed. Since the pandemic is still ongoing and interruption of healthcare services could have a major impact on MS patients, it is necessary to monitor access of MS patients to healthcare resources in order to ensure adequate treatments, including rehabilitative therapies.","Colais, Paola; Cascini, Silvia; Balducci, Maria; Agabiti, Nera; Davoli, Marina; Fusco, Danilo; Calandrini, Enrico; Bargagli, Anna Maria",Eur. j. neurol,,493

METHODS: The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of our experience of all ECMO-supported patients transferred from regional hospital of the referential ECMO center between 2015 and 2020 was carried out. Special attention was paid to transportation-related mortality and morbidity. Moreover, a systematic review of the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases was performed. It included the original papers published before the end of 2019. RESULTS: Twelve (5 women and 7 men) critically ill ECMO-supported patients with the median age of 33 years (2–63 years) were transferred to our ECMO center. In 92% (n = 11) of the cases venovenous and in 1 case, venoarterial supports were applied. The median transfer length was 45 km (5–200). There was no mortality during transfer and no serious adverse events occurred. Of note, the first ECMO-supported transfer had been proceeded by high-fidelity simulations. For our systematic review, 68 articles were found and 22 of them satisfied the search criteria. A total number of 2647 transfers were reported, mainly primary (90%) and as ground transportations (91.6%). A rate of adverse events ranged from 1% through 20% but notably only major complications were mentioned. The 4 deaths occurred during transport (mortality 0.15%).

Objective: To generate the best SMM and FM prediction models using machine learning models incorporating socioeconomic, lifestyle, and biochemical parameters and the urban hospital-based Ansan/Ansung cohort, and to determine relations between SMM and FM and metabolic syndrome and its components in this cohort. Methods: SMM and FM data measured using an Inbody 4.0 unit in 90% of Ansan/Ansung cohort participants were used to train seven machine learning algorithms. The ten most essential predictors from 1411 variables were selected by: (1) Manually filtering out 48 variables, (2) generating best models by random grid mode in a training set, and (3) comparing the accuracy of the models in a test set. The seven trained models’ accuracy was evaluated using mean-square errors (MSE), mean absolute errors (MAE), and R² values in 10% of the test set. SMM and FM of the 31,025 participants in the Ansan/Ansung cohort were predicted using the best prediction models (XGBoost for SMM and artificial neural network for FM). Metabolic syndrome and its components were compared between four groups categorized by 50 percentiles of predicted SMM and FM values in the cohort. Results: The best prediction models for SMM and FM were constructed using XGBoost (R2 = 0.82) and artificial neural network (ANN; R2 = 0.89) algorithms, respectively; both models had a low MSE. Serum platelet concentrations and GFR were identified as new biomarkers of SMM, and serum platelet and bilirubin concentrations were found to predict FM. Predicted SMM and FM values were significantly and positively correlated with grip strength (r = 0.726) and BMI (r = 0.915, p < 0.05), respectively. Grip strengths in the high-SMM groups of both genders were significantly higher than in low-SMM groups (p < 0.05), and blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c in high-FM groups were higher than in low-FM groups for both genders (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The models generated by XGBoost and ANN algorithms exhibited good accuracy for estimating SMM and FM, respectively.

616596,Mitteilungen des Berufsverbandes der Deutschen Radiologen,2021-02-26,"Background In England, the onset of COVID-19 and a rapidly increasing infection rate resulted in a lockdown (March-June 2020) which placed strict restrictions on movement of the public, including children. Using data collected from children living in a multi-ethnic city with high levels of deprivation, this study aimed to: (1) report childrens self-reported physical activity (PA) during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown and identify associated factors; (2) examine changes of childrens self-reported PA prior to and during the first UK lockdown. Methods This study is part of the Born in Bradford (BiB) COVID-19 Research Study. PA (amended Youth Activity Profile), sleep, sedentary behaviours, daily frequency/time/destination/activity when leaving the home, were self-reported by 949 children (9-13 years). A sub-sample (n=634) also self-reported PA (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children) pre-pandemic (2017-February 2020). Univariate analysis assessed differences in PA between sex and ethnicity groups; multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with childrens PA. Differences in childrens levels of being sufficiently active were examined using the McNemar test examined change in PA prior to and during the lockdown, and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors explaining change. Results During the pandemic, White British (WB) children were more sufficiently active (34.1%) compared to Pakistani Heritage children (PH) (22.8%) or Other ethnicity children (O) (22.8%). WB children reported leaving the home more frequently and for longer periods than PH and O children. Modifiable variables related to being sufficiently active were frequency, duration, type of activity, and destination away from the home environment. There was a large reduction in children being sufficiently active during the first COVID-19 lockdown (28.9%) compared to pre-pandemic (69.4%). Conclusions Promoting safe extended periods of PA everyday outdoors is important for all children, in particular for children from ethnic minority groups. Childrens PA during the first COVID-19 UK lockdown has drastically reduced from before. Policy and decision makers, and practitioners should consider the findings in order to begin to understand the impact and consequences that COVID-19 has had upon childrens PA which is a key and vital behaviour for health and development.","Bingham, D.

C-reactive protein (CRP) levels could be utilized as a prognosticator for disease severity in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine whether CRP levels are correlated with COVID-19 patient outcomes and length of stay (LoS). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted utilizing data obtained between March and May 2020. Data were collected by abstracting past medical records through electronic medical records at 10 hospitals within CommonSpirit Health. Patients were included if they had a positive COVID-19 test from a nasopharyngeal swab sample, and if they were admitted and then discharged alive or had in-hospital mortality and were ≥18 years. A total of 541 patients had CRP levels measured and were included in this report. Patient outcome and LoS were the endpoints measured. RESULTS: The 541 patients had their CRP levels measured, as well as the demographic and clinical data required for analysis. While controlling for body mass index (BMI), number of comorbidities, and age, the first CRP was significantly predictive of mortality (p<0.001). The odds ratio for first CRP indicates that for each one-unit increase in CRP, the odds of death increased by 0.007. For LoS, the first CRP was a significant predictor (p<0.001), along with age (p=0.002). The number of comorbidities also predicted LoS (p=0.007), but BMI did not. The coefficient for the first CRP indicates that, for each one-unit increase in CRP, LoS increased 0.003 days. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a positive correlation between the CRP levels of COVID-19 patients and their respective outcomes with regard to death and LoS.","Lentner, Jacob; Adams, Taylor; Knutson, Valene; Zeien, Sarah; Abbas, Hassan; Moosavi, Ryan; Manuel, Chris; Wallace, Thomas; Harmon, Adam; Waters, Richard; Ledford, Samuel; Vijayakrishnan, Rajakrishnan; Jagan, Nikhil; Falluji, Nezar; DelCore, Michael; Bay, Curt; Jhamnani, Sunny",Journal of osteopathic medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592071/; https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2021-0103,493

It is the country with the highest population density in the Middle East, Northern Africa and the Mediterranean basin. This review summarizes the prevalence, reservoirs, sources of human infection and control regimes of common bacterial, parasitic and viral zoonoses in animals and humans in Egypt. There is a gap of knowledge conerning the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the human-animal interface in different localities in Egypt. Some zoonotic agents are “exotic” for Egypt (e.g., MERS-CoV and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus), others are endemic (e.g., Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis and Avian influenza). Transboundary transmission of emerging pathogens from and to Egypt occurred via different routes, mainly importation/exportation of apparently healthy animals or migratory birds. Control of the infectious agents and multidrug resistant bacteria in the veterinary sector is on the frontline for infection control in humans. The implementation of control programs significantly decreased the prevalence of some zoonoses, such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, in some localities within the country. Sustainable awareness, education and training targeting groups at high risk (veterinarians, farmers, abattoir workers, nurses, etc.) are important to lessen the burden of zoonotic diseases among Egyptians. There is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of these diseases in Egypt.","Helmy, Yosra A.; El-Adawy, Hosny; Abdelwhab, Elsayed M.",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens6030033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28754024/,493

However, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) have been shown to exert protective effects due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Therefore, it is hypothesized that supplementation with Zn and Cu alone or as an adjuvant may be beneficial with promising efficacy and a favorable safety profile to mitigate symptoms, as well as halt progression of the severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The objective of this review is to discuss the proposed underlying molecular mechanisms and their implications for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection in response to Zn and Cu administration. Several clinical trials have also included the use of Zn as an adjuvant therapy with dietary regimens/antiviral drugs against COVID-19 infection. Overall, this review summarizes that nutritional intervention with Zn and Cu may offer an alternative treatment strategy by eliciting their virucidal effects through several fundamental molecular cascades, such as, modulation of immune responses, redox signaling, autophagy, and obstruction of viral entry and genome replication during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rani, Isha; Goyal, Anmol; Bhatnagar, Mini; Manhas, Sunita; Goel, Parul; Pal, Amit; Prasad, Rajendra",Nutr Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0271531721000300; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2021.05.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000300?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34284268/,493

In this paper, we argue that those conducting social research in the energy domain should give special consideration to the internal and external validity of their work conducted during this pandemic period. We set out a number of principles that researchers can consider to give themselves and research users greater confidence that findings and recommendations will still be applicable in years to come. Largely grounded in existing good practice guidance, our recommendations include collecting and reporting additional supporting contextual data, reviewing aspects of research design for vulnerability to validity challenges, and building in longitudinal elements where feasible. We suggest that these approaches also bring a number of opportunities to generate new insights. However, we caution that a more systemic challenge to validity of knowledge produced during this period may result from changes in the kinds of social research that it is practicable to pursue.","Fell, Michael J.; Pagel, Laura; Chen, Chien-fei; Goldberg, Matthew H.; Herberz, Mario; Huebner, Gesche M.; Sareen, Siddharth; Hahnel, Ulf J.J.",Energy Res Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101646; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214629620302218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839692/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620302218?v=s5,493

645338,Menschen mit HIV in der Corona-Pandemie,2021-06-24,"AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common comorbidities in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of diabetes mellitus on the severity and fatality of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 66 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients were collected and classified into non‐severe (mild/moderate cases) and severe (severe/critical cases) groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the risk of severe COVID‐19 (severe/critical infection). In addition, a meta‐analysis including published studies reported the impacts of diabetes mellitus on severity and fatality of COVID‐19, and our current study was conducted using fixed‐effects models. RESULTS: There were 22 diabetic and 44 non‐diabetic cases among the 66 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. As the results shown, seven cases (31.82%) were diagnosed as severe COVID‐19 in diabetic patients, which was significantly higher than that in non‐diabetic group (4/44, 9.09%, P = 0.033). After adjustment for age and gender, the results showed that diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with COVID‐19 severity (OR: 5.29, 95% CI: 1.07–26.02). A meta‐analysis further confirmed the positive association between diabetes mellitus and COVID‐19 severity (pooled OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.93–3.45). Moreover, the diabetic patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 showed to have 2.95‐fold higher risk of fatality compared to those patients without diabetes mellitus (95% CI: 1.93–4.53). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new evidences that diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of severity and fatality of COVID‐19. Therefore, intensive monitoring and antidiabetic therapy should be considered in diabetic patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This article is protected by copyright.

Pathogens in turn encode numerous factors that inhibit nearly all steps of cGAS-STING signal transduction. From masking of cytosolic DNA ligands, to post-translational modification of cGAS and STING, and degradation of the nucleotide second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP, pathogens have evolved convergent mechanisms to evade cGAS-STING sensing. Here we examine pathogen inhibitors of innate immunity in the context of newly discovered regulatory features controlling cellular cGAS-STING activation. Comparative analysis of these strategies provides insight into mechanisms of action and suggests aspects of cGAS-STING regulation and immune evasion that remain to be discovered.","Eaglesham, James B.; Kranzusch, Philip J.",Curr Opin Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791520300406?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339908/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2020.04.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952791520300406,493

As most research in this field has focused on negative effects of a loss, little is known about potential positive effects experienced by bereaved university students. This study investigated the experience of grief and personal growth in a sample of students from The University of Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Semi-structured interviews via Zoom/telephone with bereaved students (n = 14), who were invited to reflect on their loss and any personal growth potentially experienced. Thematic analysis of the data was based on a deductive and inductive approach. Results: The analysis identified four themes: (i) sharing of grief as a coping mechanism, (ii) balance between grief reactions and moving forward in life, (iii) lessons learned and personal growth, and (iv) adopting values from the deceased person and continuing bonds. Conclusions: Participants emphasized personal growth regarding self-perception and philosophical views on life. Following the loss, they preferred peer support, and used formal services only when they had a specific need. The findings indicate the importance of social support for bereaved students, and the complimentary role of peer and professional support. Hence, academic institutions should offer supportive services tailored to both students and professionals to help bereaved students.","Tan, Jovita; Andriessen, Karl",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669340/,493

With the increasing digitalization of operations by most State Universities in Zimbabwe, the mum effect has the potential to rise to exponential proportions. Guided by the Design Science approach data was gathered from an intensity sample of 15 participants comprising 7 software project team members, 3 ICT project managers, and 5 users of the system drawn from three Zimbabwean state universities. The data collection was done using key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and NVivo (version 11) software was used to store, organise, and code data transcripts. Factors suppressing Bad News Reporting were grouped into three broad categories which included organisational factors, personal factors, and situational factors. The findings suggest the need to incorporate these multi-level factors in the design and implementation of software projects if they are to be efficacious. This study recommends the establishment of clear channels of communication to manage bad news reporting and creating formal structures that function outside the traditional organisational hierarchy to convey information regarding anomalies.

We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral. Community-acquired co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis was uncommon (31/989, 3.1%) and mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.

METHODS: Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULTS: The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","Tariq, Amna; Lee, Yiseul; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Blumberg, Seth; Yan, Ping; Ma, Stefan; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493466/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01615-9,493
684968,Reconstruction for Severe Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation-induced Ischemic Lower Limb Injury Complicated by Osteomyelitis,2020-08-25,"Pulmonary infection is one of the main complications occurring in patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Besides traditional risk factors, dysregulation of lung immune defenses and microbiota may play an important role in ARDS patients. Prone positioning does not seem to be associated with a higher risk of pulmonary infection. Although bacteria associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in ARDS patients are similar to those in patients without ARDS, atypical pathogens (Aspergillus, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus) may also be responsible for infection in ARDS patients. Diagnosing pulmonary infection in ARDS patients is challenging, and requires a combination of clinical, biological and microbiological criteria. The role of modern tools (e.g., molecular methods, metagenomic sequencing, etc.) remains to be evaluated in this setting. One of the challenges of antimicrobial treatment is antibiotics diffusion into the lungs. Although targeted delivery of antibiotics using nebulization may be interesting, their place in ARDS patients remains to be explored. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the most severe patients is associated with a high rate of infection and raises several challenges, diagnostic issues and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics changes being at the top. Prevention of pulmonary infection is a key issue in ARDS patients, but there is no specific measure for these high-risk patients. Reinforcing preventive measures using bundles seems to be the best option.","Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Bouadma, Lila; Morris, Andrew Conway; Dhanani, Jayesh A.; Kollef, Marin; Lipman, Jeffrey; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Nseir, Saad; Ranzani, Otavio T.; Roquilly, Antoine; Schmidt, Matthieu; Torres, Antoni; Timsit, Jean-François",Intensive Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-020-06292-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33175277/,493

687750,Mitteilungen des Berufsverbandes der Deutschen Radiologen,2021-02-01,"The location of autocrine interactions between the v-sis protein and PDGF receptors remains uncertain and controversial. To examine whether receptor-ligand interactions can occur intracellularly, we have constructed fusion proteins that anchor v-sis to specific intracellular membranes. Fusion of a cis-Golgi retention signal from a coronavirus E1 glycoprotein to v-sis protein completely abolished its transforming ability when transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Fusion proteins incorporating mutations in this retention signal were not retained within the Golgi complex but instead were transported to the cell surface, resulting in efficient transformation. All chimeric proteins were shown to dimerize properly. Derivatives of some of these constructs were also constructed bearing the cytoplasmic tail from the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). These constructs allowed examination of subcellular localization by double-label immunofluorescence, using antibodies that distinguish between the extracellular PDGF-related domain and the VSV-G cytoplasmic tail. Colocalization of sis-E1-G with Golgi markers confirmed its targeting to the early Golgi complex. The sis-E1 constructs, targeted to the early Golgi complex, exhibited no proteolytic processing whereas the mutant forms of sis-E1 exhibited normal proteolytic processing. Treatment with suramin, a polyanionic compound that disrupts ligand/receptor interactions at the cell surface, was able to revert the transformed phenotype induced by the mutant sis-E1 constructs described here. Our results demonstrate that autocrine interactions between the v-sis oncoprotein and PDGF receptors within the early Golgi complex do not result in functional signal transduction. Another v-sis fusion protein was constructed by attaching the transmembrane domain and COOH-terminus of TGN38, a protein that localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This construct was primarily retained intracellularly, although some of the fusion protein reached the surface. Deletion of the COOH-terminal region of the TGN38 retention signal abrogated the TGN-localization, as evidenced by very prominent cell surface localization, and resulted in increased transforming activity. The behavior of the sis-TGN38 derivatives is discussed within the context of the properties of TGN38 itself, which is known to recycle from the cell surface to the TGN.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7806564/,493
690331,Was tun mit Atemwegspatienten in Corona-Zeiten?,2021-02-04,"INTRODUCTION: Growing pressures upon Emergency Departments [ED] call for new ways of working with frequent presenters who, although small in number, place extensive demands on services, to say nothing of the costs and consequences for the patients themselves. EDs are often poorly equipped to address the multi-dimensional nature of patient need and the complex circumstances surrounding repeated presentation. Employing a model of intensive short-term community-based case management, the Checkpoint program sought to improve care coordination for this patient group, thereby reducing their reliance on ED. METHOD: This study employed a single group interrupted time series design, evaluating patient engagement with the program and year-on-year individual differences in the number of ED visits pre and post enrolment. Associated savings were also estimated. RESULTS: Prior to intervention, there were two dominant modes in the ED presentation trends of patients. One group had a steady pattern with ≥7 presentations in each of the last four years. The other group had an increasing trend in presentations, peaking in the 12 months immediately preceding enrolment. Following the intervention, both groups demonstrated two consecutive year-on-year reductions. By the second year, and from an overall peak of 22.5 presentations per patient per annum, there was a 53% reduction in presentations. This yielded approximate savings of $7100 per patient. DISCUSSION: Efforts to improve care coordination, when combined with proactive case management in the community, can impact positively on ED re-presentation rates, provided they are concerted, sufficiently intensive and embed the principles of integration. CONCLUSION: The Checkpoint program demonstrated sufficient promise to warrant further exploration of its sustainability. However, health services have yet to determine the ideal organisational structures and funding arrangements to support such initiatives.","Baird, Christine; Oytam, Yalchin; Rahman, Khairunnessa; Fornasari, Marja; Sharma, Anita; Kim, Jinman; Ahn, Euijoon; Hughes, Rod",International journal of integrated care,https://doi.org/10.5334/ijic.5532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220393/,493
