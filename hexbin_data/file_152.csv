323,323,323,Outdoor environments and human pathogens in air,19.807707,2.5716772,2009-12-21,"Are pathogens in outdoor air a health issue at present or will they become a problem in the future? A working group called AirPath - Outdoor Environments and Human Pathogens in Air was set up in 2007 at University College London, UK with the aim of opening new discussion and creating a research network to investigate the science and impacts of outdoor pathogens. Our objective in this paper is to review and discuss the following areas: What is the source of human pathogens in outdoor air? What current, developing and future techniques do we need? Can we identify at-risk groups in relation to their activities and environments? How do we prepare for the anticipated challenges of environmental change and new and emerging diseases? And how can we control for and prevent pathogens in outdoor environments? We think that this work can benefit the wider research community and policy makers by providing a concise overview of various research aspects and considerations which may be important to their work.","Lai, Ka man; Emberlin, Jean; Colbeck, Ian",Environ Health,152,11
1432,1432,1432,Advantages and Limitations of Anticipating Laboratory Test Results from Regression- and Tree-Based Rules Derived from Electronic Health-Record Data,19.942078,3.0230944,2014-04-14,"Laboratory testing is the single highest-volume medical activity, making it useful to ask how well one can anticipate whether a given test result will be high, low, or within the reference interval (“normal”). We analyzed 10 years of electronic health records—a total of 69.4 million blood tests—to see how well standard rule-mining techniques can anticipate test results based on patient age and gender, recent diagnoses, and recent laboratory test results. We evaluated rules according to their positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC AUCs). Using a stringent cutoff of PPV and/or NPV≥0.95, standard techniques yield few rules for sendout tests but several for in-house tests, mostly for repeat laboratory tests that are part of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Most rules were clinically and pathophysiologically plausible, and several seemed clinically useful for informing pre-test probability of a given result. But overall, rules were unlikely to be able to function as a general substitute for actually ordering a test. Improving laboratory utilization will likely require different input data and/or alternative methods.","Mohammad, Fahim; Theisen-Toupal, Jesse C.; Arnaout, Ramy",PLoS One,152,5

Campylobacter jejuni causes a form of gastroenteritis called campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter drug resistance is considered a serious threat. In order to better understand national and international research output on Campylobacter, we conducted this bibliometric overview of publications on Campylobacter. This study can be used to assess extent of interaction and response of researchers, food regulators, and health policy makers to global burden of campylobacateriosis. METHODS: Scopus database was used to retrieve publications with the following keywords (Campylobacter/campylobacteriosis, C. jejuni, C. coli). The study period was set from 2000 to 2015. All types of journal documents, excluding errata, were considered. Bibliometric indicators such as annual growth of publications, country contribution, international collaboration, and citation analysis were presented. The quality of retrieved data was indirectly assessed by Hirsch index and impact factor of journals. RESULTS: A total of 5522 documents were retrieved with median (Q1–Q3) citations of 9 (2–23) and h-index of 113. Annual number of publications showed a fluctuating increase. The core leading journals were Applied and Environmental Microbiology journal and Journal of Food Protection with 246 (4.46%) publications for each. The USA (1309; 23.6%) was the most productive country while Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (150; 2.7%) was the most productive institution. Half of the top ten productive countries were European. France had the lowest percentage (33.5%) of articles with international collaboration while Netherlands (57.7%) had the highest percentage of articles with international collaboration. Approximately half (50.1%) of retrieved articles were published in journals under the subject area of “immunology/microbiology”. Main themes in highly cited articles were molecular biology/genetics and public health burden of campylobacteriosis. There were 728 (13.1%) articles on campylobacter-related drug resistance, and the top cited articles focused mainly on increasing resistance to quinolones and fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS: There was a clear increase in number of publications on Campylobacter. Rational use of antimicrobials in humans, poultry, and animals is highly recommended. International collaboration is highly required particularly in implementing new diagnostic screening technologies to minimize global health burden of Campylobacter and ensure food safety.","Sweileh, Waleed M.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.; Sawalha, Ansam F.; AbuTaha, Adham S.; Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",J Health Popul Nutr,152,5

While several theoretical perspectives provide insights on this relationship, the literature lacks an integrative framework explaining the relationship. We develop a conceptual model explaining the link between subjective well-being and physiological functioning in the context of work. Integrating positive psychology and occupational stress perspectives, our model explains the relationship between subjective well-being and physiological functioning as a result of the direct influence of subjective well-being on physiological functioning and of their common relationships with work stress and personal resources, both of which are influenced by job conditions.","Kuykendall, Lauren; Tay, Louis",Health Psychol Open,152,5

The review is primarily focused on routinely collected information covering a whole country. No attempt is made to draw up an inventory of sources by country; the paper deals instead with the pros and cons of each source for mortality and morbidity studies in demography. While each source considered separately can already yield useful, though partial, results, record linkage among data sources can significantly improve the analysis. Record linkage can also lead to the detection of possible causal associations that could eventually be confirmed. More generally, Big Data can reveal changing mortality and morbidity trends and patterns that could lead to preventive measures being taken rather than more costly curative ones.","Wunsch, Guillaume; Gourbin, Catherine",Genus,152,5

However, there is a lack of early signs suggesting right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction prior to acute cor pulmonale development. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analytical cohort study of patients for acute respiratory distress syndrome undertaking an echocardiography during admission in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Patients were divided according to treatment: conventional protective ventilation (38 patients, 38%); interventional lung assist (23 patients, 23%); veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (37 patients, 37%). Systolic and diastolic function was studied assessing, respectively: right ventricular systolic longitudinal function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and systolic contraction duration (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length); right ventricular diastolic filling time and right ventricular diastolic restrictive pattern (presence of pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave). Correlation between the respiratory mechanics and systo-diastolic parameters were analysed. RESULTS: In 98 patients studied, systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <16 mm) was present in 33.6% while diastolic restrictive pattern was present in 64%. A negative correlation was found between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001; r −0.42). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length correlated with right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.001; r −0.39). Pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave was associated with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P<0.0001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001), right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.0001), positive end-expiratory pressure (P<0.0001) and peak inspiratory pressure (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Diastolic restrictive pattern is present in a remarkable percentage of patients with respiratory distress syndrome. Bedside echocardiography allows a mechanistic evaluation of systolic and diastolic interaction of the right ventricle.","Tavazzi, Guido; Bergsland, Niels; Alcada, Joana; Price, Susanna",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,152,5

The transmission cycle involves human (or other mammalian) water contact with surface water contaminated by faeces or urine, as well as specific freshwater snails acting as intermediate hosts. The main disease-causing species are S. haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. According to the World Health Organisation, over 250 million people are infected worldwide, leading to considerable morbidity and the estimated loss of 1.9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a likely underestimated figure. Schistosomiasis is characterised by focal epidemiology and an over-dispersed population distribution, with higher infection rates in children. Complex immune mechanisms lead to the slow acquisition of immune resistance, but innate factors also play a part. Acute schistosomiasis, a feverish syndrome, is most evident in travellers following a primary infection. Chronic schistosomiasis affects mainly individuals with long-standing infections residing in poor rural areas. Immunopathological reactions against schistosome eggs trapped in host tissues lead to inflammatory and obstructive disease in the urinary system (S. haematobium) or intestinal disease, hepatosplenic inflammation and liver fibrosis (S. mansoni and S. japonicum). An effective drug—praziquantel—is available for treatment but, despite intensive efforts, no schistosomiasis vaccines have yet been accepted for public use. In this review, we briefly introduce the schistosome parasites and the immunopathogenic manifestations resulting from schistosomiasis. We then explore aspects of the immunology and host-parasite interplay in schistosome infections paying special attention to the current status of schistosomiasis vaccine development highlighting the advancement of a new controlled human challenge infection model for testing schistosomiasis vaccines.","McManus, Donald P.; Bergquist, Robert; Cai, Pengfei; Ranasinghe, Shiwanthi; Tebeje, Biniam Mathewos; You, Hong",Semin Immunopathol,152,5

The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for postoperative morbidity after elective ileostomy closure. METHODS: The ACS-NSQIP dataset was evaluated for elective ileostomy closures from 1/1/2015 to 12/31/2016. Demographic characteristics, operative, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The primary outcome was 30-day major morbidity (Clavien class III and greater). Secondary outcomes were rates and predictors of major morbidity, superficial site infection (SSI), reoperation, and readmission from multivariate logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 1885 patients. The median operative time was 65 (IQR 50–90) minutes and median length of stay was 3 (IQR 2–5) days. Major morbidity was recorded in 6.7%, including mortality (1.0%), deep/organ space SSI (2.6%), dehiscence (0.8%), reintubation (0.5%), sepsis (1.7%), septic shock (0.8%), and reoperation (3.7%). Readmission was recorded in 9.7% and 6.2% had SSI. Multivariate logistic regression showed male sex (OR 1.584; 95% CI 1.068–2.347; p = 0.022) and longer operative time (OR 1.004; 95% CI 1.001–1.007; p = 0.009) were among those variables associated with increased odds of major morbidity. Dyspnea (OR 2.431; 95% CI 1.139–5.094; p = 0.021) and longer operative time (OR 1.003; 95% CI 1.001–1.007; p = 0.034) were among the independent risk factors for SSI. Male sex (OR 2.246; 95% CI 1.297–3.892; p = 0.004, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.959; 95% CI 1.153–7.591; p = 0.024), and longer operative time (OR 1.005; 95% CI 1.001–1.009; p = 0.011) were associated with increased odds of reoperation. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.578; 95% CI 1.338–4.968; p = 0.005), wound infection (OR 2.680; 95% CI 1.043–6.890; p = 0.041), and inflammatory bowel disease (OR 2.565; 95% CI 1.203–5.463; p = 0.015) were associated with increased odds of readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Elective stoma closure has significant risk of morbidity. Patients with longer operative times were at increased risk for major morbidity, overall SSI, and reoperation. From the analysis, factors specifically associated with major morbidity, overall infectious complications, readmissions, and reoperations were identified. This information can be used to prospectively prepare for these high-risk patients, potentially improving postoperative outcomes.

Furthermore, many marketed drugs that were later found to also have NF-κB targeting activity were repurposed for new therapeutic interventions. Despite the rising importance of biologics in drug discovery, small molecules got around 76% of US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration-US) approval in the last decade.

We retrospectively studied adult patients supported with femoral VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock between 2015 and 2019 at our tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: The study included 65 adult patients supported with femoral VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock. The studied patients had a mean age of 37.9 ± 14.87 years, mostly males (70.8%), a mean BSA of 1.77 ± 0.27 m(2), and a mean BMI of 26.1 ± 6.7 kg/m(2). Twenty-one (32.3%) patients developed acute lower limb ischemia. The patients who developed acute limb ischemia had significantly frequent AKI (< 0.001) without significant use of haemodialysis (p = 0.07) and longer ICU stay (p = 0.028) compared to the patients without limb ischemia. The hospital mortality occurred in 29 (44.6%) patients without significant difference between the patients with and without acute limb ischemia. The occurrence of acute limb ischemia was significantly correlated with failed percutaneous cannulation (p = 0.039), while there was no significant statistical correlation between the cut-down technique and occurrence of limb ischemia (p = 0.053). The occurrence of femoral cannulation site bleeding was significantly correlated with failed percutaneous cannulation (p = 0.001) and cut-down technique (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Acute vascular complications are frequent after femoral VA-ECMO. Failed percutaneous femoral cannulation has been, in this study, identified as the most important risk factor for acute limb ischemia and cannulation site bleeding. A careful approach during femoral cannulation is recommended to prevent occurrence of acute limb ischemia and femoral cannulation site bleeding.","Laimoud, Mohamed; Saad, Elias; Koussayer, Samer",Egypt Heart J,152,5

Cardiac endoplasm reticulum (ER) stress increases with age and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction. Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug that protects cardiac mitochondria during acute ER stress. We hypothesized that metformin treatment would improve preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction in aged hearts by attenuating ER stress, followed by a decrease in cardiac injury during subsequent ischemia and reperfusion. Male young (3 mo.) and aged mice (24 mo.) received metformin (300 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking water with sucrose (0.2 g/100 ml) as sweetener for two weeks versus sucrose vehicle alone. Cytosol, subsarcolemmal (SSM), and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) were isolated. In separate groups, cardioprotection was evaluated using ex vivo isolated heart perfusion with 25 min. global ischemia and 60 min. reperfusion. Infarct size was measured. The contents of CHOP and cleaved ATF6 were decreased in metformin-treated 24 mo. mice compared to vehicle, supporting a decrease in ER stress. Metformin treatment improved OXPHOS in IFM in 24 mo. using a complex I substrate. Metformin treatment decreased infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion. Thus, metformin feeding decreased cardiac injury in aged mice during ischemia-reperfusion by improving pre-ischemic mitochondrial function via inhibition of ER stress.","Chen, Qun; Thompson, Jeremy; Hu, Ying; Lesnefsky, Edward J.",Aging (Albany NY),152,5

However, knowledge on what drives user emotion and behavioral responses to emergency event developments are still limited. Therefore, unlike previous studies that have only explored trending themes and public sentiment in social media, this study sought to develop a holistic framework to assess the impact of emergency developments on emotions and behavior by exploring the evolution of trending themes and public sentiments in social media posts as a focal event developed. By examining the event timelines and the associated hashtags on the popular Chinese social media site Sina-Weibo, the 2019 Wuxi viaduct collapse accident was taken as the research object and the event timeline and the Sina-Weibo tagging function focused on to analyze the behaviors and emotional changes in the social media users and elucidate the correlations. It can conclude that: (i) There were some social media rules being adhered to and that new focused news from the same event impacted user behavior and the popularity of previous thematic discussions. (ii) While the most critical function for users appeared to express their emotions, the user foci changed when recent focus news emerged. (iii) As the news of the collapse deepened, the change in user sentiment was found to be positively correlated with the information released by personal-authentication accounts.

The objective of this Phase I trial (NCT03299309) was to assess the safety and feasibility of a novel pp65 peptide vaccine (PEP-CMV) in children and young adults with recurrent medulloblastoma and malignant glioma. METHODS: Vaccines contain a synthetic long peptide (SLP) of 26 amino acids encoding multiple potential class I, class II, and antibody epitopes of CMV pp65 across several haplotypes. This SLP is administered as an emulsion in Montanide ISA 51. Patients receive a single course of temozolomide to induce lymphopenia, tetanus/diphtheria toxoid site preconditioning, then vaccines administered intradermally every two weeks for 3 doses, then monthly. RESULTS: To date, 17 patients have been enrolled. Diagnoses include medulloblastoma (n=1), glioblastoma (n=9), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (n=2), anaplastic astrocytoma (n=2), and malignant glioma NOS (n=3). Mean number of prior treatment regimens is 4.9 (range 1–12). Mean age is 22yo (range 6–35) and 41% of patients are male. The median KPS is 80. The median number of vaccines given at time of analysis is 3.3 (range 1–12). There have been no ≥ 3 Grade toxicities related to the vaccine. One patient developed nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and tachycardia after vaccination and had elevated inflammatory cytokines consistent with cytokine release syndrome. Median PFS is 2.5 months (95% CI: 0.8, not estimable) and median OS is 6.5 months (95% CI 1.8, not estimable). Interim analysis of immune monitoring bloodwork and perfusion MRI to quantify responses to PEP-CMV has been delayed due to COVID-19. However, adults with GBM who received PEP-CMV (NCT02864368) had significant (p≤0.05) increases in GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-8, MIP1-α, and TNF-α levels. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results demonstrate that PEP-CMV is feasible and well-tolerated in heavily pretreated, multiply recurrent patients.","Thompson, Eric; Landi, Daniel; Thompson, Eric; Lipp, Eric; Balajonda, Bea; Herndon, James; Buckley, Evan; Flahiff, Charlene; Jaggers, Denise; Schroeder, Kristin; Randazzo, Dina; Desjardins, Annick; Johnson, Maggie; Peters, Katherine; Khasraw, Mustafa; Malinzak, Michael; Mitchell, Duane; Ashley, David; Sampson, John",Neuro Oncol,152,1

Whether the inhibition of mitochondrial fission is beneficial to sepsis-related organ dysfunction and underlying mechanisms are unknown. Cecal ligation and puncture induced sepsis in rats and dynamic related protein 1 knockout mice, lipopolysaccharide-treated vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, were used to explore the effects of inhibition of mitochondrial fission and specific mechanisms. Our study showed that mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 could antagonize sepsis-induced organ dysfunction including heart, vascular smooth muscle, liver, kidney, and intestinal functions, and prolonged animal survival. The further study showed that mitochondrial functions such as mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine-triphosphate contents, reactive oxygen species, superoxide dismutase and malonaldehyde were recovered after Mdivi-1 administration via improving mitochondrial morphology. And sepsis-induced inflammation and apoptosis in heart and vascular smooth muscle were alleviated through inhibition of mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial function improvement. The parameter trends in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells were similar in vivo.

Does the induction of a model of lung injury affect the expiratory time constant (τE) in terms of either total duration or morphology? Does ventilation with gases of different densities alter the duration or morphology of τE either before or after injury? What is the main finding and its importance? The use of sulfur hexafluoride in ventilating gas mixtures lengthens total expiratory time constants before and after lung injury compared with both nitrogen and helium mixtures. Sulfur hexafluoride mixtures also decrease the difference and variability of τE between fast- and slow-emptying compartments before and after injury when compared with nitrogen and helium mixtures. Acute lung injury is characterized by regional heterogeneity of lung resistance and elastance that may lead to regional heterogeneity of expiratory time constants (τE). We hypothesized that increasing airflow resistance by using inhaled sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) would lengthen time constants and decrease their heterogeneity in an experimental model of lung injury when compared with nitrogen or helium mixtures. To overcome the limitations of a single-compartment model, we employed a multisegment model of expiratory gas flow. An experimental model of lung injury was created using intratracheal injection of sodium polyacrylate in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated female Yorkshire-cross pigs (n = 7). The animals were ventilated with 50% O2 and the remaining 50% as nitrogen (N2), helium (He) or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Values for τE decreased with injury and were more variable after injury than before (P < 0.001). Values for τE increased throughout expiration both before and after injury, and the rate of increase in τE was lessened by SF6 (P < 0.001 when compared with N2 both before and after injury). Altering the inhaled gas density did not affect indices of oxygenation, dead space or shunt. The use of SF6 in ventilating gas mixtures lengthens total expiratory time constants before and after lung injury compared with both N2 and He mixtures. Importantly, SF6 mixtures also decrease the difference and variability of τE between fast- and slow-emptying compartments before and after injury when compared with N2 and He mixtures.","Henderson, William R; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Dominelli, Paolo B; Brasher, Penelope M A; Griesdale, Donald E G; Foster, Glen E; Yacyshyn, Alexandra; Ayas, Najib T; Sheel, A William",Experimental physiology,152,16

In clinical practice, diammonium glycyrrhizinate is usually used with omeprazole in patients with viral hepatitis and cirrhosis accompanied by peptic ulcers. However, the drug interaction between diammonium glycyrrhizinate and omeprazole remains unclear. 2. In this study, the effects of diammonium glycyrrhizinate on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole was investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical method. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to two groups: omeprazole and omeprazole + diammonium glycyrrhizinate, and the main pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated after oral administration. It was found that using the omeprazole along with the diammonium glycyrrhizinate increased the AUC, AUMC, Cmax for omeprazole. 3. For this reason, we used the LC-MS/MS to detect the binding rate of plasma protein (BRPP) of omeprazole in rats, it was found that diammonium glycyrrhizinate could decrease the BRPP in rats. In addition, we found that diammonium glycyrrhizinate specifically inhibited the enzyme activity of the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, which are involved in the metabolism of the omeprazole. 4. These results mean that diammonium glycyrrhizinate could inhibit the metabolism and increase the plasma concentration of the omeprazole in rats. Overall, diammonium glycyrrhizinate can influence the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole by inhibiting CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activities and decreasing BRPP of omeprazole.","Han, Lu; Wang, Rong; Wu, Bin; Gu, Yanqiu; Yuan, Yongfang",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,152,16

We review some current misconceptions about UC in adults with the aim of optimizing care for patients. Although UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are considered discrete diseases, distinctions between them are not always clear-cut and phenotypes may change over time. Patient management should take into account disease manifestations, disease severity and extent, and response to prior treatments. Although disease extent often defines severity, distal UC is not always less disabling than extensive disease as patients can progress to more extensive disease. In addition, severe proctitis can give rise to severe and debilitating symptoms, with a substantial impact on health-related quality of life. UC carries an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with CD; however, more recent data indicate a similar risk of CRC in CD with colonic involvement as with UC. Corticosteroids are widely used to induce remission in UC, and prolonged use of steroids in patients with UC is common, but corticosteroid-free maintenance of remission is an important therapeutic goal. Although biologic therapies provide a valuable treatment option in UC, they are not clinically effective in all patients and are also associated with secondary loss of response.","D'Haens, Geert R A M; Lindsay, James O; Panaccione, Remo; Schreiber, Stefan",Drugs in R&D,152,23

If this is the case, thalamic circuit imbalance can be considered as a core mechanistic defect in schizophrenia, unconfounded by the age of onset. METHOD Totally 116 adolescents with EOS (63 drug-naive EOS) and 55 matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited and underwent resting-state fMRI scans. To define the specific location of the thalamic subregions in thalamocortical circuit, 16 atlas-based thalamic subdivisions were employed in functional connectivity analysis. RESULTS The EOS group showed increased sensorimotor-thalamic connectivity and decreased prefrontal-/cerebello-thalamic connectivity, consistent with AOS. Sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity was more prominent than prefrontal-thalamic hypoconnectivity, which was circumscribed to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in EOS. Of note, the EOS group specifically exhibited strengthened thalamic connectivity with the Salience Network (SN). Additionally, the EOS showed a more prominent disruption of the lateral thalamic nuclear connectivity. CONCLUSION Thalamic dysconnectivity observed in the EOS extends the observations from adult patients. Sensorimotor-thalamic hyperconnectivity is critical for the expression of schizophrenia phenotype irrespective of the onset age, raising the possibility of aberrant, but accelerated functional network maturation in EOS. The specific thalamocortical dysconnectivity involving the SN and mPFC may underlie the distinctive features of multi-modal hallucinations and heightened emotional valence of psychotic seen in the EOS.","Zhang, Manqi; Palaniyappan, Lena; Deng, Mengjie; Zhang, Wen; Pan, Yunzhi; Fan, Zebin; Tan, Wenjian; Wu, Guowei; Liu, Zhening; Pu, Weidan",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,152,1

In contrast, a convenient one single-time-point scan might also reveal relevant information on expected dose to organs. However, very early time points might not reflect the true retention by the renal cortex and therefore be of limited value to predict dose for the long-lived 177Lu. PATIENTS AND METHODS Dosimetry with 111In-octreotide was performed in 24 patients, and the number of disintegrations (ND) were calculated for 177Lu. Uptake values for each time point were correlated with ND. RESULTS The fitting algorithm was best with biexponential equations in 18 patients. Mean biologic half-life of the alpha component was 6 hours (+/-12 hours) and for the beta component 82 hours (+/-38 hours). For the early time points, correlation with ND was generally poor. For later time points, correlation increased markedly after 4 hours (4 hours: r = 0.83, 72 hours: r = 0.93) and were also capable of predicting dosimetry to some extent.

The rapid increase in the number of cases has caused widespread panic among people and has become the main public health problem in the world. Severe patients often have difficult breathing and/or hypoxemia after 1 week of onset. A few critically ill patients may not only rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, but also may cause coagulopathy, as well as multiple organs failure (such as heart, liver and kidney) or even death. This article is to analyze the predictive role of clinical features in patients with COVID-19 for severe disease, so as to help doctor monitor the severity-related features, restrain the disease progress, and provide a reference for improvement of medical treatment. METHODS The clinical data of 208 patients with COVID-19 who were isolated and treated in Changsha Public Health Treatment Center from January 17, 2020 to March 14, 2020 were collected. All patients were the mild and ordinary adult patients on admission, including 105 males and 103 females from 19 to 84 (median age 44) years old. According to the ""Program for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infected pneumonia (Trial version 7)"" issued by the General Office of National Health Committee and Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine as the diagnostic and typing criteria. According to progression from mild to severe disease during hospitalization, the patients were divided into a mild group (n=183) and a severe transformation group (n=25). The clinical features such as age, underlying disease, blood routine, coagulation function, blood biochemistry, oxygenation index, and so on were analyzed. Among them, laboratory tests included white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), plasma fibrinogen (Fib), activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), D-dimer, total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and oxygen partial pressure in arterial blood. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fractional concentration of inspiratory oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was calculated. The variables with statistical significance were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Patients in the severe transformation group had more combined underlying diseases than those in the mild group (P<0.05). From the perspective of disease distribution, patients in the severe transformation group had more combined hypertension (P<0.05). In the severe transformation group, PT was significantly longer, the levels of Fib, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP were significantly higher than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001), while LYM, ALB, and PaO2/FiO2 were significantly lower than those in the mild group (P<0.05 or P<0.001). Logistic regression analysis was performed on clinical features with statistically significant differences. Combined with hypertension, LYM, PT, Fib, ALB, ALT, AST, CK, LDH, and CRP as independent variables, and having severe disease or not was the dependent variable. The results show that combined hypertension, decreased LYM, longer PT, and increased CK level were independent risk factors that affected the severity of COVID-19 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The patients with mild COVID-19 who are apt to develop severe diseases may be related to combined hypertension, decreased LYM, and longer PT, and increased CK level. For the mild patients with these clinical features, early intervention may effectively prevent the progression to severe diseases.","Mo, Juan; Liu, Jiyang; Wu, Songbai; LÜ, Ailian; Xiao, Le; Chen, Dong; Zhou, Yun; Liang, Lu; Liu, Xiaofang; Zhao, Jinjin",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Pathology in humans ranges from sub-clinical to acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis and meningitis. Until now, all of the enteroviral proteins were thought to derive from the proteolytic processing of a polyprotein encoded in a single open reading frame. Here we report that many enterovirus genomes also harbour an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is subject to strong purifying selection. Using echovirus 7 and poliovirus 1, we confirmed the expression of uORF protein in infected cells. Through ribosome profiling (a technique for the global footprinting of translating ribosomes), we also demonstrated translation of the uORF in representative members of the predominant human enterovirus species, namely Enterovirus A, B and C. In differentiated human intestinal organoids, uORF protein-knockout echoviruses are attenuated compared to the wild-type at late stages of infection where membrane-associated uORF protein facilitates virus release. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown enterovirus protein that facilitates virus growth in gut epithelial cells-the site of initial viral invasion into susceptible hosts. These findings overturn the 50-year-old dogma that enteroviruses use a single-polyprotein gene expression strategy and have important implications for the understanding of enterovirus pathogenesis.","Lulla, Valeria; Dinan, Adam M; Hosmillo, Myra; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Sherry, Lee; Irigoyen, Nerea; Nayak, Komal M; Stonehouse, Nicola J; Zilbauer, Matthias; Goodfellow, Ian; Firth, Andrew E",Nature microbiology,152,8

However, practical deployment of the technology is hindered by the bioinformatics challenge of analyzing results accurately and in a clinically relevant timeframe. Here we describe SURPI (""sequence-based ultrarapid pathogen identification""), a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data generated from clinical samples, and demonstrate use of the pipeline in the analysis of 237 clinical samples comprising more than 1.1 billion sequences. Deployable on both cloud-based and standalone servers, SURPI leverages two state-of-the-art aligners for accelerated analyses, SNAP and RAPSearch, which are as accurate as existing bioinformatics tools but orders of magnitude faster in performance. In fast mode, SURPI detects viruses and bacteria by scanning data sets of 7-500 million reads in 11 min to 5 h, while in comprehensive mode, all known microorganisms are identified, followed by de novo assembly and protein homology searches for divergent viruses in 50 min to 16 h.

OBJECTIVES To determine effectiveness of (a) hand-held narrowband-UVB (NB-UVB) and (b) combination of potent topical corticosteroid (TCS) and NB-UVB compared to TCS, for localised vitiligo. METHODS Pragmatic, 3-arm, placebo-controlled RCT (9 months' treatment; 12 months' follow-up). Adults and children, recruited from secondary care and community, aged ≥5 years with active vitiligo affecting <10% of skin, were randomised 1:1:1 to receive: TCS (mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment + dummy NB-UVB); NB-UVB (NB-UVB + placebo TCS); or combination (TCS + NB-UVB). TCS applied once daily on alternating weeks; NB-UVB administered alternate days in escalating doses, adjusted for erythema. PRIMARY OUTCOME treatment success at 9 months at target patch assessed using participant-reported Vitiligo Noticeability Scale, with multiple imputation for missing data. RESULTS 517 participants were randomised: TCS (n=173), NB-UVB (n = 169), combination (n=175). Primary outcome data were available for 370 (72%) participants. Target patch treatment success was 17% (TCS), 22% (NB-UVB) and 27% (combination). Combination treatment was superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 10.9% (95% CI 1.0% to 20.9%; p= 0.032; NNT=10). NB-UVB alone was not superior to TCS: adjusted between group difference 5.2% (95% CI -4.4% to 14.9%; p= 0.290; NNT=19). Participants using interventions >75% expected were more likely to achieve treatment success, but effects were lost once treatment stopped. Localised grade 3 or 4 erythema was reported in 62 (12%) participants (including 3 with dummy light). Skin thinning was reported in 13 (2.5%) participants (including 1 with placebo ointment). CONCLUSION Combination treatment with home-based hand-held NB-UVB plus TCS is likely to be superior to TCS alone for treatment of localised vitiligo.

Initially, her daily ECGs showed QTc intervals within normal limits; however, she experienced a rapid increase in QTc interval from 317 ms to 784 ms within a 24-hour period after methadone had been discontinued for excessive sedation. QTc interval greater than 500 ms is considered to be high risk for the fatal arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes. Daily ECGs did not detect a gradual increase in the QTc interval that would have alerted the medical staff of the need to decrease or stop the methadone before reaching a prolonged QTc interval associated with cardiotoxicity.

Cyanobacterial carbohydrates have been discussed as an emerging renewable feedstock in industrial biotechnology for the production of fuels and chemicals, showing promising production rates when compared to crop-based feedstock. However, intrinsic capacities of cyanobacteria to produce biotechnological compounds are limited and yields are low. RESULTS Here, we present an approach to circumvent these problems by employing a synthetic bacterial co-culture for the carbon-neutral production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from CO2. The co-culture consists of two bio-modules: Bio-module I, in which the cyanobacterial strain Synechococcus elongatus cscB fixes CO2, converts it to sucrose, and exports it into the culture supernatant; and bio-module II, where this sugar serves as C-source for Pseudomonas putida cscAB and is converted to PHAs that are accumulated in the cytoplasm. By applying a nitrogen-limited process, we achieved a maximal PHA production rate of 23.8 mg/(L day) and a maximal titer of 156 mg/L. We will discuss the present shortcomings of the process and show the potential for future improvement. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the feasibility of mixed cultures of S. elongatus cscB and P. putida cscAB for PHA production, making room for the cornucopia of possible products that are described for P. putida. The construction of more efficient sucrose-utilizing P. putida phenotypes and the optimization of process conditions will increase yields and productivities and eventually close the gap in the contemporary process. In the long term, the co-culture may serve as a platform process, in which P. putida is used as a chassis for the implementation of synthetic metabolic pathways for biotechnological production of value-added products.","Löwe, Hannes; Hobmeier, Karina; Moos, Manuel; Kremling, Andreas; Pflüger-Grau, Katharina",Biotechnology for biofuels,152,16

Although simulation is now considered an important adjunct to operating-room-based training for learning laparoscopic skills, there is very little literature assessing the use of simulation in resource-restricted countries. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and impact of a 3-day Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) course in Botswana, Africa. METHODS A total of 20 surgeons and trainees participated in a 3-day FLS course. A pretest FLS score was obtained for each subject, followed by 2 days of practice with feedback. A final FLS posttest score was then obtained. Participants also watched the FLS instructional CD-ROM and took the written test on day 3. RESULTS Mean posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores for each FLS task and for the total normalized FLS simulator score (285 +/- 94 versus 132 +/- 92, p < 0.001). The mean score on the written test was 242 (116). In total, only two surgeons achieved a passing score on both the cognitive and skills assessment required to obtain FLS certification. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first time the FLS program has been taught in Africa. We have shown that giving the FLS course in a resource-restricted country is feasible and resulted in a significant improvement in FLS technical skills after 3 days. Most surgeons, however, still did not reach FLS passing scores, indicating that more than 3 days will be required in future courses to help surgeons obtain FLS certification.","Okrainec, Allan; Smith, Lloyd; Azzie, Georges",Surgical endoscopy,152,19

Unfortunately, repair failure remains a common problem after rotator cuff repair surgery. Several factors may contribute to repair failure, including age, tear size, and time from injury. However, the mechanical mechanisms resulting in repair failure are not well understood, making clinical management difficult. Specifically, altered scapular motion (termed scapular dyskinesis) may be one important and modifiable factor contributing to the risk of repair failure. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of scapular dyskinesis on supraspinatus tendon healing after repair. METHODS A rat model of scapular dyskinesis was used. Seventy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were randomized into 2 groups: nerve transection of the accessory and long thoracic nerves (SD) or sham nerve transection (Sham control). After this procedure, all rats underwent unilateral detachment and repair of the supraspinatus tendon. All rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Shoulder function, passive joint mechanics, and tendon properties (mechanical, histologic, organizational, and compositional) were evaluated. RESULTS Scapular dyskinesis alters joint function and may lead to compromised supraspinatus tendon properties. Specifically, diminished mechanical properties, altered histology, and decreased tendon organization were observed for some parameters. CONCLUSION This study identifies scapular dyskinesis as one underlying mechanism leading to compromise of supraspinatus healing after repair. Identifying modifiable factors that lead to compromised tendon healing will help improve clinical outcomes after repair.","Reuther, Katherine E; Tucker, Jennica J; Thomas, Stephen J; Vafa, Rameen P; Liu, Stephen S; Gordon, Joshua A; Caro, Adam C; Yannascoli, Sarah M; Kuntz, Andrew F; Soslowsky, Louis J",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,152,1

Debate remains, however, how can we best define changes in syringomyelia following surgery. OBJECTIVE To introduce a grading system focusing on syrinx reduction based on routinely and reproducible radiological information, and provide a suggestion of the application of this scale for prediction of patient's prognoses. METHODS Data from 48 patients with Chiari malformation and syringomyelia were compiled. We calculated syrinx cross-sectional area by approximating an ellipse in the largest axial plane. We compared the percentage of reduction or enlargement following surgery. The percentage change was grouped into four grades: Grade 0 = Increasing size, grade I ≤ 50% reduction, grade II = 50% to 90% reduction, grade III ≥ 90% reduction. RESULTS A total of 89.6% of patients had syrinx improvement after surgery. A total of 5 patients were grade 0, 14 were grade I, 20 patients were grade II, and 9 patients met criteria for grade III. The mean postoperative syrinx area was 24.1 mm2 (0-169 mm2) with a mean syrinx reduction of 62.7%.

Hence, anesthesia aims for an unconscious patient at the beginning and end of surgery but an awake and responsive patient in between. We investigated the plasma (Cplasma) and effect-site (Ceffect-site) propofol concentration as well as the related Bispectral Index (BIS) required for intraoperative return of consciousness and begin of neurological testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 13 patients, arterial Cplasma were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography and Ceffect-site was estimated based on the Marsh and Schnider pharmacokinetic/dynamic (pk/pd) models. The BIS, Cplasma and Ceffect-site were compared during the intraoperative awakening period at designated time points such as return of consciousness and start of the Boston Naming Test (neurological test). RESULTS Return of consciousness occurred at a BIS of 77±7 (mean±SD) and a measured Cplasma of 1.2±0.4 μg/mL. The Marsh model predicted a significantly (P<0.001) higher Cplasma of 1.9±0.4 µg/mL as compared with the Schnider model (Cplasma=1.4±0.4 µg/mL) at return of consciousness. Neurological testing was possible as soon as the BIS had increased to 92±6 and measured Cplasma had decreased to 0.8±0.3 µg/mL. This translated into a time delay of 23±12 minutes between return of consciousness and begin of neurological testing. At begin of neurological testing, Cplasma according to Marsh (Cplasma=1.3±0.5 µg/mL) was significantly (P=0.002) higher as compared with the Schnider model (Cplasma=1.0±0.4 µg/mL). CONCLUSIONS To perform intraoperative neurological testing, patients are required to be fully awake with plasma propofol concentrations as low as 0.8 µg/mL. Following our clinical setup, the Schnider pk/pd model estimates propofol concentrations significantly more accurate as compared with the Marsh model at this neurologically crucial time point.","Soehle, Martin; Wolf, Christina F; Priston, Melanie J; Neuloh, Georg; Bien, Christian G; Hoeft, Andreas; Ellerkmann, Richard K",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,152,16

METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 1647 patients between the ages of 30 and 65 years with HPV 16/18 undergoing colposcopy-guided biopsy at a tertiary gynecological cancer center between January-2016 and January-2019. We compared the preinvasive lesion rates and the invasive cervical cancer rates of women with HPV 16/18 between the negative and the abnormal cytology group. RESULTS Of the 1647 women, 1105 (67.1%) had negative cytology and 542 (32.9%) had abnormal cytology. Among women with initial negative cytology, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2+ lesion was detected in 205 (18.6%) women. The rate of CIN 2+ lesion in women with abnormal cytology was 28%. There was a significant difference between negative and abnormal cytology group in terms of CIN 2+ lesion rates (P < .001). Among women with initial negative cytology, invasive cervical cancer was detected in 6 (0.5%) women. The rate of invasive cervical cancer in women with abnormal cytology was 8 (1.5%). There was no significant difference between negative and abnormal cytology group in terms of invasive cervical cancer rates (P = .082). CONCLUSIONS The rate of cervical cancer among HPV 16/18-infected women with negative cytology is similar to women with abnormal cytology. Based on the results of this study, Pap testing could be unnecessary in HPV 16/18-infected women to diagnose invasive cervical cancer who will undergo colposcopy biopsy.","Giray, Burak; Kabaca, Canan; Uzun, Mine Guray; Akis, Serkan; Purut, Yunus Emre; Peker, Esra Keles; Cetiner, Handan",Diagnostic cytopathology,152,1

Extended lumbar drainage (ELD) is regarded as the most accurate test for this condition, however, varying estimates of its accuracy are found in the current literature. Here, we review the literature in order to provide summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive value for this test through meta-analysis of suitably rigorous studies. METHODS Studies involving a population of NPH patients with predominantly idiopathic aetiology (>80%) in which the intention of the study was to shunt patients regardless of the outcome of ELD were included in the review. Various literature databases were searched to identify diagnostic test accuracy studies addressing ELD in the diagnosis of iNPH. Those studies passing screening and eligibility were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool and data extracted for bivariate random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS Four small studies were identified. They showed disparate results concerning diagnostic test accuracy. The summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity were 94% (CI 41-100%) and 85% (CI 33-100%), respectively. The summary estimates of positive and negative predictive value were both 90% (CIs 65-100% and 48-100%, respectively). CONCLUSION Large, rigorous studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of ELD are lacking, and little robust evidence exists to support the use of ELD in diagnostic algorithms for iNPH. Therefore, a large cohort study, or ideally an RCT, is needed to determine best practice in selecting patients for shunt surgery.","Nunn, Adam C; Jones, Hayley E; Morosanu, Cezar O; Singleton, William G B; Williams, Michael A; Nagel, Sean J; Luciano, Mark G; Zwimpfer, Thomas J; Holubkov, Richard; Wisoff, Jeffrey H; McKhann, Guy M; Hamilton, Mark G; Edwards, Richard J",British journal of neurosurgery,152,1

A large number of lipids can be readily detected from a single mass spectrum free from molecular fragmentation that may complicate spectral interpretation. This has been the driving force for MS to play a predominant role in lipidomics. However, elucidation of the detailed lipid structures, especially the location of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), remains challenging for MS-based lipid analysis workflows. Here we describe the coupling of photochemical derivatization of C=C via Paternò-Büchi (PB) reaction with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to identify C=C locations in unsaturated lipids and quantify lipid C=C location isomers. The PB reaction can be conducted online in ~30 s, which transforms a C=C into the oxetane ring structure. Subjecting PB products of lipids to MS/MS leads to the formation of abundant C=C-specific fragment ions upon low energy collision-induced dissociation.","Hu, Qingyuan; Xia, Yu; Ma, Xiaoxiao",Methods in molecular biology,152,7

The expression level of MMP-11 in serum of breast cancer patients was evaluated, and the diagnostic value of color Doppler ultrasound combined with MMP-11 in breast cancer was assessed. The diagnostic results of color Doppler ultrasound and the imaging characteristics of breast cancer patients were recorded. The results of biopsy and ultrasound were compared. The expression level of MMP-11 in serum of breast cancer patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects (P<0.05). The AUC of MMP-11 was 0.735, the sensitivity was 66.67%, and the specificity was 86.11%. Among the 72 patients, there were 41 patients diagnosed with breast cancer by serum MMP-11 examination, 38 patients diagnosed by ultrasound examination, 33 patients diagnosed by combined diagnosis, and 30 patients diagnosed by pathology biopsy. The pathological biopsy was used as the gold standard. The diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound combined with mammography examination was significantly better than the other two single examinations (P<0.050). In conclusion, Doppler ultrasound parameters combined with MMP-11 has a high diagnostic accordance rate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. At the same time, different diagnostic methods combined with the clinical manifestations of patients can improve the diagnostic accuracy, which is worthy of providing reference and advice for future clinical practice.","Ren, Hui; Shen, Zhipeng; Shen, Jirui; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Yunhua",Oncology letters,152,20

These outbreaks are happening on top of the COVID-19 pandemic that is causing havoc among these ten countries. Both infectious diseases have caused a tremendous burden for the countries in the region-from infection control to the economic impact. This increasing number of cases happened with the contribution of the disruption in the pathogen-host-vector relationship, caused by the change of human behaviour during the pandemic period, and aggravated by the implementation of lockdowns and social distancing policies. These had several consequences, including limiting the coverage of dengue preventive programs and delaying the medical management of both diseases due to co-infection and misdiagnosis. It is of utmost importance to maintain the awareness of the population of both diseases and to devise strategies on dengue vector control to properly address the infection with digitalization and remote surveillance. Similarly, critical triage algorithms and further research are also needed to address co-infection and misdiagnosis.

Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-8, and IL-6, play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS by stimulating chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. To obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-associated ALI, we compared SARS-CoV infections in two different nonhuman primate species, cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys. Viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract were not significantly different in SARS-CoV-infected macaques and African green monkeys. Inflammatory cytokines that play a major role in mediating and amplifying ALI/ARDS or have neutrophil chemoattractant activity, such as IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2, were, however, induced only in macaques. In contrast, other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including osteopontin and CCL3, were upregulated in the lungs of African green monkeys to a significantly greater extent than in macaques. Because African green monkeys developed more severe ALI than macaques, with hyaline membrane formation, some of these differentially expressed proinflammatory genes may be critically involved in development of the observed pathological changes. Induction of distinct proinflammatory genes after SARS-CoV infection in different nonhuman primate species needs to be taken into account when analyzing outcomes of intervention strategies in these species.","Smits, Saskia L; van den Brand, Judith M A; de Lang, Anna; Leijten, Lonneke M E; van Ijcken, Wilfred F; van Amerongen, Geert; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Andeweg, Arno C; Haagmans, Bart L",Journal of virology,152,1

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 357 mothers and their infants <12 months who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Subjects came from an anonymous worldwide online survey between May 4 and September 30, 2020, who were recruited through social media, support groups, and health care providers. Using multivariable logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, and summary statistics, we assessed the association of skin-to-skin care, feeding, and rooming-in with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, breastfeeding outcomes, and maternal distress. Results: Responses came from 31 countries. Among SARS-CoV-2+ mothers whose infection was ≤3 days of birth, 7.4% of their infants tested positive. We found a nonsignificant decrease in risk of hospitalization among neonates who roomed-in, directly breastfed, or experienced uninterrupted skin-to-skin care (p > 0.2 for each). Infants who did not directly breastfeed, experience skin-to-skin care, or who did not room-in within arms' reach, were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the first 3 months, adjusting for maternal symptoms (p ≤ 0.02 for each). Nearly 60% of mothers who experienced separation reported feeling ""very distressed,"" and 29% who tried to breastfeed were unable. Presence of maternal symptoms predicted infant transmission or symptoms (adjusted odds ratio = 4.50, 95% confidence interval = 1.52-13.26, p = 0.006).

Although measures were taken to restrict hospital visits, traditional paper-based registration is insufficient to screen and monitor the numbers of visitors to a large hospital. METHODS Throughout March 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, a computer system was deployed in the 2800-bed Taipei Veterans General Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan) to register, screen, and monitor inpatient visitors. This system comprised three parts: online registration form, entrance check-in interface, and registration database. The early utilization of this newly deployed system was then analyzed. RESULTS A total of 22,336 visits were recorded between March 11, 2020, and March 31, 2020, with 1064 a day on average. Out of these visits, 18.1% (n = 4049) had made online reservations within 48 hours. On the other hand, of all 4941 online reservations, 18.1% (n = 892) were no-shows. In the last 12 days of the study period, eight prospective visitors were identified as ineligible by the computer system, and so their visits were denied. CONCLUSION Using a computer system, the hospital was able to enforce restrictions on hospital visits. Although the online registration system had not been fully used yet in the early phase of adoption, its superiority from the standpoint of disease control should enable hospital managers to consider abolishing on-site visitor registration.","Hsu, Chia-An; Yuan, Eunice J; Fen, Jun-Jeng; Lee, Chung-Yuan; Ming, Jin-Lain; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Shih-Ann",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,152,1

Although this pathway has been studied for years, its relevance is still not familiar to many working in the fields of clinical antibiotic resistance and stewardship. In some conditions, the SOS response favors DNA repair and preserves the genetic integrity of the organism. On the other hand, the SOS response also includes induction of error-prone DNA polymerases, which can increase the rate of mutation, called the mutator phenotype or ""hypermutation."" As a result, mutations can occur in genes conferring antibiotic resistance, increasing the acquisition of resistance to antibiotics.Almost all of the work on the SOS response has been on bacteria exposed to stressors in vitro. In this study, we sought to quantitate the effects of the SOS-inducing drugs in vivo, in comparison with the same drugs in vitro. We used a rabbit model of intestinal infection with enteropathogenic E. coli, strain E22. SOS -inducing drugs triggered the mutator phenotype response in vivo as well as in vitro. Exposure of E. coli strain E22 to ciprofloxacin or zidovudine, both of which induce the SOS response in vitro, resulted in increased antibiotic resistance to 3 antibiotics: rifampin, minocycline, and fosfomycin. Zinc was able to inhibit SOS-induced emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo, as previously observed in vitro.

We aimed to determine whether hygiene interventions delivered in childcare, school or domestic settings in LMICs effectively prevent or reduce ARIs. METHODS We registered our systematic review with PROSPERO (CRD42017058239) and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Scopus from inception to 17 October 2017 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the impact of hygiene interventions on ARI morbidity in adults and children in community-based settings in LMICs. We stratified data into childcare, school and domestic settings and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess evidence quality. RESULTS We identified 14 cluster RCTs evaluating hand-hygiene interventions in LMICs with considerable heterogeneity in setting, size, intervention delivery and duration. We found reduced ARI-related absenteeism and illness in childcare settings (low- to moderate-quality evidence). In school settings, we found reduced ARI-related absenteeism and laboratory-confirmed influenza (moderate- to high-quality evidence), but no reduction in ARI illness (low-quality evidence). In domestic settings, we found reduced ARI illness and pneumonia amongst children in urban settlements (high-quality evidence) but not in rural settlements (low-quality evidence), and no effect on secondary transmission of influenza in households (moderate-quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS Evidence suggests that hand-hygiene interventions delivered in childcare, school and domestic settings can reduce ARI morbidity, but effectiveness varies according to setting, intervention target and intervention compliance. Further studies are needed to develop, deliver and evaluate targeted and sustainable hygiene interventions in LMICs.","McGuinness, Sarah L; Barker, S Fiona; O'Toole, Joanne; Cheng, Allen C; Forbes, Andrew B; Sinclair, Martha; Leder, Karin",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,152,31

Through cooperation, we can tackle shared problems like climate change or pandemics and cater for shared needs like shelter, mobility, or healthcare. However, cooperation invites free-riding and can easily break down. Maybe because of this reason, societies also enable individuals to solve shared problems individually, like in the case of private healthcare plans or private retirement planning. Such ""self-reliance"" allows individuals to avoid problems related to public goods provision, like free-riding or underprovision, and decreases social interdependence. However, not everyone can equally afford to be self-reliant, and amid shared problems, self-reliance may lead to conflicts within groups on how to solve shared problems. In two preregistered studies, we investigate how the ability of self-reliance influences collective action and cooperation. We show that self-reliance crowds out cooperation and exacerbates inequality, especially when some heavily depend on collective action while others do not. However, we also show that groups are willing to curtail their ability of self-reliance. When given the opportunity, groups overwhelmingly vote in favor of abolishing individual solutions to shared problems, which, in turn, increases cooperation and decreases inequality, particularly between group members that differ in their ability to be self-reliant. The support for such endogenously imposed interdependence, however, reduces when individual solutions become more affordable, resonating with findings of increased individualism in wealthier societies and suggesting a link between wealth inequality and favoring individual independence and freedom over communalism and interdependence.","Gross, Jörg; Böhm, Robert",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,152,19

Fewer than 60% of patients with decompensated cirrhosis survive after two years, with patients often experiencing distressing symptoms impairing quality of life. Early advanced care planning and timely palliative care referral can improve quality of life and the end of life experience. We aimed to determine palliative care referral rates and patterns for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis, and to identify the factors associated with referral. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-centre study undertaken at a metropolitan tertiary referral hospital. Patients admitted between the 1st June 2016 to 31st January 2019 with a Child-Pugh score of B or C, and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score ≥15 were included. We assessed survival and compared those referred and not referred to palliative care, adjusting for lag-time to referral (Kaplan-Meier analysis). RESULTS One-hundred-and-sixteen admissions met eligibility criteria for referral. The median age at admission was 59 years, with 76% male. Only a fifth of eligible patients (25/116) were referred to palliative care. The median survival (from referral) for those referred to palliative care was 20 days, versus 148 days for those not referred. CONCLUSIONS Despite benefits from timely referral, less than one-quarter of palliative care eligible patients were referred. Referral appears reserved for those facing imminent death - surviving just under three weeks post-referral, yet mortality in non-referred patients remained high (148-day median). Low rates and late referral are a missed opportunity to improve the end of life care for patients with end-stage liver disease.","Chen, Hayley; Johnston, Alexander; Palmer, Andrew; Mickenbecker, Matthew; O'Sullivan, Timothy; Clark, Paul",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,152,1

The trachea could not be intubated with a videolaryngoscope, and successful intubation was achieved with a laryngeal mask airway device (LMAD) and a fibreoptic bronchoscope (FOB). CLINICAL FEATURES A 65-yr-old male developed sudden tetraplegia after a fall. Initial attempts at securing his airway were unsuccessful with a videolaryngoscope, but success was achieved with a LMAD and a FOB. Diagnostic imaging revealed no cervical spine fracture but demonstrated severe airway distortion from DISH and a spinal cord contusion accounting for his tetraplegia. Subcutaneous neck emphysema likely secondary to difficult intubation was also identified, but it did not result in additional morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Although often considered to be a benign entity, DISH can predispose patients to catastrophic cervical injury and difficult airway management. Careful review of plain radiographs in the spinal cord injury patient may assist with appropriate selection of airway interventions. The videolaryngoscope is useful for difficult airways, but its effectiveness may be compromised with an anteriorly displaced airway in combination with restricted cervical movement and limited oropharyngeal airspace.","Thompson, Calvin; Moga, Rebecca; Crosby, Edward T",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,152,33

Like for other coronaviruses, its particles are composed of four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleoprotein (N) proteins. The involvement of each of these proteins and their interactions are critical for assembly and production of β-coronavirus particles. Here, we sought to characterize the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the viral assembly process. By combining biochemical and imaging assays in infected vs. transfected cells, we show that E and M regulate intracellular trafficking of S as well as its intracellular processing. Indeed, the imaging data reveal that S is re-localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi compartments upon co-expression of E or M, as observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, which prevents syncytia formation. We show that a C-terminal retrieval motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S is required for its M-mediated retention in the ERGIC, whereas E induces S retention by modulating the cell secretory pathway. We also highlight that E and M induce a specific maturation of N-glycosylation of S, independently of the regulation of its localization, with a profile that is observed both in infected cells and in purified viral particles. Finally, we show that E, M and N are required for optimal production of virus- like-particles. Altogether, these results highlight how E and M proteins may influence the properties of S proteins and promote the assembly of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","Boson, Bertrand; Legros, Vincent; Zhou, Bingjie; Siret, Eglantine; Mathieu, Cyrille; Cosset, François-Loïc; Lavillette, Dimitri; Denolly, Solène",The Journal of biological chemistry,152,1

In this study, we aimed to compare the outcomes of spontaneous and induced breech deliveries and to describe variations in induction rates. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 1054 singleton live fetuses in breech presentation at Trondheim University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. The main outcome was intrapartum cesarean section, and secondary outcomes were postpartum hemorrhage, anal sphincter ruptures, Apgar scores, pH in the umbilical artery and metabolic acidosis. All data were obtained from the hospital birth journal. RESULTS Induction of labor was performed in 127/606 (21.0%) of women with planned vaginal birth. The frequency of intrapartum cesarean section was 48.0% for induced labor vs 45.7% for spontaneous labor (p=0.64). We found no differences in the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage or anal sphincter ruptures between induced and spontaneous births. The median pH in the umbilical artery was significantly lower in neonates with induced labor compared with neonates with spontaneous labor (7.22 vs 7.25; p=0.02). The frequency of pH <7.05 was 7.0% for induced labor vs 2.9% (p= 0.05) for spontaneous labor, but the frequency of pH <7.0 was not significantly different: 2.6% vs 0.8% (p=0.14), respectively. Three neonates with planned vaginal birth had metabolic acidosis: two with spontaneous labors and one with induced labor. Three fetuses with planned vaginal birth died during labor: two with spontaneous onset of labor and one with induced labor. All three were extremely preterm: two were delivered in week 23 and one in week 25. We did not observe any significant trend in induction rates in either parous or in nulliparous women. CONCLUSIONS The induction rates were stable during the study period. We did not observe any significant difference in intrapartum cesarean section rates, in the frequency of pH <7.0 in the umbilical artery, or in the frequency of metabolic acidosis when comparing induced and spontaneous breech deliveries.","Welle-Strand, Johanne Augusta Horn; Tappert, Christian; EggebØ, Torbjørn Moe",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,152,5

Similarly, shared risk factors for both homelessness and/or TBI may exacerbate the risk of repetitive neurotrauma within homeless populations.Research DesignWe leveraged a state-wide trauma registry, the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS), to characterize 609 patients discharged to homeless (58% TBI, 42% orthopedic injury (OI)) in comparison to 609 randomly sampled adult patients discharged to home.Methods and ProceduresWe implemented Chi-square tests to examine preexisting health conditions (PECs), hospital course, and injury mechanisms for both patient groups.Main Outcomes and ResultsHomelessness affects a greater proportion of nonwhite patients, and homeless patients present for care with increased frequencies of psychiatric and substance use PECs, and alcohol-positive TBI. Furthermore, assault impacts a larger proportion of homeless patients, and the window for overnight assault risk resulting in TBI is extended for these patients compared to patients discharged to home.ConclusionGiven the shifting conceptualization of TBI as a chronic condition, identifying homeless patients on admission to trauma centers, rather than retrospectively at discharge, can enhance understanding of the challenges facing the homeless as they age with both a complex neurotrauma history and multimorbidity.","Dell, Kristine C; Staph, Jason; Hillary, Frank G",Brain injury,152,1

We assessed the effects of the influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods and Results We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library through January 2020 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effects of influenza vaccine on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Analyses were stratified by study design into randomized controlled trials and observational studies. A total of 16 studies (n=237 058), including 4 randomized controlled trials (n=1667) and 12 observational studies (n=235 391), were identified. Participants' mean age was 69.2±7.01 years, 36.6% were women, 65.1% had hypertension, 31.1% had diabetes mellitus, and 23.4% were smokers. At a median follow-up duration of 19.5 months, influenza vaccine was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60-0.93 [P=0.01]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.84 [P<0.001]), and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.94 [P<0.001]) compared with control.

Data were analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusting for lung function, gender, age, BMI, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or open surgery and presence of incomplete fissure or pleural adhesions. Time was distinguished as possible (optimal) and actual time for chest tube removal, as well as length of hospitalization. RESULTS A total of 105 patients were randomized. We found no significant difference between the electronic group and traditional group in optimal chest tube duration (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.55-1.25; P = 0.367), actual chest tube duration (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.55-1.26; P = 0.397) or length of hospital stay (HR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.59-1.39; P = 0.651). No chest tubes had to be reinserted. Presence of pleural adhesions or an incomplete fissure was a significant predictor of chest tube duration (HR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.15-2.77; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS Electronic drainage systems did not reduce chest tube duration or length of hospitalization significantly compared with traditional water seal drainage when a strict algorithm for chest tube removal was used. This algorithm allowed delegation of chest tube removal to staff nurses, and in some patients chest tubes could be removed safely on the day of surgery.","Lijkendijk, Marike; Licht, Peter B; Neckelmann, Kirsten",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,152,1

Data was collected from 5153 people through a questionnaire created via Google Form on the Internet. The data collection process was carried out on April 22-27, 2020. According to the result of the regression analysis made in line with the data obtained; it was determined that the perceived coronavirus threat explained 4.6% of the total variance on psychological well-being and 2.7% of the total variance on e-health literacy; and finally, e-health literacy explained 18.6% of the total variance on psychological well-being. The study also revealed that the participants' scores regarding the perceived coronavirus threat show statistically significant differences depending on age, gender, marital status, education level, place of residence, income level, having a chronic disease, regular drug use, smoking use, the degree of information about the coronavirus disease and watching TV programs about the current coronavirus news. As a result of this research, it is thought that individuals should minimize their perception of coronavirus threats by increasing their e-health literacy levels, and thus, their psychological well-being levels should be increased.","Özkan, Okan; Özer, Özlem; Özmen, Sümeyye; Budak, Fatih",Social work in public health,152,1

Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) has been reported to be the receptor for PEDV, although robust evidence is lacking. In the present study, we explored whether pAPN functions as a receptor for PEDV. Human HeLa cells expressing pAPN and pAPN-positive porcine CPK cells failed to support PEDV infection, but were susceptible to infection by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which utilizes pAPN as a functional receptor. In contrast to TGEV, PEDV did not bind soluble porcine aminopeptidases (pAPs) and infection was not inhibited by the soluble form of pAPs. However, overexpression of pAPN in porcine CPK cells (CPK-pAPN cells) slightly increased the production of PEDV, and the increased replication in CPK-pAPN cells was inhibited by bestatin, an inhibitor of the protease activity of aminopeptidase N. These results suggest that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV, but promotes the infection of PEDV through its protease activity.","Shirato, Kazuya; Maejima, Madoka; Islam, Md Taimur; Miyazaki, Ayako; Kawase, Miyuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro",The Journal of general virology,152,1

METHODS Between January 2006 and April 2010, a total of 96 patients underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Of these, 74 (77.1%) underwent conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (group 1) and 22 (32.9%) underwent SILA (group 2). Age, sex ratio, tumor size, operating time, blood loss, postoperative visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores, and duration of hospitalization were compared between the two groups. RESULTS The mean ages of the patients in groups 1 and 2 were 43.4 ± 12.3 and 43.3 ± 10 years, respectively (P = 0.7). The female:male ratios in groups 1 and 2 were 1.6:1 and 4.5:1, respectively (P < 0.0001). The mean tumor size was significantly larger in group 1 than in group 2 (4.7 ± 1.5 vs. 3.34 ± 1.06 cm, respectively; P = 0.093). No significant difference was found between group 1 and group 2 with respect to the mean operating time (68.4 ± 20.8 vs. 63.9 ± 16.9 min, respectively; P = 0.36) or the level of intraoperative blood loss (38 ± 26.5 vs. 48.4 ± 62.4 ml, respectively; P = 0.26). The postoperative VAS score was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 (2.05 ± 0.57 and 3.28 ± 0.63, respectively; P < 0.0001). The length of hospital stay was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (3.04 ± 1.2 and 2.45 ± 0.96 days, respectively; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION The findings of the present study suggest that SILA is as safe as conventional transabdominal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Furthermore, SILA is associated with less pain and better cosmesis than the conventional laparoscopic procedure.","Tunca, Fatih; Senyurek, Yasemin Giles; Terzioglu, Tarik; Iscan, Yalın; Tezelman, Serdar",Surgical endoscopy,152,1

However, the potential benefits during anaerobic events and the mechanism(s) underlying these benefits remain unclear. Fifteen recreational cyclists were assessed to evaluate the effects of IPC of the upper thighs on anaerobic performance, skeletal muscle activation, and metabolic responses during a 60-s sprint performance. After an incremental test and a familiarization visit, subjects were randomly submitted in visits 3 and 4 to a performance protocol preceded by intermittent bilateral cuff inflation (4 × (5 min of blood flow restriction + 5 min reperfusion)) at either 220 mm Hg (IPC) or 20 mm Hg (control). To increase data reliability, each intervention was replicated, which was also in a random manner. In addition to the mean power output, the pulmonary oxygen uptake, blood lactate kinetics, and quadriceps electromyograms (EMGs) were analyzed during performance and throughout 45 min of passive recovery. After IPC, performance was improved by 2.1% compared with control (95% confidence intervals of 0.8% to 3.3%, P = 0.001), followed by increases in (i) the accumulated oxygen deficit, (ii) the amplitude of blood lactate kinetics, (iii) the total amount of oxygen consumed during recovery, and (iv) the overall EMG amplitude (P < 0.05). In addition, the ratio between EMG and power output was higher during the final third of performance after IPC (P < 0.05).

Acutely increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase I in normal rodent hearts has been shown to recapitulate the reduced fat oxidation and elevated atrial natriuretic peptide message of cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS Because of the potential for reduced fat oxidation to affect cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide, and thus, induce adipose lipolysis, we studied peripheral and systemic metabolism in male C57BL/6 mice model of transverse aortic constriction in which left ventricular hypertrophy occurred by 2 weeks without functional decline until 16 weeks (ejection fraction, -45.6%; fractional shortening, -22.6%). We report the first evidence for initially improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in response to 2 weeks transverse aortic constriction versus sham, linked to enhanced insulin signaling in liver and visceral adipose tissue (epididymal white adipose tissue [WAT]), reduced WAT inflammation, elevated adiponectin, mulitilocular subcutaneous adipose tissue (inguinal WAT) with upregulated oxidative/thermogenic gene expression, and downregulated lipolysis and lipogenesis genes in epididymal WAT. By 6 weeks transverse aortic constriction, the metabolic profile reversed with impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, reduced insulin signaling in liver, epididymal WAT and heart, and downregulation of oxidative enzymes in brown adipose tissue and oxidative and lipogenic genes in inguinal WAT. CONCLUSIONS Changes in insulin signaling, circulating natriuretic peptides and adipokines, and varied expression of adipose genes associated with altered insulin response/glucose handling and thermogenesis occurred prior to any functional decline in transverse aortic constriction hearts. The findings demonstrate multiphasic responses in extracardiac metabolism to pathogenic cardiac stress, with early iWAT browning providing potential metabolic benefits.","Liew, Chong Wee; Xu, Shanshan; Wang, Xuerong; McCann, Maximilian; Whang Kong, Hyerim; Carley, Andrew C; Pang, Jingbo; Fantuzzi, Giamila; O'Donnell, J Michael; Lewandowski, E Douglas",Circulation.

Surgeons depend on visual and tactile clues to select which tissues should be removed from a patient. Recently, we and others have hypothesized near-infrared (NIR) imaging can be used during surgery to differentiate tumors from normal tissue. METHODS We enrolled 8 canines and 5 humans undergoing cancer surgery for NIR imaging. The patients were injected with indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA approved non-receptor specific NIR dye that accumulates in hyperpermeable tissues, 16-24 hours prior to surgery. During surgery, NIR imaging was used to discriminate the tumor from non-tumor tissue. RESULTS NIR imaging identified all tumors with a mean signal-to-background ratio of 6.7. Optical images were useful during surgery in discriminating normal tissue from cancer. In 3 canine cases and 1 human case, the tissue surrounding the tumor was inflamed due to obstruction of the vascular supply due to mass effect. In these instances, NIR imaging could not distinguish tumor tissue from tissue that was congested, edematous and did not contain cancer. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that NIR imaging can identify tumors from normal tissues, provides excellent tissue contrast, and it facilitates the resection of tumors. However, in situations where there is significant peritumoral inflammation, NIR imaging with ICG is not helpful. This suggests that non-targeted NIR dyes that accumulate in hyperpermeable tissues will have significant limitations in the future, and receptor-specific NIR dyes may be necessary to overcome this problem.","Holt, David; Okusanya, Olugbenga; Judy, Ryan; Venegas, Ollin; Jiang, Jack; DeJesus, Elizabeth; Eruslanov, Evgeniy; Quatromoni, Jon; Bhojnagarwala, Pratik; Deshpande, Charuhas; Albelda, Steven; Nie, Shuming; Singhal, Sunil",PloS one,152,16

We assessed the inter-/intra-rate reviewer reliability of two scales: the Oral Secretion Scale (OSS), specifically developed for ALS patients, and the Sialorrhea Scoring Scale (SSS), initially developed for Parkinson's disease patients. Sialorrhea was rated in 69 ALS consecutive patients by four evaluators: two neurologists, one nurse and one speech therapist. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated by the light kappa coefficient and intra-rater reliability by the weighted kappa coefficient. We also compared patients' and caregivers' answers. Results demonstrated that the two scales present a high inter-/intra-rater reliability: weighted kappas were 0.85 for both scales and light kappas 0.89 for the OSS and 0.88 for the SSS. Both scales also showed a good intra-profession reliability (OSS kappa = 0.84; SSS kappa = 0.79) and agreement between patients' and caregivers' answers. The SSS showed a higher responsiveness compared to OSS. In conclusion, both Oral Secretion Scale and Sialorrhea Scoring Scale are reliable tools to measure sialorrhea in ALS patients.

Stem-directed, broadly neutralizing antibodies (sBnAbs) targeting the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) are a promising therapeutic strategy, but neutralization escape mutants can develop. We used an integrated approach combining viral passaging, deep sequencing, and protein structural analyses to define escape mutations and mechanisms of neutralization escape in vitro for the F10 sBnAb. IAV was propagated with escalating concentrations of F10 over serial passages in cultured cells to select for escape mutations. Viral sequence analysis revealed three mutations in HA and one in neuraminidase (NA). Introduction of these specific mutations into IAV through reverse genetics confirmed their roles in resistance to F10. Structural analyses revealed that the selected HA mutations (S123G, N460S, and N203V) are away from the F10 epitope but may indirectly impact influenza virus receptor binding, endosomal fusion, or budding. The NA mutation E329K, which was previously identified to be associated with antibody escape, affects the active site of NA, highlighting the importance of the balance between HA and NA function for viral survival. Thus, whole-genome population sequencing enables the identification of viral resistance mutations responding to antibody-induced selective pressure.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus is a public health threat for which currently available vaccines are not always effective. Broadly neutralizing antibodies that bind to the highly conserved stem region of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) can neutralize many influenza virus strains. To understand how influenza virus can become resistant or escape such antibodies, we propagated influenza A virus in vitro with escalating concentrations of antibody and analyzed viral populations by whole-genome sequencing. We identified HA mutations near and distal to the antibody binding epitope that conferred resistance to antibody neutralization. Additionally, we identified a neuraminidase (NA) mutation that allowed the virus to grow in the presence of high concentrations of the antibody. Virus carrying dual mutations in HA and NA also grew under high antibody concentrations. We show that NA mutations mediate the escape of neutralization by antibodies against HA, highlighting the importance of a balance between HA and NA for optimal virus function.","Prachanronarong, Kristina L; Canale, Aneth S; Liu, Ping; Somasundaran, Mohan; Hou, Shurong; Poh, Yu-Ping; Han, Thomas; Zhu, Quan; Renzette, Nicholas; Zeldovich, Konstantin B; Kowalik, Timothy F; Kurt-Yilmaz, Nese; Jensen, Jeffrey D; Bolon, Daniel N A; Marasco, Wayne A; Finberg, Robert W; Schiffer, Celia A; Wang, Jennifer P",Journal of virology,152,27

The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.

These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.","Planas, Delphine; Bruel, Timothée; Grzelak, Ludivine; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Staropoli, Isabelle; Porrot, Françoise; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Rajah, Maaran Michael; Bishop, Elodie; Albert, Mélanie; Donati, Flora; Prot, Matthieu; Behillil, Sylvie; Enouf, Vincent; Maquart, Marianne; Smati-Lafarge, Mounira; Varon, Emmanuelle; Schortgen, Frédérique; Yahyaoui, Layla; Gonzalez, Maria; De Sèze, Jérôme; Péré, Hélène; Veyer, David; Sève, Aymeric; Simon-Lorière, Etienne; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Stefic, Karl; Mouquet, Hugo; Hocqueloux, Laurent; van der Werf, Sylvie; Prazuck, Thierry; Schwartz, Olivier",Nature medicine,152,2

This study aims to investigate the underlying biological mechanism responsible for the neurotoxicity of nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs) and amino-functionalized GQDs (A-GQDs) by use of genome-wide transcription microarray. The findings showed that 174 and 1341 genes were altered significantly in the BV2 cells treated by 25 μg/mL N-GQDs and 100 μg/mL N-GQDs compared with the control, respectively. As for the BV2 cells exposed to 100 μg/mL A-GQDs, 1396 diversely expressed genes were detected. By comparing the 100 μg/mL N-GQDs exposed group with 100 μg/mL A-GQDs exposed group, the expression of 256 genes was extensively altered, including 58 upregulated genes and 198 downregulated genes. From Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, the altered genes were mainly enriched in functions of ion channel activation and cellular processes. Based on the KEGG pathway and signal-net analysis, the toxicity of GQDs in BV2 cells was closely related to calcium signaling pathway, cell cycle and endocytosis. And the pathways that the shared mRNAs involved all served as the crucial roles in the neurotoxicity of GQDs despite the chemical functionalization (N-GQDs or A-GQDs). In addition, the consequences from qRT-PCR, Western blot, intracellular calcium level measurements and comet assay further confirmed that calcium dyshomeostasis, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest were the key factors responsible for the GQDs-induced neurotoxicity through affecting several classical signaling pathways. In conclusion, our research will supply essential data for further studies on mechanisms of GQDs-induced neurotoxicity by use of genome-wide screening.","Liang, Xue; Wu, Tianshu; Tang, Meng",The Science of the total environment,152,1

The mean operation time was 51 min, and the mean blood loss was 4.2 mL. No patients required conversion to thoracotomy, and one patient required conversion to conventional VATS. Additional thoracic ports were placed in five patients, and the needlescopic incision was extended to 15 mm in one patient. The median duration of chest drainage was 1 day. Additional analgesia was not required for 22 patients and was used for less than 1 day for three patients, less than 2 days for seven patients, and less than 3 days for seven patients. The pathologic diagnosis of the nodules was malignant for 28 patients and benign for 8 patients. On postoperative day 7 or at admission, 34 patients were free of postoperative neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS Needlescopic VATS wedge pulmonary resection combined with the SCTD approach is both safe and feasible and offers the specific advantages of minimal invasiveness and good cosmetic outcomes.","Oda, Makoto; Matsumoto, Isao; Takizawa, Masaya; Waseda, Ryuichi; Suzuki, Mitsutaka; Ishiyama, Yasuhiro; Abe, Takatoshi; Ishikawa, Norihiko; Watanabe, Go",Surgical endoscopy,152,1

METHODS In a 3-year period, 40 subjects underwent endoscopic endonasal approach for different sellar and skull base lesions (three tuberculum sellae meningiomas, six craniopharyngiomas, three Rathke's cleft cysts and 28 pituitary macroadenomas), in which an intraoperative CSF leakage was evident. In such subjects, the fibrin glue was used as a first step of the final phase of the procedure-i.e. the reconstruction of the skull base defect-followed by the other materials employed. Furthermore, ten other patients, who had undergone transsphenoidal (four cases), spinal (two cases), posterior fossa (three cases) and transcortical intraventricular tumour removal (one case) neurosurgical procedures and developed CSF leaks or collections, were conservatively treated by single or repeated in situ injections of ""modified"" fibrin glue under local anaesthesia according to different described techniques. In total, 50 patients constitute the clinical material of the present study. TECHNIQUE In the cases where the fibrin glue was used during the reconstruction phase of the procedure (40 cases), the glue was injected inside the tumour cavity to fill the dead space left by the removal of the lesion. In case of post-operative CSF leak or CSF fluid collection (ten cases), after discarding 50-80% of the thrombin solution to obtain prevalence of the product's adhesive properties, fibrin glue was injected directly in the path of the CSF leak or into the collection cavity after aspiration of the collection's content. This was performed with the provided application system or through lumbar or Tuohy needles. Applications were repeated every 48 h until the disappearance of the leak. In all the treated cases, the disappearance of CSF leaks or collections was obtained with a number of applications ranging from one to five. Successful results are stable with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the injection of fibrin glue has proved to be effective in filling or sealing post-operative ""dead spaces"" and treating minor or initial CSF leaks resulting from procedures of transsphenoidal, cranial and spinal surgery, adding another possibility in the management of many of these dreadful complications.","Cappabianca, Paolo; Esposito, Felice; Magro, Francesco; Cavallo, Luigi Maria; Solari, Domenico; Stella, Lucio; de Divitiis, Oreste",Acta neurochirurgica,152,16

Residual blockade is common, but its potential adverse effects are incompletely known. This study was designed to assess the association between NNMBD use with or without neostigmine reversal and postoperative morbidity and mortality. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study of 11,355 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery at 5 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals. Of those, 8984 received NNMBDs, and 7047 received reversal with neostigmine. The primary outcome was a composite of respiratory complications (failure to wean from the ventilator, reintubation, or pneumonia), which was ""yes"" if a patient had any of the 3 component events and ""no"" if they had none. Secondary outcomes were nonrespiratory complications, 30-day and long-term all-cause mortality. We adjusted for differences in patient risk using propensity matched (PM) followed by assessment of the association of interest by logistic regression between the matched pairs as our primary analysis and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) as a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Our primary aim was to assess the adverse outcomes in the patients who had received NNMBDs with and without neostigmine. Administration of an NNMBD without neostigmine reversal compared with NNMBD with neostigmine reversal was associated with increased odds of respiratory complications (PM odds ratio [OR], 1.75 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-2.50]; MLR OR, 1.71 [CI, 1.24-2.37]) and a marginal increase in 30-day mortality (PM OR, 1.83 [CI, 0.99-3.37]; MLR OR, 1.78 [CI, 1.02-3.13]). However, there were no statistically significant associations with nonrespiratory complications or long-term mortality. Patients who were administered an NNMBD followed by neostigmine had no differences in outcomes compared with patients who had general anesthesia without an NNMBD. CONCLUSIONS The use of NNMBDs without neostigmine reversal was associated with increased odds of our composite respiratory outcome compared with patients reversed with neostigmine. Based on these data, we conclude that reversal of NNMBDs should become a standard practice if extubation is planned.","Bronsert, Michael R; Henderson, William G; Monk, Terri G; Richman, Joshua S; Nguyen, Jennifer D; Sum-Ping, John T; Mangione, Michael P; Higley, Binh; Hammermeister, Karl E",Anesthesia and analgesia,152,31

However, whether miR-21 plays a role in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the potential functions and mechanisms of miR-21 in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC. Methods The anticancer effects of curcumin were assessed in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism of miR-21 in curcumin-mediated treatment of HCC was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot, and Dual-Luciferase Reporter assays. Results The present study revealed that curcumin suppressed HCC growth in vivo and inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Meanwhile, the curcumin treatment can downregulate miR-21 expression, upregulate TIMP3 expression, and inhibit the TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathway. miR-21 inhibition enhanced the effect of curcumin on cell proliferation inhibition, apoptosis, and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathway inhibition in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. It demonstrated that TIMP3 was a direct target gene of miR-21. Interestingly, the effect of miR-21 inhibition on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathway in HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells exposed to curcumin was attenuated by TIMP3 silencing. Conclusion Taken together, the present study suggests that miR-21 is involved in the anticancer activities of curcumin through targeting TIMP3, and the mechanism possibly refers to the inhibition of TGF-β1/smad3 signaling pathway.","Li, Jingtao; Wei, Hailiang; Liu, Yonggang; Li, Qian; Guo, Hui; Guo, Yingjun; Chang, Zhanjie",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,152,16

METHODS Twelve individuals with unilateral AKP and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Quadriceps voluntary activation (%VA) was quantified using a triggered interpolated twitch technique. Gamma loop function was assessed through knee extension maximum voluntary isometric contractions before and after 20 minutes of 50-Hz patellar tendon vibration. RESULTS The AKP group exhibited 5.7% lower %VA bilaterally compared with controls (P = 0.039, Cohen d = 0.79). After prolonged vibration, both groups exhibited an average 8.5% reduction in knee extension force in each limb (P < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.85). CONCLUSIONS Significant force reductions after vibration suggest that gamma loop dysfunction was not seen in either control or AKP participants. Bilateral quadriceps inhibition in the AKP group does not appear to be associated with gamma loop dysfunction.","Ingram, Tony G J; Roddick, Jenna M; Byrne, Jeannette M",Muscle & nerve,152,1

Our objective was to determine social and individual perceptions of COVID-19 immunity certificates through a population-based study. A nested survey within the SEROCoV-POP study, a population-based serosurvey of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Geneva, Switzerland, was conducted with a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was proposed to 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants. Measures included percentage of participants agreeing or disagreeing with statements on immunity and vaccination certificates. Stratification by age, gender, education and work status was used to examine socio-demographic variations. Of the 1520 SEROCoV-POP participants, 1425 completed the questionnaire (response rate 93%; mean age ± standard deviation 52 ± 15.1 years; 51.9% women). About 80% of participants agreed that knowing one’s serology status would lead to a change in one’s behaviour. In the event that the presence of antibodies correlated with immunity, 60% of participants reported that certificates should be offered to the general population. The results showed variations in perceptions of certificates depending on the context (73% agreed on certificates’ utility for travel, 72% for entering a country, and 32% for the right to work). Provided an effective vaccine was available, 55% of participants agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and 49% agreed that a vaccination certificate should be mandatory. About 68% reported a potential risk of discrimination and 28% a risk of deliberate infection. Differences were seen with age, gender and education level. This study shows that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland can envisage scenarios where COVID-19 immunity, and eventually vaccination, certificates would be useful. Seroprevalence estimates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain low to date, and the interpretability of serological testing and immunity remains undefined. However, the information from this study is important, especially the differences based on context and the socio-demographic variations, and should be taken into account if COVID-19-related certificates are to be implemented.","Nehme, Mayssam; Stringhini, Silvia; Guessous, Idris; SEROCoV-Pop Study Team,",Swiss medical weekly,152,11

The need to study readmission patterns is even bigger during a pandemic because the burden is further stretching the healthcare system. METHODS We reviewed the initial hospitalization and subsequent readmission for 19 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest statewide hospital network in Rhode Island, US, from March 1st through April 19th , 2020. We also compared the characteristics and clinical outcomes between readmitted and non-readmitted patients. RESULTS Of the 339 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 279 discharged alive. Among them, 19/279 were readmitted (6.8%) after a median of 5 days. There was a significantly higher rate of hypertension, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, cancer, and substance abuse among the readmitted compared to non-readmitted patients. The most common reasons of readmissions happening within 12 days from discharge included respiratory distress and thrombotic episodes, while those happening at a later time included psychiatric illness exacerbations and falls. The length of stay during readmission was longer than during index admission and more demanding on healthcare resources. CONCLUSION Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, those readmitted had a higher burden of comorbidities than the non-readmitted. Within the first 12 days from discharge, readmission reasons were more likely to be associated with COVID-19, while those happening later were related to other reasons. Readmissions characterization may help in defining optimal timing for patient discharge and ensuring safe care transition.","Atalla, Eleftheria; Kalligeros, Markos; Giampaolo, Giorgina; Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",International journal of clinical practice,152,1

The questionnaire comprised three main components: (1) demographic information, previous working experience, actual working schedule; (2) individual chronotype, either calculated by Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ); (3) self-perception of risk of medication error. RESULTS Midwives (n = 401) responded ""yes, at least once"" to the question dealing with self-perception of risk of medication error in 48.1% of cases. Cluster analysis showed that perception of risk of medication errors was associated with class of age 31-35 years, shift work schedule, working experience 6-10 years, and Intermediate-type MEQ score. CONCLUSIONS Perception of the risk of medication errors is present in near one out of two midwives in Italy. In particular, younger midwives with lower working experience, engaged in shift work, and belonging to an Intermediate chronotype, seem to be at higher risk of potential medication error. Since early morning hours seem to represent highest risk frame for female healthcare workers, shift work is not always aligned with individual circadian preference. Assessment of chronotype could represent a method to identify healthcare personnel at higher risk of circadian disruption.","Cappadona, Rosaria; Di Simone, Emanuele; De Giorgi, Alfredo; Boari, Benedetta; Di Muzio, Marco; Greco, Pantaleo; Manfredini, Roberto; Rodríguez-Borrego, María Aurora; Fabbian, Fabio; López-Soto, Pablo Jesús",International journal of environmental research and public health,152,26

BACKGROUND The current method of choice for local resection of rectal tumors is transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), a complex and expensive technique. Single access surgery is easy, relatively cheap, and more broadly applied in laparoscopy. Evidence regarding transanal use of single access ports is scarce. METHODS Consecutive patients with a rectal lesion otherwise eligible for TEM were operated using the Single Site Laparoscopic Access System (SSL) and standard laparoscopic instrumentation. Patient, lesion and procedure characteristics, hospitalization length, and peroperative and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS Fifteen patients were planned for single port transanal surgery. In 2 patients (13.3%), intrarectal retractor expansion failed, and conversion to conventional TEM was necessary. The remaining 13 patients were successfully operated. Rectal lesions (mean diameter 36 mm, standard deviation ±25 mm, mean distance from the dentate line 6 cm [±4.5]) included adenoma in 7 patients, T1 adenocarcinoma in 1, T2 adenocarcinoma in 3, carcinoid in 1, and fibrosis only in 1 (after prior polypectomy). All patients were operated in lithotomy position. Resections were en bloc, full thickness, and had complete margins. Resection specimens measured 65 (±35) × 52 (±24) mm. Twelve rectal defects were sutured. One peroperative pneumoscrotum occurred. Mean operating time was 57 (±39) minutes. One patient presented with postoperative hemorrhage, treated conservatively (postoperative morbidity rate 7.7%). Mean hospitalization lasted 2.5 days (±2.7). CONCLUSIONS Transanal single port surgery via the SSL is feasible and safe and may become a promising alternative to TEM.","Barendse, Renée M; Doornebosch, Pascal G; Bemelman, Willem A; Fockens, Paul; Dekker, Evelien; de Graaf, Eelco J R",Annals of surgery,152,1

Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the type or temperature of coffee consumed will have a different impact on the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acute coffee consumption on the following: 1. self-reported GI symptoms and salivary gastrin, 2. stress indices [salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA)] and psychometric measures, and 3. blood pressure (BP), in healthy, daily coffee consuming individuals in non-stressful conditions. METHODS This was a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial, in which 40 healthy individuals (20 men, 20 women), 20-55 years of age, randomly consumed four 200 ml coffee beverages containing 160 mg caffeine (hot and cold instant coffee, cold espresso, hot filtered coffee), 1 week apart. Salivary samples and psychometric questionnaires were collected at baseline and post-coffee consumption at 15,30, and 60 min for salivary gastrin and sAA measurements and at 60,120, and 180 min for cortisol measurements. BP was measured at beginning and end of each intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02253628 RESULTS: Coffee consumption significantly increased sAA activity (P = 0.041), with significant differences only between cold instant and filter coffee at 15 and 30 min post-consumption (P < 0.05). Coffee temporarily increased salivary gastrin, without differences between coffee types. Coffee did not affect salivary cortisol or self-reported anxiety levels. Coffee consumption significantly increased BP, within the healthy physiological levels, in a gender specific manner at the end of the experimental periods, without differences between coffee types. CONCLUSION Acute coffee consumption in non-stressful conditions activated sAA and BP but not salivary cortisol, indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Post-coffee sAA increase without a concomitant cortisol increase may also indicate that coffee may have some anti-stress properties.","Papakonstantinou, Emilia; Kechribari, Ioanna; Sotirakoglou, Κyriaki; Tarantilis, Petros; Gourdomichali, Theodora; Michas, George; Kravvariti, Vassiliki; Voumvourakis, Konstantinos; Zampelas, Antonis",Nutrition journal,152,1

We used a large-scale strategy to determine the time-dependent transcriptomic changes in islets of diabetes-prone db/db and diabetes-resistant ob/ob mice at 6 and 16 weeks of age. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to cluster, gene ontology, pathway and gene set enrichment analyses. A distinctive gene expression pattern was observed in 16 week db/db islets in comparison to the other groups with alterations in transcriptional regulators of islet cell identity, upregulation of glucose/lipid metabolism, and various stress response genes, and downregulation of specific amino acid transport and metabolism genes. In contrast, ob/ob islets displayed a coordinated downregulation of metabolic and stress response genes at 6 weeks of age, suggestive of a preemptive reconfiguration in these islets to lower the threshold of metabolic activation in response to increased insulin demand thereby preserving beta-cell function and preventing cellular stress. In addition, amino acid transport and metabolism genes were upregulated in ob/ob islets, suggesting an important role of glutamate metabolism in beta-cell compensation. Gene set enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes identified the enrichment of binding motifs for transcription factors, FOXO4, NFATC1, and MAZ. siRNA-mediated knockdown of these genes in MIN6 cells altered cell death, insulin secretion, and stress gene expression. In conclusion, these data revealed novel gene regulatory networks involved in beta-cell compensation and failure. Preemptive metabolic reconfiguration in diabetes-resistant islets may dampen metabolic activation and cellular stress during obesity.","Chan, Jeng Yie; Bensellam, Mohammed; Lin, Ruby C Y; Liang, Cassandra; Lee, Kailun; Jonas, Jean-Christophe; Laybutt, D Ross",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,152,10

METHOD Five electronic databases were searched including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and EMBASE for articles written in Arabic and English from inception to August 2019. Data were extracted and synthesised narratively. RESULTS Six studies were retrieved from the search: three randomised control studies, two non-randomised studies and one qualitative study. There is limited evidence about culturally-adapted family interventions in the Arab region. However, the cultural adaptation process was comprehensive, and the implementation was reported to be feasible and acceptable. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor, so there is a risk of underestimating the effect size of the interventions due to lack of rigour and the presence of bias. CONCLUSION The present review provides the foundation for future work regarding family interventions in the Arab world, and confirms the feasibility of implementing such interventions with some modifications. Furthermore, the data suggests that any family-oriented intervention for schizophrenia is likely to be better than standard care in improving the outcome for patients and their families.","Al-Sawafi, Aziza; Lovell, Karina; Renwick, Laoise; Husain, Nusrat",BMC psychiatry,152,1

The pandemic of 2009 highlighted the importance of such planning and the value of prior efforts at all levels. Our review of the public health response to this pandemic in Pune, India, considers the challenges of integrating global and national strategies in local programmes and lessons learned for influenza pandemic preparedness. METHODS Global, national and local pandemic preparedness and response plans have been reviewed. In-depth interviews were undertaken with district health policy-makers and administrators who coordinated the pandemic response in Pune. RESULTS In the absence of a comprehensive district-level pandemic preparedness plan, the response had to be improvised. Media reporting of the influenza pandemic and inaccurate information that was reported at times contributed to anxiety in the general public and to widespread fear and panic. Additional challenges included inadequate public health services and reluctance of private healthcare providers to treat people with flu-like symptoms. Policy-makers developed a response strategy that they referred to as the Pune plan, which relied on powers sanctioned by the Epidemic Act of 1897 and resources made available by the union health ministry, state health department and a government diagnostic laboratory in Pune. CONCLUSION The World Health Organization's (WHO's) global strategy for pandemic control focuses on national planning, but state-level and local experience in a large nation like India shows how national planning may be adapted and implemented. The priority of local experience and requirements does not negate the need for higher level planning. It does, however, indicate the importance of local adaptability as an essential feature of the planning process. Experience and the implicit Pune plan that emerged are relevant for pandemic preparedness and other public health emergencies.","Purohit, Vidula; Kudale, Abhay; Sundaram, Neisha; Joseph, Saju; Schaetti, Christian; Weiss, Mitchell G",International journal of health policy and management,152,0

Studies revealed that pulsatile shear stress plays a vital role in microcirculatory function and integrity. The objective of this study was to investigate how pulsatility affects wall shear stress and endothelial glycocalyx components during ECMO. METHODS Using the i-Cor system, sixteen canine ECMO models were randomly allocated into the pulsatile or the non-pulsatile group (eight canines for each). Hemodynamic parameters, peak wall shear stress (PWSS), serum concentration of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate were measured at different time points during ECMO. Pulsatile shear stress experiments were also performed in endothelial cells exposed to different magnitudes of pulsatility (five plates for each condition), with cell viability, the expressions of syndecan-1, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) markers analyzed. RESULTS The pulsatile flow generated more surplus hemodynamic energy and preserved higher PWSS during ECMO. Serum concentrations of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate were both negatively correlated with PWSS, and significantly lower levels were observed in the pulsatile group. Besides, non-pulsatility triggered EndMT and endothelial cells exposed to low pulsatility had the lowest possibility of EndMT. CONCLUSION The maintenance of the PWSS by pulsatility during ECMO possesses beneficial effects on glycocalyx integrity. Moreover, pulsatility prevents EndMT in endothelial cells, and low pulsatility exhibits the best protective effects. The augmentation of pulsatility may be a plausible future direction to improve the clinical outcome in ECMO.","Zhang, Yu; Zeng, Jianfeng; He, Xiaoqian; Cao, Weidong; Peng, Xiaopeng; Li, Guanhua",Microcirculation,152,5

These technicalities determine the ability of materials, components and products (MCPs) to be properly recovered and redistributed for reuse, recycling or recovery, given their remaining functionality, described here as the remaining properties and characteristics of MCPs. The different properties of MCPs make them useful for various functions and purposes. A transition, therefore, towards a CE would require the utmost exploitation of the remaining functionality of MCPs; ideally, enabling recirculation of them back in the economy. At present, this is difficult to succeed. This short communication article explains how the remaining functionality of MCPs, defined here as quality, is perceived at different stages of the supply chain, focusing specifically on plastic packaging, and how this affects their potential recycling. It then outlines the opportunities and constraints posed by some of the interventions that are currently introduced into the plastic packaging system, aimed at improving plastic materials circularity. Finally, the article underpins the need for research that integrates systemic thinking, with technological innovations and policy reforms at all stages of the supply chain, to promote sustainable practices become established.","Hahladakis, John N; Iacovidou, Eleni",The Science of the total environment,152,9

Furthermore, how this overuse injury impacts other components of the glenohumeral joint, including nearby articular cartilage, is also unclear. Therefore, this study sought to better understand the time course of tendon protease activity in a rat model of supraspinatus overuse, as well as determine effects of 10 weeks of overuse on humeral head articular cartilage. For these studies, multiplex gelatin zymography was used to characterize protease activity profiles in tendon and cartilage, while histological scoring/mechanical testing and micro-computed tomography (μCT) imaging were used to quantify structural damage in the supraspinatus tendon insertion and humeral articular cartilage, respectively. Histological scoring of supraspinatus tendon insertions revealed tendinopathic cellular and collagen fiber changes after 10 weeks of overuse when compared to controls, while mechanical testing revealed no significant differences between tensile moduli (overuse: 24.5 ± 11.5 MPa; control: 16.3 ± 8.7 MPa). EPIC-μCT imaging on humeral articular cartilage demonstrated significant cartilage thinning (overuse: 119.6 ± 6.34 μm; control: 195.4 ± 13.4μm), decreased proteoglycan content (overuse: 2.1 ± 0.18 cm-1 ; control: 1.65 ± 0.14 cm-1 ), and increased subchondral bone thickness (overuse: 216.2 ± 10.9 μm; control: 192 ± 17.8μm) in the overuse animals. Zymography results showed no significant upregulation of cathepsins or matrix metalloproteinases in tendon or cartilage at 2 or 10 weeks of overuse compared to controls. These results have further elucidated timing of protease activity over 10 weeks and suggest that damage occurs to other tissues in addition to the supraspinatus tendon in this overuse injury model. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10%. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8-9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.","Currie, Janet; Schwandt, Hannes",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,152,24

The diagnosis and evaluation of familial outbreaks requires a collective consideration of epidemiological history, molecular detection methods, chest computed tomography (CT), and clinical symptoms. Methods A group of family patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in Guizhou, China, in February 2020, was retrospectively analyzed. As of March 1, all patients in the group have been discharged from hospital. This study tracked all patients in the group. We report the epidemiology, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of these patients. Results We collected a group of 8 clustered cases (3 men and 5 women) from a family with confirmed COVID-19 infection. In the first admission diagnosis, according to the degree of clinical symptoms, the 8 patients were defined as mild type (4/8) or moderate type (4/8). They were also divided according to the CT findings into early period (1/8), progressive period (3/8), and negative on CT scan (4/8); for the first 4 patients, the corresponding CT image scores were 1, 4, 5, and 5 respectively. In this group of COVID-19 patients, half of the patients showed occult clinical manifestations and negative CT performance. We defined these patients as COVID-19-infected patients, or asymptomatic carriers. Conclusions The family cluster analysis indicated that COVID-19-infected patients (asymptomatic carriers) and symptomatic COVID-19 patients are distinct but coexistent. This may indicate that the infectivity and virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has decreased. In order to block the transmission pathway of this virus before it spreads, we need to identify the presence of asymptomatic carriers as early as possible.","Huang, Kexin; Zhang, Jingjing; Wu, Weidong; Huang, Di; He, Cheng; Yang, Yanli; Zeng, Xianchun; Jiang, Zhixia; Li, Bangguo; Liu, Heng",Annals of translational medicine,152,1

However, their findings are not always consistent. In this review, we compared the risk of adverse birth outcomes due to PM exposures among subpopulations and investigated whether any particular population is more vulnerable. METHODS We selected U.S. studies examining associations between PM exposure during pregnancy and birth outcomes that included results for effect modification by race/ethnicity and/or maternal education. We summarized the findings for various sizes of PM and birth outcomes. Meta-analysis was conducted to quantify vulnerable race/ethnicity for the association between fine PM (PM2.5) and birthweight. RESULTS In total, 19 studies were assessed, and PM-related risks of adverse birth outcomes, particularly those related to fetal growth, likely differ across subpopulations. A meta-analysis from five studies showed that a 10 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 during the full-gestation reduced birthweight by 21.9 g (95% confidence interval 11.7, 32.0), 15.7 g (10.1, 21.4), 9.3 g (2.7, 15.8), and 5.8 g (- 9.0, 20.7) for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian mothers, respectively. CONCLUSION Our review indicated that Black mothers and mothers with low educational attainment are more vulnerable subpopulations. More investigation is needed for effect modification by other maternal factors, such as household income. Characterizing and quantifying vulnerable subpopulations are essential for addressing environmental justice since it can help regulatory agencies allocate resources and design policy interventions.","Thayamballi, Neil; Habiba, Sara; Laribi, Ouahiba; Ebisu, Keita",Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,152,16

A cell-based antiviral screen against HRV was performed with a subset of our proprietary compound collection, and an aminothiazole series with pan-HRV species and enteroviral activity was identified. The series was found to act at the level of replication in the HRV infectious cycle. In vitro selection and sequencing of aminothiazole series-resistant HRV variants revealed a single-nucleotide mutation leading to the amino acid change I42V in the essential HRV 3A protein. This same mutation has been previously implicated in resistance to enviroxime, a former clinical-stage antipicornavirus agent. Enviroxime-like compounds have recently been shown to target the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KIIIβ). A good correlation between PI4KIIIβ activity and HRV antiviral potency was found when analyzing the data over 80 compounds of the aminothiazole series, covering a 750-fold potency range. The mechanism of action through PI4KIIIβ inhibition was further demonstrated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of PI4KB, which reduced HRV replication and also increased the potency of the PI4KIIIβ inhibitors. Inhibitors from two different structural classes with promising pharmacokinetic profiles and with very good selectivity for PI4KIIIβ were used to dissociate compound-related toxicity from target-related toxicity. Mortality was seen in all dosing groups of mice treated with either compound, therefore suggesting that short-term inhibition of PI4KIIIβ is deleterious.","Spickler, Catherine; Lippens, Julie; Laberge, Marie-Kristine; Desmeules, Sophie; Bellavance, Édith; Garneau, Michel; Guo, Tim; Hucke, Oliver; Leyssen, Pieter; Neyts, Johan; Vaillancourt, Fréderic H; Décor, Anne; O'Meara, Jeff; Franti, Michael; Gauthier, Annick",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,152,27

While care is often thought of in terms of proximity, literature on 'landscapes of care' highlights the potential for 'care at a distance'. We extend this literature to examine practices of social distancing, specifically the act of maintaining a 'space between' bodies in communal areas - a practice currently brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the CF clinic as a case study, we examine how distancing can be understood as an emplaced practice of care, shaped by - and shaping - architectures and materialities in particular contexts. We explore these issues drawing on data from Pathways, practices and architectures: containing antimicrobial resistance in the cystic fibrosis clinic, a UK AHRC funded study (AH/R002037/1) examining practices in three cystic fibrosis clinics using visual and ethnographic methods. Clinical staff practices of maintaining distancing were often regarded by patients as 'care-ful', part of personalised 'care in place', embroiling a wider care assemblage including ancillary staff, materialities and architectures. Patients also actively participate in distancing as an 'ethic of care', using strategies of 'holding back' and 'looking out' in confined spaces. Yet our findings also highlight tensions between care, proximity and distance in circulation spaces and communal areas, including transient spaces where the assemblage of care breaks down.

This study aimed to quantitatively synthesise available evidence on the association between QoL and mortality in the general population. METHODS An electronic search was conducted using three bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Inclusion criteria were studies that assessed QoL using standardized tools and examined mortality risk in a non-patient population. Qualitative data synthesis and meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed. RESULTS Of 4184 articles identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion, involving approximately 1,200,000 participants. Studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of QoL measures, population characteristics and data analysis. In total, 43 studies (91.5%) reported that better QoL was associated with lower mortality risk. The results of four meta-analyses indicated that higher health-related QoL (HRQoL) is associated with lower mortality risk, which was consistent for overall HRQoL (HR 0.633, 95% CI: 0.514 to 0.780), physical function (HR 0.987, 95% CI: 0.982 to 0.992), physical component score (OR 0.950, 95% CI: 0.935 to 0.965), and mental component score (OR 0.980, 95% CI: 0.969 to 0.992). CONCLUSION These findings provide evidence that better QoL/HRQoL was associated with lower mortality risk.

This disease has previously been described as endemic in areas such as northern Australia and Southeast Asia, but, more recently, a better understanding of the epidemiology of melioidosis indicated that the disease is distributed worldwide, including regions of the Americas and Africa. A 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) typing system has been developed for Bpm and has revealed that ITS types C, E, and hybrid CE are mainly associated with Australia and Southeast Asia while type G strains are more associated with cases of melioidosis in the Western Hemisphere. The purpose of the current study was to determine the in vitro and in vivo virulence profiles of the understudied Bpm type G strains Ca2009, Ca2013a, Mx2013, and 724644 and compared such phenotypes to the commonly studied Bpm type C strain K96243. We evaluated virulence by measuring invasion/uptake and survival of these Bpm strains in murine respiratory epithelial LA-4 cells and alveolar macrophage MH-S cells using different multiplicity of infections (MOIs of 1 and 10).

Endovascular techniques have become the standard option for treating IAs in adults. More recently, flow diverters, such as the Pipeline embolization device (PED), are being widely adopted for unruptured IAs, with proven safety and efficacy in adults; however, their use in the pediatric population is not well defined. Here we report a pediatric patient with a ruptured posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysm successfully treated with a PED, and provide a review of the literature on the current status of PED use in this subset of patients. CASE DESCRIPTION A previously healthy 4-year old boy presented to the emergency department with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) suggested a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the right PCA. After discussing treatment options with the child's parents, off-label use of the PED device was chosen. A single PED device was successfully deployed within 24 hours of onset. At a 6-month follow-up, the patient was fully recovered, with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0, and MRA showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm and patency of the parent vessel. CONCLUSIONS Even though the PED has not received Food and Drug Administration approval to treat IAs in children, the literature reports favorable outcomes with this application. Thus, the PED may be a feasible option for treating challenging cases occurring more frequently in the pediatric population. Further studies in pediatric populations are needed to determine whether this technology is a viable and durable option for treating aneurysms in children.","Cunegatto-Braga, Murillo; Hogan, Brian; Aguilar-Salinas, Pedro; Beier, Alexandra D; Hanel, Ricardo A",World neurosurgery,152,24

This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. METHODS An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. RESULTS Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.","Page, Andrew; Diallo, Saikou Y; Wildman, Wesley J; Hodulik, George; Weisel, Eric W; Gondal, Neha; Voas, David",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,152,1

This qualitative study identified implementation strategies used to integrate IPV screening programs within Veterans Health Administration (VHA) women's health primary care. METHODS Thirty-two administrators and clinician key informants from 11 VHA facilities participated in semistructured interviews. Implementation strategies were identified using established definitions from implementation science literature, through multistep content analysis, involving site comparisons by implementation status. RESULTS We identified 8 implementation strategies. Three were present across all sites: (1) conduct ongoing IPV trainings, (2) conduct educational meetings and outreach visits, and (3) develop and distribute educational materials. Five strategies were unique to early adopting sites: (4) identify and prepare champions, (5) change record systems to remind clinicians, (6) create a learning collaborative through advisory boards or workgroups, (7) audit and provide feedback with relay of clinical data to providers, and (8) access new funding. DISCUSSION Strategies align with and extend literature addressing barriers to screening. Evidence shows that effective IPV screening implementation in primary care requires a bundle of well-defined, carefully selected strategies. CONCLUSIONS Implementation strategies used collectively can enable integration of IPV screening programs in primary care.","Adjognon, Omonyêlé L; Brady, Julianne E; Gerber, Megan R; Dichter, Melissa E; Grillo, Alessandra R; Hamilton, Alison B; Stirman, Shannon Wiltsey; Iverson, Katherine M",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,152,1

A standardized sampling protocol included routine microbiologic investigations as well as polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Lungs with histologic lesions were categorized into 1 of 5 morphologic patterns of pneumonia. Fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia (49%) and interstitial pneumonia (48%) were the morphologic patterns recorded most frequently. The various morphologic patterns of pulmonary lesions suggest the involvement of variable combinations of initiating and compounding infectious agents that hindered any simple classification of the etiopathogenesis of the pneumonias. Dual infections were detected in 58% of lungs, with Mannheimia haemolytica and Histophilus somni most frequently recorded in concert. M. haemolytica (43%) was the most frequently detected respiratory pathogen; H. somni was also shown to be frequently implicated in pneumonia in this age group of cattle. Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) and Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (16% each) were the viral agents detected most frequently. Potential respiratory pathogens (particularly Pasteurella multocida, BPIV-3, and H. somni) were frequently detected (64%) in lungs that had neither gross nor histologic pulmonary lesions, raising questions regarding their role in the pathogenesis of BRD. The breadth of respiratory pathogens detected in bovine lungs by various detection methods highlights the diagnostic value of parallel analyses in respiratory disease postmortem investigation.","Murray, Gerard M; More, Simon J; Sammin, Dónal; Casey, Mìcheàl J; McElroy, Máire C; O'Neill, Rónan G; Byrne, William J; Earley, Bernadette; Clegg, Tracy A; Ball, Hywel; Bell, Colin J; Cassidy, Joseph P","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",152,1

Findings for managers and researchers from a scoping review.,19.857368,2.722475,2020-08-29,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a life threatening novel corona viral infection to our civilization and spreading rapidly. Terrific efforts are generous by the researchers to search for a drug to control SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Here, a series of arsenical derivatives were optimized and analyzed with in silico study to search the inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the major replication factor of SARS-CoV-2. All the optimized derivatives were blindly docked with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 using iGEMDOCK v2.1. RESULTS Based on the lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp, darinaparsin (-82.52 kcal/mol) revealed most effective among them. Darinaparsin strongly binds with both Nsp9 replicase protein (-8.77 kcal/mol) and Nsp15 endoribonuclease (-8.3 kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed from the AutoDock analysis. During infection, the ssRNA of SARS-CoV2 is translated into large polyproteins forming viral replication complex by specific proteases like 3CL protease and papain protease. This is also another target to control the virus infection where darinaparsin also perform the inhibitory role to proteases of 3CL protease (-7.69 kcal/mol) and papain protease (-8.43 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION In host cell, the furin protease serves as a gateway to the viral entry and darinaparsin docked with furin protease which revealed a strong binding affinity. Thus, screening of potential arsenic drugs would help in providing the fast invitro to in-vivo analysis towards development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Chowdhury, Trinath; Roymahapatra, Gourisankar; Mandal, Santi M",Infectious disorders drug targets,152,1

Using well-established, traditional endovascular techniques, this is generally achievable with a high level of safety and efficacy. These techniques involve either constructive treatment of the aneurysm (coils with or without an intravascular stent) or deconstruction (coil occlusion) of the aneurysm and the parent artery. While established as safe and efficacious, the constructive treatment of large and giant aneurysms with coils has typically been associated with relatively lower rates of complete occlusion and higher rates of recurrence. Parent artery deconstruction, though immediately efficacious in achieving complete and durable occlusion, does require occlusion of a major intracranial blood vessel and is associated with risk of stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Flow diversion represents a new technology that can be used to constructively treat large and giant aneurysms. Once excluded successfully, the vessel reconstruction and aneurysm occlusion appears durable. The ability to definitively reconstruct cerebral blood vessels is an attractive approach to these large and giant complex aneurysms and allows the treatment of some aneurysms which were previously not amenable to other therapies. By comparison, conventional coiling techniques have traditionally been used for endovascular treatment of large aneurysms. Large and giant aneurysms that are amenable to either flow diversion or traditional endovascular treatment will be randomized to either therapy with FDA (or appropriate regulatory body) approved devices. RESULTS The trial is currently enrolling and results of the data are pending the completion of enrollment and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This paper details the trial design of the LARGE trial, a blinded, prospective randomized trial of large anterior circulation aneurysms amenable to either traditional endovascular treatments using coils or reconstruction with flow diverters.","Turk, A S; Martin, R H; Fiorella, D; Mocco, J; Siddiqui, A; Bonafe, A",AJNR.

Whether human pulmonary arterial function is compromised is unknown. The aim of the present study was to compare the structure and function of isolated and cannulated human pulmonary arteries obtained from lung biopsies after the chest was opened (pre-cardiopulmonary bypass) to those obtained at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass (post-cardiopulmonary bypass) from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS Pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass lung biopsies were received from 12 patients undergoing elective surgery. Intralobular small arteries were dissected, cannulated, pressurized, and imaged using confocal microscopy. Functionally, the thromboxane mimetic U46619 produced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction in 100% and 75% of pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass arteries, respectively. The endothelium-dependent agonist bradykinin stimulated vasodilation in 45% and 33% of arteries pre- and post-cardiopulmonary bypass, respectively. Structurally, in most arteries smooth muscle cells aligned circumferentially; live cell viability revealed that although 100% of smooth muscle and 90% of endothelial cells from pre-cardiopulmonary bypass biopsies had intact membranes and were considered viable, only 60% and 58%, respectively, were viable from post-cardiopulmonary bypass biopsies. CONCLUSIONS We successfully investigated isolated pulmonary artery structure and function in fresh lung biopsies from patients undergoing heart surgery. Pulmonary artery contractile tone and endothelium-dependent dilation were significantly reduced in post-cardiopulmonary bypass biopsies. The decreased functional responses were associated with reduced cell viability. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN34428459.

Curative embolization plays a limited role in AVM treatment but several studies have shown that it is possible, especially with later-generation liquid embolic agents. Given the complexity of AVM anatomy and the recent controversies over the role of any intervention in AVM management, it is critical that the cerebrovascular community better define the indications of each treatment modality to provide quality AVM management. In this review, the authors evaluate the role of curative AVM embolization. Important considerations in the feasibility of curative AVM embolization include whether it can be performed reliably and safely, and whether it is a durable cure. Studies over the past 20 years have begun to define the anatomical factors that are amenable to complete endovascular occlusion, including size, feeding artery anatomy, AVM morphology, and endovascular accessibility. More recent studies have shown that highly selected patients with AVMs can be treated with curative intent, leading to occlusion rates as high as 100% of such prospectively identified lesions with minimal morbidity. Advances in endovascular technology and techniques that support the efficacy and safety of curative embolization are discussed, as is the importance of superselective diagnostic angiography. Finally, the durability of curative embolization is analyzed. Overall, while still unproven, endovascular embolization has the potential to be a safe, effective, and durable curative treatment for select AVMs, broadening the armamentarium with which one can treat this disease.","Potts, Matthew B; Zumofen, Daniel W; Raz, Eytan; Nelson, Peter K; Riina, Howard A",Neurosurgical focus,152,1

In the current study, we investigated the effects of vaccination with a highly stable and homogeneous Massachusetts (Mass)-type vaccine on days 1 or 7 of age on Harderian gland (HG) responses. Confirming previous studies, both IBV serum antibodies and lachrymal IgA levels were greater upon vaccination on day 7 compared with vaccination on day 1 of age.

Although the ameliorating effect of silicon (Si) on plant resistance against fungal pathogens has been proven, the mechanism of its action needs to be better understood on a cellular level. The present study explores the effect of Si application in sorghum roots infected with fungus Alternaria alternata under controlled in vitro conditions. Detailed anatomical and cytological observations by both fluorescent and electron microscopy revealed that Si supplementation results in the inhibition of fungal hyphae growth into the protoplast of root cells. An approach of environmental scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy enabling spatial detection of Si even at low concentrations showed that there is no continual solid layer of silica in the root cell walls of the rhizodermis, mesodermis and exodermis physically blocking the fungal growth into the protoplasts. Additionally, biochemical evidence suggests that Si speeds up the onset of activities of phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidases and polyphenol oxidases involved in phenolic compounds production and deposition to plant cell walls. In conclusion, Si alleviates the negative impact of A. alternata infection by limiting hyphae penetration through sorghum root cell walls into protoplasts, thus maintaining their structural and functional integrity. This might occur by triggering plant biochemical defense responses rather than by creating compact Si layer deposits.","Bathoova, Monika; Švubová, Renáta; Bokor, Boris; Neděla, Vilém; Tihlaříková, Eva; Martinka, Michal",Planta,152,16

Diagnostic techniques of PTB primarily rely on expectorated sputum samples. However, the diagnostic yields are often hindered due to insufficient volume and quality of the sputum specimens. Moreover, some individuals are unable to provide sputum samples due to scanty sputum production or difficulty in coughing up and require an invasive procedure to obtain a respiratory sample, such as bronchoscopic or gastric aspiration. Thus, challenges in the acquisition of respiratory specimens warrant an alternate specimen. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a stool specimen for the diagnosis of PTB in adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science and Cochrane database from inception to April 2021 using a comprehensive search strategy. Two reviewers will independently perform screening, data extraction and quality assessment. The risk of bias assessment and applicability of results of eligible studies will be performed using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Bivariate random-effects models will be performed to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio along with 95% CI of stool specimen for each reported diagnostic method against any of the reference standard test (ie, mycobacterial culture or smear microscopy or Xpert assay using respiratory specimens). Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by I2 statistics and Q statistic of the χ2 test. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results will be disseminated through publishing in a peer-reviewed medical journal and public presentations in relevant national and international conferences.

Our objective was to systematically search, identify and compare relevant available mobile applications (apps) for smartphones and tablets, which use could potentially affect clinical and public health outcomes. We carried out a systematic review of the literature in January 2020, including major medical databases, and app stores. We used the validated Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) to assess the quality of apps, (1 worst score, 3 acceptable score, and 5 best score). We planned to evaluate the accuracy of the mobile apps to detect SCM. We retrieved 335 references through medical databases and 42 from Apple, Google stores and Google Scholar. We finally included two studies of the medical database, 25 apps (eight from the App Store, eight from Google Play, eight from both stores, and one from Google Scholar), and 16 websites. We only found one report on the accuracy of a mobile apps detecting SCMs. Most apps use the imprint, color or shape for pill identification, and only a few offer pill detection through photographs or bar code. The MARS mean score for the apps was 3.17 (acceptable), with a maximum of 4.9 and a minimum of 1.1. The 'functionality' dimension resulted in the highest mean score (3.4), while the 'engagement' and 'information' dimensions showed the lowest one (3.0). In conclusion, we found a remarkable evidence gap about the accuracy of mobile apps in detecting SCMs. However, mobile apps could potentially be useful to screen for SCM by assessing the physical characteristics of pills, although this should still be assessed in properly designed research studies.","Ciapponi, Agustín; Donato, Manuel; Gülmezoglu, A Metin; Alconada, Tomás; Bardach, Ariel",PloS one,152,5

The aim of this study was to prove the feasibility and efficacy of this novel innovative off-pump apico-aortic conduit technique. METHODS The bipartite conduit consists of an 18-mm prosthetic tube graft containing a stentless porcine aortic valve as well as a flexible semi-rigid and curved ventricular connector. Via left anterior lateral thoracotomy, the valved conduit is sutured to the descending aorta. The left ventricular connector is implanted with a gun-like applicator into the apex without cardiopulmonary bypass and with minimal blood loss. RESULTS Between March and December 2011, 7 patients (5 females/2 males) with a mean age of 82 (79-89 years) were operated on. The mean logistic EuroSCORE I was 36.4 ± 23.7 (median 36.7%). The mean ejection fraction was 37 (25-65%) and the mean preoperative transaortic gradient was 38 (22-53 mmHg). Three patients had previous mechanical mitral valve replacement, 1 had a porcelain aorta and 3 had unfavourable distances between the aortic annulus and ostia (ostial encroachment). Implantation was uneventful in all patients, with need for limited cardiopulmonary bypass in only 1 patient. Postoperative mean transaortic gradient was 14 (11-25 mmHg). Approximately 70% of stroke volume was bypassed as measured in postoperative magnetic resonance. One patient died in hospital due to respiratory failure.

How gestational timing of MIA-exposure differentially impacts downstream development remains unclear. Here, we characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories of mice exposed to MIA induced by poly I:C either early (gestational day [GD]9) or late (GD17) in gestation using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging from weaning to adulthood. Early MIA-exposure associated with accelerated brain volume increases in adolescence/early-adulthood that normalized in later adulthood, in regions including the striatum, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Similarly, alterations in anxiety, stereotypic, and sensorimotor gating behaviours observed in adolescence normalized in adulthood. In contrast, MIA-exposure in late gestation had less impact on anatomical and behavioural profiles. Using a multivariate technique to relate imaging and behavioural variables for the time of greatest alteration, i.e. adolescence/early adulthood, we demonstrate that variation in anxiety, social, and sensorimotor gating associates significantly with volume of regions including the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex. Using RNA sequencing to explore the molecular underpinnings of region-specific alterations in early MIA-exposed mice in adolescence, we observed the most transcriptional changes in the dorsal hippocampus, with regulated genes enriched for fibroblast growth factor regulation, autistic behaviours, inflammatory pathways, and microRNA regulation. This indicates that MIA in early gestation perturbs brain development mechanisms implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings demonstrate the inherent strength of an integrated hypothesis- and data-driven approach in linking brain-behavioural alterations to the transcriptome to understand how MIA confers risk for major mental illness.","Guma, Elisa; Bordignon, Pedro; Devenyi, Gabriel A.; Gallino, Daniel; Anastassiadis, Chloe; Cvetkovska, Vedrana; Barry, Amadou; Snook, Emily; Germann, Jurgen; Greenwood, Celia M.T.; Misic, Bratislav; Bagot, Rosemary C.; Chakravarty, M.

The chapter evaluates the effectiveness of these measures and the challenges faced by the government and the people in coping with this crisis, not just in seeking to reduce the number of positive cases but also in the larger context of democratic norms, human rights, and socio-economic justice. Chief among Malaysia’s measures to stem the spread of the pandemic is the Movement Control Order (MCO), which forces people to stay inside except to perform essential services, go out to buy food, or seek medical treatment. The MCO has been successful in some respects, particularly in flattening the curve, but in some areas, such as the rights of marginalized communities, clarity of instructions, and uniformity of enforcement, it has left much to be desired. © the several contributors 2021.","Tayeb, A.; Hong, P.

Setting Nationwide. Patients or Participants Fellows in practice. Interventions Online survey distributed to participants via email. Measurements and Main Results The survey consisted of 5 subsections: (1) demographic data, (2) impact of COVID-19 pandemic on MIGS practice, (3) changes of practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (4) changes in the conduct of surgery and post-operative care. A frequency distribution table was used to summarize responses. A total of 119 out of 144 PSGE Fellows participated in the survey. Average age was 53 years old, majority practicing in the National Capital Region, and practicing for more than fifteen years. Nearly all respondents cancelled surgeries due to the pandemic. As of the time of the survey, only 41% and 68.1% of Fellows had returned to perform laparoscopy and hysteroscopy respectively. Most respondents noted that their hospital of practice provided protocols for elective surgery. Majority (71.4%) reported reduced surgical staff with 30.6% due to resignation. Clinical practice saw the shift from face-to-face consults to the use of telemedicine (74.8%). Face masks and shields, and PPE were the top three precautions taken in the clinics, while symptom assessment, temperature screening, and RT-PCR testing were the most common screening procedures prior to surgery. Respondents also preferred laparotomy over laparoscopy (64.7%). Most of the respondents reported availability of disposable equipment, use of face mask, eye protection, and half or full respirator mask in the operating room. Conclusion The findings show that the COVID-19 pandemic markedly disrupted clinical and surgical practice among Fellows across the country. Adaptation of several precautionary measures and screening procedures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV 2 transmission to patients and healthcare workers were done.","Habana, M.A.E.; Aquino-Aquino, P.

However, the outbreak of COVID-19 at the end of 2019 severely affected global economic development, and 5G development was also affected. Due to the obstruction of COVID-19, countries began to close down, which brings certain development opportunities but it also presents challenges. As for the new technology represented by 5G, the market has a certain time demand for its acceptance. However, the outbreak of the epidemic has shortened the training and demand time for 5G in the market, thus giving rise to the demand and application of 5G in various fields and creating a certain space for 5G development in all walks of life. Based on this, this paper makes an in-depth analysis of the opportunities brought by 5G development in the context of the epidemic, and discusses in detail the promotion effect brought by the rise of 5G on all walks of life in terms of consumer consumption and economic development.","Wang, P.

While some single-joint exoskeletons have assisted incline walking, recent successes in level-ground assistance suggest that greater improvements may be possible by optimizing assistance of the whole leg. To understand how exoskeleton assistance should change with incline, we used human-in-the-loop optimization to find whole-leg exoskeleton assistance torques that minimized metabolic cost on a range of grades. We optimized assistance for three expert, able-bodied participants on 5 degree, 10 degree and 15 degree inclines using a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator. For all assisted conditions, the cost of transport was reduced by at least 50% relative to walking in the device with no assistance, a large improvement to walking that is comparable to the benefits of whole-leg assistance on level-ground. This corresponds to large absolute reductions in metabolic cost, with the most strenuous conditions reduced by 4.9 W/kg, more than twice the entire energy cost of level walking. Optimized extension torque magnitudes and exoskeleton power increased with incline, with hip extension, knee extension and ankle plantarflexion often growing as large as allowed by comfort-based limits. Applied powers on steep inclines were double the powers applied during level-ground walking, indicating that larger exoskeleton power may be optimal in scenarios where biological powers and costs are higher. Future exoskeleton devices can be expected to deliver large improvements in walking performance across a range of inclines, if they have sufficient torque and power capabilities.","Franks, Patrick W.; Bryan, Gwendolyn M.; Reyes, Ricardo; O’Donovan, Meghan P.; Gregorczyk, Karen N.; Collins, Steven H.",bioRxiv,152,1

Coronavirus not only impacts the general population but also a thread for health care providers. Besides, it psychologically impacts health care professionals especially nurses. Objectives. To explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses working in corona isolation units. Methodology. A qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological study design. Overall, data were collected from 15 nurses working in tertiary care hospitals of district Nowshera. The study was carried from 1st April 2020 to 20th May 2020. Permission was granted from the District Health Officer of District Nowshera. Keeping the spread of the coronavirus in view, data was collected through semistructured in-depth telephonic interviews. Electronic consent was also granted from all the concerned participants before data collection. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results. A total of three themes were generated from the data;Stress, social isolation, and Coping and Self-Care Styles. Nurses working in COVID-19 units experience stress due to constant duty change, fatigue, change in duty placement, and work overload. Also, they experience social isolation due to the fear of getting infected and the disease transmission to their family and other population. Coping and self-care styles such as exercise, physical activity, facing the reality and religious beliefs are important for the nurses to maintain their mental health. Conclusions. The outbreak of COVID-19 psychologically impacts the nurses. Besides, the nurses experience stress and social isolation. The nurses also need coping and self-care styles to maintain their mental health. The role of the health department is very important to highlight this issue and provide proper assistance to the nurses. © Danial F., Khattak I.U., 2021.

Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments. Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess. We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the world’s fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (Chelodina longicollis) that people interact with regularly or have as pets. Chelodina longicollis utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation. Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss. Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that ∼40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation. Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes. Urban wetlands (natural and constructed) may provide “biodiversity arks” for endangered species and facilitate community led conservation programs.","Gabites, Harriet; Spencer, Ricky-John",bioRxiv,152,24

Although mortality rates have been high in LTCF residents there is little information regarding the features of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity after infection in this setting or how this may influence immunity to other infections. We studied humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in 152 LTCF staff and 124 residents over a prospective 4-month period shortly after the first wave of infection and related viral serostatus to heterologous immunity to other respiratory viruses and systemic inflammatory markers. LTCF residents developed high levels of antibodies against spike protein and RBD domain which were stable over 4 months of follow up. Nucleocapsid-specific responses were also elevated in elderly donors but showed waning across all populations. Antibodies showed stable and equivalent levels of functional inhibition against spike-ACE2 binding in all age groups with comparable activity against viral variants of concern. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors showed high levels of antibodies to other beta-coronaviruses but serostatus did not impact humoral immunity to influenza or RSV. SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses were equivalent across the life course but virus-specific populations showed elevated levels of activation in older donors. LTCF residents who are survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus show robust and stable immunity which does not impact responses to other seasonal viruses. These findings augur well for relative protection of LTCF residents to re-infection. Furthermore, they underlie the potent influence of previous infection on the immune response to Covid-19 vaccine which may prove to be an important determinant of future vaccine strategy.","Tut, G.; Lancaster, T.; Butler, M.

To date, no case of VITT has been reported in Thais after COVID-19 vaccination. We determined the frequency of anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies in the Thai population receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies in health care workers who received COVID-19 vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or CoronaVac within 7-35 days. A control population who had not been vaccinated was also included. Anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies were detected using enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Functional assay with platelet aggregation was performed for all positive anti-PF4/polyanionic antibody ELISA tests. Results: A total of 646 participants were included in the study. 221 received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 232 received CoronaVac, and 193 participants were in the control group.

We have developed a rapid point-of-care test for IgG, M, or A-class immunoglobulins that recognize the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CovAb). The test employs a lateral-flow strip design with a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain capture antigen to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in oral fluid samples. Oral fluid samples are collected with a swab that captures the gingival crevicular fluid component of oral fluid that represents a plasma transudate and that is the primary source of oral fluid monomeric antibodies. The sensitivity of the CovAb test is 97.29% and the specificity is 98.13%, and the results obtained are similar to those obtained using matched fingerstick whole blood samples and in an EUA-approved commercial serology test.

When the unemployment (UE) rate soars during an economic downturn such as the spread of COVID-19, assuming a linear positive relationship between the two variables, as the prior literature has suggested, forewarns a large spike in DI claim rates. Yet, if the model is misspecified, it can lead to misinformed decisions such as reducing DI awards during an economic downturn when such awards are needed the most. This study aims to improve the accuracy of the DI claims' prediction. Design/methodology/approach This study suggests that the relationship between the UE rate and DI claim rate is nonlinear and examines this hypothesis using a panel dataset of 866 state-year observations from 2002-2018. Findings The results provided compelling evidence in support of the proposed quadratic relationship between the UE rate and DI claim rate and revealed that compared to a quadratic model, the linear model overestimated the DI claim rate by approximately 18 percent or 172,000 claims per year. Practical implications Given that DI awards represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in present value terms, the impact of increase in DI claims on the Social Security Disability Fund during an economic downturn might not be as high as some model might forecast. Originality/value To our knowledge, no other studies have examined a quadratic relationship between the UE rate and the DI claim rate. This study is especially relevant during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its aftermath. In April 2020, the UE rate spiked to nearly 15 percent nationwide, with Nevada and Michigan at 28 percent and 22.7 percent, respectively. The nonlinear model used in this study suggests that, as the UE increases, DI claims increase, albeit at a decreasing rate. On the contrary, a linear relationship between the UE rate and DI claim rates implies that the increase in the DI claim rate would be constant regardless of the UE rate. This misspecification can result in misinformed decisions, such as the reduction of DI awards because of the overestimation of claims during economic downturns. This can lead to lower award rates during economic turmoil when this assistance is most needed.","Smoluk, H.; Mansouri, R. Y.",Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences,152,1

Since the only ionizable groups in the pore are four histidines, we investigated the stability and dynamics of all six possible protonation states of the protein by using molecular dynamics. We show that while all channel protonation states are surprisingly stable, only systems with two or more charged histidines are appreciably conductive. The structural switch, from a uniprotonated to a biprotonated channel, causes an electrostatic repulsion between the charged histidines that pushes the helices apart. This results in the formation of a continuous water file that conducts protons via a H+ wire. pKa calculations place this transition at a pH of 5.6, in remarkable agreement with the experimental value. Since the conversion from uniprotonation to biprotonation occurs during endosome acidification, this explains how M2 is activated in vivo.","Kass, Itamar; Arkin, Isaiah T",Structure,152,30

RECENT FINDINGS Sensitive new diagnostic methods have increased the detection rate of the causative agent up to 94%. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prevalent bacterial pathogen in all ages. Polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which have gained greater importance in recent years. During the period covered by this review, two new agents causing pneumonia were extensively studied. Human metapneumonovirus detected in young children is a leading cause of respiratory disease during the first years of life. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of severe respiratory syndrome, a new respiratory illness that affects adults and children. One multicenter trial concluded that nonsevere pneumonia can be treated with a short course of oral amoxicillin and a multicenter international study showed that children with severe pneumonia have similar outcomes whether treated with oral amoxicillin or parenteral penicillin, but more data are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such regimens. SUMMARY The continued evolution of bacterial resistance highlights the need for appropriate use of antibacterials. Improved diagnostic techniques will aid the treatment of children with community-acquired pneumonia. Aggressive vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and other available vaccines as well as the development of new vaccines will aid the prevention of respiratory disease in children.","Sinaniotis, Constantine A; Sinaniotis, Athanassios C",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,152,12

Committee on School Health.,19.882423,2.8253472,2000,"OBJECTIVE An experience with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using the natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) technique. BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is nowadays the only long term effective obesity treatment method. METHODS Twenty one consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with the use of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) in the Surgical Clinic of Faculty Hospital Ostrava between May 2012 and August 2012. Inclusion criteria were the body mass index (BMI) higher than 35 kg/m2 or higher than 32 kg/m2 accompanied with relevant comorbidities. RESULTS Among 21 patients in this series, there were three men (14.3%) and 18 women (85.7%). Their mean age was 40.9±10.2 years. Their mean preoperative BMI was 40.4±4.6 kg/m2. No patient had previous bariatric surgery, one patient had laparoscopic fundoplication. All operations were completed laparoscopically with no conversions to an open procedure. In two cases, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and the gallbladder was extracted along with the gastric specimen by transgastric approach. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with low morbidity and mortality. Based on our initial experiences it could be an indication for NOSE with transgastric approach. Obese patients would benefit from this approach due to the elimination of wound complications (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 22).","Gunkova, P; Gunka, I; Zonca, P; Dostalik, J; Ihnat, P",Bratislavske lekarske listy,152,0

Combined nasal and pharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline for influenza cultures and picornavirus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. In addition, acute- and convalescent-serum samples were obtained for serological studies of common respiratory pathogens. From a total of 719 subjects enrolled in the clinical trial within 36 h of the onset of symptoms, 475 (66%) had evidence of recent influenza A or B virus infections by means of culture and/or serological testing. Of the 244 remaining patients, 36 (15%) presented a seroconversion for at least one of the common respiratory viruses or atypical pathogens. An RT-PCR assay for the picornavirus 5"" noncoding region (NCR) was positive in a subset of 15 (19%) of 78 patients with flu-like illnesses of undetermined etiology. Sequence analysis of the picornavirus 5"" NCR amplicons revealed that 14 (93%) of them had greater homology to rhinoviruses, whereas 1 (7%) was related to enteroviruses. Interestingly, median total symptom scores and oral temperatures of picornavirus-positive patients (n = 15) and placebo-treated influenza virus-positive patients (n = 161) were similar over a 3-week period. We conclude that, among the influenza virus-negative preselected cases of this study, rhinoviruses were relatively frequent pathogens associated with important respiratory and systemic symptoms.","Boivin, Guy; Osterhaus, Albert D; Gaudreau, Annie; Jackson, Helen C; Groen, Jan; Ward, Penelope",Journal of clinical microbiology,152,12

Effective antivirals are urgently needed for COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an attractive antiviral target because of its essential role in the cleavage of the viral polypeptide. In this study, we performed an in silico structure-based screening of a large chemical library to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. Among 8,820 compounds in the library, our screening identified trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor and an antifungal compound, as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity and replication. The half maximal effective concentration of trichostatin A against SARS-CoV-2 replication was 1.5 to 2.7µM, which was markedly below its 50% effective cytotoxic concentration (75.7µM) and peak serum concentration (132µM).

Reports on the increased interest in community births (at home or in birth centers) are emerging. The purpose of this project was to quantitatively investigate psychological factors related to this birth preference. METHODS: This study included 3896 pregnant women from the COVID-19 Pregnancy Experiences (COPE) Study who were anticipating a vaginal birth. COPE Study participants were recruited online between April 24 and May 15, 2020, and completed a questionnaire that included preference with respect to place of birth and psychological constructs: fear of childbirth, basic beliefs about birth, pandemic-related preparedness stress, and pandemic-related perinatal infection stress. RESULTS: Women who preferred a community birth, on average, had less childbirth fear, had stronger beliefs that birth is a natural process, were less likely to see birth as a medical process, and were less stressed about being unprepared for birth and being infected with COVID-19. In multivariate models, higher stress about perinatal COVID-19 infection was associated with greater likelihood of preferring a community birth. The effect of perinatal infection stress on preference was stronger when preparedness stress was high. DISCUSSION: Women's birth preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with psychological processes related to risk perception. Community births are more appealing to women who view being in a hospital as hazardous because of the pandemic. Policies and prenatal care aimed to increase access to safe in-hospital and out-of-hospital birth services should be encouraged.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci",Birth,152,16

This study aimed to determine an injury criterion and accompanying tolerance values for cervical spine segments in axial compression applied with varying coronal plane eccentricity. Thirty-three human cadaveric functional spinal units were subjected to axial compression at three magnitudes of lateral eccentricity of the applied force. Injury was identified by high-speed video and graded by spine surgeons. Linear regression was used to define neck injury tolerance values based on a criterion incorporating coronal plane loads accounting for specimen sex, age, size and bone density. Larger coronal plane eccentricity at injury was associated with smaller resultant coronal plane force. The level of coronal plane eccentricity at failure appears to distinguish between the types of injuries sustained, with hard tissue structure injuries more common at low levels of eccentricity and soft tissue structure injuries more common at high levels of eccentricity. There was no relationship between axial force and lateral bending moment at injury which has been previously proposed as an injury criterion. These results provide the foundation for designing and evaluating strategies and devices for preventing severe spinal injuries.","Whyte, Tom; Melnyk, Angela D; Van Toen, Carolyn; Yamamoto, Shun; Street, John; Oxland, Thomas R; Cripton, Peter A",Sci Rep,152,16

Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course. In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases. Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels &#8805;140mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay. Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P<0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs. normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P<0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P<0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P<0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.","Marfella, R; Paolisso, P; Sardu, C; Bergamaschi, L; D039,; Angelo, E C; Barbieri, M; Rizzo, M R; Messina, V; Maggi, P; Coppola, N; Pizzi, C; Biffi, M; Viale, P; Galié, N; Paolisso, G",Diabetes Metab,152,22

Further adjustment for therapeutic anticoagulation did not meaningfully attenuate this relationship (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.19). CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicenter cohort study of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019, higher d-dimer levels were independently associated with a greater risk of death.","Short, Samuel A P; Gupta, Shruti; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Srivastava, Anand; Shaefi, Shahzad; Singh, Harkarandeep; Wu, Benjamin; Bagchi, Aranya; Al-Samkari, Hanny; Dy, Rajany; Wilkinson, Katherine; Zakai, Neil A; Leaf, David E",Crit Care Med,152,20

Dysregulated innate immune response in the lung due to viral-entry mediated angiotensin-I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor downregulation causes endothelial injury in the pulmonary vasculature, inflammatory cytokine release, increased thrombin generation and impaired fibrinolysis. The inflammatory disease process, immobilization with prolonged hospital stay, hypoxia due to extensive lung injury and pre-existing comorbidities can contribute to thromboembolic episodes (TE). The observed risk for TE in COVID-19 is high despite anticoagulation, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A high level of clinical suspicion, lower threshold for diagnostic imaging and aggressive early and extended thromboprophylaxis is indicated. The available evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is heterogenous, but rapidly evolving.

Recently, the role of platelet activating factor (PAF) was suggested in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In the present review several micronutrients (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and minerals), phytochemicals and Mediterranean diet compounds with potential anti-COVID activity are presented. We further underline that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of the investigated nutrients and/or holistic dietary schemes, such as the Mediterranean diet, are also mediated through PAF. In conclusion, there is no single food to prevent coronavirus Although the relationship between PAF and COVID-19 is not robust, a healthy diet containing PAF inhibitors may target both inflammation and thrombosis and prevent the deleterious effects of COVID-19.

Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,654 residents was contacted, 2,534 agreed to participate, and 2,215 completed valid questionnaires. The sample covered 30 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions of China, and a broader region. MEASURES: The Uncertainty About COVID-19 Scale was applied to assess perceived public uncertainty. Five dimensions of health beliefs about COVID-19 and 12 health-related response behaviors were measured. ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to identify associations. Mediation was assessed by a bootstrapping technique. RESULTS: Five constructs of health beliefs were found to be significant predictors of multiple response behaviors. Uncertainty about COVID-19 has a direct relationship with general response behaviors (ß=-0.119**) and sanitization practices (ß=-0.068**). Emergency coping behaviors aside, uncertainty also partially mediated associations between perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, and perceived barriers influencing general response behaviors and sanitization practices, respectively. CONCLUSION: Findings provide evidence-based information to government and policymakers for designing effective health communication messages and intervention strategies by targeting the key constructs of the health belief model and reducing perceived uncertainty about COVID-19. They support public health-related response behaviors to prevent COVID-19 spread among the population.","Wu, Dan; Rockett, Ian R H; Yang, Tingzhong; Yang, Xiaozhao Yousef; Wang, Mengmeng; Jiao, Can",Am J Health Promot,152,15

This review summarizes the knowledge on the diagnosis and management of stingers in college and professional collision athletes by providing an overview of their epidemiology and pathophysiology, followed by a discussion on current treatment guidelines and return-to-play recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite modifications to tackling technique, increasing awareness, and various equipment options, American football continues to have a high rate of cervical spine injuries, the majority of which occur in preseason and regular season competition settings. The incidence of stingers has slowly increased among collision athletes, and nearly half of all players report sustaining at least one stinger in their career. Recent studies have shown certain anatomical changes in the cervical spine are related to acute and reoccurring stingers. Most players who experience stingers do not miss practices or games. Despite their prevalence, literature highlighting the impact of stingers on college and professional collision athletes is limited. Advances in imaging modalities and novel radiographic parameters have provided tools for screening athletes and can guide return-to-play decisions. Future research regarding appropriate screening practices for athletes with reoccurring stingers, use of protective equipment, and rehabilitation strategies are needed to identify predisposing factors, mitigate the risk of injury, and restore full functional strength and ability.","Bowles, Daniel R; Canseco, Jose A; Alexander, Tyler D; Schroeder, Gregory D; Hecht, Andrew C; Vaccaro, Alexander R",,152,6

223521,223521,223521,Psychological Typhoon Eye Effect During the COVID-19 Outbreak,19.781681,2.7226396,2020,"BACKGROUND: Anticoagulant prophylaxis is part of the standard management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Despite adequate thromboprophylaxis, one-third of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia developed pulmonary embolism. This high rate of thrombotic complications has led to higher doses of anticoagulants according to clinical complexity (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) patients) and D-dimer levels. On the other side of the coin, haemorrhagic complications are being increasingly reported. CASES PRESENTATION: We herein report four cases of spontaneous psoas haematomas (SPH) among 548 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia between March 2020 and January 2021 (incidence of 7.3 cases per 1000 patients). All patients had pneumonia, with age ranging between 62 and 83 years. All patients received anticoagulant therapy with low weight molecular heparin (100 U.I. anti-Xa/kg 2 times/d) from admission: in two cases, a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made. In another case, a thrombosis of left axillary and basilic veins was found, and only in one case anticoagulant therapy was started because of elevated levels of D-dimer. In all cases, signs of anaemia were detected and patients experienced low back or abdominal pain. The diagnosis of spontaneous psoas haematoma was made by computed tomography (CT) after a median of 12.5 d (9;16) from admission and 19.5 d (14.75; 24.25) from the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms. Half of these patients died from haemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential life-threatening of SPH and the possible subtle clinical presentation, we believe it is crucial to raise clinicians awareness of this complication among COVID-19 patients undergoing anticoagulants.","Zerbato, Verena; Bozzato, Alessandro Marco; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Martingano, Paola; Di Giusto, Anna; Battisti, Sofia; Cova, Maria Assunta; Luzzati, Roberto; Cavallaro, Marco Francesco Maria",Infect Dis (Lond),152,20

METHODS: A comprehensive literature review on COVID-19 was conducted. A two-stage modified Delphi technique involving 18 oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons across Canada was used to determine consensus risk-stratification criteria and PPE recommendations for surgeries performed in the North American context. RESULTS: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We summarize COVID-19 virology and transmission, as well as practice considerations for oculofacial plastic and orbital surgeons. Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be transmitted predominantly by droplet mechanisms, some studies suggest that transmission is possible through aerosols. Among common procedures performed by oculofacial and plastic surgeons, some are likely to be considered aerosol-generating. Risk of transmission increases when manipulating structures known to harbor high viral loads. We present an algorithm for risk-stratification based on the nature of surgery and the anatomical sites involved and offer recommendations for PPE. CONCLUSIONS: Although universal droplet precautions are now recommended in most healthcare settings, some clinical situations require more stringent infection control measures. By highlighting high-risk scenarios specific to oculofacial plastic and orbital surgery, as well as PPE recommendations, we hope to enhance the safety of continued care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daigle, Patrick; Leung, Victoria; Yin, Vivian; Kalin-Hajdu, Evan; Nijhawan, Navdeep",Orbit,152,1

After having performed electrostatic pKa calculations on several X-ray structures, we consider both the native (unbound) configuration of the enzyme and its noncovalent complex with a model peptide, Ace-Ala-Val-Leu-Glnâ¼Ser-Nme, which mimics the polyprotein sequence recognized at the active site. For each configuration, we also study their monomeric and homodimeric forms. The simulations of the unbound systems show that the relative orientation of domain III is not stable in the monomeric form and provide further details about interdomain motions, protomer-protomer interactions, inter-residue contacts, accessibility at the catalytic site, etc. In the presence of the peptide substrate, the monomeric protease exhibits a stable interdomain arrangement, but the relative orientation between the scissile peptide bond and the catalytic dyad is not favorable for catalysis. By means of comparative analysis, we further assess the catalytic impact of the enzyme dimerization, the actual flexibility of the active site region, and other structural effects induced by substrate binding.

The researcher used Q methodology [Q], a mixed method, to determine and describe faculty views about this situation. The participants sorted 36 statements to reveal and describe their subjective viewpoints. In Q, similar sorts are grouped together mathematically into factors, each representing a unique viewpoint. The Q-sorting process is reflective and self-referent. The operation of sorting items allows participants to provide their internal viewpoint. This is different from responding to a Likert-type survey. Additionally, the analyses allow for differentiation of views rather than an aggregate of views. Each unique viewpoint is described by a representative sort, distinguishing statements, and participants' post-sort responses. Three views emerged: Techies who like to teach (the view most positive in relation to teaching online); Overwhelmed as human beings (populated by caregivers); and It's about what cannot be done online (those who are focused on the limitations of technology and abilities for online instruction). Generally, faculty felt frustrated with their ability to best support their students within the online format. Administrators should consider the results of this study to better understand the instructional and mental-health needs of faculty especially in an emergency situation, such as COVID-19. The findings indicate that creating the best learning situations for students is not one-size-fits-all and that there are discipline and pedagogical issues to consider when moving F2F courses online that are not fixed simply with technology.","Ramlo, Susan",Innov High Educ,152,23

DESIGN: Prospective observational study of RPE fit testing according to health and safety, and occupational health requirements. SETTING: A large tertiary referral UK healthcare facility. POPULATION: 1443 healthcare workers undergoing quantitative fit testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative fit test success (pass/fail) and the count of tests each participant required before successful fit. RESULTS: Healthcare workers were fit tested a median (IQR) 2 (1-3) times before successful fit was obtained. Males were tested a median 1 (1-2) times, while females were tested a median 2 (1-2) times before a successful fit was found. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Modelling each fit test as its own independent trial (n=2359) using multivariable logistic regression, male healthcare workers were significantly more likely to find a well-fitting respirator and achieve a successful fit on first attempt in comparison to females, after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR=2.07, 95% CI): 1.66 to 2.60, p<0.001). Staff who described their ethnicity as White were also more likely to achieve a successful fit compared with staff who described their ethnicity as Asian (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.58, p<0.001), Black (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.71, p<0.001), mixed (OR=0.50 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.80, p=0.004) or other (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.99, p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Male and White ethnicity healthcare workers are more likely to achieve RPE fit test success. This has broad operational implications to healthcare services with a large female and Black, Asian and minority ethnic group population. Fit testing is imperative in ensuring RPE effectiveness in protecting healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Carvalho, Clarissa Y M; Schumacher, Jan; Greig, Paul Robert; Wong, Danny J N; El-Boghdadly, Kariem",BMJ Open,152,16

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different intervention strategies on the hospital outbreak within a tertiary hospital. A mathematical model was developed for the COVID-19 transmission within a 2500-bed tertiary hospital of South Korea. The SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model with a compartment of doctor, nurse, patient, and caregiver was constructed. The effects of different intervention strategies such as front door screening, quarantine unit for newly admitted patients, early testing of suspected infected people, and personal protective equipment for both medical staff and visitors were evaluated. The model suggested that the early testing (within eight hours) of infected cases and monitoring the quarantine ward for newly hospitalized patients are effective measures for decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital (81.3% and 70% decrease of number of incident cases, respectively, during 60 days). Front door screening for detecting suspected cases had only 42% effectiveness. Screening for prohibiting the admission of COVID-19 patients was more effective than the measures for patients before emergency room or outpatient clinic. This model suggests that under the assumed conditions, some effective measures have a great influence on the incidence of COVID-19 within a hospital.

Studies have shown that the mechanisms of DNA methylation-mediated plant defense against DNA viruses and RNA viruses are different. However, in rice its function in response to infection of RBSDV, a double-stranded RNA virus, remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput single-base resolution bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) was carried out to analyze the distribution pattern and characteristics of cytosine methylation in RBSDV-infected rice. Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG contexts between the RBSDV-infected and RBSDV-free rice. We identified a large number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) along the genome of RBSDV-infected rice. Additionally, the transcriptome sequencing analysis obtained 1119 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Correlation analysis of DMRs-related genes (DMGs) and DEGs filtered 102 genes with positive correlation and 71 genes with negative correlation between methylation level at promoter regions and gene expression. Key genes associated with maintaining DNA methylation in rice were analyzed by RT-qPCR and indicated that OsDMT702 might be responsible for the global increase of DNA methylation level in rice under RBSDV stress. Our results suggest important roles of rice DNA methylation in response to RBSDV and provide potential target genes for rice antiviral immunity.","Li, Linying; He, Yuqing; Zhang, Xueying; Zhang, Hehong; Sun, Zongtao; Li, Junmin; Hong, Gaojie",,152,16

In this review, we provide an overview of the implications of SARS-CoV-2 for blood safety and sufficiency. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We searched the PubMed database, the preprint sites bioRxiv and medRxiv, the websites of the World Health Organization, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Communicable Diseases Center and monitored ProMed updates. RESULTS: An estimated 15%-46% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. The reported mean incubation period is 3 to 7 days with a range of 1-14 days. The blood phase of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be brief and low level, with RNAaemia detectable in only a small proportion of patients, typically associated with more severe disease and not demonstrated to be infectious virus. An asymptomatic blood phase has not been demonstrated. Given these characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the absence of reported transfusion transmission (TT), the TT risk is currently theoretical. To mitigate any potential TT risk, but more importantly to prevent respiratory transmission in donor centres, blood centres can implement donor deferral policies based on travel, disease status or potential risk of exposure. CONCLUSION: The TT risk of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be low. The biggest risk to blood services in the current COVID-19 pandemic is to maintain the sufficiency of the blood supply while minimizing respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-19 to donors and staff while donating blood.","Kiely, Philip; Hoad, Veronica C; Seed, Clive R; Gosbell, Iain B",Vox sang,152,30

This method is useful because it involves the quantitative analysis of large amounts of literature, using mathematical and statistical method. The results showed that the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and China were the countries with the most published papers in the field. The US plays a key role in the cooperation between international institutions. An assessment conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) created the standard scientific reference for the research on climate change and its consequences. From 2006 to 2016, a large number of co-cited papers laid a solid foundation for research in the field. During this period, the research focused on the impact of climate change on the ecological environment, began to propose different countermeasures, and formed a set of mature research methods. From 2017 to 2019, there was an acceleration in the growth rate of the number of published articles. Strategies to address climate change, including renewable energy and energy transition, were the focus during this phase. Future studies are expected to focus on climate change mitigation strategies and energy policies.

The exponential increase of global aquaculture has raised the number of research studies aimed at demonstrating the sensitivity of aquatic animals in confined environments. The development of a real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry methods were investigated to evaluate the presence, localization, and quantity of biomarkers of oxidative stress in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). In particular, stress tests such as manipulation and temperature changes were conducted through molecular methods to identify the expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in stressed animals compared with a control group. The immunohistochemical technique was also applied to locate and study the trends-levels of nitrotyrosine (NT), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in different tissues from stressed animals and control group. The presence of the rodlet cell (RCs) was evaluated by histology in both a control and stressed group. Our results show that the real-time PCR method developed is specific for the evaluated target gene and that manipulation and temperature increase are strong stressors for animals. Relative quantification data revealed a gene expression increase of HSP70 in the stressed group of animals compared to the control group. The antibodies used for the immunohistochemical staining were efficient, and it was possible to appreciate the increase of immunoprecipitates in European sea bass either manipulated or stressed by temperature increase. The present study can be a starting point to allow the quantification of HSP70 and the identification of other stress biomarkers in D. labrax.","Fiocchi, Eleonora; Civettini, Michele; Carbonara, Pierluigi; Zupa, Walter; Lembo, Giuseppe; Manfrin, Amedeo",,152,23

Therefore, we search for a more global analysis of antihypertensive medication in relation to SAS-CoV-2 severity using prescription data worldwide. The association between the percentage use of different types of antihypertensive medications and mortality rates due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first 3 weeks of the pandemic was analyzed using random effects linear regression models for 30 countries worldwide. Higher percentages of prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (ß, 95% confidence interval [CI]; -0.02 [-0.04 to -0.0012]; p = .042) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (ß, 95% CI; -0.023 [-0.05 to -0.0028]; p = .0304) were associated with a lower first 3-week SARS-CoV-2-related death rate, whereas a higher percentage of prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) (ß, 95% CI; 0.03 [0.0061-0.05]; p = .0103) was associated with a higher first 3-week death rate, even when adjusted for age and metformin use. There was no association between the amount of prescribed beta-blockers (BBs) and diuretics (Diu) and the first 3-week death rate. When analyzing the combination of drugs that is used by at least 50% of antihypertensive users, within the different countries, countries with the lowest first 3-week death rates had at least an angiotensin receptor blocker as one of the most often prescribed antihypertensive medications (ARBs/CCBs: [ß, 95% CI; -0.02 [-0.03 to -0.004]; p = .009], ARBs/BBs: [ß, 95% CI; -0.03 [-0.05 to -0.006]; p = .01]).

METHODS: We reviewed patients admitted from the community to University College Hospital (UCH) with COVID-19 as their primary diagnosis between 1st-31st December 2020. Re-attendance and readmission data were collected for patients who re-presented within 10 days following discharge. Data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: 196 patients were admitted from the community with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged alive in December 2020. Corticosteroids were prescribed in hospital for a median of 5 days (IQR 3-8). 20 patients (10.2%) were readmitted within 10 days. 11/20 received corticosteroids in the first admission of which 10 had received 1-3 days of corticosteroids. Readmission rate in those receiving 1-3 days of corticosteroids was 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Most international guidelines have recommended providing up to 10 days of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 but stopping on discharge. Our findings show shorter courses of corticosteroids during admission are associated with an increased risk of being readmitted and support continuing the course of corticosteroids after hospital discharge monitored in the virtual ward setting.","Chaudhry, Zain; Shawe-Taylor, Marianne; Rampling, Tommy; Cutfield, Tim; Bidwell, Gabriella; Chan, Xin Hui S; Last, Anna; Williams, Bryan; Logan, Sarah; Marks, Michael; Esmail, Hanif",J Infect,152,23

Yet studies of resilience suggest most individuals will successfully negotiate this challenge and some may even experience growth and positive change. Some evidence suggests that the capacity to enact positive change in the face of adversity may be shaped by early life experiences. METHODS: In a subset of 374 participants (57% female, mean age = 29 years) in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD), a longitudinal, birth cohort, prospective models were tested to determine whether early life adversities in family and neighborhood contexts predict positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood family and neighborhood contexts were assessed using a combination of self-report questionnaires and US Census data. Adulthood positive change events (e.g., becoming more appreciative of things usually taken for granted) were assessed using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). RESULTS: In regression analyses, neighborhood disadvantage in childhood, measured both by objective and subjective assessments, predicted a higher number of positive change events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (ß = .18, p = .004 and ß = .15, p = .006, respectively). Examination of the positive change event subscales showed neighborhood disadvantage in childhood predicted increases in events related to 'perspective taking and charitable giving' (ß = .20, p = .022 and ß = .17, p = .002, respectively) and improved 'social relationships' (ß = .18, p = .004 and ß = .13, p = .020, respectively), but not to positive 'health behaviors' (ps > .05). All associations were independent of sociodemographic factors and childhood family dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage in childhood may shape prosocial responses to stress in adulthood, potentially through early life adaptions to stress that are protective when facing adversity. There are several notable implications of the study findings. Although adversity in early life has clear negative impacts, it is possible that adversity experiences may also provide opportunities to develop adaptive strategies that foster resilience and growth when facing stress. Intervention efforts should consider leveraging such stress-adapted strengths to reduce the many negative impacts of early life adversity.","Bleil, Maria E; Appelhans, Bradley M; Thomas, Alexis S; Gregorich, Steven E; Marquez, Neal; Roisman, Glenn I; Booth-LaForce, Cathryn; Crowder, Kyle",BMC Psychol,152,1

The aim of this study is to understand which investigations are useful in a screening protocol aimed at protecting health but also avoiding inappropriate examinations. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of a professional soccer team that is based on an extensive screening protocol for resuming training during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included personal history, antigen swabs, blood tests, spirometry, resting/stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring, echocardiogram, Holter and chest CT. We also compared the findings with prior data from the same subjects before infection and with data from SARS-CoV-2-negative players. RESULTS: None of the players had positive swab and/or anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM class antibodies. Out of 30 players, 18 (60%) had IgG class antibodies. None had suffered severe SARS-CoV-2-related disease, 12 (66.7%) had complained of mild COVID-19-related symptoms and 6 (33.3%) were asymptomatic. None of the players we examined revealed significant cardiovascular abnormalities after clinical recovery. A mild reduction in spirometry parameters versus pre-COVID-19 values was observed in all athletes, but it was statistically significant (p<0.05) only in SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes. One SARS-CoV-2-positive player showed increased troponin I level, but extensive investigation did not show signs of myocardial damage. CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of athletes with previous asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive screening protocol including blood tests, spirometry, resting ECG, stress-test ECG with oxygen saturation monitoring and echocardiogram did not identify relevant anomalies. While larger studies are needed, extensive cardiorespiratory and haematological screening in athletes with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unnecessary.","Gervasi, Salvatore Francesco; Pengue, Luca; Damato, Luca; Monti, Riccardo; Pradella, Silvia; Pirronti, Tommaso; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Epifani, Francesco; Saggese, Alessio; Cuccaro, Francesco; Bianco, Massimiliano; Zeppilli, Paolo; Palmieri, Vincenzo",Br J Sports Med,152,16

Then the likelihood approach is introduced with a very artificial example to enable the concept to be grasped easily. Next, a more realistic example is described, with associated calculations. A further example using real categorical data is explained, showing how it relates to and is superior to the oft-used &#967;2 test.

METHODS: Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 members, residing mostly in Edinburgh and the surrounding Lothians regions in Scotland, mean age 84 years (SD = 0.3), responded to an online questionnaire in May 2020 (n = 190). We examined responses (experience and knowledge of COVID-19; adherence to guidance; impact on day-to-day living; social contact; self-reported physical and mental health; loneliness; and lifestyle) and relationships between previously-measured characteristics and questionnaire outcomes. RESULTS: Four respondents experienced COVID-19; most had good COVID-19 knowledge (94.7%) and found guidance easy to understand (86.3%).

Worldwide, this pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people in many countries causing similar reaction in terms of emotions and concerns at the population level. Our study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being in a cohort of Italian university students. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the period immediately after the first lockdown through the administration of a questionnaire on the personal websites of students attending their undergraduate courses at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. We used the Patient-Health-Engagement-Scale, Self-Rating-Anxiety-Scale, and Self-Rating-Depression-Scale to assess engagement, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms of our sample. RESULTS: The sample size was 501 subjects, of which 35.33% were classified as anxious and 72.93% as depressed. Over 90% of respondents had good understanding of the preventive measures despite over 70% suffered from the impossibility of physically seeing friends and partners. Around 55% of students would have been willing to contribute much more to face the pandemic. An increase in the occurrences of anxiety was associated with being female, being student of the Rome campus, suffering from the impossibility of attending university, being distant from colleagues, and being unable of physically seeing one's partner. Performing physical activity reduced this likelihood. CONCLUSION: University students are at risk of psychological distress in the case of traumatic events. The evolution of the pandemic is uncertain and may have long-term effects on mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to study the most effective interventions to identify vulnerable subgroups and to plan for acute and long-term psychological services to control and reduce the burden of psychological problems.","Villani, Leonardo; Pastorino, Roberta; Molinari, Enrico; Anelli, Franco; Ricciardi, Walter; Graffigna, Guendalina; Boccia, Stefania",Global Health,152,10

Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19.

Serum levels of HMGB1, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; were significantly higher in ARS rats compared to controls, and decreased by EP treatments (p < 0.001). Nasal sponge packing led to acute inflammatory response of nasal sinus in rats, and increased the expression of HMGB1, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;. Nasal drops with EP could attenuate the inflammation of sinonasal mucosa through inhibiting the expression of HMGB1, IL-6 and TNF-&#945; in ARS rats.","Liang, Xiang; Shen, Yang; Zhang, Xiaowei; He, Guangxiang; Tan, Guolin",Sci Rep,152,1

In this work, a carbon foam microwave plasma process is developed, utilizing plasma discharge to generate surface temperatures exceeding â¼3000 K in a N2 atmosphere, to convert unsorted white wastes into gases (H2, CO, C2H4, C3H6, CH4, etc.) and small amounts of inorganic minerals and solid carbon, which can be buried as artificial ""coal"". This process is self-perpetuating, as the new solid carbon asperities grafted onto the foam's surface actually increase the plasma discharge efficiency over time. This process has been characterized by in situ optical probes and infrared sensors and optimized to handle most of the forms of white waste without the need for pre-sorting or washing.

Therefore, in this demo paper, we proposed a portable non-contact healthy screening system for people wearing masks, which can simultaneously obtain body temperature and respiration state. This system consists of three modules viz. thermal image collection module, health indicator calculation module and health assessment module. In this system, the thermal video of human faces is first captured through a portable thermal imaging camera. Then, body temperature and respiration state are extracted from the video and are imported into the following health assessment module. Finally, the screening result can be obtained. The results of preliminary experiments show that this syetem can give an accurate screening result within 15 seconds.

Social and systemic factors determine mental health as much as individual factors. To determine how best to address multi-level risk factors, we must first understand the distribution of risk. Previously, we have used psychometric methods applied to two epidemiologically-principled samples of people aged 14-24 to establish a robust, latent common mental distress (CMD) factor of depression and anxiety normally distributed across the population. This was linearly associated with suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm such that effective interventions to reduce CMD across the whole population could have a greater total benefit than those that focus on the minority with the most severe scores. In a randomised trial of mindfulness interventions in university students (the Mindful Student Study), we demonstrated a population-shift effect whereby the intervention group appeared resilient to a universal stressor. Given these findings, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that population-based interventions to reduce CMD are urgently required. To target all types of mental health determinants, these interventions must be multi-level. Careful design and evaluation, interdisciplinary work, and extensive local stakeholder involvement are crucial for these interventions to be effective.","Lo Moro, Giuseppina; Soneson, Emma; Jones, Peter B; Galante, Julieta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,16

The factors influencing compliance with these regulations may differ from ""classic"" predictors for medical compliance. This study attempted to assess the effect of social communication and psychological factors on intention to comply. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on healthy adults living in Israel (n = 697). The survey assessed the intention to comply with the state COVID-19 regulations and explored possible correlations with demographic and psychosocial factors. Data were collected during May 2020 using a Qualtrics online survey. Data were analyzed to find correlations between anxiety, uncertainty, media exposure and other variables and the level of intention to comply as self-reported. Moderation and mediation effects were studied by an integrative model of influencing factors. We found that media exposure change, trust in responsible agencies and anxiety were positively correlated with compliance, while uncertainty was correlated with noncompliance. The effect of media exposure on compliance had two components. First, media exposure was positively correlated with compliance. On the other hand, media exposure was positively correlated with uncertainty, and uncertainty was negatively correlated with compliance. Interestingly, anxiety, which was positively correlated with media exposure, also moderated the negative correlation between uncertainty and compliance. Our results highlight the important role of uncertainty and anxiety as moderators between media exposure and compliance. To increase public compliance with COVID-19 regulations, efforts should be directed at decreasing uncertainty and anxiety.","Mevorach, Tomer; Cohen, Jonathan; Apter, Alan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,33

In recent years, there has been greater awareness of the ways in which climate-sensitive infectious diseases pose a growing threat to global public health. Objective: To categorize and describe the effects of climate change on infectious diseases with skin manifestations. Methods: A scoping review of the MEDLINE and PubMed online databases for climate-sensitive infections was performed in February and March 2020. A representative selection of conditions with skin manifestations was included in this review. Results: Several representative climate-sensitive infectious diseases were identified in each the following categories: (1) vector-borne infectious diseases, (2) infectious diseases associated with extreme weather events, and (3) infectious diseases linked to human migration. Conclusions: Climate variables directly influence the survival and reproduction of infectious microorganisms, their vectors, and their animal reservoirs. Due to sustained warmer temperatures at higher latitudes, climate change has expanded the geographic range of certain pathogenic microbes. More frequent climate change-related extreme weather events create circumstances where existing infectious microorganisms flourish and novel infections emerge. Climate instability is linked to increased human migration, which disrupts healthcare infrastructure as well as the habitats of microbes, vectors, and animal reservoirs, and also leads to widespread poverty and overcrowding. Dermatologists should understand that climate change will affect the burden and geographic distribution of infectious diseases, many of which have cutaneous signs and might be encountered in their regular practice.","Coates, Sarah J; Norton, Scott A",,152,12

Btk inhibition has shown impressive clinical efficacy in various B cell malignancies. However, it remains unknown whether inhibition additionally induces changes in BCR signaling due to feedback mechanisms, a phenomenon referred to as BCR rewiring. In this report, we studied the impact of Btk activity on major components of the BCR signaling pathway in mice. As expected, NF-&#954;B and Akt/S6 signaling was decreased in Btk-deficient B cells. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation of several proximal signaling molecules including CD79a, Syk and PI3K, as well as the key Btk-effector PLCÎ³2 and the more downstream kinase Erk were significantly increased. This pattern of BCR rewiring was essentially opposite in B cells from transgenic mice overexpressing Btk. Importantly, prolonged Btk inhibitor treatment of wild-type mice or mice engrafted with leukemic B cells also resulted in increased phosho-CD79a and phospho-PLCÎ³2 in B cells. Our findings show that Btk enzymatic function determines phosphorylation of proximal and distal BCR signaling molecules in B cells. We conclude that Btk inhibitor treatment results in rewiring of BCR signaling, which may affect both malignant and healthy B cells. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we aim to clarify the epidemiologic and influencing factors of asymptomatic carriers in the general population. Methods: In our hospital, all hospital staff have received throat swab RT-PCR test, plasma COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibodies test and chest CT examination. We analyzed the correlation between infection rates and gender, age, job position, work place and COVID-19 knowledge training of the staff. After that, all asymptomatic staff were re-examined weekly for 3 weeks. Findings: A total of 3764 hospital staff were included in this single-center cross-sectional study. Among them, 126 hospital staff had abnormal findings, and the proportion of asymptomatic infection accounted for 0.76% (28/3674). There were 26 staff with IgM+, 73 with IgG+, and 40 with ground glass shadow of chest CT. Of all staff with abnormal findings, the older they are, the more likely they are to be the staff with abnormal results, regardless of their gender. Of 3674 hospital staff, the positive rate of labor staff is obviously higher than that of health care workers (HCWs) and administrative staff (P<0.05). In the course of participating in the treatment of COVID-19, there was no statistically significant difference in positive rates between high-risk departments and low-risk departments (P>0.05). The positive rate of HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 knowledge training was lower than those did not participate in early training (P <0.01). Importantly, it was found that there was no statistical difference between the titers of IgM antibody of asymptomatic infections and confirmed patients with COVID-19 in recovery period (P>0.05). During 3 weeks follow-up, all asymptomatic patients did not present the development of clinical symptoms or radiographic abnormalities after active intervention in isolation point. Interpretation: To ensure the safety of resumption of work, institutions should conduct COVID-19 prevention training for staff and screening for asymptomatic patients, and take quarantine measures as soon as possible in areas with high density of population.

However, despite the mounting evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infecting the human gut, little is known about the antiviral programs triggered in this organ. To address this gap, we performed single-cell transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected intestinal organoids. We identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2 and, interestingly, found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2. Infected cells activated strong pro-inflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon. These findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 curtails the immune response and highlights the gut as a pro-inflammatory reservoir that should be considered to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Triana, Sergio; Metz-Zumaran, Camila; Ramirez, Carlos; Kee, Carmon; Doldan, Patricio; Shahraz, Mohammed; Schraivogel, Daniel; Gschwind, Andreas R; Sharma, Ashwini K; Steinmetz, Lars M; Herrmann, Carl; Alexandrov, Theodore; Boulant, Steeve; Stanifer, Megan L",Mol Syst Biol,152,20

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All residents of LTCFs registered in Senior Alert, a Swedish national database of health examinations in older adults, during 2019-2020. METHODS: We selected residents with confirmed COVID-19 until September 15, 2020, along with time-dependent propensity score-matched controls without COVID-19. Exposures were COVID-19, age, sex, comorbidities, medications, and other patient characteristics. The outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3731 residents (median age 87 years, 64.5% female) with COVID-19 were matched to 3731 controls without COVID-19. Thirty-day mortality was 39.9% in COVID-19 cases and 5.7% in controls [relative risk 7.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.10-8.14]. In COVID-19 cases, the odds ratio (OR) for 30-day mortality was 2.44 (95% CI 1.57-3.81) in cases aged 80-84 years, 2.99 (95% CI 1.93-4.65) in cases aged 85-89 years, and 3.28 (95% CI 2.11-5.10) in cases aged &#8805;90 years, as compared with cases aged <70 years. Other risk factors for mortality among COVID-19 cases included male sex (OR, 2.60, 95% CI 2.22-3.05), neuropsychological conditions (OR, 2.18; 95% CI 1.76-2.71), impaired walking ability (OR, 1.45, 95% CI 1.17-1.78), urinary and bowel incontinence (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.22-1.85), diabetes (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.14-1.62), chronic kidney disease (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and previous pneumonia (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.85). Nutritional factors, cardiovascular diseases, and antihypertensive medications were not significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In Swedish LTCFs, COVID-19 was associated with a large excess in mortality after controlling for an extensive number of risk factors. Beyond older age and male sex, several prevalent clinical risk factors independently contributed to higher mortality. These findings suggest that reducing transmission of COVID-19 in LTCFs will likely prevent a considerable number of deaths.","Ballin, Marcel; Bergman, Jonathan; Kivipelto, Miia; Nordström, Anna; Nordström, Peter",J Am Med Dir Assoc,152,20

However, there is scarce evidence supporting the relationship between SB and urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling older adults, and no information on any possible association in institutionalised older adults. Stage I of this project has the main objective of determining the prevalence of UI and its associated factors in nursing home (NH) residents, as well as analysing the association between UI (and its types) and SB. Stage II aims to investigate the incidence and predictive factors of functional and continence decline, falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among NH residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Stage I is an observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study with mixed methodology that aims to explore the current status of several health-related outcomes in NH residents of Osona (Barcelona, Spain). The prevalence ratio will be used as an association measure and multivariate analysis will be undertaken using Poisson regression with robust variance. Stage II is a 2-year longitudinal study that aims to analyse functional and continence decline, incidence of falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these outcomes. A survival analysis using the actuarial method for functional decline and continence, evaluated every 6 months, and the Kaplan-Meier method for falls, hospitalisations and deaths, and Cox regression for multivariate analysis will be undertaken.

Although SAS is a common sleep disorder, most patients remain undiagnosed because the gold standard test polysomnography (PSG), is high-cost and unavailable in many hospitals. Thus, an SAS screening system that can be used easily at home is needed. METHODS: Apnea during sleep affects changes in the autonomic nervous function, which causes fluctuation of the heart rate. In this study, we propose a new SAS screening method that combines heart rate measurement and long short-term memory (LSTM) which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). We analyzed the data of intervals between adjacent R waves (R-R interval; RRI) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) records, and used an LSTM model whose inputs are the RRI data is trained to discriminate the respiratory condition during sleep. RESULTS: The application of the proposed method to clinical data showed that it distinguished between patients with moderate-to-severe SAS with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%, results which are superior to any other existing SAS screening methods. CONCLUSION: Since the RRI data can be easily measured by means of wearable heart rate sensors, our method may prove to be useful as an SAS screening system at home.","Iwasaki, Ayako; Nakayama, Chikao; Fujiwara, Koichi; Sumi, Yukiyoshi; Matsuo, Masahiro; Kano, Manabu; Kadotani, Hiroshi",Sleep breath,152,29

A histological examination of the palatine tonsils of 22 children aged 5 to 14 years old who had a paratonsillar abscess and 18 children suffering from chronic tonsillitis was carried out. Fragments of small salivary glands, located both superficially, in the mucous membrane between the stratified squamous non-keratinizing epithelium and the lymphoid tissue of the palatine tonsils, and between the muscles of the amygdala were found in 42 of the 80 (52.5%) tonsils studied. Along with the unchanged glandular structure, 26 (61.9%) samples revealed areas of destruction foci in small salivary glands with signs of inflammatory and compensatory regenerative activity. The presence of separate interlobular ducts of the salivary glands with pronounced periductal lymph - macrophage infiltration was noted. The subepithelial lymph-macrophage infiltrates found in the lamina propria are associated with the exit of the excretory ducts of the salivary glands to the surface of the mucous membrane. Many thin-walled veins are surrounded by perivascular lymphocellular infiltrates. The inflammatory and post-inflammatory changes in the small salivary glands revealed by us in children with chronic tonsillitis do not exclude their participation in the pathogenesis of paratonsillitis. At the same time, inflammation in the salivary gland can be both primary, as a result of its infection with live microorganisms from the tissues of the tonsil, and secondary, due to the compression of the excretory ducts by the edematous tissue of the tonsil in acute tonsillitis.","Kim, A S; Boyko, N V; Stagnieva, I V; Panchenko, S N",Vestn Otorinolaringol,152,1

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of multiple CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia on initial presentation in nonelderly patients without underlying medical conditions. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, thirty laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with no known major underlying disease who underwent a chest CT scan and expired of pneumonia within the following 30 days after admission, were included as case group. Sixty control subjects individually matched on their age, gender, without underlying medical conditions, who received same-criteria standard care and were discharged from the hospital in 30-day follow-up were included in the control group. A conditional logistic regression model was applied. RESULTS: Applying a univariate conditional logistic regression model, it was revealed that bilateral lung disease, anterior involvement, central extension, GGO, consolidation, air bronchograms, pleural effusion, BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯25â¯kg/m² and CT severity score were the significant preliminary predictors (all p-values < 0.05). Next, by applying a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, it was determined that the CT severity score is the only statistically significant CT predictor of mortality (Odds Ratioâ¯=â¯1.99, Confidence Interval: 1.01-4.06, p-value < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis revealed a score of 7.5 as the cut-off point of CT severity score with the highest sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.87). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that CT severity score is a reliable predictor factor of mortality in nonelderly previously healthy individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia. Assessment of disease extension in addition to the morphological pattern is necessary for CT reports of COVID-19 patients. This may alert the clinicians to alter the management for this specific group of patients, even when they are clinically silent or have a mild presentation.","Tabatabaei, Seyed Mohammad Hossein; Rahimi, Habibollah; Moghaddas, Fahimeh; Rajebi, Hamid",Eur J Radiol,152,16

The aim of this paper is to analyze whether differences in patient management may have influenced the local course of the epidemic. The analysis on the 21 Italian regions considers the strategies adopted in terms of hospitalization, treatment in the ICU and at home. Moreover, an in-depth analysis was carried out on: Lombardia, which adopted a hospitalization approach; Veneto, which tended to confine patients at home; and Emilia Romagna, which adopted a mixed hospitalization-home based approach. The majority of regions implemented a home-based approach, while the hospital approach was followed in three regions (Lombardia, Piemonte, and Lazio), mainly limited to the first period of the outbreak. All regions in the later phases tended to reduce hospitalization, preferring to confine patients at home. This comparison, highlighting the different phases of the pandemic, outlined that the adoption of home-based practices contributed to limiting infection rates among patients and health professionals as well as decreasing the number of deaths.","Pecoraro, Fabrizio; Luzi, Daniela; Clemente, Fabrizio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data on Google Search queries in the United States for 30 otolaryngology-related terms were obtained from Google Trends. The means of relative search volume from the COVID-19 period (March 29, 2020 through May 16, 2020) were compared to similar periods from 2016 to 2019 using a t-test of two independent samples. RESULTS: In total, 16.6% of search terms had significant increases in relative search volume during the COVID-19 period, with the largest percentage increase for ""can't smell"" (124.4%, p = .006), followed by ""allergies"" (30.3%, p = .03), ""voice pain"" (26.1%, p = .008), and ""ears ringing"" (19.0%, p < .001).

Advanced understanding of young adults' willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine and the potential factors influencing their vaccine intention will contribute to the development and implementation of effective strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this group. The current study investigated how risk exposures and risk perceptions of COVID-19 (e.g., perceived susceptibility, severity, and fear of COVID-19) as well as negative attitudes toward general vaccination were related to COVID vaccine acceptance among college students based on online survey data from 1062 college students in South Carolina . Hierarchical linear regression was used to examine the association of these factors with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance controlling for key demographics. Results suggested that perceived severity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with vaccine acceptance, while higher level of risk exposures (work/study place exposure) and negative attitude toward general vaccination were associated with low vaccine acceptance. Our findings suggested that we need tailored education messages for college students to emphasize the severity of COVID-19, particularly potential long-term negative consequences on health, address the concerns of side effects of general vaccines by dispelling the misconception, and target the most vulnerable subgroups who reported high level of risk exposures while showed low intention to take the vaccine. Efforts are warranted to increase college students' perceived susceptibility and severity and promote their self-efficacy in health management and encourage them to take protective behaviors including vaccine uptake.","Qiao, Shan; Tam, Cheuk Chi; Li, Xiaoming",,152,24

Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to this hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.","Iacus, Stefano Maria; Natale, Fabrizio; Satamaria, Carlos; Spyratos, Spyridon; Vespe, Michele",,152,1

An image-based eyelid lesion management service was piloted to reduce the number of patients who would require outpatient clinic review. The aim of this study was to determine its accuracy and feasibility, both as a hospital-based and community optometrist-based service. If successful, the service was envisaged to significantly reduce the number of patients that require face-to-face (F2F) review, in accordance with current post-COVID-19 principles of social distancing. METHODS: Patients with lid lesions attending an oculoplastics clinic were assessed by consultant oculoplastic surgeons in an F2F consultation (Arm A). The lesions were photographed by a professional clinical photographer (Arm B) and by an optometrist with a handheld digital camera (Arm C). These images were reviewed by independent consultants masked to the outcome of the F2F clinical encounter. Data were collected prospectively including patient demographics, diagnosis, suspicion of malignancy and management. The image-based clinic results were compared to the F2F clinic results. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included. Clinical diagnoses were compared for intra-observer variability and substantial agreement was demonstrated between gold-standard F2F clinic visit (Arm A) and Arm B (Æ = 0.708) and C (Æ = 0.776). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of discharge and all cases of malignancy were either identified or flagged for F2F review in the image-based arms. CONCLUSION: This pilot demonstrated substantial diagnostic agreement of image-based diagnoses with F2F consultation and image review alone did not miss any cases of malignancy.","Hind, J; Edington, M; McFall, K; Salina, E; Diaper, C; Drummond, S; Tejwani, D; Gregory, M E; Connolly, J; Cauchi, P; Crofts, K; Chadha, V",,152,20
308411,308411,308411,One Health needs a vision beyond zoonoses,19.715456,2.6412117,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tele-rehabilitation (TR) has been developed to improve service access to ambulatory rehabilitation service in Hong Kong. The development was completed in October 2019 and rollout for use to occupational therapist (OT), Physiotherapist (PT) and speech therapist (ST). During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, rehabilitation service was seriously interrupted. TR was used extensively as a novel mean of service delivery model to bridge the demand for rehabilitation service. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the design and development process of TR. And (2) as an observational study, to study how the TR platform was used to overcome the disruption of rehabilitation service during the COVID-2019 pandemic. METHODS: TR was developed utilizing four core determinants of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as guiding principle. A generic prescription platform called Activity Base Prescription System (ABPS) and a mobile app called Rehabilitation App were built. Five outcomes were used to examine the utilization of TR both before and during the pandemic periods that included throughput, patient demographic, patient conditions, workforce, satisfaction from patient and staff. RESULTS: There was tremendous increase in use of TR during pandemic. The total number of patient prescribed up till July 2020 were 9101. The main age distribution prescribed most was between 51 to 70 years old. It was found that TR was used to a much wider scope of patient conditions than the original development plan. More than 1112 therapists prescribed TR to patients which constituted to 50.6% of total workforce. Moreover, there was high satisfaction rate from patient 4.2/5 and high compliance rate to prescribed rehabilitation activities (81.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that TR in the form of generic prescription platform and mobile app can be an effective mean to provide rehabilitation to patient. During outbreak period, TR has been used extensive and effectively to mitigate service disruption. Our finding also supported the high satisfaction of TR by patient. However, longer study is required to demonstrate the sustained use of TR especially after the pandemic.","Ku, Benny Pang Shing; Tse, Ada Wai Shan; Pang, Benny Chu Hang; Cheung, Ngai Tseung; Pang, Joanna Yuk Wa; Chan, Joyce Ka Yin; Hui, Hing Loi; Chu, Dave; Choi, Kevin Hoi Wa",,152,10

This retrospective study was aimed to explore the predictive value of the MHR for the late recurrence of AF after radiofrequency ablation. METHODS: From April 2015 to October 2018, patients with paroxysmal AF who had undergone radiofrequency catheter ablation at Subei People's Hospital of Jiangsu Province were enrolled in our study. All the participants were observed until November 2019 after the procedure. During the postoperative follow up, the patients were categorized into the recurrence group and maintenance of sinus rhythm group based on who had experienced AF recurrence. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients were diagnosed with paroxysmal AF, with an average age of 61.2 ± 9.3 years. Forty-seven patients had developed late recurrence during a mean follow up of 25.1 ± 12.0 months. The AF recurrence event rates were significantly increased in the highest MHR tertile compared with those in the lowest MHR tertile (22.0% vs. 57.1%; P < 0.05). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the preablation MHR (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.12 ~ 1.60; P = 0.001) and left atrial diameter (LAD) (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08 ~ 1.35; P = 0.001) were independent risk factors predicting the recurrence of AF after radiofrequency ablation. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the MHR was 0.712 (95% CI = 0.618 ~ 0.806; P = 0.000) and that of LAD was 0.739 (95% CI = 0.653 ~ 0.814; P = 0.000). Z-test found no significant difference between the MHR and LAD regarding the AUC (Z = 0.451; P = 0.652). CONCLUSION: An elevated preablation MHR was associated with an increased risk of the postoperative recurrence of AF. Additionally, the MHR independently predicted the late recurrence of paroxysmal AF after radiofrequency ablation, with the same predictive value as LAD.","Chen, She-An; Zhang, Man-Man; Zheng, Meifang; Liu, Fei; Sun, Lei; Bao, Zheng-Yu; Chen, Fu-Kun; Li, Hong-Xiao; Gu, Xiang",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,152,1

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to affect humans. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (88%), cough (68%), vomiting (5%) and diarrhoea (3.7%), and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur from human to human via respiratory secretions released by the infected individuals when coughing and sneezing. COVID-19 can be detected through computed tomography scans and confirmed through molecular diagnostics tools such as polymerase chain reaction. Currently, there are no effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2, hence antiviral drugs have been used to reduce the development of respiratory complications by reducing viral load.

Established practices changed quickly, with educators showing ‘pedagogic agility’. Despite the relocation to newly-formed online spaces, many principles and ‘intentionalities’ of practice remained unchanged, as did the teacher educators’ orientating values. Overall, there was a sense of both sameness and difference in some of the innovative pedagogies developed on the (g)local level.

Although effective strategies for combatting virus transmission and associated disease are available, global outbreaks of viral pathogens such as the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that there is still a critical need for new approaches that can be used to interrupt the chain of viral infection and mitigate virus-associated pathogenesis. Recent studies point to non-thermal plasma (NTP), a partly ionized gas comprised of a complex mixture of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species along with physical effectors, as the potential foundation for new antiviral approaches. A more thorough understanding of the antiviral properties and safety of NTP has stimulated explorations of NTP as the basis for treatments of viral diseases. The recently described immunomodulatory properties of NTP are also being evaluated for potential use in immunotherapies of viral diseases as well as in antiviral vaccination strategies. In this review, we present the current state-of-the-art in addition to compelling arguments that NTP merits further exploration for use in the prevention and management of viral infections and associated diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Mohamed, Nayak, Rendine, Wigdahl, Krebs, Bruggeman and Miller.","Mohamed, H.; Nayak, G.; Rendine, N.; Wigdahl, B.; Krebs, F.

The most common causes of infectious vaginitis wich are identifed by European researchers are bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis and mixed infections. Treatment of VDS is a serious problem not only because of the pathogens's resistance and frequent recurrences, but especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic which can complicate further patient`s examination for determination of infectious agent and the choice of individual approach to etiotropic therapy. Purpose of study: to investigate the structure of causes of pathological vaginal discharge in Ukrainian women, as well as assess the compliance and effectiveness of their treatment. Methods: 472 doctors of women's consultation centres, gynecological hospitals and centers of reproductive medicine from 23 regions of Ukraine were enrolled in multi-center study of vulvovaginal infections management. During the study, which lasted from August to December 2019, were examined 45,295 patients aged 18 to 59 years who complained for pathological vaginal discharge. Results: analysis of the structure of nosologies that caused VDS showed that the examined patients were most often diagnosed with BV (41.1%), colpitis of mixed etiology (26.59%) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (19.22%), trichomoniasis was confirmed in 8.44%. The interviewed gynecologists preferred topical therapy in 95,99% cases of BV and colpitis of mixed etiology. Topical combined medications were prescribed in 85,21% of cases, monoforms - in 14.79%. Among the combined vaginal dosage forms the combination of metronidazole 750 mg /miconazole 200 mg was preferred in 48.81% of cases with clinical efficacy 87.1% in patients with BV and 86,9% in women with mixed infection. Normalization of the vaginal biocenosis was observed in 93.50% of the examined patients. The study demonstrated the safety, good tolerability and compliance of patients to therapy with the combined medications metronidazole 750 mg / miconazole 200 mg in vaginal suppositories. Conclusion: BV, colpitis of mixed etiology and vulvovaginal candidiasis are predominated in structure of main causes of VDS in Ukraine. In the treatment of VDS, priority is given to vaginal forms with the most compliant (89.8%) regimen: once a day for a short period (7 days).

As such, Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements (PROMS) can be an essential metric to deliver high-quality cardiovascular care, particularly in the subset of patients who remain disappointed with their outcomes. PROMS should be a reproducible and reflective report of what is fundamental to a patient over time and across treatments with proper standards in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of the collected data. These reports can also be sensitive to changes, whether improvements or deteriorations in the quality of care and medical attitude, but a lack of standardization makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions and compare findings across treatments. As a research tool, PROMS can have a significant prognostic prominence, offering a powerful instrument of comparison between different treatment modalities. With the information technology (IT) abilities of today, we can leverage mobile tools and powerful computer systems to perform sophisticated data analysis using patient-derived data and randomization. This may eliminate guess work and generate impactful metrics to better inform the decision-making process. PROMS analyzed by proper standardized algorithms can avoid physician bias, and be integrated in the hospital team work. Therefore, there is a strong need for integration of PROMS into the evaluation of cardiovascular interventions and procedures; and also, establish international standards in the analyses of Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Data to address this need and develop therapeutic recommendations.","Kornowski, Ran",Eur.

Many published commentaries have proposed plans for pandemic control that are primarily based on mortality rates among older individuals without considering long-term morbidity among individuals of all ages. Reliable estimates of such morbidity are important for patient care, prognosis, and development of public health policy. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the frequency and variety of persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Evidence Review: A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2020, to March 11, 2021, that examined persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection. Persistent symptoms were defined as those persisting for at least 60 days after diagnosis, symptom onset, or hospitalization or at least 30 days after recovery from the acute illness or hospital discharge. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, long-term, after recovery, long-haul, persistent, outcome, symptom, follow-up, and longitudinal. All English-language articles that presented primary data from cohort studies that reported the prevalence of persistent symptoms among individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that had clearly defined and sufficient follow-up were included. Case reports, case series, and studies that described symptoms only at the time of infection and/or hospitalization were excluded. A structured framework was applied to appraise study quality. Findings: A total of 1974 records were identified; of those, 1247 article titles and abstracts were screened. After removal of duplicates and exclusions, 92 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility; 47 studies were deemed eligible, and 45 studies reporting 84 clinical signs or symptoms were included in the systematic review. Of 9751 total participants, 5266 (54.0%) were male; 30 of 45 studies reported mean or median ages younger than 60 years. Among 16 studies, most of which comprised participants who were previously hospitalized, the median proportion of individuals experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom was 72.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 55.0%-80.0%). Individual symptoms occurring most frequently included shortness of breath or dyspnea (26 studies; median frequency, 36.0%; IQR, 27.6%-50.0%), fatigue or exhaustion (25 studies; median frequency, 40.0%; IQR, 31.0%-57.0%), and sleep disorders or insomnia (8 studies; median 29.4%, IQR, 24.4%-33.0%). There were wide variations in the design and quality of the studies, which had implications for interpretation and often limited direct comparability and combinability. Major design differences included patient populations, definitions of time zero (ie, the beginning of the follow-up interval), follow-up lengths, and outcome definitions, including definitions of illness severity. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review found that COVID-19 symptoms commonly persisted beyond the acute phase of infection, with implications for health-associated functioning and quality of life. Current studies of symptom persistence are highly heterogeneous, and future studies need longer follow-up, improved quality, and more standardized designs to reliably quantify risks.","Nasserie, Tahmina; Hittle, Michael; Goodman, Steven N",JAMA Netw Open,152,5

The lack of an efficient pharmacological treatments are serious problems to be faced by scientists and medical staffs worldwide. In this work, an in silico approach based on the combination of molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and quantum biochemistry revealed that the synthetic peptides RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA, strongly interact with the main protease (Mpro) a pivotal protein for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Although not binding to the proteolytic site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with other protein domain and allosterically altered the protease topology. Indeed, such peptide-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes provoked dramatic alterations in the three-dimensional structure of Mpro leading to area and volume shrinkage of the proteolytic site, which could affect the protease activity and thus the virus replication. Based on these findings, it is suggested that RcAlb-PepI, PepGAT, and PepKAA could interfere with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro role in vivo. Also, unlike other antiviral drugs, these peptides have no toxicity to human cells. This pioneering in silico investigation opens up opportunity for further in vivo research on these peptides, towards discovering new drugs and entirely new perspectives to treat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Five of eight (62.5%) did not show any clinical signs of infection, three of eight (37.5%) had self-limited disease, and none required hospitalization for COVID-19. Two of eight (25%) had known exposure to infected health care staff as the probable source of infection. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, LT recipients showed a SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion rate similar to that of the general population with a substantial percentage of unrecognized infections.","Rauber, Conrad; Tiwari-Heckler, Shilpa; Pfeiffenberger, Jan; Mehrabi, Arianeb; Lund, Frederike; Gath, Philip; Mieth, Markus; Merle, Uta; Rupp, Christian",Transplant. proc,152,1

According to the most optimistic projections, it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, so the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule-based interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to control the relative expression of their proteins. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV have revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that stimulates high -1 PRF rates and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity impairs virus replication, suggesting that this activity may be therapeutically targeted. Here, we comparatively analyzed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar -1 PRF rates and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We noted that the upstream attenuator hairpin activity is also functionally retained in both viruses, despite differences in the primary sequence in this region. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may be promising lead compounds to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Kelly, Jamie A; Olson, Alexandra N; Neupane, Krishna; Munshi, Sneha; San Emeterio, Josue; Pollack, Lois; Woodside, Michael T; Dinman, Jonathan D",J Biol Chem,152,16

In this work, we perform a longitudinal analysis of a surface web marketplace. The information was collected through targeted web scrapping that allowed us to identify hundreds of merchants' profiles for the most widely used surface web marketplaces. In this regard, we discuss the products traded in these markets, their prices, their availability, and the exchange currency. This analysis is performed in an automated way through a machine learning-based pipeline, allowing us to quickly and accurately extract the needed information. The outcomes of our analysis evince that illegal practices are leveraged in surface marketplaces and that there are not effective mechanisms towards their takedown at the time of writing.","Lykousas, Nikolaos; Koutsokostas, Vasilios; Casino, Fran; Patsakis, Constantinos",,152,30

In contrast, in human medicine, especially until the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, they were unimportant viruses associated with the common cold. This is a brief comparative review of the biology of coronaviral infections emphasizing the commonalities among the various members of the family and considering how the veterinary experience with coronaviruses can inform the response to SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are perhaps best viewed as mutation machines whose genetic sequences can readily change through genetic drift, recombination, and deletions from a large genome. However, to be of clinical concern, variants must have the perfect set of amino acids in the S protein receptor binding domain and in their replication-mediating nonstructural proteins. Extensive experience with veterinary coronaviral vaccines suggests that optimal clinical immunity is a tandem of mucosal and systemic responses induced by a combination of mucosal and parenteral vaccines.","Ellis, J.",Canadian Veterinary Journal,152,16

Methods: To test the effect of cinnamaldehyde on prostate CAFs, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay was used to determine their survival. When spleen cells were treated with CAF supernatant, the proliferation of T cells was inhibited as determined by flow cytometry. After cinnamaldehyde treatment, this immunosuppressive function of CAFs was partially reversed. To explore the molecular mechanism, Western blotting and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied, and TLR4-dependent signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were quantified. Results: Cinnamaldehyde acted on the TLR4-dependent signaling pathway, altering the function of CAFs such that its supernatant no longer inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Conclusion: These data indicate that cinnamaldehyde can modify the functions of CAFs, which may be helpful for treating tumors.

Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers.

We aimed to describe clinical features and outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients with co-infection of influenza virus. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study was performed and a total of 140 patients with severe COVID-19 were enrolled in designated wards of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital between Feb 8th and March 15th in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. The demographic, clinical features, laboratory indices, treatment and outcomes of these patients were collected. RESULTS: Of 140 severe COVID-19 hospitalized patients, including 73 patients (52.14%) with median age 62 years were influenza virus IgM-positive and 67 patients (47.86%) with median age 66 years were influenza virus IgM-negative. 76 (54.4%) of severe COVID-19 patients were males. Chronic comorbidities consisting mainly of hypertension (45.3%), diabetes (15.8%), chronic respiratory disease (7.2%), cardiovascular disease (5.8%), malignancy (4.3%) and chronic kidney disease (2.2%). Clinical features, including fever (&#8805;38 °C), chill, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, diarrhea and fatigue or myalgia were collected. Fatigue or myalgia was less found in COVID-19 patients with IgM-positive (33.3% vs 50/7%, P = 0.0375). Higher proportion of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 42 s was observed in COVID-19 patients with influenza virus IgM-negative (43.8% vs 23.6%, P = 0.0127). Severe COVID-19 Patients with influenza virus IgM positive have a higher cumulative survivor rate than that of patients with influenza virus IgM negative (Log-rank P = 0.0308).

With the scale and severity of infection, number of deaths and lack of any definite therapeutic armamentarium, the vaccine development has been accelerated at a never-before pace. A wide variety of vaccine technologies and platforms are being attempted. Out of the over 108 efforts, 100 are in preclinical and eight in Phase 1 or 2 trial stage. While the availability of newer technologies has facilitated development, there are several challenges on the way including limited understanding of the pathophysiology, targeting humoral or mucosal immunity, lack of suitable animal model, poor success of human severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines, limited efficacy of influenza vaccines, and immune exaggeration with animal coronavirus vaccines. With the current scenario with political, funding, research, and regulatory supports, if everything sails through smoothly, the successful vaccine is expected in 12-18 months. Modestly efficacious vaccine may be also a good achievement.","Arora, Narendra Kumar; Das, Manoja Kumar",Indian J Public Health,152,26

Beyond slowing viral transmission, strict lockdowns have severe economic consequences. This work investigated response stringency, quantified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker's Stringency Index, and examined how restrictive interventions affected infection rates and gross domestic product (GDP) in China and OECD countries. Accounting for response timing, China imposed the most stringent restrictions, while Sweden and Japan were the least stringent. Expected GDP declines range from -8% (Japan) to -15.4% (UK). While greater restrictions generally slowed viral transmission, they failed to reach statistical significance and reduced GDP (p = 0.006). Timing was fundamental: governments who responded to the pandemic faster saw greater reductions in viral transmission (p = 0.013), but worse decreases in GDP (p = 0.044). Thus, response stringency has a greater effect on GDP than infection rates, which are instead affected by the timing of COVID-19 interventions. Attempts to mitigate economic impacts by delaying restrictions or decreasing stringency may buoy GDP in the short term but increase infection rates, the longer-term economic consequences of which are not yet fully understood. As highly restrictive interventions were successful in some but not all countries, decision-makers must consider whether their strategies are appropriate for the country on health and economic grounds.","Cross, Megan; Ng, Shu-Kay; Scuffham, Paul",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,16

No clinical use of these embedded sensors is currently being made, despite the relevance of remote clinical pulse oximetry to the management of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and the triage, initial management, and remote monitoring of people affected by respiratory viral pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or influenza. To be used for clinical pulse oximetry the embedded PPG system must be paired with an application (app) and meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does this smartphone sensor with app meet FDA/ISO requirements? Are measurements obtained using this system comparable to those of hospital reference devices, across a wide range of people? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed laboratory testing addressing ISO and FDA requirements in 10 participants using the smartphone sensor with app. Subsequently, we performed an open-label clinical study on 320 participants with widely varying characteristics, to compare the accuracy and precision of readings obtained by patients with those of hospital reference devices, using rigorous statistical methodology. RESULTS: ""Breathe down"" testing in the laboratory showed that the total root-mean-square deviation of oxygen saturation (Spo2) measurement was 2.02%, meeting FDA/ISO standards. Clinical comparison of the smartphone sensor with app vs hospital reference devices determined that Spo2 and heart rate accuracy were 0.48% points (95% CI, 0.38-0.58; P < .001) and 0.73 bpm (95% CI, 0.33-1.14; P < .001), respectively; Spo2 and heart rate precision were 1.25 vs reference 0.95 points (P < .001) and 5.99 vs reference 3.80 bpm (P < .001), respectively. These small differences were similar to the variation found between two FDA-approved reference instruments for Spo2: accuracy, 0.52 points (95% CI, 0.41-0.64; P < .001) and precision, 1.01 vs 0.86 (P < .001). INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the application for full FDA/ISO approval of the smartphone sensor with app tested for use in clinical pulse oximetry. Given the immense and immediate practical medical importance of remote intermittent clinical pulse oximetry to both chronic disease management and the global ability to respond to respiratory viral pandemics, the smartphone sensor with app should be prioritized and fast-tracked for FDA/ISO approval to allow clinical use.

METHODS: Pseudo-continuous ASL imaging with a three PLDs protocol was performed in 90 healthy adult volunteers from January 2018 to February 2019. Healthy subjects were divided into youth group (mean age, 30.63 years; age range, 20-44 years), middle-aged group (mean age, 52.16 years; age range 45-59 years) and elderly group (mean age, 66.07 years; age range, 60-77 years). After preprocessing, analyses of variance (ANOVA) and volume-of-interest (VOI) were conducted to compare the CBF in each brain region. According to the trends of CBF changing with PLD and the results of ANOVA, we optimized the PLD for ASL imaging in different brain regions and age groups. RESULTS: The CBF values of 87 VOIs [global gray matter (global GM) and other 86 VOIs] for each subject were obtained.

The objective of this study was to determine whether a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of adverse postoperative events following surgery in patients with cancer. METHODS: This was a propensity-matched cohort study from April 6, 2020 to October 31, 2020 at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. Cancer patients were identified who underwent elective surgery after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched to controls based on patient, disease, and surgical factors. Primary study outcome was a composite of the following adverse postoperative events that occurred within 30 days of surgery: death, unplanned readmission, pneumonia, cardiac injury, or thromboembolic event. RESULTS: A total of 5682 patients were included for study, and 114 (2.0%) had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The average time from infection to surgery was 52 (range 20-202) days. Compared with matched controls, there was no difference in the rate of adverse postoperative outcome (14.3% vs. 13.4%, p = 1.0). Patients with a SARS-CoV-2-related inpatient admission before surgery had increased odds of postoperative complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.4 [1.6-34.3], p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A minimal wait time of 20 days after recovering from minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be safe for cancer patients undergoing low-risk elective surgery. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections requiring inpatient treatment were at increased risk for adverse events after surgery. Additional wait time may be required in those with more severe infections.","Kothari, Anai N; DiBrito, Sandra R; Lee, J Jack; Caudle, Abigail S; Clemens, Mark W; Gottumukkala, Vijaya N; Katz, Matthew H G; Offodile, Anaeze C; Uppal, Abhineet; Chang, George J",Ann. surg. oncol,152,30

In preparation for the second wave, we sought to make such ramp down decisions more prudently and ethically. We report the development of a tool that can be used to make fair and ethical decisions in times of resource scarcity. We formed an interprofessional team to develop and use this tool to ensure that a diverse range of stakeholder perspectives were represented in this development process. This team, called the clinical activity recovery team, established institutional objectives that were combined with well-established procedural values, substantive ethical principles and decision-making criteria by using a variation on the well-known accountability for reasonableness ethical framework. The result of this is a stepwise, semiquantitative, ethical decision tool that can be applied to resource allocation challenges in order to reach fair and ethically defensible decisions. This ethical decision tool can be applied in various contexts and may prove useful at both the institutional and the departmental level; indeed this is how it is applied at our centre.

The lateral view showed an osteochondral lesion in the lateral femoral condyle and a skyline was suggested to be performed. Despite the patient could manage only 70° of flexion from full extension, a skyline view was obtained by adapting the standard technique which revealed an avulsion fracture at the medial aspect of the patella. Advanced imaging is used for further evaluation when x-ray findings are equivocal, or as a management or intervention tool(s). But not every patient is referred for advanced imaging unless there is an informed clinical reason.

The GLU-MCSB sorbents are insoluble in aqueous acidic solution and improve adsorption capacity. The adsorption process was carried out by considering various parameters, viz. adsorbent dose, contact time, pH and temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis of beads shows that degradation takes place in two stages. Fourier transform infra-red spectra of magnetic beads exhibit an absorption band at 606 cm-1 for Fe-O. The elemental analysis (energy dispersive X-ray analysis) and scanning electron microscopy were used to analyze the structure and characteristics of MCSB and GLU-MCSB. The Ni(II) removal efficiency attains a highest value of 95.12% with cross-linked GLU-MCSB in comparison to 79.5% with MCSB. Adsorption processes follow the pseudo-second-order rate kinetics model, which suggested that the rate-limiting step may be the chemical adsorption rather than the mass transport. The experimental data of adsorption fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.9), showing that monolayer adsorption took place on the surface of GLU-MCSB absorbents. The negative values of entropy change, -175.64 and -163.30 J/(mol·K), and enthalpy change, -54.75 and -49.58 kJ/mol, for MCSB and GLU-MCSB suggest that the process is spontaneous and exothermic in nature.","Rani, Priti; Johar, Rajni; Jassal, P S",Water Sci Technol,152,1

However, the current 1-2 m physical distancing rule is based on the physics of droplet transport and could not directly translate into infection risk. We therefore revisit the 2-m physical distancing rule by developing an infection-risk-based model for human speaking. The key modeling framework components include viral load, droplets dispersion and evaporation, deposition efficiency, viral dose-response rate and infection risk. The results suggest that the one-size-fits-all 2-m physical distancing rule derived from the pure droplet-physics-based model is not applicable under some realistic indoor settings, and may rather increase transmission probability of diseases. Especially, in thermally stratified environments, the infection risk could exhibit multiple peaks for a long distance beyond 2 m. With Sobol's sensitivity analysis, most variance of the risk is found to be significantly attributable to the variability in temperature gradient, exposure time and breathing height difference. Our study suggests there is no such magic 2 m physical distancing rule for all environments, but it needs to be used alongside other strategies, such as using face cover, reducing exposure time, and controlling the thermal stratification of indoor environment.","Liu, Fan; Luo, Zhiwen; Li, Yuguo; Zheng, Xiaohong; Zhang, Chongyang; Qian, Hua",Environ Int,152,16

People under different conditions have very different attitudes toward the epidemic. Due to the real-time and large-scale nature of social media, we can continuously obtain a massive amount of public opinion information related to the epidemic from social media. In particular, researchers may ask questions such as""how is the public reacting to COVID-19 in China during different stages of the pandemic?"",""what factors affect the public opinion orientation in China?"", and so on. To answer such questions, we analyze the pandemic related public opinion information on Weibo, China's largest social media platform. Specifically, we have first collected a large amount of COVID-19-related public opinion microblogs. We then use a sentiment classifier to recognize and analyze different groups of users' opinions. In the collected sentiment orientated microblogs, we try to track the public opinion through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we analyze more key factors that might have an impact on the public opinion of COVID-19 (e.g., users in different provinces or users with different education levels). Empirical results show that the public opinions vary along with the key factors of COVID-19. Furthermore, we analyze the public attitudes on different public-concerning topics, such as staying at home and quarantine.","Gao, Yuqi; Hua, Hang; Luo, Jiebo",,152,4

We use SEIJR and SIJR models involving populations of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, dead and recovered individuals to infer from covid-19 data rate constants, as well as their variations in response to lockdown measures. To account for confinement, we distinguish two susceptible populations at different risk: confined and unconfined. We show that transmission and recovery rates within them vary in response to facts. A key unknown to predict the evolution of the epidemic is the fraction of the population affected by the virus, including asymptomatic subjects. Our study tracks its time evolution with quantified uncertainty from available official data from the onset of the epidemic, limited, however, by the data quality. We exemplify the technique with data from Spain, country in which late drastic lockdowns were enforced for months. In late actions and in the absence of other measures, spread is delayed but not stopped unless a large enough fraction of the population is confined until the asymptomatic population is depleted. To some extent, confinement could be replaced by strong distancing through masks in adequate circumstances.","Carpio, A.; Pierret, E.",,152,16

Better knowledge of the seroprevalence and immune response after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in this population is important to manage them safely during the pandemic. METHODS: 922 cancer patients, 100 non-cancer patients and 94 health care workers (HCW) attending the Multidisciplinary Oncology Unit of Antwerp University Hospital from 24th of March 2020 till 31st of May 2020, and the Oncology Unit of AZ Maria Middelares Hospital, Ghent, from 13th of April 2020 till 31st of May 2020 participated in the study. The Alinity® (A; Abbott) and Liaison® (D; DiaSorin) commercially available assays were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while total SARS-CoV-2 Ig was measured by Elecsys® (R; Roche). RESULTS: In the overall study population IgG/total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in respectively 32/998 (3.2%), 68/1020 (6.7%), 37/1010 (3.7%) and of individuals using the A, D or R test. Forty-six out of 618 (7.4%) persons had a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Seroprevalence in cancer patients (A:2.2%, D:6.2%, R:3.0%), did not significantly differ from that in non-cancer patients (A:1.1%, D:5.6%, R:0.0%), but was lower than the HCW (A:13%, D:12%, R:12%; respectively Fisher's exact test p = 0.00001, p = 0.046, p = 0.0004). A positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was found in 6.8% of the cancer patients, 2.3% of the non-cancer patients and 28.1% of the HCW (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0004). Correlation between absolute values of the different Ig tests was poor in the cancer population. Dichotomising a positive versus negative test result, the A and R test correlated well (kappa 0.82 p McNemar test = 0.344), while A and D and R and D did not (respectively kappa 0.49 and 0.57; result significantly different p McNemar test = <0.0001 for both). The rate of seroconversion (>75%) and median absolute antibody levels (A: 7.0 versus 4.7; D 74.0 versus 26.6, R: 16.34 versus 7.32; all >P Mann Whitney U test = 0.28) in cancer patients and HCW with a positive RT-PCR at least 7 days earlier did not show any differences. However, none (N = 0/4) of the patients with hematological tumours had seroconversion and absolute antibody levels remained much lower compared to patients with solid tumours (R: 0.1 versus 37.6, p 0.003; D 4.1 versus 158, p 0.008) or HCW (all p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: HCW were at high risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Seroprevalence in cancer patients was low in the study period. Although Ig immune response in cancer patients with solid tumours does not differ from healthy volunteers, patients with hematological tumours have a very poor humoral immune response. This has to be taken into account in future vaccination programmes in this population. SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have divergent results and seem to have little added value in the management of cancer patients.","van Dam, Peter; Huizing, Manon; Roelant, Ella; Hotterbeekx, An; De Winter, Fien H R; Kumar-Singh, Samir; Moons, Pieter; Amajoud, Zainab; Vulsteke, Christof; Croes, Lieselot; Janssens, Annelies; Berneman, Zwi; Prenen, Hans; Meuris, Leander; Vanden Berghe, Wim; Smits, Evelien; Peeters, Marc",Eur J Cancer,152,16

Identification of this subgroup of patients was crucial for early aggressive intervention to improve survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether computer tomography (CT) - derived measurements of body composition such as myosteatosis indicating fat deposition inside the muscles could be used to predict the risk of transition to severe illness in patients with initial diagnosis of mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting initially as having the mild common-subtype illness were retrospectively recruited between January 21, 2020 and February 19, 2020. CT-derived body composition measurements were obtained from the initial chest CT images at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and were used to build models to predict the risk of transition. A myosteatosis nomogram was constructed using multivariate logistic regression incorporating both clinical variables and myosteatosis measurements. The performance of the prediction models was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve including the area under the curve (AUC). The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included in this study. Thirty-one of the enrolled patients transitioned to severe illness. Myosteatosis measurements including SM-RA (skeletal muscle radiation attenuation) and SMFI (skeletal muscle fat index) score fitted with SMFI, age and gender, were significantly associated with risk of transition for both the training and validation cohorts (P < 0.01). The nomogram combining the SM-RA, SMFI score and clinical model improved prediction for the transition risk with an AUC of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95] for the training cohort and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97] for the validation cohort, as compared to the nomogram of the clinical model with AUC of 0.75 and 0.74 for the training and validation cohorts respectively. Favorable clinical utility was observed using decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION: We found CT-derived measurements of thoracic myosteatosis to be associated with higher risk of transition to severe illness in patients affected by COVID-19 who presented initially as having the mild common-subtype infection. Our study showed the relevance of skeletal muscle examination in the overall assessment of disease progression and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Yi, Xiaoping; Liu, Haipeng; Zhu, Liping; Wang, Dongcui; Xie, Fangfang; Shi, Linbo; Mei, Ji; Jiang, Xiaolong; Zeng, Qiuhua; Hu, Pingfeng; Li, Yihui; Pang, Peipei; Liu, Jie; Peng, Wanxiang; Bai, Harrison X; Liao, Weihua; Chen, Bihong T",Clin. nutr.

PARTICIPANTS: Up to 1000 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Indigenous) infants aged 6 to < 12 months will be recruited from all regions of the Northern Territory. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention is the addition of a third scheduled dose of human monovalent rotavirus vaccine. CO-PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: ORVAC has two co-primary outcomes: (1) anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion, defined as serum anti-rotavirus IgA &#8805; 20 U/ml 28 to 55 days post Rotarix/placebo, and (2) time from randomisation to medical attendance for which the primary reason for presentation is acute gastroenteritis or acute diarrhoea illness before age 36 months. Secondary outcomes include (1) change in anti-rotavirus IgA log titre, (2) time from randomisation to hospitalisation with primary admission code presumed or confirmed acute diarrhoea illness before age 36 months, (3) time from randomisation to hospitalisation for which the admission is rotavirus confirmed diarrhoea illness before age 36 months and (4) time from randomisation to rotavirus infection (not necessarily requiring hospitalisation) meeting the jurisdictional definition before age 36 months.

Lockdown and risks of exposure to the coronavirus induced patients to modify their ways of use. The objective of this article was to share feedback on the implementation of a real-time monitoring system concerning (a) the activity of private practitioners in southeastern France, and (b) the evolution of reimbursements for drugs prescribed to persons with diabetes, for treatment of mental health disorders, and for performance of some vaccines. METHODS: Data regarding 2019 and 2020 were extracted from regional health insurance databases. They were used to elaborate several indicators relative to the general health insurance scheme, which were calculated and updated each week, starting with week 2. RESULTS: We observed a drop in private physician activity during the lockdown (-23% for general practitioners; -46% for specialist doctors), followed by a return to a semblance of normalcy. Concomitantly, a boom in teleconsultations occurred: at the height of the crisis they represented 30% of medical acts. The initial stage of the lockdown was characterized by peak provisioning for drugs, whereas vaccination strongly declined (-39% regarding measles, mumps and rubella vaccine among children aged less than 5 years; -54% regarding human papillomavirus vaccine among girls aged 10 to 14 years). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to health effects other than those directly attributable to the coronavirus itself. Renouncing care may result in healthcare delays highly deleterious for people and society. Public authorities are preoccupied with these questions; they have set up action plans aimed at encouraging patients to seek treatment without delay. That said, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has also created opportunities, such as the expansion of telemedicine. Although partial, these indicators can provide useful information enabling public decision makers to be reactive and to implement specific actions to meet the health needs of the population.","Davin-Casalena, B; Jardin, M; Guerrera, H; Tréhard, H; Lapalus, D; Ménager, C; Nauleau, S; Cassaro, V; Verger, P; Guagliardo, V",Rev. epidemiol. sante publique,152,17

Due to an observed higher than expected early mortality, a preliminary analysis was performed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects from 10 lung transplant centres were assigned to ECP treatment or to observation based on spirometric criteria, with potential crossover for those under observation. The primary endpoint of this study was to assess response to ECP (i.e., greater than a 50% decrease in the rate of FEV1 decline) before and 6 months after initiation of ECP. Mortality was also evaluated 6 and 12 months after enrolment as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Of 44 enrolled subjects, 31 were assigned to ECP treatment while 13 were initially assigned to observation on a non-random basis using specific spirometric inclusion criteria (seven of the observation patients subsequently crossed over to receive ECP). Of evaluable patients, 95% of patients initially assigned to treatment responded to ECP with rates of FEV1 decline that were reduced by 93% in evaluable ECP-treated patients. Mortality rates (percentages) at 6 and 12 months after enrolment was 32% and 41%, respectively. The most common (92%) primary cause of death was respiratory or graft failure. Significantly (p = 0.002) higher rates of FEV1 decline were observed in the non-survivors (-212 ± 177 ml/month) when compared to the survivors (-95 ± 117 ml/month) 12 months after enrolment. In addition, 18 patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) diagnosis within 6 months of enrolment had lost 38% of their baseline lung function at BOS diagnosis and 50% of their lung function at enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses suggest that earlier detection and treatment of BOS should be considered to appreciate improved outcomes with ECP.","Hage, Chadi A; Klesney-Tait, Julia; Wille, Keith; Arcasoy, Selim; Yung, Gordon; Hertz, Marshall; Chan, Kevin M; Morrell, Matt; Goldberg, Hilary; Vedantham, Suresh; Derfler, Mary Clare; Commean, Paul; Berman, Keith; Spitznagel, Ed; Atkinson, Jeff; Despotis, George",Transfus. med,152,9

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: 185 frontline nurses taking care of the COVID-19 patients participated in the study from March to April 2020. The data were collected using demographic questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). RESULTS: The results showed that not being at risk of coronavirus infection, poor/no satisfaction with life and non-resilience were significantly associated with higher psychological disorders. The coronavirus disease has significant consequences for the mental health of nurses. The factors affecting the mental health of nurses should be considered to support nurses in crises such as coronavirus.

Additionally, when the number of deaths data is also provided with the number of total cases to the input of LSTM Network, the mean error reduces to 0.99$\pm$0.51%. Consequently, addition of the number of deaths data to the input, results a lower error in forecasting, compared to using only the number of total cases as the input.

In addition to the current data protection and network security legal frameworks, for example, the UK government has initiated the 'Secure by Design' campaign. While there has been work on how organisations and individuals manage their own cybersecurity risks, it remains unclear to what extent IoT vendors are supporting end-users to perform day-to-day management of such risks in a usable way, and what is stopping the vendors from improving such support. We interviewed 13 experts in the field of IoT and identified three main categories of barriers to making IoT products usably secure: technical, legal and organisational.

In diagnostic imaging, the afflicted population showed pathognomonic findings of pneumonia. What started out as an epidemic in China, rapidly spread across geographical locations with a significant daily increase in the number of affected cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, the range of worldwide mortality is 3 to 4%. Maternal adaptations and immunological changes predispose pregnant women to a prolonged and severe form of pneumonia, which results in higher rates of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is limited data about the consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy, thereby limiting the prevention, counseling, and management of these patients. The objective of this literature review is to explore pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19, complications, morbidity, and mortality in this sub-population. We conducted a literature review pertaining to COVID-19 and pregnancy in databases such as: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The studies we chose to focus on were systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports. Twenty four articles were reviewed regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy, complications and their outcomes. Due to immunological changes during pregnancy as evidenced by the flaring of auto-immune diseases; pregnant women may be at an increased risk for infection. Women (19.7%) who had underlying comorbidities such as gestational DM, HTN, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disease, COPD, or HBV infection were considered high risk. The most common maternal outcomes were premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and pre-eclampsia. Asthma was the most common comorbidity associated with maternal mortality. The most common neonatal complications were fetal distress leading to NICU admissions and preterm birth <37 weeks. The most common laboratory changes were elevated CRP and lymphocytopenia. Most patients underwent C-section due to their underlying comorbidities. Pregnant and lactating women did not shed viral particles through their vaginal mucus and milk, as evidenced by negative nucleic-acid tests of these secretions. Neonatal infections as demonstrated by positive RT-PCR were rare, but direct evidence supporting intrauterine transmission was not confirmed. Direct evidence indicating vertical transmission of COVID-19 is not available, but risk for transmission cannot be ruled out. Pregnant women should be closely monitored due to increased risk of adverse outcomes.","Vijayan, Rupalakshmi; Moon, Hanna; Joseph, Jasmine; Zaidi, Madiha; Kamwal, Chhaya; Senatus, Andrelle; Nagpal, Shavy; Diaz, Miguel",,152,23

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment. METHODS: Embase and MEDLINE were comprehensively searched for original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis. Participant demographics and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients. RESULTS: Women accounted for a significantly larger number of cases of psoriasis compared with men and unreported sex (14 [77.8%] vs 2 [11.1%] vs 2 [11.1%], respectively). In addition, 50% (n = 9) of the patients did not have a history of psoriasis before taking HCQ. Of the 18 patients, 9 (50.0%) experienced de novo psoriasis, 5 (27.8%) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms, and 4 (22.2%) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration. CONCLUSION: HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis. Monitoring for adverse effects of HCQ treatment is necessary, and clinical trials are essential in characterizing the safety profile of HCQ use in patients with a COVID-19 infection.","Sachdeva, Muskaan; Mufti, Asfandyar; Maliyar, Khalad; Lytvyn, Yuliya; Yeung, Jensen",J Am Acad Dermatol,152,8

It will no longer be possible to cram the humblest into cramped areas, but priority must be given to prevention (certainly with physical barriers, hydro-alcoholic gel, face masks), biological diagnosis, isolation, and also the care of any infected person. COVID-19 has hit the most vulnerable first in terms of biological inequality, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Those with AD can have sensorial deficits and perception troubles, including visual difficulties and the inability to recognize faces and emotions. Face masks and physical distancing can disrupt facial familiarity and make it more difficult to recognize emotional facial expressions. It can provoke distress, which the visitor can perceive and feel obligated to take off the face mask. This gesture should not be considered as an act of indiscipline, but an act of empathy. Transparent face masks could improve the suffering of AD patients, distraught in the presence of their loved ones whose masks hide their faces. Wearing a mask should not be due to fear of punishment, but as an understanding of the responsibility of each individual in the control of the current pandemic. It may be necessary to convince more citizens of this civic duty, using clear and attractive messaging in order to standardize the wearing of face masks for the general public and to adapt them to the needs of patients.","Gil, Roger; Arroyo-Anlló, Eva M",J. alzheimers dis,152,29

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also raised concerns among patients with inflammatory rheumatic conditions and their treating physicians. There are emerging data regarding the potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 for this particular patient group. However, less is known with regard to the course of COVID-19 among patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors. The aim of the current article is to review the growing body of knowledge on the course/management of COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases by presenting a SARS-CoV-2 infected case with ankylosing spondylitis under secukinumab therapy. A 61-year old patient with ankylosing spondylitis who was on secukinumab therapy for 5 months admitted with newly onset fever and gastrointestinal complaints. After being hospitalized, she developed respiratory manifestations with focal pulmonary ground-glass opacities and multiple nodular densities in both lungs. The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Substantial clinical improvement was obtained following a management plan, which included tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and enoxaparin sodium. PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched by using relevant keywords and their combinations. The literature search revealed four articles reporting the clinical course of COVID-19 in seven rheumatic patients on secukinumab. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in most of these patients, while one of them experienced severe COVID-19. Interleukin-17 has been related to the hyperinflammatory state in COVID-19 and IL-17 inhibitors were presented as promising targets for the prevention of aberrant inflammation and acute respiratory distress in COVID-19. However, this hypothesis still remains to be proved. Further studies are warranted in order to test the benefits and risks of IL-inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","Coskun Benlidayi, Ilke; Kurtaran, Behice; Tirasci, Emre; Guzel, Rengin",Rheumatol Int,152,11

Using the big data of online public sentiment during the COVID-19 period, this paper analyzes and establishes a cross-validation based public sentiment system dynamics model which can simulate the evolution processes of public sentiment under the effects of individual behaviors and governmental guidance measures. A concrete case of a violation of relevant regulations during COVID-19 epidemic that sparked public sentiment in China is introduced as a study sample to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. By running the model, the results show that an increase in government responsiveness contributes to the spread of positive social sentiment but also promotes negative sentiment. Positive individual behavior suppresses negative emotions while promoting the spread of positive emotions. Changes in the disaster context (epidemic) have an impact on the spread of sentiment, but the effect is mediocre.","Huang, Hainan; Chen, Weifan; Xie, Tian; Wei, Yaoyao; Feng, Ziqing; Wu, Weijiong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,24

To better uncover the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy consumption, this research compared pandemic-free scenarios with actual (with COVID-19) energy consumption in 2020, rather than comparing energy consumption between 2020 and 2019 in the existing studies. The simulation approach used for scenario simulation is developed by combing the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and back propagation neural network (BP). In the proposed ARIMAR-BP approach, BP is used to correct the error of ARMIA simulation, and then develop a new simulation approach so as to reduce the error of simulation. The results of the model testing show that the simulation error of the developed model is much lower than that of the BP or ARIMA simulation. This study runs China's electricity consumption from 2015 to 2019 on the proposed ARIMAR-BP approach, and produces the simulated value of China's electricity consumption from January to August 2020, which is China's electricity consumption under the pandemic-free scenario. Compared with China's electricity consumption under the pandemic-free scenario, China's actual electricity consumption dropped by an average of 29% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is much larger than the decline rate derived from year-to-year comparison. In addition, the results of the correlation analysis show the simulated decline in electricity consumption is only positively correlated with the number of new cases of COVID-19 in January–March, when the COVID-19 outbreak in China. This research provides a novel research structure for a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the pandemic on energy consumption.","Wang, Qiang Li Shuyu Jiang Feng",Journal of Cleaner Production,152,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinic-demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and high-sensitivity troponin I were extracted from the electronic database. Mortality and other clinical complications, including respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury were recorded. Myocardial injury was defined as having a serum troponin I value >19.8 ng/mL. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression to determine survival times and independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients were included. Seventy-seven patients (23.8%) had acute myocardial injury. The primary outcome measure, namely death, occurred in 54.5% and 3.2% of the patients with and without myocardial injury, respectively. Notably, 75.3% of the patients with myocardial injury and 6.5% of the patients without myocardial injury developed ARDS. Overall, 50 out of 324 patients (15.4%) died during the study period. The mortality rate was 54.5% in patients with myocardial injury and 3.2% in patients without myocardial injury. Mean survival times were significantly different between the groups (15.1±0.9 days in patients with myocardial injury and 24.4±0.7 days in patients without myocardial injury, log-rank test p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of chronic kidney disease and application of invasive mechanical ventilation were found to be independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. The presence of acute myocardial injury was common but not independently associated with mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Karahan, S; Katkat, F; Ozcan, S; Sahin, I; Okuyan, E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,152,1

Urologists in training who are already known to have burnout, are in the front line to face this disease. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young French urologists in training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire evaluating the pandemic added stress, and its negative impact on work and training quality, was e-mailed to the members of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF). The association includes all French junior and senior residents. The survey lasted 3 days. Multivariable analyses using logistic regression was performed to identify the predictive factors. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five (55.5%) of the 495 AFUF members responded to the questionnaire. More than 90% of responders felt more stressed by the pandemic. Fellows and senior residents were more likely to feel that the crisis had an important impact on their work quality (OR=1.76, IC95=[1.01-3.13]), even more when COVID 19 patients were present in their department (OR=2.31, IC95=[1.20-4.65]). Past medical history of respiratory disease (OR=2.57, IC95=[1.31-5.98]) and taking in charge COVID19 patients (OR=1.85, IC95=[0.98-3.59]) were additional risk factors.

Chi-square tests of independence were performed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority subgroups. Marginalized populations experienced significant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations reported significant difficulties accessing food and supplies (p = 0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (p = 0.013), medical services (p = 0.001), and use of telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.001).

No specific therapy for COVID-19 is not currently available, and urgent treatment solutions are needed. Recent studies have found several potential molecular targets, and one of the most critical proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus work machine is the Papain-like protease (Plpro). Potential inhibitors are available, and their X-ray crystallographic structures in complex with this enzyme have been determined recently. However, their activities against this enzyme are insufficient and need to be characterized and improved to be of clinical values. Therefore, in this work, by utilizing the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) simulation method, we achieved multiple unbinding events of Plpro inhibitors, GRL0617, and its derivates, and captured and understood the details of the unbinding pathway. We found that residues of the BL2 loop, such as Tyr268 and Gln269, play major roles in the unbinding pathways, but the most important contributing factor is the natural movements and behavior of the BL2 loop, which can control the entire process. We believe that the details found in this study can be used to refine and optimize potential inhibitors like GRL0617 and design more efficacious inhibitors as a treatment for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Sohraby, Farzin; Aryapour, Hassan",PLoS One,152,24

PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection (89.9%), and a source of risk (74.7%) and concern (71.5%) to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks (91.1%) and the need to care for COVID-19 patients (85.4%). Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high (75.9 to 89.9%). PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs continue to serve willingly on the frontlines of this pandemic despite the high perception of risk to themselves and loved ones. Healthcare organizations should continue to support PCPs by managing both their psychosocial (e.g. stress management) and professional (e.g. pandemic preparedness) needs.","Lau, Jerrald; Tan, David Hsien-Yung; Wong, Gretel Jianlin; Lew, Yii-Jen; Chua, Ying-Xian; Low, Lian-Leng; Ho, Han-Kwee; Kwek, Thiam-Soo; Toh, Sue-Anne Ee-Shiow; Tan, Ker-Kan",BMC Fam Pract,152,20

We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between SVD and in vivo neuroinflammation using [11C]PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. METHODS: Forty-two participants were recruited (according to NIA-AA guidelines, 14 healthy controls, 14 mild Alzheimer's disease, 14 amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment). Neuroinflammation was assessed using [11C]PK11195 PET imaging, a marker of microglial activation. To quantify SVD, we assessed white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds and lacunes. Composite scores were calculated for global SVD burden, and SVD subtypes of hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). General linear models examined associations between SVD and [11C]PK11195, adjusting for sex, age, education, cognition, scan interval, and corrected for multiple comparisons via false discovery rate (FDR). Dominance analysis directly compared the relative importance of hypertensive arteriopathy and CAA scores as predictors of [11C]PK11195. RESULTS: Global [11C]PK11195 binding was associated with SVD markers, particularly in regions typical of hypertensive arteriopathy: deep microbleeds (ß=0.63, F(1,35)=35.24, p<0.001), deep WMH (ß=0.59, t=4.91, p<0.001). In dominance analysis, hypertensive arteriopathy score outperformed CAA in predicting [11C]PK11195 binding globally and in 28 out of 37 regions of interest, especially the medial temporal lobe (ß=0.66-0.76, t=3.90-5.58, FDR-corrected p (pFDR)=<0.001-0.002) and orbitofrontal cortex (ß=0.51-0.57, t=3.53-4.30, pFDR=0.001-0.004). CONCLUSION: Microglial activation is associated with SVD, particularly with the hypertensive arteriopathy subtype of SVD. Although further research is needed to determine causality, our study suggests that targeting neuroinflammation might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for SVD.","Low, Audrey; Mak, Elijah; Malpetti, Maura; Passamonti, Luca; Nicastro, Nicolas; Stefaniak, James D; Savulich, George; Chouliaras, Leonidas; Su, Li; Rowe, James B; Markus, Hugh S; O039,; Brien, John T",,152,23

We report our proof-of-concept experience in a COVID-19 intensive care unit. RESULTS: All nine patients required mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids. During the protocol, 75.7% of sensor values were within 20% of the reference POC glucose with an associated average reduction in POC of 63%. Mean time in range (70-180 mg/dL) was 71.4 ± 13.9%.

T cells play a critical role in the cellular immune response against viral infections. We aimed to reveal the relationship between T cell subsets and disease severity. METHODS: 40 COVID-19 patients were randomly recruited in this cross-sectional study. All cases were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Patients were divided into two equivalent groups, one severe and one nonsevere. Clinical, laboratory and flow cytometric data were obtained from both clinical groups and compared. RESULTS: Lymphocyte subsets, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, memory CD4+ T cells, memory CD8+ T cells, naive CD4+ T cells, effector memory CD4+ T cells, central memory CD4+ T cells, and CD3+CD4+ CD25+ T cells were significantly lower in severe patients. The naive T cell/CD4 + EM T cell ratio, which is an indicator of the differentiation from naive T cells to memory cells, was relatively reduced in severe disease. Peripheral CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells were notably lower in severe presentations of the disease (median DP T cells 11.12 µL vs 1.95 µL; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As disease severity increases in COVID-19 infection, the number of T cell subsets decreases significantly. Suppression of differentiation from naive T cells to effector memory T cells is the result of severe impairment in adaptive immune functions. Peripheral CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells were significantly reduced in severe disease presentations and may be a useful marker to predict disease severity.","Kalpakci, Yasin; Hacibekiroglu, Tuba; Trak, Gulay; Karacaer, Cengiz; Demirci, Taner; Kocayigit, Havva; Sunu, Cenk; Varim, Ceyhun; Falay, Mesude",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),152,16

However, nearly no empirical studies or reports have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of those measures. Aim: This study aimed at examining the effectiveness of business response measures to COVID-19 impact on business outcome. Setting: This study focused on businesses that are value-added tax (VAT) registered. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was used. The authors applied logistic regression technique to analyse the effectiveness of business response measures on business outcome. Results: The authors found evidence that business responses such as virtual connection, innovative e-commerce and increasing working hours are more effective business responses, whilst decreasing work hours, laying off workers temporarily and ordinary e-commerce are less effective measures against the impact of the outbreak. Furthermore, business characteristics such as industry type (e.g. ‘agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing’ and ‘electricity, gas and water supply’) are more resilient to COVID-19 shock, whilst pure export market and small businesses, secondary and tertiary, are significantly less resilient. Conclusions: Firstly, the study shows that some business responses are more effective in remediating the adverse impact of COVID-19 and therefore recommends policy intervention and industrial actions to promote them. Secondly, it is also recommended that financial bailout and/or Internet infrastructure and domestic support for small and export businesses could make them more resilient to the adverse impact of the outbreak.","Anakpo, Godfred Mishi Syden",The Southern African Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management,152,21

We have previously generated a transgenic mouse model that allows diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of Six2-positive nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Elimination of existing native host NPCs enables their replacement with donor NPCs, which can generate neo-nephrons. However, this system cannot be applied to human NPCs, because DT induces apoptosis in human cells. Therefore, the present study presents a transgenic mouse model for the ablation of NPCs using tamoxifen, which does not affect human cells. Using this system, we successfully regenerate interspecies neo-nephrons, which exhibit urine-producing abilities, from transplanted rat NPCs in a mouse host. Transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs results in differentiation into renal vesicles, which connect to the ureteric bud of the host. Thus, we demonstrate the possibility of the regeneration of human kidneys derived from human iPSC-derived NPCs via NPC replacement.","Fujimoto, Toshinari; Yamanaka, Shuichiro; Tajiri, Susumu; Takamura, Tsuyoshi; Saito, Yatsumu; Matsumoto, Naoto; Matsumoto, Kei; Tachibana, Toshiaki; Okano, Hirotaka James; Yokoo, Takashi",Cell Rep,152,1

Whether a positive test is associated with a high viral RNA load, specific viral variant, recovery of infectious virus, or symptomatic infection is largely not known. MethodsIn this study, we identified 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who had received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines, the 2nd of which was received between January and April of 2021. The positive samples were collected between January and May of 2021 with a time that extended from 2 to 100 days after the second dose. Samples were sequenced to characterize the whole genome and Spike protein changes and cycle thresholds that reflect viral loads were determined using a single molecular assay. Local SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were examined using ELISA and specimens were grown on cell culture to assess the recovery of infectious virus as compared to a control unvaccinated cohort from a matched time frame. ResultsOf 133 specimens, 24 failed sequencing and yielded a negative or very low viral load on the repeat PCR. Of 109 specimens that were used for further genome analysis, 68 (62.4%) were from symptomatic infections, 11 (10.1%) were admitted for COVID-19, and 2 (1.8%) required ICU admission with no associated mortality. The predominant virus variant was the alpha (B.1.1.7), however a significant association between lineage B.1.526 and amino acid change S: E484K with positives after vaccination was noted when genomes were compared to a large control cohort from a matched time frame. A significant reduction of the recovery of infectious virus on cell culture as well as delayed time to the first appearance of cytopathic effect was accompanied by an increase in local IgG levels in respiratory samples of vaccinated individuals but upper respiratory tract IgG levels were not different between symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. ConclusionsVaccination reduces the recovery of infectious virus in breakthrough infections accompanied by an increase in upper respiratory tract local immune responses.

Long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals are vital in the care of CCI patients, but their role for patients post COVID-19 infection is not known. Barlow Respiratory Hospital (BRH) is a 105-bed, LTAC hospital network serving ventilator-dependent and medically-complex patients transferred from the ICUs of hospitals in southern California. We report patient characteristics of our first series of COVID-19 survivors admitted to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Methods: Single-center observational descriptive report of patients recovering from acute infectious complications of COVID-19 pneumonia requiring long-term respiratory support. Results: From 28 April to 7 September 2020, 41 patients were admitted to BRH for continued recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. Median age: 68 [44-94] years, 25/41 (61%) male, 33/41 (80.5%) with tracheostomy, 21/41 (51.2%) on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9/41 (22%) receiving hemodialysis. All mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis interventions were initiated at the transferring hospital. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize CCI and medically complex COVID-19 patients transferred to the post-acute venue of an LTAC hospital. Patients on average spent over six weeks in the transferring hospital mostly in the ICU, are largely elderly, carry the known risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and experienced respiratory failure necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy. Our findings suggest that these patients will continue to require considerable medical interventions and treatments, including weaning from mechanical ventilation, owing to the numerous sequelae of the infection and the burden of acute-on-chronic diseases. As ICU survival rates improve, this research further emphasizes the important role of the LTAC hospital in responding to the COVID-19 crisis. © 2021 Hassenpflug MS et al.","Hassenpflug, M.

Machine learning is used to predict which students are at risk of failing a national certifying exam. Predictions are made well in advance of the exam, such that educators can meaningfully intervene before students take the exam. Methods: Using already-collected, first-year student assessment data from four cohorts in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, the authors implement an""adaptive minimum match""version of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (AMMKNN), using changing numbers of neighbors to predict each student's future exam scores on the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE). Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the practical capabilities of this model, before making predictions for new students. Results: The best predictive model has an accuracy of 93%, sensitivity of 69%, and specificity of 94%. It generates a predicted PANCE score for each student, one year before they are scheduled to take the exam. Students can then be prospectively categorized into groups that need extra support, optional extra support, or no extra support. The educator then has one year to provide the appropriate customized support to each type of student. Conclusions: Predictive analytics can help health professions educators allocate scarce time and resources across their students.

Chinese health authorities, as a response to the lack of an effective therapeutic strategy, started to investigate the use of lopinavir and ritonavir, previously optimized for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS viral infection. Despite the clinical use of these two drugs, no information regarding their possible mechanism of action at the molecular level is still known for SARS-CoV-2. Very recently, the crystallographic structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also known as C30 Endopeptidase, was published. Starting from this essential structural information, in the present work we have exploited supervised molecular dynamics, an emerging computational technique that allows investigating at an atomic level the recognition process of a ligand from its unbound to the final bound state. In this research, we provided molecular insight on the whole recognition pathway of Lopinavir, Ritonavir, and Nelfinavir, three potential C30 Endopeptidase inhibitors, with the last one taken into consideration due to the promising in-vitro activity shown against the structurally related SARS-CoV protease.","Bolcato, Giovanni; Bissaro, Maicol; Pavan, Matteo; Sturlese, Mattia; Moro, Stefano",Sci Rep,152,20

METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. An increase in telehealth consultations with specialists was reported in the survey but migraine patients preferred face-to-face consultations.","Haghdoost, Faraidoon; Carcel, Cheryl; Chandrasekhar, Deepak; Rodgers, Anthony; Delcourt, Candice",J. neurol,152,1

Fear and stigma related to infection, mistrust between officials and the population, the often-asymptomatic nature of the disease is likely to lead to under-reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection in a large slum in South India 3 months after the index case and recruited 499 adults (age >18 years). The majority (74.3%) were females and about one-third of the population reported comorbidities. The overall seroprevalence of IgG antibody for COVID-19 was 57.9% (95% CI 53.4-62.3). Age, education, occupation and the presence of reported comorbidities were not associated with seroprevalence (P-value >0.05). Case-to-undetected-infections ratio was 1:195 and infection fatality rate was calculated as 2.94 per 10 000 infections. We estimated seroprevalence of COVID-19 was very high in our study population. The focus in this slum should shift from infection prevention to managing the indirect consequences of the pandemic. We recommend seroprevalence studies in such settings before vaccination to identify the vulnerability of COVID-19 infection to optimise the use of insufficient resources. It is a wake-up call to societies and nations, to dedicate paramount attention to slums into recovery and beyond - to build, restore and maintain health equity for the 'Health and wellbeing of all'.","George, Carolin Elizabeth; Inbaraj, Leeberk Raja; Chandrasingh, Sindhulina; de Witte, L P",Epidemiol Infect,152,27

Due to the limited detection facilities, especially in developing countries, a large number of suspected cases can only receive common clinical diagnosis rather than more effective detections like Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests or CT scans. This motivates us to develop a quick screening method via common clinical diagnosis results. However, the diagnostic items of different patients may vary greatly, and there is a huge variation in the dimension of the diagnosis data among different suspected patients, it is hard to process these indefinite dimension data via classical classification algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose an Indefiniteness Elimination Network (IE-Net) to eliminate the influence of the varied dimensions and make predictions about the COVID-19 cases. The IE-Net is in an encoder-decoder framework fashion, and an indefiniteness elimination operation is proposed to transfer the indefinite dimension feature into a fixed dimension feature. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on the public available COVID-19 Clinical Spectrum dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed indefiniteness elimination operation greatly improves the classification performance, the IE-Net achieves 94.80% accuracy, 92.79% recall, 92.97% precision and 94.93% AUC for distinguishing COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with only common clinical diagnose data. We further compared our methods with 3 classical classification algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). To explore each clinical test item's specificity, we further analyzed the possible relationship between each clinical test item and COVID-19.","Guo, Guangyu; Liu, Zhuoyan; Zhao, Shijie; Guo, Lei; Liu, Tianming",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,152,25

We analyzed responses to ClinicalTrials.gov fields regarding intent to share individual participant level data and analyzed the data sharing statements in eligible publications. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-four trial registrations were analyzed. 15.7% were willing to share, of which 38.6% were willing to share immediately upon publication of results. 47.6% declared they were not willing to share. Twenty-eight publications were analyzed representing 26 unique COVID-19 trials. Only seven publications contained data sharing statements; six indicated a willingness to share data whereas one indicated that data was not available for sharing.

To do so, we compared the energy consumption measured in a 40-dwelling social housing building located in Quebec City (Canada) during four months of lockdown to those of the months that preceded the lockdown It is found that consumption patterns for electricity and hot water changed for the first two months of the lockdown, when the most intensive lockdown measures were applied Overall consumption slightly increased for these two energy expenditures, but the more important change was that consumption occurred throughout the day instead of being concentrated in the evening as observed before the lockdown Results shed light on the impact of lockdown on energy bills for consumers and on how energy utilities might be solicited during this kind of episode","Rouleau, Jean Gosselin Louis",Applied Energy,152,16

Methods: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R0 in Germany. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on the course of the pandemic. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses. Results: Efficacy and compliance estimates for the three most effective NPIs were as follows: test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%. Applying all NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A combination of four NPIs at consented compliance rates might curb the CoViD-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach can support SARS-CoV-2 modelling. Future curbing scenarios require a combination of NPIs. A Delphi-panel-based NPI assessment and modelling might support public health policy decision making by informing sequence and number of needed public health measures.

RT-qPCR tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, are ideal in a hospital environment. However, mass testing requires cheaper and simpler tests, especially in settings that lack sophisticated machinery. The most common current diagnostic method is based on nasopharyngeal sample collection, RNA extraction, and RT-qPCR for amplification and detection of viral nucleic acids. Here, we show that samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs in VTM and in saliva can be used with or without RNA purification in an isothermal loop-mediated amplification (LAMP)-based assay, with 60-93% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection as compared to standard RT-qPCR tests. A series of simple modifications to standard RT-LAMP published methods to stabilize pH fluctuations due to salivary acidity resulted in a significant improvement in reliability, opening new avenues for efficient, low-cost testing of COVID-19 infection.","Uribe-Alvarez, Cristina; Lam, Quynh; Baldwin, Don A; Chernoff, Jonathan",PLoS One,152,10

Bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC, has been demonstrated to be involved in the susceptibility to parasite infections. However, few studies have analyzed this connection in more depth. The aim of this study was to determine if early BPA exposure in female mice affects the systemic immune response and the susceptibility to T. crassiceps infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: BALB/cice were exposed to BPA at postnatal day 3. At 6 weeks of age, they were inoculated with T. crassiceps larvae, and 2 weeks later, were euthanized. The number of parasites was quantified. By flow cytometry, in the spleen, the peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, the different innate and adaptive immune cell modulation was analyzed, and RT-PCR cytokine expression was also evaluated. BPA induced a reduction of 40% in parasite load. BPA treatment modulated some lineages of the innate immune response and caused slight changes in cells belonging to the adaptive immune response. Additionally, BPA enhanced the type 2 cytokine profile. CONCLUSION: Neonatal BPA treatment in female mice affects not only the percentage of different immune cells but also theirex vivo cytokine gene expression., decreasing T. crassiceps cysticercosis susceptibility.","Nava-Castro, Karen Elizabeth; Togno-Peirce, Cristian; Palacios-Arreola, Margarita Isabel; Del Río-Araiza, Víctor Hugo; Hernández-Bello, Romel; Morales Montor, Jorge",Parasite Immunol,152,1

However, only a few works focus on AI-based lung ultrasound (LUS) analysis in spite of its significant role in COVID-19. In this work, we aim to propose a novel method for severity assessment of COVID-19 patients from LUS and clinical information. Great challenges exist regarding the heterogeneous data, multi-modality information, and highly nonlinear mapping. To overcome these challenges, we first propose a dual-level supervised multiple instance learning module (DSA-MIL) to effectively combine the zone-level representations into patient-level representations. Then a novel modality alignment contrastive learning module (MA-CLR) is presented to combine representations of the two modalities, LUS and clinical information, by matching the two spaces while keeping the discriminative features. To train the nonlinear mapping, a staged representation transfer (SRT) strategy is introduced to maximumly leverage the semantic and discriminative information from the training data. We trained the model with LUS data of 233 patients, and validated it with 80 patients. Our method can effectively combine the two modalities and achieve accuracy of 75.0% for 4-level patient severity assessment, and 87.5% for the binary severe/non-severe identification. Besides, our method also provides interpretation of the severity assessment by grading each of the lung zone (with accuracy of 85.28%) and identifying the pathological patterns of each lung zone. Our method has a great potential in real clinical practice for COVID-19 patients, especially for pregnant women and children, in aspects of progress monitoring, prognosis stratification, and patient management.","Xue, Wufeng; Cao, Chunyan; Liu, Jie; Duan, Yilian; Cao, Haiyan; Wang, Jian; Tao, Xumin; Chen, Zejian; Wu, Meng; Zhang, Jinxiang; Sun, Hui; Jin, Yang; Yang, Xin; Huang, Ruobing; Xiang, Feixiang; Song, Yue; You, Manjie; Zhang, Wen; Jiang, Lili; Zhang, Ziming; Kong, Shuangshuang; Tian, Ying; Zhang, Li; Ni, Dong; Xie, Mingxing",Med Image Anal,152,16

We conducted this retrospective cohort study with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020 to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. The study identified morbidity and mortality risk factors on the 28th day of the disease course. The majority of the patients were male (64.1%) and belonged to the age group 25-39 years (39.4%). Urban patients were higher in proportion than rural (69.3% vs. 30.7%). Major comorbidities included 35.0% diabetes mellitus (DM), 28.4% hypertension (HTN), 16.6% chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 7.8% coronary heart disease (CHD). The morbidity rate (not-cured) was 6.0%, and the mortality rate (non-survivor) was 2.5%. Morbidity risk factors included elderly (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.31-4.99), having comorbidity (AOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.83-2.47), and smokeless tobacco use (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 0.84-5.61). The morbidity risk was higher with COPD (RR = 2.68), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR = 3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR = 3.99).

Because hospitals were still burdened with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, it was focal to design a separate ""clean path"" for the surgical candidates and determine the possible effects of major surgery on previously infected patients. METHODS: From May to July 2020 (postpandemic peak), 259 consecutive patients were scheduled for elective cardiac surgery in three different centers. Our original roadmap with four screening steps included: a short item questionnaire (STEP-1), nasopharyngeal swab (NP) (STEP-2), computed tomography (CT)-scan using COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scoring (STEP-3), and final NP swab before discharge (STEP-4). RESULTS: Two patients (0.8%) resulted positive at STEP-2: one patient was discharged home for quarantine, the other performed a CT-scan (CO-RADS: <2), and underwent surgery for unstable angina. Chest-CT was positive in 6.3% (15/237) with mean CO-RADS of 2.93 ± 0.8. Mild-moderate lung inflammation (CO-RADS: 2-4) did not delay surgery. Perioperative mortality was 1.15% (3/259), and cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications was 14.6%. At multivariable analysis, only age and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were independently related to pulmonary complications composite outcome (age >75 years: odds ratio [OR]: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-5.57; p = 0.011; CPB >90 min. OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.84-10.16; p = 0.001). At 30 days, no periprocedural contagion and rehospitalization for COVID-19 infections were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our structured roadmap supports the safe restarting of an elective cardiac surgery list after a peak of a still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in an epicenter area. Mild to moderate CT residuals of coronavirus pneumonia do not justify elective cardiac surgery procrastination.","Rosati, Fabrizio; Muneretto, Claudio; Baudo, Massimo; D039,; Ancona, Giuseppe; Bichi, Samuele; Merlo, Maurizio; Cuko, Besart; Gerometta, Piersilvio; Grazioli, Valentina; Giroletti, Laura; Di Bacco, Lorenzo; Repossini, Alberto; Benussi, Stefano",J Card Surg,152,16

For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the spike (S) protein is the main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of the S protein exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates the process of membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role in fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FPs share a high sequence homology, and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by screening a mutant array in which E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP were substituted with neutrally charged alanines (A). Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested their ability to mediate pseudoparticle (PP) infection of host cells in modulating Ca2+ environments. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV wild-type (WT) PP infection by approximately 2-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry showed an approximate 1:1 MERS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, as opposed to an 1:2 SARS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, suggesting significant differences in FP Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a major emerging infectious disease with zoonotic potential and has reservoirs in dromedary camels and bats. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans, with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. In order to develop novel drugs and vaccines, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable the virus to infect host cells. Our data have found that calcium is an important regulator of viral fusion by interacting with negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV FP region. This information can guide therapeutic solutions to block this calcium interaction and also repurpose already approved drugs for this use for a fast response to MERS-CoV outbreaks.","Straus, Marco R; Tang, Tiffany; Lai, Alex L; Flegel, Annkatrin; Bidon, Miya; Freed, Jack H; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R",J. virol,152,16

However, this tracer shows inadequate blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and, therefore, would be limited for accurate quantification of reporter gene expression in the brain. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of 9-(4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl)-2(phenylthio)-6-oxopurine ([18F]FHBT) as a new PET tracer for imaging reporter gene expression of HSV1-tk and its mutant HSV1-sr39tk, with the aim of improved BBB penetration. PROCEDURES: [18F]FHBT was prepared by using a tosylate precursor and [18F]KF. The cellular uptake of [18F]FHBT was performed in HSV1-sr39tk-positive (+) or HSV1-sr39tk-negative (-) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The specificity of [18F]FHBT to assess HSV1-sr39tk expression was evaluated by in vitro blocking studies using 1 mM of ganciclovir (GCV). Penetration of [18F]FHBT and [18F]FHBG across the BBB was assessed by dynamic PET imaging studies in normal mice. RESULTS: The tosylate precursor reacted with [18F]KF using Kryptofix2.2.2 followed by deprotection to give [18F]FHBT in 10 % radiochemical yield (decay-corrected). The uptake of [18F]FHBT in HSV1-sr39tk (+) cells was significantly higher than that of HSV1-sr39tk (-) cells. In the presence of GCV (1 mM), the uptake of [18F]FHBT was significantly decreased, indicating that [18F]FHBT serves as a selective substrate of HSV1-sr39TK. PET images and time-activity curves of [18F]FHBT in the brain regions showed similar initial brain uptakes (~ 12.75 min) as [18F]FHBG (P > 0.855). Slower washout of [18F]FHBT was observed at the later time points (17.75 - 57.75 min, P > 0.207). CONCLUSIONS: Although [18F]FHBT showed no statistically significant improvement of BBB permeability compared with [18F]FHBG, we have demonstrated that the 2-(phenylthio)-6-oxopurine backbone can serve as a novel scaffold for developing HSV1-tk/HSV1-sr39tk reporter gene imaging agents for additional research in the future.","Fuchigami, Takeshi; Haywood, Tom; Gowrishankar, Gayatri; Anders, David; Namavari, Mohammad; Wardak, Mirwais; Gambhir, Sanjiv Sam",Mol. imaging biol,152,24

Since last year many molecular products are available for COVID-19 diagnostics., some of these diagnostics have become commercially available for healthcare workers and clinical laboratories. However, the diagnostic technologies have specific limitations and reported several false-positive and false-negative cases, especially during the early stages of kit development and use. The current article addresses these and other relevant questions important to the medical microbiologists running or aspiring to run COVID diagnostic services using PCR and related technologies. METHODS: In this Systematic Review we follow Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA). A total of 258 citations retrieved, among those 77 peer reviewed articles was assessed for eligibility, and 181 studies were excluded. Based on inclusion criteria final data extraction was done. RESULTS: The question of diagnostic dilemma has also been addressed in view of discordant results between assays, inter-test variability, repeat testing requirements in specific settings and inconclusive or indeterminate results. Kit efficiency was satisfactory for all assays and the estimates varied within sample types and technology. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona) viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude SARS CoV-2 related molecular assays differed considerably in performance. Hence we need to understand importance of molecular diagnostics test interpretation in light of the latest pandemic virus.","Das, Parijat; Mondal, Sudipto; Pal, Soumik; Roy, Samadrita; Vidyadharan, Anju; Dadwal, Rajneesh; Bhattacharya, Sanjay; Mishra, Deepak Kumar; Chandy, Mammen",Indian J Med Microbiol,152,24

Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1ß, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1ß and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1ß than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1ß and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1ß blockade in treatment of COVID-19. However, the source of the high levels of IL-6 remains to be determined.","Kahn, Robin; Schmidt, Tobias; Golestani, Karan; Mossberg, Anki; Gullstrand, Birgitta; Bengtsson, Anders A; Kahn, Fredrik",J Leukoc Biol,152,26

Within a short span, COVID-19 was declared a global public health emergency affecting 214 countries with 5,939,234 confirmed cases and 3,67,255 deaths as of 30 May, 2020. With limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date. AREAS COVERED: We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, healthcare professionals and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction and aggressive steps such as 'lockdown'. Clinical trials at different phases are ongoing across different countries to expedite development of effective drugs and vaccine to overcome the pandemic.","Hussain, Arafat; Yadav, Suniti; Hadda, Vijay; Suri, Tejas M; Tiwari, Pawan; Mittal, Saurabh; Madan, Karan; Mohan, Anant",,152,22

This paper aims to study the influencing factors of people's fear of missing out (FOMO) toward personal ICT use and its further impact on life satisfaction during the pandemic. A sample consisting of 318 participants was obtained by an online survey in China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. The results suggested that people's anxiety and boredom brought by the pandemic are positively correlated with their FOMO. People with higher FOMO used personal ICTs more frequently for both social and process purposes. Furthermore, the social use of ICTs promoted people's life satisfaction, while the process use of ICTs had no significant effect on life satisfaction. Several theoretical and practical implications were discussed based on the results.","Song, Xiaokang Song Shijie Zhao Yuxiang Chris Min Hua Zhu Qinghua",Journal of Database Management,152,16

In response, most countries in the world implemented lockdowns, restricting their population's movements, work, education, gatherings, and general activities in attempt to ""flatten the curve"" of COVID-19 cases. The public health goal of lockdowns was to save the population from COVID-19 cases and deaths, and to prevent overwhelming health care systems with COVID-19 patients. In this narrative review I explain why I changed my mind about supporting lockdowns. The initial modeling predictions induced fear and crowd-effects (i.e., groupthink). Over time, important information emerged relevant to the modeling, including the lower infection fatality rate (median 0.23%), clarification of high-risk groups (specifically, those 70 years of age and older), lower herd immunity thresholds (likely 20-40% population immunity), and the difficult exit strategies. In addition, information emerged on significant collateral damage due to the response to the pandemic, adversely affecting many millions of people with poverty, food insecurity, loneliness, unemployment, school closures, and interrupted healthcare. Raw numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths were difficult to interpret, and may be tempered by information placing the number of COVID-19 deaths in proper context and perspective relative to background rates. Considering this information, a cost-benefit analysis of the response to COVID-19 finds that lockdowns are far more harmful to public health (at least 5-10 times so in terms of wellbeing years) than COVID-19 can be. Controversies and objections about the main points made are considered and addressed. Progress in the response to COVID-19 depends on considering the trade-offs discussed here that determine the wellbeing of populations. I close with some suggestions for moving forward, including focused protection of those truly at high risk, opening of schools, and building back better with a economy.","Joffe, Ari R",Front Public Health,152,16

However, we argue that such approaches are suboptimal because medical datasets are largely different from ImageNet and often contain limited training samples. In this work, we propose Task Agnostic Transfer Learning (TATL), a novel framework motivated by dermatologists' behaviors in the skincare context. TATL learns an attribute-agnostic segmenter that detects lesion skin regions and then transfers this knowledge to a set of attribute-specific classifiers to detect each particular region's attributes. Since TATL's attribute-agnostic segmenter only detects abnormal skin regions, it enjoys ample data from all attributes, allows transferring knowledge among features, and compensates for the lack of training data from rare attributes. We extensively evaluate TATL on two popular skin attributes detection benchmarks and show that TATL outperforms state-of-the-art methods while enjoying minimal model and computational complexity. We also provide theoretical insights and explanations for why TATL works well in practice.","Nguyen, Duy M.

Recently, genetic screens in humans and in mouse models have identified mutations in LRP2, a multi-ligand receptor, as a novel cause of a common arterial trunk, a severe form of outflow tract (OFT) defect. Yet, the underlying mechanism why the morphogen receptor LRP2 is essential for OFT development remained unexplained. Studying LRP2-deficient mouse models, we now show that LRP2 is expressed in the cardiac progenitor niche of the anterior second heart field (SHF) that contributes to elongation of the OFT during separation into aorta and pulmonary trunk. Loss of LRP2 in mutant mice results in depletion of a pool of sonic hedgehog-dependent progenitor cells in the anterior SHF due to premature differentiation into cardiomyocytes as they migrate into the OFT myocardium. Depletion of this cardiac progenitor cell pool results in aberrant shortening of the OFT, the likely cause of CAT formation in affected mice. Our findings identified the molecular mechanism whereby LRP2 controls maintenance of progenitor cell fate in the anterior SHF essential for OFT separation, and why receptor dysfunction is a novel cause of conotruncal malformation.","Christ, Annabel; Marczenke, Maike; Willnow, Thomas E",Hum. mol. genet,152,21

African countries see slower dynamic of COVID-19 cases and deaths. One of the assumptions that may explain this later emergence in Africa, and more particularly in malaria endemic areas, would be the use of antimalarial drugs. We investigated the in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 of several antimalarial drugs. Chloroquine (EC50 = 2.1 µM and EC90 = 3.8 µM), hydroxychloroquine (EC50 = 1.5 µM and EC90 = 3.0 µM), ferroquine (EC50 = 1.5 µM and EC90 = 2.4 µM), desethylamodiaquine (EC50 = 0.52 µM and EC90 = 1.9 µM), mefloquine (EC50 = 1.8 µM and EC90 = 8.1 µM), pyronaridine (EC50 = 0.72 µM and EC90 = 0.75 µM) and quinine (EC50 = 10.7 µM and EC90 = 38.8 µM) showed in vitro antiviral effective activity with IC50 and IC90 compatible with drug oral uptake at doses commonly administered in malaria treatment. The ratio Clung/EC90 ranged from 5 to 59. Lumefantrine, piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin had IC50 and IC90 too high to be compatible with expected plasma concentrations (ratio Cmax/EC90 < 0.05). Based on our results, we would expect that countries which commonly use artesunate-amodiaquine or artesunate-mefloquine report fewer cases and deaths than those using artemether-lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. It could be necessary now to compare the antimalarial use and the dynamics of COVID-19 country by country to confirm this hypothesis.","Gendrot, Mathieu; Andreani, Julien; Boxberger, Manon; Jardot, Priscilla; Fonta, Isabelle; Le Bideau, Marion; Duflot, Isabelle; Mosnier, Joel; Rolland, Clara; Bogreau, Hervé; Hutter, Sébastien; La Scola, Bernard; Pradines, Bruno",Travel Med Infect Dis,152,20

Travel medicine practitioners were increasingly called upon to provide pre-cruise travel advice and medical clearance. Demand for these services will return at some time in the future. METHODS: The clinical conditions seen in those presenting for care on six small-vessel scientific cruises to Antarctica were analysed. RESULTS: Personnel presented on 196 occasions resulting in 257 consultations (when initial plus all follow-up consultations were included). Personnel presented with a clinical condition at a rate of 17.9 per 1000 person-days at sea. The total consultation rate was 23.5 per 1000 person-days at sea. Injury accounted for 24% of all presentations at a rate of 4.3 per 1000 person-days at sea. Dermatological, soft tissue and musculoskeletal, general malaise and motion sickness were the four most common presentations.

The aims of this study were (a) to explore the association between the mental health promotion strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak and their symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress; (b) to compare the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses; and (c) to compare the frequency of use of mental health strategies of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 821 nurses. Univariate and multivariate regression models were developed to identify potential protective factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. The chi-square test was also used to compare the use of strategies among mental health and non-mental health nurses. Portuguese nurses demonstrated high symptoms of depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety. Healthy eating, physical activity, rest between shifts, maintaining social contacts, verbalizing feelings/emotions, and spending less time searching for information about COVID-19 were associated with better mental health. Mental health nurses had less depression, anxiety, and stress, and used more strategies to promote mental health than other nurses. We consider it important to promote nurses' mental health literacy by encouraging them to develop skills and strategies aimed at improving their resilience and ability to deal with difficult situations while caring for the population.","de Pinho, Lara Guedes; Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia; Fonseca, César; Lopes, Manuel José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),152,21

However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5 H7 N2 )2 ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2 ZnBr4 ) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of ""sky blue light"" before compression to ""cool daylight"" with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next-generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid-state lighting applications.","Zhao, Dianlong; Xiao, Guanjun; Liu, Zhun; Sui, Laizhi; Yuan, Kaijun; Ma, Zhiwei; Zou, Bo",Adv Mater,152,16

Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating targeted therapies to hinder this exaggerated inflammatory response. Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have shown heterogeneous severity trajectories, suggesting that response to therapies is likely to vary across patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Are critically ill COVID-19 patients biologically and immunologically dissociable based on profiling of currently evaluated therapeutic targets? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We did a single-center, prospective study in an ICU department in France. Ninety-six critically ill adult patients admitted with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. We conducted principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering on a vast array of immunologic variables measured on the day of ICU admission. RESULTS: We found that patients were distributed in three clusters bearing distinct immunologic features and associated with different ICU outcomes. Cluster 1 had a ""humoral immunodeficiency"" phenotype with predominant B-lymphocyte defect, relative hypogammaglobulinemia, and moderate inflammation. Cluster 2 had a ""hyperinflammatory"" phenotype, with high cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFâº]) associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte defects. Cluster 3 had a ""complement-dependent"" phenotype with terminal complement activation markers (elevated C3 and sC5b-9). INTERPRETATION: Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibiting cytokine release marks, complement activation, or B-lymphocyte defects are distinct from each other. Such immunologic variability argues in favor of targeting different mediators in different groups of patients and could serve as a basis for patient identification and clinical trial eligibility.","Dupont, Thibault; Caillat-Zucman, Sophie; Fremeaux-Bacchi, Véronique; Morin, Florence; Lengliné, Etienne; Darmon, Michael; Peffault de Latour, Régis; Zafrani, Lara; Azoulay, Elie; Dumas, Guillaume",Chest,152,3

These potentially deadly infections are further exacerbated due to the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance. To combat these infections there is a need to better understand immune mechanisms that promote microbial clearance. This need in the context of lung infections has been further heightened with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are a recently discovered tissue resident innate immune cell found at mucosal sites that respond rapidly in the event of an infection. ILC3s have clear roles in regulating mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis in the intestine, though the immunological functions in lungs remain unclear. It has been demonstrated in both viral and bacterial pneumonia that stimulated ILC3s secrete the cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 to promote both microbial clearance as well as tissue repair. In this review, we will evaluate regulation of ILC3s during inflammation and discuss recent studies that examine ILC3 function in the context of both bacterial and viral pulmonary infections.","Hoffmann, Joseph P; Kolls, Jay K; McCombs, Janet E",Front Immunol,152,29

We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of these patients in the United States. METHODS: Participants in a US-wide longitudinal observational registry responded to a supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire by e-mail on March 25, 2020, about their symptoms, COVID-19 testing, health care changes, and related experiences during the prior 2 weeks. Analysis compared responses by diagnosis, disease activity, and new onset of symptoms. Qualitative analysis was conducted on optional free-text comment fields. RESULTS: Of the 7061 participants invited to participate, 530 responded, with RA as the most frequent diagnosis (61%). Eleven participants met COVID-19 screening criteria, of whom two sought testing unsuccessfully. Six others sought testing, three of whom were successful, and all test results were negative. Not quite half of participants (42%) reported a change to their care in the prior 2 weeks. Qualitative analysis revealed four key themes: emotions in response to the pandemic, perceptions of risks from immunosuppressive medications, protective measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection, and disruptions in accessing rheumatic disease medications, including hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: After 2 weeks, many participants with rheumatic diseases already had important changes to their health care, with many altering medications without professional consultation or because of hydroxychloroquine shortage. As evidence accumulates on the effectiveness of potential COVID-19 treatments, effort is needed to safeguard access to established treatments for rheumatic diseases.","Michaud, Kaleb; Wipfler, Kristin; Shaw, Yomei; Simon, Teresa A; Cornish, Adam; England, Bryant R; Ogdie, Alexis; Katz, Patricia",,152,1

This interaction is similar to the mechanism in SARS-CoV, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in 2003. Drugs and antibodies that inhibit the interaction between ACE2 and S proteins could be key therapeutic methods for preventing viral infection and replication in COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between human ACE2 and a fragment of the S protein (S1 subunit) derived from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV using two-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), which can detect the interaction of fluorescently labeled proteins. The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 interacted in solution with soluble ACE2, which lacks a transmembrane region, more strongly than that of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, one-to-one stoichiometry of the two proteins during the interaction was indicated. Thus, we propose that this FCCS-based interaction detection system can be used to analyze the interaction strengths of various mutants of the S1 subunit that have evolved during the worldwide pandemic, and also offers the opportunity to screen and evaluate the performance of drugs and antibodies that inhibit the interaction.","Fujimoto, Ai; Lyu, Yidan; Kinjo, Masataka; Kitamura, Akira",,152,24

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of radiographers in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT using CO-RADS descriptors. METHODS: CT images of patients who underwent RT-PCR and chest CT due to COVID-19 suspicion between March and July 2020 were analysed retrospectively. Six readers, including two radiologists, two highly experienced radiographers and two less experienced radiographers, independently scored each CT using the CO-RADS lexicon. ROC curves were used to investigate diagnostic accuracy, and Fleiss'&#954; statistics to evaluate inter-rater agreement. RESULTS: 714 patients (419 men; 295 women; mean age: 64 years ±19SD) were evaluated. CO-RADS> 3 was identified as optimal diagnostic threshold. Highly experienced radiographers achieved an average sensitivity of 58.7% (95%CI: 52.5-64.7), an average specificity of 81.8% (95%CI: 77.9-85.2), and a mean AUC of 0.72 (95%CI: 0.68-0.75). Among less experienced radiographers, an average sensitivity of 56.3% (95%CI: 50.1-62.2) and an average specificity of 81.5% (95%CI: 77.6-84.9) were observed, with a mean AUC of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.68-0.74). Consultant radiologists achieved an average sensitivity of 60.0% (95%CI: 53.7-65.8), an average specificity of 81.7% (95%CI: 77.8-85.1), and a mean AUC of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70-0.77). CONCLUSION: Radiographers can adequately recognise the classic appearances of COVID-19 on CT, as described by the CO-RADS assessment scheme, in a way comparable to expert radiologists. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Radiographers, as the first healthcare professionals to evaluate CT images in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia by means of a categorical reporting scheme at CT in a reliable way, hence playing a primary role in the early management of these patients.","Vicini, S; Panvini, N; Bellini, D; Rengo, M; Ciotola, M; De Vivo, M; Gambaretto, C; Caldon, V; Panno, S; Del Borgo, C; Carbone, I","Radiography (Lond.

Cloth face mask can be used repeatedly and washed, its use can be adjusted to face. However, using a face mask alone is not enough to provide an adequate protection level. Other steps must be taken, such as washing hands with hand soap in running water, keeping a physical distance of minimum one meter from people, especially from those showing respiratory tract symptoms (coughing, sneezing), cleaning items touched by hands of people such as door handles and handles stairs. Therefore, the use of cloth face mask must be carried out together with clean and healthy living behaviors.","Yudhastuti, Ririh",Jurnal Kesehatan Masyarakat Nasional,152,21

Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at the end of December 2019 in China, it has become extremely important to have well-established and validated diagnostic and serological assays for this new emerging virus. Here, we present a micro-neutralization assay with the use of SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus with two different methods of read-out. We evaluated the performance of this assay using human serum samples taken from an Italian seroepidemiological study being performed at the University of Siena, along with the human monoclonal antibody CR3022 and some iper-immune animal serum samples against Influenza and Adenovirus strains. The same panel of human samples have been previously tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as a pre-screening. Positive, borderline, and negative ELISA samples were evaluated in neutralization assay using two different methods of read-out: subjective (by means of an inverted optical microscope) and objective (by means of a spectrophotometer). Our findings suggest that at least 50% of positive ELISA samples are positive in neutralization as well, and that method is able to quantify different antibody concentrations in a specific manner. Taken together, our results confirm that the colorimetric cytopathic effect-based microneutralization assay could be used as a valid clinical test method for epidemiological and vaccine studies.","Manenti, Alessandro; Maggetti, Marta; Casa, Elisa; Martinuzzi, Donata; Torelli, Alessandro; Trombetta, Claudia M; Marchi, Serena; Montomoli, Emanuele",J. med. virol,152,24

In addition, infectious virus particles in the tear fluid can be potential sources of infection; however, the detection of SARS-CoV­2 RNA in the tear fluid has rarely been successful. Although isolated conjunctival involvement is highly unlikely, at the current point in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, practically every patient examined by an ophthalmologist could be infected with SARS-CoV­2.

The present study evaluated the influenza-related outcomes between the influenza season 2019 and 2020 in Hong Kong as a result of these infection control measures. A Monte Carlo simulation model was designed to estimate the number of influenza cases, clinic visits, hospitalization, deaths, direct medical cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for the season 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 in six age groups: 0-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years and &#8805;65 years in Hong Kong. Model inputs were derived from public data and existing literature. The model findings showed significant reduction in influenza-related cases, clinic visits, hospitalization, and deaths in 2020 versus 2019 (p < 0.05). Influenza-related direct costs in all age-groups were significantly reduced by 56%-82% (p < 0.01) in 2020 versus 2019. DALYs were also significantly decreased by 58%-85% (p < 0.01). The direct cost and DALYs avoided in 2020 was the highest among the age group of 0-5 years with a cost-saving of USD593,763 (95%CI 590,730-596,796) per 10,000 population and a DALY reduction of 57.67 (95%CI 57.54-57.83) per 10,000 population.

Bioinformatics has played an important role in the design of efficient RNAi sequences targeting various pathogenic viruses. However, stability and delivery of RNAi molecules have presented serious obstacles for reaching therapeutic efficacy. For this reason, RNA modifications and formulation of nanoparticles have proven useful for non-viral delivery of RNAi molecules. On the other hand, utilization of viral vectors and particularly self-replicating RNA virus vectors can be considered as an attractive alternative. In this review, examples of antiviral therapy applying RNAi-based approaches in various animal models will be described.

METHODS: The Aichi Medical Association performed a comprehensive survey of pediatric anaphylaxis cases aged under 15 years from 87 secondary and 25 tertiary emergency care hospitals in Aichi Prefecture (population 7.5 million), Japan. RESULTS: Between April 2016 and March 2020, 3423 cases of anaphylaxis were identified. Food items were the most frequent trigger (73%), followed by exercise after food ingestion (4.3%), and drugs (2.2%). Egg (19%) and milk (17%) specifically were the most frequent among food triggers, while the largest proportional increase was observed in tree nuts from 6.0% in 2017 to 15% in 2019. Overall, 1647 (48%) cases were admitted to the hospital, of which 26 (0.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. Drug-induced anaphylaxis was associated with the highest admission rate (71%). Of the 2493 food-induced anaphylaxis cases, 1107 (44%) were treated with adrenaline. Among them, 343 cases included previously prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI), with 225 (66%) usages prior to hospital arrival. There was no significant difference in the admission rate between the cases in which AAIs were used and those with adrenaline administered in the hospital (68% and 72%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of tree nuts in food-induced anaphylaxis increased significantly. Although prehospital AAI use has become widespread, it was not associated with lower admission rate compared to in-hospital adrenaline usage.","Kitamura, Katsumasa; Ito, Tomoya; Ito, Komei",Allergol. intern,152,29

The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models. Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.","Tian, Yuan; Nian, Bixiao; Ma, Yongchen; Guo, Xinyue; Wang, Feng; Rong, Long",Front Public Health,152,14

As countries have started lifting Covid-19 related restrictions, businesses have been allowed to again have on-site customers. However, just a limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing measures are being followed. This has resulted in heavy burdens on businesses as their number of customers have decreased substantially. In this study, we propose a model to minimize the economic impact of Covid-19 for businesses that have implemented social distancing measures, as well as to minimize the health impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We introduce the quantity Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of people at a given site while applying social distancing measures. We apply our model to a real-world scenario and optimize the number of passengers and their arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular aircraft seat layouts using the Annealing Monte Carlo technique. We obtain the optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal arrangement with higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers.

It suggests that cortisol-associated activation of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) in epithelial and endothelial cells infected with the virus stimulates the release of ATP which then acts back on purinergic receptors. In the lung this could produce the non-productive cough via purinergic P2X3 receptors on vagal afferent nerves. In endothelial cells it could stimulate exocytosis of Weibel-Palade (WP) bodies that contain angiopoietin-2 which is important in the pathogenesis of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) by increasing capillary permeability and Von Willebrand Factor which mediates platelet adhesion to the endothelium and hence clotting. Both angiopoietin-2 and VWF levels are markedly elevated in COVID-19 associated ARDS. The paper offers an explanation for the sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 complications and also for why these are strongly associated with age, race, diabetes and body mass index. It also explains why individuals with blood group A have a higher risk of severe infection than those with blood group O. Dexamethasone has been shown to be of benefit in coronavirus ARDS patients and has been thought to act as an anti-inflammatory drug. This paper suggests that a major part of its effect may be due to suppression of cortisol secretion. There is an urgent need to trial the combination of dexamethasone and an MR antagonist such as spironolactone to more effectively block the MR and hence the exocytosis of WP bodies.","Edwards, Christopher",,152,26

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil Santamaría, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo Rodríguez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrotxategi, Maitane","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

AIMS: To identify the rates of probable mental health disorder in staff working in ICUs in nine English hospitals during June and July 2020. METHODS: An anonymized brief web-based survey comprising standardized questionnaires examining depression, anxiety symptoms, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), well-being and alcohol use was administered to staff. RESULTS: Seven hundred and nine participants completed the surveys comprising 291 (41%) doctors, 344 (49%) nurses and 74 (10%) other healthcare staff. Over half (59%) reported good well-being; however, 45% met the threshold for probable clinical significance on at least one of the following measures: severe depression (6%), PTSD (40%), severe anxiety (11%) or problem drinking (7%). Thirteen per cent of respondents reported frequent thoughts of being better off dead, or of hurting themselves in the past 2 weeks. Within the sample used in this study, we found that doctors reported better mental health than nurses across a range of measures. CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial rates of probable mental health disorders, and thoughts of self-harm, amongst ICU staff; these difficulties were especially prevalent in nurses. Whilst further work is needed to better understand the real level of clinical need amongst ICU staff, these results indicate the need for a national strategy to protect the mental health, and decrease the risk of functional impairment, of ICU staff whilst they carry out their essential work during COVID-19.","Greenberg, N; Weston, D; Hall, C; Caulfield, T; Williamson, V; Fong, K",Occup. med,152,16

The aim was to determine willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles among presbyopic people if the service begins. Methods An interview-based questionnaire was employed among presbyopic people, who were refracted during a community-based outreach service conducted at Debre-Tabor town, South Gondar. Results A total of 322 study subjects have completed the questionnaire. The median value of gross monthly income was US $75.0 (Range from US $7.1-321.4). The mean amount of willing to pay for a pair of spectacles was US $17.9 (Range from US $1.1-107.1). Participants who were willing to pay at least US $12.5 (minimum cost at the public optical dispensing unit) for a pair of spectacles accounted 63.0% (95% CI: 57.8-68.3). Based on multivariable logistics regression output analysis age (P = .049), occupation (P = .001), monthly income (p = .001), and positive history of previous spectacles wear (P = .005) show statistically significant association with willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles. Conclusion In the study area, the mean amount willing to pay for a pair of spectacles was higher than the average set of the price at the public optical dispensing units in Gondar. Public willingness to pay for a pair of spectacles could be considered as an assurance to set up an affordable and financially sustainable spectacle supply service. Conducted on a community-based outreach service may likely pool keen population segments to overestimate the result.

Until now, there have been no general recommendations on how humanitarian surgical missions should be organized. METHODS: Based on our experience in the field of humanitarian surgical missions to Sub-Saharan Africa, a panel of recommendations in times of COVID-19 was developed. The fields under study were as follows: (1) Planning of a multidisciplinary project; (2) Organization of the infrastructure; (3) Screening, management and treatment of SARS-COV-2; (4) Diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2; (5) Surgical priorization and (6) Context of patients during health-care assistance. We applied a risk bias measurement to obtain a consensus among humanitarian health-care providers with experience in this field. RESULTS: A total of 94.36% of agreement were reached for the approval of the recommendations. Emergency surgery must be a priority, and elective surgery adapted. For emergency surgery, we established a priority level 1a (< 24 h) and 1b (< 72 h). For an elective procedure, according our American College of Surgeon adaptation score, process with more than 60 points should be reconsidered. Due to the low life expectancy in many African countries, we consider 45-50 years as age of risk. In case of SARS-COV-2 active infection or high clinical suspicion, the screening, management and treatment should be following the international guidelines adapted to duration of the stay, available infrastructure, size of the cooperation team and medical resources. CONCLUSIONS: Humanitarian surgical mission in times of COVID-19 is a challenge that must extrapolate the established recommendations to the local cooperation environment.","Lopez-Lopez, Víctor; Morales, Ana; García-Vazquez, Elisa; González, Miguel; Hernandez, Quiteria; Baroja-Mazo, Alberto; Palazon, Dolores; Tortosa, Jose A; Rodriguez, Maria A; Torregrosa, Nuria M; Kanyi, Winnie; Ndungu, J K; Martinez, José Gil; Rodriguez, José M",World J Surg,152,16

The employee callout rate, defined as the percentage of scheduled employees unable to report to work for any cause including COVID-19 illness or asymptomatic quarantine, was tracked to determine the impact of safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A contact tracing and quarantine program was implemented for all employees, followed by additional safety measures including social distancing, masks, enhanced disinfection protocols, and temperature screening. The weekly callout rate was tracked nationally for 19,517 BCC employees over 9 months, from March to December 2020. RESULTS: Weekly employee callout rates increased after implementation of the contact tracing program due to asymptomatic employees placed into COVID-19-related quarantine. Mobile collections callouts increased by nearly fivefold the pre-pandemic baseline within the first 4 weeks, peaking at 9.7% in early April. Peaks for fixed site collections (5.0%) and manufacturing (6.7%) occurred nearly simultaneously. Shortly after implementation of all safety measures, the weekly callout rate declined for all three employee groups and has remained relatively stable with a mean callout rate of 4.3% for mobile collections, 2.4% for fixed site collections, and 3.7% for manufacturing despite further increase in new COVID-19 cases in the United States. CONCLUSION: Callouts for BCC employees during the COVID-19 pandemic initially increased, but subsequently declined and stabilized after implementation of safety measures. Since multiple interventions were implemented simultaneously, it is not possible to determine the individual impact of each measure on callout rate.","Coberly, Emily; Korich, Erin; Henesy, Michelle; Doerksen, Kate; Young, Pampee",Transfusion,152,20

The involvement of the gastrointestinal tract with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has remained unclear. The following study retrospectively reviews gastrointestinal symptoms and liver function tests at the time of hospital admission to identify patient outcomes including prolonged hospital stay, the requirement for intensive care, and all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality. Methods A retrospective review of patient charts at the Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center (WMC) was conducted at the time of hospital admission, using a pre-determined selection criterion. All adult patients, both inpatient and outpatient, were included from March 2020 till May 2020. A 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for patient outcomes. Results Of the 520 patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea (OR = 0.375, p = 0.015), and nausea and vomiting in combination (OR = 0.400, p = 0.016) had an inverse protective relationship with all-cause in-hospital 30-day mortality among COVID-19 patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea (OR = 1.008, p &lt; 0.001), and nausea and vomiting (OR = 1.291, p = 0.043) had a mild impact on the length of hospital stay. Conclusion Elevated liver transaminases including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at the time of hospital admission can predict critical care requirement and all-cause 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Presence of gastrointestinal symptoms is associated with worsened outcomes.","Deane, K.; Singh, A.; Sarfraz, A.; Sarfraz, Z.; Ciccone, L.; Zheng, B.

Extracellular HMGB1 plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury of infectious as well as sterile origin including hyperoxia. Excessive amounts of systemic HMGB1 and HMGB1-partner molecule complexes can be retained in the pulmonary circulation indicated by a substantial reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. The cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanism ameliorates pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting HMGB1 release and HMGB1 receptor expression. This comprehension was recently reinforced by results reported in Molecular Medicine by Sitapara and coworkers demonstrating that administration of an &#945;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist attenuated hyperoxia-induced acute inflammatory lung injury by alleviating the accumulation of HMGB1 in the airways and the circulation. Activating the cholinergic antiinflammatory path might be considered to alleviate severe COVID-19 with or without concurrent oxygen-induced lung injury.,"Andersson, Ulf",Mol Med,152,10

Knowledge of prognostic factors in affected patients can help optimize care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 and the form of presentation of the disease, the previous pathologies of patients and their chronic treatments. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND LOCATIONS: This was an observational study on a cohort of 418 patients admitted to three regional hospitals in Catalonia (Spain). As primary outcomes, severe disease (need for oxygen therapy via nonrebreather mask or mechanical ventilation) and death were studied. Multivariate binary logistic regression models were performed to study the association between the different factors and the results. RESULTS: Advanced age, male sex and obesity were independent markers of poor prognosis. The most frequent presenting symptom was fever, while dyspnea was associated with severe disease and the presence of cough with greater survival. Low oxygen saturation in the emergency room, elevated CRP in the emergency room and initial radiological involvement were all related to worse prognosis. The presence of eosinophilia (% of eosinophils) was an independent marker of less severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the most robust markers of poor prognosis for COVID-19.

Computed tomography (CT)-based lung-density analysis offers a fast, reliable, and quantitative assessment of lung density. Therefore, we aimed to assess the benefit of CT-based lung density measurements to predict possible severe disease progression in COVID-19. Material and methods: Thirty COVID-19-positive patients were included in this retrospective study. Lung density was quantified based on routinely acquired chest CTs. Presence of COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Wilcoxon test was used to compare two groups of patients. A multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex, was employed to model the relative increase of risk for severe disease, depending on the measured densities. Results: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients or patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed a lower proportion of medium- and low-density lung volume compared to patients on the normal ward, but a significantly larger volume of high-density lung volume (12.26 dl IQR 4.65 dl vs. 7.51 dl vs. IQR 5.39 dl, p = 0.039). In multivariate regression analysis, high-density lung volume was identified as a significant predictor of severe disease. Conclusions: The amount of high-density lung tissue showed a significant association with severe COVID-19, with odds ratios of 1.42 (95% CI: 1.09-2.00) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.03-2.11) for requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation, respectively. Acknowledging our small sample size as an important limitation; our study might thus suggest that high-density lung tissue could serve as a possible predictor of severe COVID-19.","Bressem, Keno K; Adams, Lisa C; Albrecht, Jakob; Petersen, Antonie; Thieß, Hans-Martin; Niehues, Alexandra; Niehues, Stefan M; Vahldiek, Janis L",Pol J Radiol,152,20

The human health is the primary conclusion of many studies. The improving of human health may include supplying the people with enough and safe nutrients against malnutrition to fight against multiple diseases like COVID-19. Biofortification is a process by which the edible plants can be enriched with essential nutrients for human health against malnutrition. After the great success of biofortification approach in the human struggle against malnutrition, a new biotechnological tool in enriching the crops with essential nutrients in the form of nanoparticles to supplement human diet with balanced diet is called nano-biofortification. Nano biofortification can be achieved by applying the nano particles of essential nutrients (e.g., Cu, Fe, Se and Zn) foliar or their nano-fertilizers in soils or waters. Not all essential nutrients for human nutrition can be biofortified in the nano-form using all edible plants but there are several obstacles prevent this approach. These stumbling blocks are increased due to COVID-19 and its problems including the global trade, global breakdown between countries, and global crisis of food production. The main target of this review was to evaluate the nano-biofortification process and its using against malnutrition as a new approach in the era of COVID-19. This review also opens many questions, which are needed to be answered like is nano-biofortification a promising solution against malnutrition?

We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we successfully implemented our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images.

The model is Markovian of the SIR type in which the total population is constant and individuals meet a random number of other individuals at each time step. Individuals remain infectious for R time units, after which they become removed or immune. Individual transition probabilities from susceptible to diseased states are given in terms of the binomial distribution. An expression is given for the probability that any individuals beyond those initially infected become diseased. In the model with a finite recovery time R, simulations reveal large variability in both the total number of infected individuals and in the total duration of the epidemic, even when the variability in number of contacts per day is small. In the case of no recovery, R = ∞, a formal diffusion approximation is obtained for the number infected. The mean for the diffusion process can be approximated by a logistic which is more accurate for larger contact rates or faster developing epidemics. For finite R we then proceed mainly by simulation and investigate in the mean the effects of varying the parameters p (the probability of transmission), R, and the number of contacts per day per individual. A scale invariant property is noted for the size of an outbreak in relation to the total population size. Most notable are the existence of maxima in the duration of an epidemic as a function of R and the extremely large differences in the sizes of outbreaks which can occur for small changes in R. These findings have practical applications in controlling the size and duration of epidemics and hence reducing their human and economic costs.","Tuckwell, Henry C.; Williams, Ruth J.",Math Biosci,152,24

Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9–2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5–4.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1–26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, p < 0.05 vs. after lockdown: r = 0.91, p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Schubert, Justyna; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",J Travel Med,152,26

All possible equilibrium points of the model are investigated and their local stability is discussed under some conditions. The disease-free equilibrium is local asymptotically stable when [Formula: see text] and unstable when [Formula: see text]. The globally asymptotical stability of all point is verified by Lyapunov function. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to confirm the analytical results and understand the effect of varying the parameters on spread of COVID-19.

Its identification in large healthcare databases can help better characterize this risk. OBJECTIVE: To create an ICD-10 anaphylaxis algorithm, estimate its positive predictive values (PPVs) in a post-vaccination risk window, and estimate vaccination-attributable anaphylaxis rates in the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) population. METHODS: An anaphylaxis algorithm with core and extended portions was constructed analyzing ICD-10 anaphylaxis claims data in Medicare FFS from 2015 to 2017. Cases of post-vaccination anaphylaxis among Medicare FFS beneficiaries were then identified from October 1, 2015 to February 28, 2019 utilizing vaccine relevant anaphylaxis ICD-10 codes. Information from medical records was used to determine true anaphylaxis cases based on the Brighton Collaboration's anaphylaxis case definition. PPVs were estimated for incident anaphylaxis and the subset of vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis within a 2-day post-vaccination risk window. Vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis rates in Medicare FFS were also estimated. RESULTS: The study recorded 66,572,128 vaccinations among 21,685,119 unique Medicare FFS beneficiaries. The algorithm identified a total of 190 suspected anaphylaxis cases within the 2-day post-vaccination window; of these 117 (62%) satisfied the core algorithm, and 73 (38%) additional cases satisfied the extended algorithm. The core algorithm's PPV was 66% (95% CI [56%, 76%]) for identifying incident anaphylaxis and 44% (95% CI [34%, 56%]) for vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis.

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% to 50% most of the time after February and America contributes close to 50% recently. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America is greater than 50% after May and even exceeds 75% in July, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","So, M. K. P.; Chu, A. M. Y.; Tiwari, A.; Chan, J. N.

IRGM is a negative regulator of IFN responses under basal conditions. However, the role of human IRGM during viral infection has remained unclear. In this study, we show that IRGM expression is increased upon viral infection. IFN responses induced by viral PAMPs are negatively regulated by IRGM. Conversely, IRGM depletion results in a robust induction of key viral restriction factors including IFITMs, APOBECs, SAMHD1, tetherin, viperin, and HERC5/6. Additionally, antiviral processes such as MHC-I antigen presentation and stress granule signaling are enhanced in IRGM-deficient cells, indicating a robust cell-intrinsic antiviral immune state. Consistently, IRGM-depleted cells are resistant to the infection with seven viruses from five different families, including Togaviridae, Herpesviridae, Flaviviverdae, Rhabdoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Moreover, we show that Irgm1 knockout mice are highly resistant to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Altogether, our work highlights IRGM as a broad therapeutic target to promote defense against a large number of human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, CHIKV, and Zika virus.","Nath, Parej; Chauhan, Nishant Ranjan; Jena, Kautilya Kumar; Datey, Ankita; Kumar, Nilima Dinesh; Mehto, Subhash; De, Saikat; Nayak, Tapas Kumar; Priyadarsini, Swatismita; Rout, Kshitish; Bal, Ramyasingh; Murmu, Krushna C; Kalia, Manjula; Patnaik, Srinivas; Prasad, Punit; Reggiori, Fulvio; Chattopadhyay, Soma; Chauhan, Santosh",EMBO reports,152,5

Social cognition enables the understanding of another individual's feelings, intentions, desires and mental states, which is particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. To prevent further spread of the disease face masks have been recommended. Although justified for prevention of this potentially devastating disease, they partly cover the face and hamper emotion recognition and probably mindreading. As social cognition is already affected by aging and dementia, strategies must be developed to cope with these profound changes of communication. Face masking even could accelerate cognitive decline in the long run. Further studies are of uppermost importance to address face masks' impact on social cognition in aging and dementia, for instance by longitudinally investigating decline before and in the pandemic, and to design compensatory strategies. These issues are also relevant for face masking in general, such as in medical surroundings—beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schroeter, Matthias L.; Kynast, Jana; Villringer, Arno; Baron-Cohen, Simon",Front Psychol,152,24

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected. Methods We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. Results An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10−2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10−4 to 2.72 × 10−2) for N, 5.34 × 10−3 (5.10 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−2) for S, 1.69 × 10−3 (3.94 × 10−4, 3.60 × 10−3) for P, 1.65 × 10−3 (4.47 × 10−4, 3.24 × 10−3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.","Xiong, Chenglong; Jiang, Lufang; Chen, Yue; Jiang, Qingwu",bioRxiv,152,16

However, longitudinal analyses are scarce. An online, longitudinal study was conducted among self-selected UK adults (n = 1818), involving three surveys (May–June, August–September, November–December 2020), covering anthropometric, sociodemographic, COVID-19-related and behavioural measures. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Self-reported average weight/body mass index (BMI) significantly increased between the May–June period and the August–September period (74.95 to 75.33 kg/26.22 kg/m(2) to 26.36kg/m(2), p < 0.001, respectively), and then significantly decreased to November–December (to 75.06 kg/26.27 kg/m(2), p < 0.01), comparable to May–June levels (p = 0.274/0.204). However, there was great interindividual variation, 37.0%/26.7% increased (average 3.64 kg (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 3.97)/1.64 kg/m(2) (1.49, 1.79)), and 34.5%/26.3% decreased (average 3.59 kg (3.34, 3.85)/1.53 kg/m(2) (1.42, 1.63)) weight/BMI between May–June and November–December. Weight/BMI increase was significantly negatively associated with initial BMI, and positively associated with monthly high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks intake and alcohol consumption, and for BMI only, older age. Associations were time-varying; lower initial BMI, higher HFSS snacks intake and high-risk alcohol consumption were associated with maintaining weight/BMI increases between August–September and November–December. The average weight/BMI of UK adults fluctuated between May–June and November–December 2020. However, the substantial interindividual variation in weight/BMI trajectories indicates long-term health impacts from the pandemic, associated with food and alcohol consumption.","Dicken, Samuel J.; Mitchell, John J.; Newberry Le Vay, Jessica; Beard, Emma; Kale, Dimitra; Herbec, Aleksandra; Shahab, Lion",Nutrients,152,10

However, the above methods have a critical challenge: data privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason, that is the limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the model through data sharing, which will also cause privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) framework, a new technique being used to protect data privacy. Under the FL framework and Differentially Private thinking, we propose a Federated Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Network (FedDPGAN) to detect COVID-19 pneumonia for sustainable smart cities. Specifically, we use DP-GAN to privately generate diverse patient data in which differential privacy technology is introduced to make sure the privacy protection of the semantic information of the training dataset. Furthermore, we leverage FL to allow hospitals to collaboratively train COVID-19 models without sharing the original data. Under Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, the evaluation of the proposed model is on three types of chest X-ray (CXR)images dataset (COVID-19, normal, and normal pneumonia).

Is it those who wrote the regulations, those enforcing the regulations, those being regulated or the science underpinning the regulations?

It takes as examples the role of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) in regulating veterinary products, of the Security Sensitive Biological Agents regulations in managing the risks from specific pathogens, the Quarantine Act regulations as applied to containment facilities and the development of welfare standards. By dealing with products, pathogens, places and “pets” it provides a broad oversight of how regulations have been developed and applied from different perspectives and highlights the differing roles that science and research play both in developing policy and regulations. What is clear is that in the presence of good science it is usually possible to develop sound and defensible regulations e.g. those managed by APVMA, but when there is a lack of science to underpin the regulations, problems can arise e.g. in the case of animal welfare.","Jeggo, Martyn",J Verbrauch Lebensm,152,20

Such a novel health-climate approach requires broad thinking regarding geographies, ecologies and socio-economic policies, and demands that one prioritises services for vulnerable populations at higher risk. Actions to engage more sectors and systems in comprehensive health-climate governance are identified. Much like the World Health Organization’s ‘Health in All Policies’ approach, one should think health governance and climate change together in a transnational framework as a matter not only of health promotion and disease prevention, but of population security.

In Escherichia coli, some rare codons, which can limit the expression level of exogenous protein, have been defined by gene engineering operations. Previous studies have confirmed the existence of codon pair's preference in many genomes, but the underlying cause of this bias has not been well established. Here we focus on the patterns of rarely-used synonymous codons. A novel method was introduced to identify the rare codons merely by codon pair bias in Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In Escherichia coli, we defined the ""rare codon pairs"" by calculating the frequency of occurrence of all codon pairs in coding sequences. Rare codons which are disliked in genes could make great contributions to forming rare codon pairs. Meanwhile our investigation showed that many of these rare codon pairs contain termination codons and the recognized sites of restriction enzymes. Furthermore, a new index (F(rare)) was developed. Through comparison with the classical indices we found a significant negative correlation between F(rare )and the indices which depend on reference datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach suggests that we can identify rare codons by studying the context in which a codon lies. Also, the frequency of rare codons (F(rare)) could be a useful index of codon bias regardless of the lack of expression abundance information.","Wu, Xianming; Wu, Songfeng; Li, Dong; Zhang, Jiyang; Hou, Lin; Ma, Jie; Liu, Wanlin; Ren, Daming; Zhu, Yunping; He, Fuchu",BMC Bioinformatics,152,13

Multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed for the detection of viruses. RESULTS: Viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 311 patients (73.7%). In regard to respiratory virus subtypes, 103 patients (33.1%) had respiratory syncytial virus, 102 (32.7%) had human rhinovirus, 49 (15.7%) had multiple viruses, 15 (4.8%) had parainfluenzavirus, 13 (4.1%) had adenovirus, nine (2.8%) had human metapneumovirus, eight (2.5%) had human coronaviruses, six (1.9%) had bocavirus, five (1.6%) had influenza virus, and one patient (0.3%) had enterovirus. The median age was lower in patients with multiple viruses (p<0.001). The respiratory syncytial virus was more commonly detected in patients with a history of prematurity (p<0.001).

In subjects' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we compared the phenotype of CD8 T lymphocytes, expressing PD-1, TIM-3, or CD39, both alone and in various combinations. RESULTS: The findings showed that the percentage of CD8(+) cell counts was significantly lower in non-critical patients. Critical and non-critical patients were more likely than healthy controls to have an escalated frequency of CD8(+) TIM-3(+), CD8(+) CD39(+), and CD8(+) TIM-3(+) CD39(+) cells.

Its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been the subject of an unprecedented investigation to characterize its molecular structure and intimate functioning. While markers for its detection have been proposed and several diagnostic methodologies developed, its propensity to evolve and evade diagnostic tools and the immune response is of great concern. The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.

The potential cause, clinical characteristics and infectiousness of the recurrent positive RT-PCR patients need to be answered. METHODS: A single-centered, retrospective study of 51 discharged COVID-19 patients was carried out at a designated hospital for COVID-19. The demographic data, clinical records and laboratory findings of 25 patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR from hospitalization to follow-up were collected and compared to 26 patients with negative RT-PCR discharged regularly during the same period. Discharged patients’ family members and close contacts were also interviewed by telephone to evaluate patients’ potential infectiousness. RESULTS: The titer of both IgG and IgM antibodies was significantly lower (p = 0.027, p = 0.011) in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR. Median duration of viral shedding significantly prolonged in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR (36.0 days vs 9.0 days, p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in demographic features, clinical features, lymphocyte subsets count and inflammatory cytokines levels between the two groups of patients. No fatal case was noted in two groups. As of the last day of follow-up, none of the discharged patients’ family members or close contact developed any symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low levels of IgG and IgM are more likely to have recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results and lead to a prolonged viral shedding. The recurrent positive of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR may not indicate the recurrence or aggravation of COVID-19. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the patients recovered from COVID-19 is not necessarily correlated with the ability of transmission.","Ao, Zhi; Li, Yan; Wei, Jiawei; Jiang, Jinyue; Wang, Xiaohui; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Yuxin; Yu, Haiyan; Zhu, Linxiao; Wang, Xue; Hu, Qianfang; Duan, Jun; Hu, Wenhui; Zhang, Xianxiang; Wu, Guicheng; Guo, Shuliang",Clin Exp Med,152,20

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein. This comprehensive review article anticipates providing a summary of the authentic and peer reviewed published literature about the potential of natural metabolites that can be developed into possible lead compounds against this new threat of Covid-19. Main focus of the article will be to highlight natural sources of potential anti-coronavirus molecules, mechanism of action, docking studies and the target proteins as well as their toxicity profiles. This review article intends to provide a starting point for the research endeavors that are needed for the design and development of drugs based on pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives and standardized plant extracts. This review article will be highly helpful for scientists who are working or intend to work on antiviral drugs from natural sources.","Khursheed, Aadil; Jain, Vikrant; Rasool, Ajaz; Rather, Manzoor A.; Malik, Nisar Ahmad; Shalla, Aabid Hussain",Microb Pathog,152,9

We collected two sets of data during and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The participants donated to the charitable fund, “Against COVID-19, The China Charity Federation Is on the Move.” We further investigated the mediating effect of social anxiety on the link between the contagion of donation behaviors and the changes in the COVID-19 situation. A total of 1022 participants (Mage = 22.68, 63.01% females) participated in the intertemporal online experiment and were considered in the statistical analyses. Our findings were as follows. First, the donation behaviors of others significantly changed these participants’ initial donation decisions, with increased or decreased donation amounts being associated with a positive or negative donation behavior, respectively. Others’ positive donation behavior was more likely to nudge these participants into changing their initial decisions (31.82%, Mean = 15.177, SD = 1.586) than negative donation behavior (18.28%, Mean = 12.122, SD = 1.908) during the peak of the pandemic. However, such difference disappeared after the peak because the contagion of positive donation behavior significantly decreased along with the abatement of the pandemic. Second, the participants’ social anxiety decreased along with the abatement of the pandemic, and social anxiety completely mediated the relationship between the pandemic abatement and the decrease in the contagion of positive donation behaviors. These findings advance our understanding of the motivations and influence mechanism of individuals’ donation decisions in the current pandemic situation and help make informed policy making decisions.","Li, Shuaiqi; Liu, Xiaoli; Li, Jianbiao",Front Psychol,152,1

The disease was subsequently designated as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The death toll has continued to rise with grave health and socio-economic implications for individuals, families and nations globally. Although the respiratory tract is primarily involved in this disease, kidney affectation is increasingly reported and has been shown to worsen the prognosis of the disease. Current evidence shows that kidney disease is not uncommon in patients with coronavirus infection especially in those with COVID-19 and may arise from a constellation of factors such as hypotension, sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, multi-organ failure, use of nephrotoxic medications as well as direct infection in some cases. Factors associated with acute kidney injury in coronavirus infected patients may include elderly age, male sex, presence of co-morbidities as well as pre-existing chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease. Although, there is presently no effective treatment for COVID-19, there is room for conservative management, extracorporeal therapy and renal replacement therapy. The aim of this review was to integrate current and emerging evidences on renal disease resulting from COVID-19 and the previous epidemics of coronavirus infections including the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by other strains of the virus.","Egbi, Oghenekaro Godwin; Adejumo, Oluseyi Ademola; Akinbodewa, Ayodeji Akinwumi",Pan Afr Med J,152,22

A total of 191 patients with COVID-19 were recruited at the Third Hospital of Wuhan from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Fifty healthy volunteers were randomly selected as the control group. Age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), CRP, lymphocyte percentage, and NLR were extracted. Quantitative clinical characteristics and laboratory values were compared between groups. Risk factors and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for COVID-19 were analyzed. We found that the NLR and CRP were higher, while the lymphocyte percentage was lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy controls. Among patients confirmed to have COVID-19, the NLR and CRP of the moderate group were lower than those of severely ill patients (severe, critical and death groups), and the lymphocyte percentage of the moderate group was higher than that of the critical and death group. There were no significant differences in WBC among all groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR, CRP, and lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors for COVID-19. The AUC of the combined determination of NLR and CRP was 0.863, which was higher than that of NLR, CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.835, 0.775, 0.416, and 0.749, respectively). Our results showed that the NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for COVID-19, and the combined detection of the NLR and CRP showed improved diagnostic performance for COVID-19.","Yufei, Yan; Mingli, Liu; Xuejiao, Li; Xuemei, Deng; Yiming, Jin; Qin, Qin; Hui, Shen; Jie, Guo",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,152,2

We report the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Multi-sourced nationwide cohort study of adults (age ≥18 years) admitted to hospital with TE and deaths from TE in England (hospital and community) between 1st February 2018 and 31st July 2020. Relative risks, adjusted for age, sex, atrial fibrillation, co-morbidities and time trend comparing before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were estimated using Poisson regression. FINDINGS: Of 268,054 patients admitted with TE to 195 hospitals, 82,208 (30.6%) were admitted after 2nd March 2020 (first COVID-19 death in the UK). The incidence of TE hospitalised increased during the COVID-19 pandemic from 1090 to 1517 per 100,000 (absolute risk change 45.9% [95% CI 45.1–46.6%], adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.41–1.44]) driven particularly by pulmonary embolism; 1.49, 95% CI 1.46–1.52. TE were more frequent among those with COVID-19; 1.9% vs. 1.6%, absolute risk change 21.7%, 95% CI 21.0–22.4%, ARR 1.20, 95% CI 1.18–1.22. There was an increase in the overall mortality from TE during the pandemic (617, 6.7% proportional increase compared with the historical baseline), with more TE deaths occurring in the community compared with the historical rate (44% vs. 33%). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in the incidence of hospitalised TE. There were more deaths from TE in the community highlighting a number of mechanisms including the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection and potential impact of delays in seeking help. RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study We searched PubMed on 16 November 2020 for articles that documented the incidence and mortality of thrombo-embolic events (TE) during the COVID-19 pandemic using the search terms “COVID-19” OR “Coronavirus*” OR “2019-nCOV” OR “SARS-CoV” AND (“Thromboembolism” OR “Venous Thromboembolism” OR “thromboembol*”) with no language or time restrictions. The majority of data on TE in COVID-19 pertains to hospitalised patients from retrospective cohort studies. One study found that TE in hospitalised patients was associated with an increased mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.82; 95% CI 1.54–2.15). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies in 9249 hospitalised patients calculated an overall pooled incidence of TE of 17.8% (95% CI: 9.9–27.4%), rising to 22.9% (95% CI: 14.5–32.4%) in patients admitted to intensive care (ICU). The most contemporary data are from a cohort of 1114 patients (715 outpatient, 399 hospitalised, 170 admitted to ICU). With robust COVID-19-specific therapies and widespread thromboprophylaxis the prevalence of venous TE in ICU patients was reported as 7% (n = 12) when catheter-/device-related events were excluded, and among the outpatients there was no TE reported. No published studies have used nationwide data to investigate TE during the pandemic or the effect of the pandemic on outcomes of patients with TE but without Covid-19. Added value of this study This retrospective multi-sourced nationwide unlinked cohort study compares the overall incidence and mortality of TE prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found an increased incidence of TE despite only a small proportion having a diagnosis of COVID-19. This may highlight the lack of testing, particularly in the community during the initial phase of the pandemic, and the possibility of other factors contributing to TE risk, such as decreased daily activity mandated by home quarantine and alterations in medication concordance. Mortality from TE was higher in the community during the pandemic and this highlights that adverse societal effects of the pandemic, such as aversion to seeking medical assessment, may precipitate worse outcomes related to TE. Implications of all the available evidence Evidence suggests that COVID-19 produces a hypercoagulable state and thromboprophylaxis is recommended in hospitalised patients to prevent excess mortality from TE. Whether to anticoagulate non-hospitalised ambulatory patients with COVID-19 will be answered by ongoing trials. Clinicians should consider the risks posed by decreased daily activity and fear of medical contact, and provide appropriate advice to patients.","Aktaa, Suleman; Wu, Jianhua; Nadarajah, Ramesh; Rashid, Muhammad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Mamas, Mamas A.; Gale, Chris P.",Thromb Res,152,5

For instance, about two years are needed to biodegrade dye-derived, carcinogenic aromatic amines, in sediments. Classical remediation methods based upon physicochemical reactions are costly and still generate sludges that contain amine residues.

Here, we review the synthesis and applications of biopolymeric nanomaterials for photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes. We focus on conducting biopolymers incorporating metal, metal oxide, metal/metal oxide and metal sulphide for improved biodegradation. Biopolymers can be obtained from microorganisms, plants and animals. Unlike fossil-fuel-derived polymers, biopolymers are carbon neutral and thus sustainable in the context of global warming.

Information and communications technology (ICT) used for these purposes is widely applied in various medical fields. Using ICT has the advantage of allowing the sharing of patients’ electronic patient records (EPR) among medical staff, but increases the risk of copyright infringement and privacy leaks during archiving and transmission. We have developed a home care support system for peritoneal dialysis patients using information hiding technology consisting of both digital watermarking technology for copyright protection and steganography technology for communication security when treating patients at home using ICT. In addition, we evaluated the developed system. METHOD: The system for sharing medical information was developed in the PHP programming language on a personal computer system using Microsoft Azure cloud services. Figure 1 shows an explanation of the digital watermarking technology and steganography technology used in the developed system. 1. Digital watermarking technology The patient’s data, such as EPR data, facility name, etc., were hidden in the region of non-interest (RONI) of the patient’s chest CT image series and stored in a database. 2. Steganography technology We call scene photos “cover pictures.” Medical information (CT images, etc.) was hidden in the cover picture. In this study, the cover picture containing the medical information was designated as a Stego image. A body CT image series (16-bit, 512 × 512, 100 slices) was used to verify the steganography technique. These CT images were compressed using 7-Zip and then saved in a folder, which was then embedded in the cover photo. The Stego image was then sent from the patient’s home to the medical institution via the home care support system. RESULTS: We investigated the hash value, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) of the image series (Fig. 2). If the structure of the image or photograph was exactly the same, the SSIM shows a value of 1. If the PSNR is ≥ 40 dB, the image quality can be maintained without affecting diagnosis. If part of the ROI is changed during transmission, the hash value decoded from the received Stego image will be different from that before transmission. For Stego images containing watermarked or hidden CT images with 4000 words embedded, SSIM and PSNR were ≥ 0.99 dB and 65.3 dB, respectively. If the medical information was embedded in a low bit plane, such as a 1-bit or 2-bit plane, the radiologist could not identify the embedded information. When our technology was applied, there were no changes in the capacity of CT images or Stego images before and after embedding. Therefore, it was not possible to tell that medical information was embedded due to changes in capacity. CONCLUSION: Using ICT, we have built a home care support system that can conceal medical information by combining digital watermarking technology and steganography technology to ensure the copyright of images and to ensure privacy and secure transmission of EPR and CT images. Using the developed system, daily medical information of dialysis patients could be transmitted safely to the institute, and the medical staff could share the information safely. Both techniques can be applied to all digital image information, and is not just limited to CT images.","Umeda, Tokuo; Okawa, Akiko; Kobayashi, Natsumi",Nephrol Dial Transplant,152,24

METHODS: Design: Single-site, retrospective study. Setting: A suburban 700-bed community hospital in Newark, Delaware, USA. Patients: Patients admitted to the hospital from March 11, 2020, to August 11, 2020, with a positive COVID-19 status. We followed a time-to-event analysis approach and used Kaplan–Meir curves and log-rank tests for bivariate analyses, and an accelerated failure time model for a multivariable model of hospital LOS. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighty-seven patients discharged alive (mean [SD] age, 60.94 [18.10] years; 339 men [49.34%]; 307 Black/African-American [44.69%]; and 267 White [38.86%]) were included in the investigation. Bivariate analysis using Kaplan–Meir curves showed that patients’ age, sex, ethnicity, insurance type, comorbidity of fluid and electrolyte disorder, hypertension, renal failure, diabetes, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, neurological disorder, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias to be significantly associated with LOS (P<0.05). In the multivariable analysis, patients’ age, sex, ethnicity, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and number of weeks since onset of the pandemic was significantly associated with LOS (P<0.05). Fluid and electrolyte disorder is the only comorbidity independently associated with LOS after adjusting for patients’ age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and weeks since onset of pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients LOS vary based on multiple factors. Understanding these factors are crucial to improving the prediction accuracy of COVID-19 patient census in hospitals for resource planning and care delivery.

Objective: to determine if lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are correlated to the risk for COVID-19 and its severity as measured by CT Design: single-center observational study Setting: AZ Delta general hospital Participants: 186 consecutive patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized for COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to April 7, 2020 Main outcome and measures: comparative analysis of 25(OH)D levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at various radiological stages and a season/age/sex-matched diseased control population Results: we report on 186 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19: 109 males (median age 68 years, IQR 53-79 years) and 77 females (median age 71 years, IQR 65-74 years). At admission patients were screened by CT to determine temporal changes of COVID-19 lung disease and classified as stage 1 (ground glass opacities), 2 (crazy paving pattern) and 3 (consolidation). At intake, 25(OH)D levels were measured and compared to a season-matched population of 2717 diseased controls, consisting of 999 males (median age 69 years, IQR 53-81 years) and 1718 females (median age 68 years, IQR 43-83 years). Male and female COVID-19 patients combined showed lower median 25(OH)D than controls (18.6 ng/mL, IQR 12.6-25.3, versus 21.5 ng/mL, IQR 13.9-30.8; P=0.0016) and a higher fraction of vitamin D deficiency (58.6% versus 45.2%, P=0.0005). A strong sexual dimorphism was found: female patients had comparable vitamin D status as control females. Male COVID-19 patients, however, showed markedly higher percentage of vitamin D deficiency than controls (67.0% versus 49.2%, P=0.0006) and this effect was more pronounced with advanced radiological stage ranging from 55.2% in stage 1 to 74% in stage 3. Conclusions and relevance: vitamin D deficiency is a possible risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in males. Vitamin D supplementation might be an inexpensive, accessible and safe mitigation for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","De Smet, D.; De Smet, K.; Herroelen, P.; Gryspeerdt, S.; Martens, G. A.",,152,9

The study was performed on 271 samples representative of the Italian general population and identified seven variants (rs140764737, rs142164099, rs2069849, rs142759801, rs190436077, rs148171375, rs13306435) in IL6 and five variants (rs2228144, rs2229237, rs2228145, rs28730735, rs143810642) within IL6R, respectively. These variants have been predicted to affect the expression and binding ability of IL6 and IL6R. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that IL6 and IL6R appeared to be implicated in several pathogenetic mechanisms associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality as well as with neurodegenerative diseases mediated by neuroinflammation. Thus, the availability of IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers for COVID-19 may be helpful to counteract harmful complications and prevent multiorgan failure. At the same time, IL6-IL6R-related biomarkers could also be useful for assessing the susceptibility and progression of neuroinflammatory disorders and undertake the most suitable treatment strategies to improve patients’ prognosis and quality of life. In conclusion, this study showed how IL6 pleiotropic activity could be exploited to meet different clinical needs and realize personalized medicine protocols for chronic, age-related and modern public health emergencies.","Strafella, Claudia; Caputo, Valerio; Termine, Andrea; Barati, Shila; Caltagirone, Carlo; Giardina, Emiliano; Cascella, Raffaella",Life (Basel),152,1

Surprisingly, the incidence and the Case Fatality Rate has been much higher in the richer countries compared with the poorer countries. However, the reasons behind this dichotomy have not been explained based on data or evidence, although some of the factors for the susceptibility of populations to SARS-CoV-2 infections have been proposed. We have taken into consideration all publicly available data and mined for the possible explanations in order to understand the reasons for this phenomenon. The data included many parameters including demography of nations, prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, sanitation parameters etc. Results of our analyses suggest that demography, improved sanitation and hygiene, and higher incidence of autoimmune disorders as the most plausible factors to explain higher death rates in the richer countries Thus, the much debated hygiene hypothesis appears to lend credence to the Case Fatality Rate dichotomy between the rich and the poor countries.","Chatterjee, B.; Karandikar, R.

Understanding the evolution of influenza virus is crucial to determine pathogenesis, vaccine efficacy, and resistance to antiviral drugs. In this study, we investigated the molecular evolution of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2010/11 influenza season in southern Germany by sequence analysis of the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene from 25 patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease. Phylogenetic analysis revealed co-circulation of different genetic groups. The D222G mutation, which had previously been observed in severe cases, was not detected. Immunocompromised patients were not affected more severely than non-immunocompromised patients (p>0.05), although longer shedding was observed in some of them. Interestingly, additional mutations and potential glycosylation sites were detected in samples from the lower respiratory tract in two patients, but not in the corresponding upper respiratory tract specimens. The H275Y mutation in the influenza virus neuraminidase gene, known to confer resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, was detected in one patient.","Falcone, Valeria; Bierbaum, Sibylle; Kern, Winfried; Kontny, Udo; Bertz, Hartmut; Huzly, Daniela; Panning, Marcus",Arch Virol,152,10

The aim of this review is to summarize available evidence providing an official position statement of the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) METHODS: A comprehensive Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library search was performed. Due to the limited evidence and the lack of studies, it was not possible to formulate recommendations according to the Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence criteria. RESULTS: Several molecular characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 can justify the presence of virus within the testis and possible alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. Orchitis has been reported as a possible complication of SARS-CoV infection, but similar findings have not been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome. Finally, available data do not support the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in plasma seminal fluid of infected subjects. CONCLUSION: Data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological consultation and evaluation of gonadal function including semen analysis should be suggested. Studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques.","Corona, G.; Baldi, E.; Isidori, A.

While MERS-CoV has already spread to and within other countries, these mass gatherings could further amplify and/or accelerate its international dissemination, especially since the origins and geographic source of the virus remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed 2012 worldwide flight itinerary data and historic Hajj pilgrim data to predict population movements out of Saudi Arabia and the broader Middle East to help cities and countries assess their potential for MERS-CoV importation. We compared the magnitude of travel to countries with their World Bank economic status and per capita healthcare expenditures as surrogate markers of their capacity for timely detection of imported MERS-CoV and their ability to mount an effective public health response. Results: 16.8 million travelers flew on commercial flights out of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates between June and November 2012, of which 51.6% were destined for India (16.3%), Egypt (10.4%), Pakistan (7.8%), the United Kingdom (4.3%), Kuwait (3.6%), Bangladesh (3.1%), Iran (3.1%) and Bahrain (2.9%). Among the 1.74 million foreign pilgrims who performed the Hajj last year, an estimated 65.1% originated from low and lower-middle income countries. Conclusion: MERS-CoV is an emerging pathogen with pandemic potential with its apparent epicenter in Saudi Arabia, where millions of pilgrims will imminently congregate for two international mass gatherings. Understanding global population movements out of the Middle East through the end of this year's Hajj could help direct anticipatory MERS-CoV surveillance and public health preparedness to mitigate its potential global health and economic impacts.","Khan, Kamran; Sears, Jennifer; Hu, Vivian Wei; Brownstein, John S; Hay, Simon; Kossowsky, David; Eckhardt, Rose; Chim, Tina; Berry, Isha; Bogoch, Isaac; Cetron, Martin",PLoS Curr,152,23

A major protective factor against early sexual debut among AI/AN youth is the familial system. Interventions aiming to improve parent–child communication and parental warmth toward adolescent sexual health topics were reported to contribute to positive youth sexual health outcomes, specifically among minority youth. Healthy Native Youth thus developed the Talking is Power text-messaging service to guide parents and caring adults on how to initiate sensitive topics with youth and how to support them in making informed decisions regarding sex and healthy relationships. Methods: Descriptive statistics were used to demonstrate website analytics and reach per views and time spent on each page, and for displaying participants’ responses to the questions on the usability of the Talking is Power text-messaging series. To assess the perceived impact of the series, the differences in mean percentage scores of the question assessing parental comfort in engaging in sexual health topics with youth between pre- and post-intervention were calculated using two-sample t-tests of equal variances. Descriptive content analysis was adopted to highlight emerging themes from open-ended items. Results: When looking at reach, 862 entrances were recorded during the specified time period (5.8% of total entrances to HNY website), while the bounce rate was set at 73.1% (22.6% greater than the industry average), and the exit rate was 54.3% (15.2% greater than the industry average). Series usability was highly ranked on the 5-Likert scale in terms of signing up for a similar series on a different topic, quality of images, texts, and links, relating to prompts, and change in sparking sensitive conversations with youth. High likelihood of recommending the series to a friend or colleague was also reported by participants (0–10). No significant difference in parental comfort levels was reported (p = 0.78 > 0.05). Main themes provided suggestions for improving the series mode of delivery, while others included positive feedback about the material, with the possibility of expanding the series to other adolescent health topics. Conclusion: Lessons learned during the design, dissemination, and evaluation of the resource’s usability, reach, and perceived impact may be of interest to other Indigenous communities who are in the process of adapting and/or implementing similar approaches.","Sacca, Lea; Craig Rushing, Stephanie; Markham, Christine; Shegog, Ross; Peskin, Melissa; Hernandez, Belinda; Gaston, Amanda; Singer, Michelle; Trevino, Nicole; Correa, Chrystial C.; Jessen, Cornelia; Williamson, Jennifer; Thomas, Jerri",Int J Environ Res Public Health,152,1

Based on the lack of expression of the virus entry proteins in olfactory receptor neurons, it was originally assumed that the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) does not infect olfactory neurons. Recent studies have reported otherwise, opening the possibility that the virus can directly infect the brain by traveling along the olfactory nerve. Multiple animal models have been employed to assess mechanisms and routes of brain infection of SARS-CoV-2, often with conflicting results. We here review the current evidence for an olfactory route to brain infection and conclude that the case for infection of olfactory neurons is weak, based on animal and human studies. Consistent brain infection after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in mouse models is only seen when the virus entry proteins are expressed abnormally, and the timeline and progression of rare neuro-invasion in these and in other animal models points to alternative routes to the brain, other than along the olfactory projections. COVID-19 patients can be assured that loss of smell does not necessarily mean that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gained access to and has infected their brains.","Butowt, Rafal; Meunier, Nicolas; Bryche, Bertrand; von Bartheld, Christopher S.",Acta Neuropathol,152,8

The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic. METHODS: Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers’ safety, were included. The last date of research for this study was April 4, 2020. RESULTS: We analyzed 28 papers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome. To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed. The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer. Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting. Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.","Spolverato, Gaya; Capelli, Giulia; Restivo, Angelo; Bao, Quoc Riccardo; Pucciarelli, Salvatore; Pawlik, Timothy M.; Gronchi, Alessandro",Surgery,152,1

Forty-eight patients with severe COVID-19 and a positive PCR test who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) participated in the study. All patients were treated by routine treatment protocol for COVID-19. Hemoperfusion was performed for 24 patients in addition to treatment with conventional antiviral therapies. The other 24 patients made up the control group. Demographic data, laboratory findings, and patient outcomes before and after treatment were retrospectively collected and analyzed. There was no significant difference in mortality or length of hospital stays between the control group and the hemoperfusion group. The breathing rate (P-value=0.001) and heart beat rate (P-value=0.028) of patients decreased after hemoperfusion. The hemoperfusion resulted in a significant increase in the SpO2 levels and a significant decrease in the CRP of patients compared to the conventional treatment (P-value=0.009). Hemoperfusion can improve respiratory distress.

This study aims to investigate the psychological effect of quarantine on persons living in Morocco when the first COVID-19 cases were identified. The associations between anxiety, depression symptoms, and their predictors (sociodemographics, fatigue, and religious coping) were examined. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey, with a total of 1435 participants (≥18 years) recruited anonymously, was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 3 to 30 April 2020). A structured questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, and religious coping. Religious coping, fatigue, and depression, and anxiety were measured by Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE), Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. A generalized linear model (logistic regression) was used to determine the predictive factors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.0% (n = 621) and 53.0% (n = 766), respectively. Both were associated with female gender, household income decline, tracking COVID-19 news, and fear to contract COVID-19 (aOR = 1.36 to 2.85). Additionally, 32.0% (n = 453) and 26.0% (n = 372) reported severe physical fatigue, and mental fatigue, respectively. Both latter factors were significantly and positively associated with depression as well as with anxiety. Depressive and anxious patients used more negative religious coping, while positive religious coping was slightly associated with depression. CONCLUSION: In this online survey of the general population in Morocco, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic and psychosocial factors, such as female gender, income decline, infection fears, massive COVID-19 news exposure, negative religious coping, and fatigue were associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Queen Elizabeth Hospital, 20 April 2020–13 May 2020. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and seven (n=107) patients of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, between 20 April 2020 and 13 May 2020 were included in the study using consecutive sampling. Data were collected using the Excel audit tool and included age, gender, weight, estimated eGFR, D-dimer values on admission, intensive care unit admission, presence of respiratory failure, imaging results for evaluation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and anticoagulation received on admission. The data were entered in the SPSS (V.17) and were analysed. Data were summarised as means±SD, number or percentage as appropriate. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The frequency of VTE was found to be 11.2% in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean D-dimers were 3322.24 ng/mL±9603 ng/mL with the values significantly higher for patients with VTE and those requiring intensive care unit admission. All of the seven patients (100%) with D-dimers value above 2000 ng/mL who underwent imaging were found to have VTE. CONCLUSION: VTE is frequent in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia despite anticoagulation. A higher D-dimers value correlates well with the risk of VTE in these patients and further evaluation of such patients for VTE is necessary especially with D-dimers values above 2000 ng/mL.","Khan, Muhammad Ziaullah; Jamal, Yousaf; Sutton, Benjamin; Rauf, Farrukh",BMJ Open Respir Res,152,16

PTGS allows modification of the expression of a given cellular gene as a means to elucidate its role in the viral cycle and in virus–host cell interactions, and to investigate cellular pathways involved in viral pathogenesis. It also allows the creation of new animal models of human diseases. In addition, PTGS already appears to be a promising new therapeutic tool to fight viral multiplication and dissemination through the host and to prevent inflammation and virus-induced pathogenesis, including virus-induced tumorigenesis.","Colbère-Garapin, Florence; Blondel, Bruno; Saulnier, Aure; Pelletier, Isabelle; Labadie, Karine",Microbes Infect,152,7

Healthcare providers in general practice play an important role in referring smokers to smoking cessation counselling. We chose the Netherlands as a case study to qualitatively explore which factors play a role among healthcare providers in general practice with regard to referral for smoking cessation counselling organised both inside and outside general practice. METHODS: We conducted four focus groups and 18 telephone interviews, with a total of 31 healthcare providers who work in general practice. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify relevant factors related to referral behaviours, and each factor was linked to one of the three main components of the COM-B behaviour model (i.e., capability, opportunity and motivation) as well as the six sub-components of the model. RESULTS: Dutch healthcare providers in general practice typically refer smokers who want to quit to counselling inside their own general practice without actively discussing other counselling options, indicating a lack of shared decision making. The analysis showed that factors linked to the COM-B main components ‘capability’ and ‘opportunity’, such as healthcare providers’ skills and patients’ preferences, play a role in whether patients are referred to counselling inside general practice. Factors linked to all three COM-B components were found to play a role in referrals to counselling outside general practice. These included (knowledge of) the availability and quality of counselling in the region, patients’ requests, reimbursement, and sense of urgency to refer. The identified factors can both act as barriers and facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research suggest that more smokers can be reached with smoking cessation counselling if implementation interventions focus on: (i) equipping healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills needed to refer patients; (ii) creating more opportunities for healthcare providers to refer patients (e.g., by improving the availability and reimbursement of counselling options); and (iii) motivating healthcare providers to discuss different counselling options with patients.

Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cannot be perceived as a disease limited only to pneumonia with diverse severity. More and more reports have demonstrated a wide range of possible systemic symptoms, including hepatic complications. Liver injury has been observed in a significant proportion of patients, especially in those with a severe or critical illness. COVID-19 might provoke a deterioration of liver function in patients with already diagnosed chronic liver diseases and without pre-existing liver disorders. The deterioration of liver function worsens the prognosis, increases the risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prolongs the hospital stay. In general, patients who develop liver dysfunction in COVID-19 are mainly males, elderly people, and those with higher body mass index. The underlying mechanisms for hepatic failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear, nevertheless liver damage appears to be directly connected with virus-induced cytopathic effects. A liver injury observed during hospitalization might be simultaneously caused by the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, mainly antiviral agents. This minireview focuses on a possible relationship between COVID-19 and the liver, potential molecular mechanisms of liver damage, the characteristics of liver injury and suggested factors predisposing to hepatic manifestations in COVID-19 patients.","Cichoż-Lach, Halina; Michalak, Agata",World J Gastroenterol,152,1

The severity of BP can be assessed by detecting the anti-BP180 immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration, but the lab test is not available in many community clinics. BP patients are usually in a hypercoagulable state with increased levels of D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDPs). We aimed to evaluate the use of D-dimer and FDPs in assessing BP severity. We compared the levels of plasma D-dimer, plasma FDPs, eosinophil counts, eosinophil cationic protein, and serum anti-BP180 IgG concentration between 48 typical BP patients and 33 Herpes zoster (HZ) patients (control group). Correlational analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between the lab values and common BP severity markers. The plasma D-dimer and FDP levels were higher in BP patients than in HZ controls (D-dimer: 3297 ± 2517 µg/L vs. 569.70 ± 412.40 µg/L; FDP: 9.74 ± 5.88 mg/L vs. 2.02 ± 1.69 mg/L, respectively, P < 0.0001). Significant positive correlations were found between D-dimer/FDP levels and BP severity markers (i.e. anti-BP180 IgG concentration [D-dimer: r = 0.3928, P = 0.0058; FDP: r = 0.4379, P = 0.0019] and eosinophil counts [D-dimer: r = 0.3625, P = 0.0013; FDP: r = 0.2880, P = 0.0472]) in BP patients. We also found an association between FDP and urticaria/erythema lesions (r = 0.3016, P = 0.0372), but no other BPDAI components. In 19 BP patients with complete remission after systemic glucocorticoid treatment, D-dimer and FDP levels decreased post-therapy (D-dimer: 5559 ± 7492 µg/L vs. 1738 ± 1478 µg/L; P < 0.0001; FDP: 11.20 ± 5.88 mg/L vs. 5.13 ± 3.44 mg/L; P = 0.0003), whereas they did not in BP patients with treatment resistant.

It is of utmost importance to assess the risks of contamination of susceptible people by infectious individuals and to evaluate the level of viral transmission in the community. Most countries have imposed non-pharmaceutical measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including social distancing and mask wearing. Here we evaluated the spreading of viruses in open air using harmless Escherichia coli bacteriophages as a surrogate. Phages were sprayed towards Petri dishes seeded with bacteria at different lengths and angles. Median droplets size was 127 m, similar to those produced by sneeze. Our results showed that the transmission rate decreased exponentially with distance. The highest recorded transmission rate was 9x10E-6 PFU/plate when phages were sprayed from a 1 m distance. This suggests that the probability of transmission of a single phage at a 1 m distance is 1:100,000.","Trombini Machado, G.; Ramos de Carvalho Pinto, C.; Villanueva da Fonseca, L.

At the beginning of lockdown (wave 1), participants (N = 470) completed self-assessment questionnaires to document their initial level of well-being and state of nine different well-established psychological resources, measured as traits: optimism, hope, self-efficacy, gratitude toward the world, self-transcendence, wisdom, gratitude of being, peaceful disengagement, and acceptance. Three weeks later, a weekly follow-up was started to record changes in well-being and reported threats for a duration of 5 weeks (waves 2–6). Results show that psychological resources efficiently protected well-being in a variety of ways: they buffered the adverse effects of reported threats to health and wealth, increased the well-being averages, and reduced the decline in well-being over time. More specifically, emotional well-being was positively predicted by hope, gratitude of being, and, to a lesser level, by acceptance; psychological well-being by self-efficacy, personal wisdom, and gratitude of being; social well-being only by gratitude toward the world; and inner well-being by optimism, gratitude of being, and acceptance.

The role requires practitioners to manage clinical activities while providing learning opportunities and supervision for students. This can be time-consuming in often stretched clinical settings. This research investigated how experienced practice educators in occupational therapy tailored their approach to supporting student learning to make the most of limited supervision time. The results were developed into the Professional Learning through Useful Support (PLUS) Framework, which revealed how experienced practice educators focused their supervisory approach with students to maximise learning. METHODS An Action Research methodology was used across four cycles. Semi-structured interviews and naturally occurring placement documentation were gathered to determine the critical features of practice educator supervision. Template analysis was used to explore the approaches employed by practice educators to support student learning. Key focal points were linked and situated within educational theory to create the PLUS Framework. FINDINGS Three key focal points for practice educators were identified: (1) guiding learning, (2) making the theory-to-practice links explicit and (3) supportively challenging students. DISCUSSION The PLUS Framework is an educational tool that describes a set of guidance strategies used by skilled practice educators, whilst acknowledging the critical influences of workplace and university contexts. The proposed key features could be useful target areas for busy practice educators to help make the most of limited supervision time.

Using publicly available transcriptomic datasets, we conducted an in-silico analyses to evaluate the expression levels of 52 autoantigens, known to be associated with 24 autoimmune diseases, during SAR-CoV-2 infection. Seven autoantigens (MPO, PRTN3, PADI4, IFIH1, TRIM21, PTPRN2, and TSHR) were upregulated in whole blood samples. MPO and TSHR were overexpressed in both lung autopsies and whole blood tissue and were associated with more severe COVID-19. Neutrophil activation derived autoantigens (MPO, PRTN3, and PADI4) were prominently increased in blood of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, while TSHR and PTPRN2 autoantigens were specifically increased in SARS-CoV-2. Using single-cell dataset from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we observed an upregulation of MPO, PRTN3, and PADI4 autoantigens within the low-density neutrophil subset. To validate our in-silico analysis, we measured plasma protein levels of two autoantigens, MPO and PRTN3, in severe and asymptomatic COVID-19. The protein levels of these two autoantigens were significantly upregulated in more severe COVID-19 infections. In conclusion, the immunopathology and severity of COVID-19 could result in transient autoimmune activation.

Probably one of the most ambitious examples is Brazil, with its National Health Survey (PNS-2019). We evaluated PNS-2019, presenting in an unprecedented way, one of its innovations, which refer to Starfield and Shi’s adult Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT). METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional study, we evaluated Module H of the PNS-2019, which interviewed a probabilistic sample of about 10,000 adults in 2019 in all 27 Brazilian states. According to the PCAT methodology, an average score equal to or above 6.6 indicates a greater orientation and quality of the evaluated primary care services. RESULTS: Brazilian overall PCAT score [5, 9] reveals the need to improve primary health care services across the country. There were no statistically significant differences in the scores by sex (men and women, 5.9), and race (whites 5.9 [5.7; 6.0] and brown / black 5.9 [5.8; 6.0]). On the other hand, there was a difference in terms of age. The elderly evaluated the services in a more positive way (score = 6.1 [6.0; 6.2]), when compared to those aged 40–59 years (5.9 [5.7; 6.0]) and 18 to 39 years (5.6 [5.5; 5.8]). First results of PNS-2019 show that the population that most needs primary care services in SUS is the one with the best perception and the most positive evaluation of the actions and procedures offered in health facilities. DISCUSSION: During 2019, Brazil undertook important structural reforms in PHC based on a new financing model with the aim of inducing an improvement in efficiency and strengthening its attributes. It is essential that countries with universal health coverage (UHC) guarantee access to their population and, especially, the most vulnerable, seek better efficiency of these services and regularly assess PHC based on the population’s perception, through an independent methodology that monitor the quality of services and the strength of PHC, generating value for public resources applied to health services.","Pinto, Luiz Felipe; D’Avila, Otavio Pereira; Hauser, Lisiane; Harzheim, Erno",Int J Equity Health,152,21

Although these properties are well established, the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. In this study, GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture, toward a long term goal of discovering natural compounds that may complement existing vaccines. METHODS: Epithelial cells were treated with GA or GRA various times pre- or post-infection and virus yields were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. Levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6, and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunoblot to determine if there was an effect of GRA treatment on the accumulation of viral protein. RESULTS: GRA treatment reduced rotavirus yields by 99% when added to infected cultures post-- virus adsorption, whereas virus yields in GA treated cultures were similar to mock treated controls. Time of addition experiments indicated that GRA-mediated replication inhibition likely occurs at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry. The amounts of VP2, VP6 and NSP2 were substantially reduced when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours post-entry. CONCLUSIONS: GRA, but not GA, has significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication in vitro, and studies to determine whether GRA attenuates rotavirus replication in vivo are underway.","Hardy, Michele E; Hendricks, Jay M; Paulson, Jeana M; Faunce, Nicholas R",Virol J,152,21

METHODS: Data regarding depression, anxiety and quality of life in adult participants with a history of a depressive disorder (n = 308) were collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed effects regression models were fit for these outcomes over the period May – August 2020, controlling for pre-pandemic depressive groups (none, mild, moderate-to-severe), demographic characteristics, and early COVID-19 related experiences (such as disruptions in routines, mental health treatment, and social supports). RESULTS: In pre-to-early pandemic comparisons, the 3 pre-pandemic depressive categories varied significantly in anxiety (F(df=2,197) = 7.93, p < 0.0005) and psychological QOL (F(df=2,196) = 8.57, p = 0.0003).

We obtained 2699 studies from the initial literature search. Of them, we included 28 eligible studies that met our eligibility criteria. The sample size of the included studies is 2079 individuals. We extracted and pooled the available data and conducted a quality assessment for the eligible studies. From the 28 studies, only 13 studies provide strong evidence. Our results showed that Favipiravir and Hydroxycholoroquine shorten viral clearance and clinical recovery time and promote pneumonia absorption. On the other hand, Lopinavir-ritonavir either alone or combined with arbidol or interferons has no significant difference superior to the standard care. Corticosteroids, Convalescent plasma transfusion, and anticoagulant therapies provide a better prognosis.

SARS-CoV-2 has been found to have characteristic and powerful infectivity (ability to propagate) and lethality (severity). With influenza, primary influenza pneumonia from the virus itself is known to exist in addition to secondary bacterial pneumonia. With COVID-19, on the other hand, it is important to provide diagnosis and treatment while keeping acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema (alveolar flood) from a similar cytokine storm, as well as severe angiopathy, in mind. The importance of complying with hand hygiene and masks in infection control remains the same as in previous general infection control measures and responses to influenza virus infections and others, but in the future, vaccination will likely be the key to infection control in the community.","Seki, Masafumi",World J Virol,152,11

This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 on patient presentations with acute coronary syndromes during the first and second pandemic wave in Melbourne, Victoria. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of adults presenting with cute coronary syndrome during the first pandemic wave from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2020 and the second pandemic wave from 1 July 2020 to 31 August 2020 was compared to a control period from 1 March to 31 April 2019 at a single sub-tertiary referral centre in Melbourne, Victoria servicing a catchment area with a relatively high incidence of COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Three-hundred-and-thirty-five (335) patients were hospitalised with acute coronary syndromes across all three time periods. The total number of patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome was reduced during the pandemic, with a higher proportion of ST elevation myocardial infarctions. Ischaemic times increased with time from symptom onset to first medical contact rising from 191 minutes in the control period to 292 minutes in the first wave (p=0.06) and 271 minutes in the second wave (p=0.06). Coronary angiography with subsequent revascularisation significantly increased from 55% in the control period undergoing revascularisation to 69% in the first wave (p<0.001) and 74% in the second wave (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A concerning reduction in acute coronary presentations occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, associated with longer ischaemic times and a higher proportion requiring revascularisation. It is crucial that public awareness campaigns are instituted to address the contributing patient factors in future waves.","Sutherland, Nigel; Dayawansa, Nalin H.; Filipopoulos, Benjamin; Vasanthakumar, Sheran; Narayan, Om; Ponnuthurai, Francis A.; van Gaal, William",Heart Lung Circ,152,3

In this perspective, “drug repurposing” aims to represent a rapid and valuable strategy. In the last decades, the endogenous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) has emerged as a ubiquitous modulator of several biological functions. Early studies pointed out its importance in the regulation of numerous biological functions and systems. Accordingly, H(2)S deficiency has been associated with several disorders, and many chemotypes of H(2)S‐releasing agents have been developed as potential therapeutic tools for diseases related with impaired H(2)S production/activity. Some of these compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Presently, the pivotal role of H(2)S in modulating the inflammatory response and proinflammatory cytokine cascade is well recognized, and the usefulness of some H(2)S‐donors for the treatment of different forms of acute lung inflammation (due to infectious and non‐infectious etiologies) has been reported. More recent evidence is also unravelling several mechanisms of action which may account for antiviral effects of this gasotransmitter. Noteworthy, some preliminary clinical results suggest an inverse relationship between endogenous H(2)S levels and severity of COVID‐19 disease. Therefore, repurposing of H(2)S‐releasing drugs may be worthy of investigation as potential therapeutic opportunities for treatment of COVID‐19 disease.","Citi, Valentina; Martelli, Alma; Brancaleone, Vincenzo; Brogi, Simone; Gojon, Gabriel; Montanaro, Rosangela; Morales, Guillermo; Testai, Lara; Calderone, Vincenzo",Br J Pharmacol,152,16

Autophagy has both positive and negative roles in infection, cancer, neural development, metabolism, cardiovascular health, immunity, and iron homeostasis. Genetic defects in autophagy can have pathological consequences, such as static childhood encephalopathy with neurodegeneration in adulthood, Crohn’s disease, hereditary spastic paraparesis, Danon disease, X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy, and sporadic inclusion body myositis. Further studies on the process of autophagy in different microbial infections could help to design and develop novel therapeutic strategies against important pathogenic microbes.

Lipoxygenases are not restricted to humans but also occur in a large number of pro- and eucaryotic organisms. Lipoxygenase-like sequences have been identified in the three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, eucarya) but because of lacking functional data the occurrence of catalytically active lipoxygenases in archaea still remains an open question.

Here we demonstrated that porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is a major causative agent of an emerging and important swine disease complex, PCV2-associated diseases, caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest through degradation of cyclin D1 and E followed by reduction of retinoblastoma phosphorylation in synchronized PCV2-infected cells dependent upon virus replication. This induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest promoted PCV2 replication as evidenced by increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in the synchronized PCV2-infected cells. To delineate a mechanism of miRNAs in regulating PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we determined expression levels of some relevant miRNAs and found that only miR-15a but not miR-16, miR-21, and miR-34a was significantly changed in the PCV2-infected cells. We further demonstrated that upregulation of miR-15a promoted PCV2-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via mediating cyclins D1 and E degradation, in which involves PCV2 growth. These results reveal that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest induced by PCV2 may provide favourable conditions for viral protein expression and progeny production and that miR-15a is implicated in PCV2-induced cell cycle control, thereby contributing to efficient viral replication.","Quan, Rong; Wei, Li; Zhu, Shanshan; Wang, Jing; Cao, Yongchang; Xue, Chunyi; Yan, Xu; Liu, Jue",Sci Rep,152,20

The results showed that 62.5% and 75% of the participants achieved neutralizing antibody seroconversion on D14 and D42, respectively. After vaccination, IL-5 and IL-6 increased, and INF-γ decreased. IL6, IL-1B, INF-γ, IL-8, and IL-12p70 showed statistical significance in the comparison of different groups.

In fact, besides being involved in primary defense against infections–mainly through phagocytosis, generation of toxic molecules, release of toxic enzymes and formation of extracellular traps–neutrophils have been shown to play a role in finely regulating the development and the evolution of inflammatory and immune responses. These latter neutrophil-mediated functions occur by a variety of mechanisms, including the production of newly manufactured cytokines. Herein, we provide a general overview of the chemotactic cytokines/chemokines that neutrophils can potentially produce, either under inflammatory/immune reactions or during their activation in more prolonged processes, such as in tumors. We highlight recent observations generated from studying human or rodent neutrophils in vitro and in vivo models. We also discuss the biological significance of neutrophil-derived chemokines in the context of infectious, neoplastic and immune-mediated diseases. The picture that is emerging is that, given their capacity to produce and release chemokines, neutrophils exert essential functions in recruiting, activating and modulating the activities of different leukocyte populations.","Tecchio, Cristina; Cassatella, Marco A.",Semin Immunol,152,1

Fortunately, as online learning has grown, together with medical education shifting to problem-based and team-centered learning over the last three decades, existing resources have been adapted and improved upon to meet the challenges. Effective blended learning has resulted in innovative synchronous and asynchronous learning platforms. Clearly, to do this well requires time, effort, and adjustment from clinicians, educators, and learners, but it should result in an engaging change in teaching practice. Its success will rely on an evaluation of learning outcomes, educator and learner satisfaction, and long-term retention of knowledge.

Standard practises that have evolved to minimise the risks associated with tracheostomy must be comprehensively reviewed in light of the numerous potential episodes for aerosol generating procedures. We meet the urgent need for safe practise standards by presenting the experience of two major London teaching hospitals, and synthesise our findings into an evidence-based guideline for multidisciplinary care of the tracheostomy patient. METHODS: This is a narrative review presenting the extensive experience of over 120 patients with tracheostomy, with a pragmatic analysis of currently available evidence for safe tracheostomy care in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tracheostomy care involves many potentially aerosol generating procedures which may pose a risk of viral transmission to staff and patients. We make a series of recommendations to ameliorate this risk through infection control strategies, equipment modification, and individualised decannulation protocols. In addition, we discuss the multidisciplinary collaboration that is absolutely fundamental to safe and effective practise. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 requires a radical rethink of many tenets of tracheostomy care, and controversy continues to exist regarding the optimal techniques to minimise risk to patients and healthcare workers. Safe practise requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach to infection control, weaning and decannulation, with integrated processes for continuous prospective data collection and audit.","Rovira, Aleix; Dawson, Deborah; Walker, Abigail; Tornari, Chrysostomos; Dinham, Alison; Foden, Neil; Surda, Pavol; Archer, Sally; Lonsdale, Dagan; Ball, Jonathan; Ofo, Enyi; Karagama, Yakubu; Odutoye, Tunde; Little, Sarah; Simo, Ricard; Arora, Asit",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,152,21

It has been established that the worsening climate causes many environmental disasters and physical health problems. However, its psychological impacts are still not well understood. Climate change has brought about an emerging psychological phenomenon termed ‘climate anxiety’ or ‘eco-anxiety,’ which has been described as a ""chronic fear of environmental doom"" (Clayton et al., 2017, p. 68) due to the impact of climate change. This predictive cross-sectional study investigated the link between climate change anxiety and mental health among 433 Filipinos. A total of 145 males and 288 females aged 18 to 26 completed the Climate Change Anxiety Scale and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-38). Results show a significant relationship between climate change anxiety and mental health, with climate change anxiety predicting 13.5% of the overall Mental Health Index variance. Significantly, climate change anxiety was associated with the MHI-38’s global scale of Psychological Distress but not with the global scale of Psychological Well-being. The findings are discussed concerning the broader context of research on the mental health impacts of climate change.","Reyes, Marc Eric S.; Carmen, Bianca Patricia B.; Luminarias, Moses Emmanuel P.; Mangulabnan, Soleil Anne Nichole B.; Ogunbode, Charles A.",Curr Psychol,152,21

One possible strategy is the repurposing of existing drugs approved for other indications as antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2. Due to the commercial unavailability of SARS-CoV-2 drugs for treating COVID-19, we screened approximately 250 existing drugs or pharmacologically active compounds for their inhibitory activities against feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), a human coronavirus in the same genus (Betacoronavirus) as SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: FIPV was proliferated in feline Fcwf-4 cells and HCoV-OC43 in human HCT-8 cells. Viral proliferation was assayed by visualization of cytopathic effects on the infected Fcwf-4 cells and immunofluorescent assay for detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-OC43 in the HCT-8 cells. The concentrations (EC(50)) of each drug necessary to diminish viral activity to 50% of that for the untreated controls were determined. The viabilities of Fcwf-4 and HCT-8 cells were measured by crystal violet staining and MTS/PMS assay, respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen out of the 252 drugs or pharmacologically active compounds screened were found to be active against both FIPV and HCoV-OC43, with EC(50) values ranging from 11 nM to 75 μM. They are all old drugs as follows, anisomycin, antimycin A, atovaquone, chloroquine, conivaptan, emetine, gemcitabine, homoharringtonine, niclosamide, nitazoxanide, oligomycin, salinomycin, tilorone, valinomycin, vismodegib. CONCLUSION: All of the old drugs identified as having activity against FIPV and HCoV-OC43 have seen clinical use in their respective indications and are associated with known dosing schedules and adverse effect or toxicity profiles in humans. Those, when later confirmed to have an anti-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2, should be considered for immediate uses in COVID-19 patients.","Yang, Cheng-Wei; Peng, Tzu-Ting; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Wu, Szu-Huei; Lin, Wen-Hsing; Ke, Yi-Yu; Hsu, Tsu-An; Yeh, Teng-Kuang; Huang, Wen-Zheng; Lin, Jiunn-Horng; Sytwu, Huey-Kang; Chen, Chiung-Tong; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Biomed J,152,1

Coping With COVID-19: Learning From Past Pandemics to Avoid Pitfalls and Panic,19.96625,2.8287828,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE: Released particles are a major risk of airborne contamination during surgery. The present prospective study investigated the quantitative and qualitative particle load in the operating room (OR) depending on location, time of surgery and use of laminar air flow (LAF) system. METHODS: The particle load/m(3) was measured during the implantation of 12 total knee arthroplasties (6 × LAF, 6 × Non-LAF) by using the Met One HHPC 6 + device (Beckmann Coulter GmbH, Germany). Measurement was based on the absorption and scattering of (laser) light by particles and was performed at three different time-points [empty OR, setting up, ongoing operation) at 3 fixed measurement points [OR table (central LAF area), anaesthesia tower (marginal LAF area), surgical image amplifier (outside LAF area)]. RESULTS: Independent of time and location, all measurements showed a significantly higher particle load in the Non-LAF group (p < 0.01). With ongoing surgical procedure both groups showed increasing particle load. While there was a major increase of fine particles (size < 1 µm) with advancing activity in the LAF group, the Non-LAF group showed higher particle gain with increasing particle size. The lowest particle load in the LAF group was measured at the operating column, increasing with greater distance from the operating table. The Non-LAF group presented a significantly higher particle load than the LAF group at all locations. CONCLUSION: The use of a LAF system significantly reduces the particle load and therefore potential bacterial contamination regardless of the time or place of measurement and therefore seems to be a useful tool for infection prevention. As LAF leads to a significant decrease of respirable particles, it appears to be a protective factor for the health of the surgical team regardless of its use in infection prevention.

We explored the efficacy of KSK in reducing viral load and preventing the disease progression in asymptomatic, COVID-19 cases. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a COVID Care Centre in Chennai, India. We recruited reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 of 18 to 55 years of age, without clinical symptoms and co-morbidities. They were randomized (1:1 ratio) to KSK (60 mL twice daily for 7 days) or standard of care (7 days supplementation of vitamin C 60,000 IU morning daily and zinc 100 mg evening daily) groups. The primary outcomes were reduction in the SARS-CoV-2 load [as measured by cyclic threshold (CT) value of RT-PCR], prevention of progression of asymptomatic to symptomatic state, and changes in the immunity markers including interleukins (IL-6, IL-10, IL-2), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF α). Siddha clinical assessment and the occurrence of adverse effects were documented as secondary outcomes. Paired t-test was used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Viral load in terms of the CT value (RdRp: 95% CI = 1.89 to 5.74) declined significantly on the seventh day in the KSK group and that of the control group, more pronounced in the study group. None progressed to the symptomatic state. There was no significant difference in the biochemical parameters. We did not observe any changes in the Siddha-based clinical examination and adverse events in both groups. CONCLUSION: KSK significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral load among asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and did not record any adverse effect, indicating the use of KSK in the strategy against COVID-19. Larger, multi-centric trials can strengthen the current findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI2020/05/025215.

They are increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP among adults, particularly older adults. Polymerase chain reaction-based testing has allowed detection of newer agents (e.g. human metapneumovirus, coronavirus HKU1 and NL63) as well as improved the ability to detect “old” viral infections such as influenza virus and rhinovirus. When PCR is used, viruses have been detected in 45–75% of children and 15–54% of adults with CAP. Co-infection with viruses and bacteria is common and it remains challenging to determine which patients have only viral infection as the cause of CAP. Treatment for influenza with neuraminidase inhibitors should be started promptly for patients with CAP when influenza is suspected or documented, regardless of evidence of bacterial co-infection. Better ways to diagnose viral CAP and to integrate detection into management are urgently needed, as well as better treatment options for non-influenza respiratory viral infections.","Pavia, Andrew T",Infectious Disease Clinics of North America,152,32

Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery. METHODS: This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID‐19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories. RESULTS: Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross‐cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning.

How they impact cystic fibrosis lung disease history in young children is poorly known. The principal aim of our study was to determinate respiratory tract infections frequency in this cystic fibrosis young population. Secondary outcomes were nature of viral agents recovered and impact of such infections. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 25 children affected by cystic fibrosis and aged less than 2 years. Nasal samplings were taken systematically monthly or bimonthly with additional samples taken during respiratory tract infections episodes. Ten pathogens were tested by a combination of five duplex RT-PCRs or PCRs: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV), rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV)), coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43), parainfluenza virus (1–4), adenovirus and bocavirus (Respiratory Multi-Well System MWS r-gene®, BioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France). Cycle thresholds (CTs) were reported for all positive samples and considered positive for values below 40. Quantitative variables were compared using a nonparametric statistical test (Wilcoxon signed rank for paired comparisons). Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess relationships between two variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or GraphPad Prism V6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The significance level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age at inclusion was 9.6 ± 6.7 months. The patients had 3.4 ± 1.7 respiratory tract infections episodes per child per year. Forty-four respiratory tract infections (69%) were associated with virus: rhinovirus and enterovirus (RV/EV) were implied in 61% of them and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 14%. Only one patient required hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infections. 86% of the patients were treated by antibiotics for a mean of 13.8 ± 6.2 days. RSV infections (n = 6) were usually of mild severity. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory tract infections in young children with cystic fibrosis were of mild severity, rarely requiring hospitalization. Unsurprisingly, RV/EV were the most frequent agents. RSV-related morbidity seems low in this population. This raises the question of the usefulness of RSV preventive medication in this young population.","Eymery, Mathilde; Morfin, Florence; Doleans-Jordheim, Anne; Perceval, Marie; Ohlmann, Camille; Mainguy, Catherine; Reix, Philippe",Virol J,152,1

However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent, reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents: dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-MCE), and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP), in addition to GSH, against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high scoring compounds (~560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many non-overlapping hits. More importantly, we find that various reducing agents alter inhibitor potency (IC(50)) from ~10 µM with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC(50) > 200 µM) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in a HTS is critical as this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds. We demonstrate the feasibility of using GSH for in vitro HTS assays with these three target enzymes.","Lee, Hyun; Torres, Jaime; Truong, Lena; Chaudhuri, Rima; Mittal, Anuradha; Johnson, Michael E.",Analytical Biochemistry,152,1

Both vaccines provided similar protection, with symptomatic infections in 5.11% and 4.58%, following ChAdOx nCOV-19 (Recombinant) and the whole virion inactivated Vero cell vaccines, respectively (p < 0.001). Nursing and Clinical staff and cohorts >50 years contracted more infections (p < 0.001). Two-dose vaccination has significantly lower odds of developing symptomatic infection (0.83, 95%CI – 0.72 to 0.97). Maximum infections occurred during the peak of the second COVID-19 wave from mid-April to May 2021 (p < 0.001). No significant difference existed in the infection between sex, vaccine type, and the number of vaccine doses received (p ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSION: Symptomatic infections occurred in a small percentage of healthcare workers after COVID vaccination. Vaccination protected them from not only infection but also severe disease.","Vaishya, Raju; Sibal, Anupam; Malani, Arpita; Kar, Sujoy; Prasad K, Hari; SV, Kiran; Reddy, Sangita; Kamineni, Shobana; Reddy, Suneeta; Reddy, Preetha; Chandra Reddy, Prathap",Diabetes Metab Syndr,152,22

As the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is cleaved into the S1 and the S2 domain by furin protease, Nrp1 binds to the newly created C-terminal RRAR amino acid sequence of the S1 domain. In this study, we model the association of a Nrp1 (a2-b1-b2) protein with the Spike protein computationally and analyze the topological constraints in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein for binding with Nrp1 and ACE2. Importantly, we study the exit mechanism of S2 from the S1 domain with the assistance of ACE2 as well as Nrp1 by molecular dynamics pulling simulations. In the presence of Nrp1, by binding the S1 more strongly to the host membrane, there is a high probability of S2 being pulled out, rather than S1 being stretched. Thus, Nrp1 binding could stimulate the exit of S2 from the S1 domain, which will likely increase virus infectivity as the liberated S2 domain mediates the fusion of virus and host membranes. Understanding of such a Nrp1-assisted viral infection opens the gate for the generation of protein-protein inhibitors, such as antibodies, which could attenuate the infection mechanism and protect certain cells in a future combination therapy.","Li, Zhen-lu; Buck, Matthias",bioRxiv,152,21

These biologic drugs are structurally more complex than small molecules, and yet share a similar principle for rational drug discovery and development: That is to start with a pre-defined target and follow with the functional modulation with a therapeutic agent. Despite these tremendous successes, this “one target one drug” paradigm has been challenged by complex disease mechanisms that involve multiple pathways and demand new therapeutic routes. A rapidly evolving wave of multispecific biotherapeutics is coming into focus. These new therapeutic drugs are able to engage two or more protein targets via distinct binding interfaces with or without the chemical conjugation to large or small molecules. They possess the potential to not only address disease intricacy but also exploit new therapeutic mechanisms and assess undruggable targets for conventional monospecific biologics. This review focuses on the recent advances in molecular design and applications of major classes of multispecific biotherapeutics drugs, which include immune cells engagers, antibody-drug conjugates, multispecific tetherbodies, biologic matchmakers, and small-scaffold multispecific modalities. Challenges posed by the multispecific biotherapeutics drugs and their future outlooks are also discussed.","Zhong, Xiaotian; D’Antona, Aaron M.",Antibodies (Basel),152,16

We conducted a comprehensive 9‐year study on HCoVs by analyzing 1137 respiratory samples from four subsets of patients (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: A pan‐coronavirus RT‐PCR screening assay was performed, followed by species‐specific real‐time RT‐PCR monoplex assays. RESULTS: Human coronaviruses were detected in 88 of 1137 (7.7%) of the samples. The most frequently detected HCoV species were NL63 (50.0%) and OC43 (27.3%). Patients with comorbidities presented the highest risk of acquiring coronavirus infection (odds ratio = 4.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.9–9.3), and children with heart diseases revealed a significant HCoV infection presence. Dyspnea was more associated with HCoV‐229E infections (66.6%), and cyanosis was reported only in HCoV‐OC43 infections. There were interseasonal differences in the detection frequencies, with HCoV‐229E being predominant in the year 2004 (61.5%) and HCoV‐NL63 (70.8%) in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a novel insight into the epidemiology and clinical knowledge of HCoVs among different subsets of patients, revealing that these viruses may cause more than mild respiratory tract disease.","Cabeça, Tatiane K.; Granato, Celso; Bellei, Nancy",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,152,10

The current study adopted a qualitative approach and employed interview methodology to explore gay men’s attitudes, feelings and experiences of their eating behavior, and the potential link to mindfulness and self-compassion. Twenty gay men aged from 21 to 51 years were interviewed using an interview schedule with open-ended questions. Three main themes emerged from the transcript data sets: “Lean to be Seen,” “Sod it ‘I’ll Have a Pizza,” and “You Can’t Sit with Us.” The first theme was developed following responses that participant’s eating behavior and exercise engagement were influenced by their perceived attractiveness by the gay community. All participants spoke of achieving or maintaining a slim or muscular body type and adopted their eating behavior or exercise regime to reach corresponding goals. The second theme relates to the lack of acceptance felt from the gay community upon not conforming to the bodily expectations set out by the community. The third theme relates to the conflicts in participants’ attitudes around how exercising and eating healthily would improve their mental well-being; but that they also would give preference to calorie dense foods to reduce stress. These reflections are observed through a context of self-kindness and self-compassion and are seen to be related to increased feelings of self-criticism and body dissatisfaction.

VOC have the potential to disrupt ongoing public health measures and vaccine efforts. Yet, little is known regarding how frequently different viral variants emerge and under what circumstances. We report a longitudinal study to determine the degree of SARS-CoV-2 sequence evolution in 94 COVID-19 cases and to estimate the frequency at which highly diverse variants emerge. 2 cases accumulated 9 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) over a two-week period and 1 case accumulated 23 SNVs over a three-week period, including three non-synonymous mutations in the Spike protein (D138H, E554D, D614G). We estimate that in 2% of COVID cases, viral variants with multiple mutations, including in the Spike glycoprotein, can become the dominant strains in as little as one month of persistent in patient virus replication. This suggests the continued local emergence of VOC independent of travel patterns.

Within an already under-funded public health sector, it is imperative that the costs and effects of potential interventions to care are assessed and weighed against the opportunity costs of their required investment. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ICU management for admitted COVID-19 patients across the public and private health sector in South Africa. Methods: Using a Markov modelling framework and a health system perspective, the costs and health outcomes of inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in (1) general ward and intensive care (GW+ICU) and (2) general ward only were assessed. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were evaluated as health outcomes, and the cost per admission from public and private sectors was determined. The models made use of four variables: mortality rates, utilisation of inpatient days for each management approach, disability weights associated to the severity of the disease, and the unit cost per general ward day and per ICU day in public and private hospitals. The unit costs were multiplied by utilisation estimates to determine the cost per admission. DALYs were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) - representing the difference in costs and health outcomes of the two management strategies - was calculated and compared to a cost-effectiveness threshold to determine the value for money of ICU management. Results: A cost per admission of ZAR 75,127 was estimated for inpatient management of severe and critical COVID-19 patients in general wards only as opposed to ZAR 103,030 in GW+ICU. DALYs were 1.48 and 1.10 in the general ward only and GW+ICU, respectively. The ratio of difference in costs and health outcomes between the two management strategies produced an ICER equal to ZAR 73 091 per DALY averted, a value above the cost-effectiveness threshold of ZAR 38 465. Conclusions: This study indicated that purchasing additional ICU capacity from the private sector may not be a cost-effective use of limited health resources. The real time, rapid, pragmatic, and transparent nature of this analysis demonstrates a potential approach for further evidence generation for decision making relating to the COVID-19 pandemic response and the wider priority setting agenda in South Africa.","Cleary, S.

The objective of this research is to design a measurement that could be utilised to predict the efficacy of a lockdown decision. METHODS: One would expect that the effectiveness of lockdown lies in the assumption that the virus spreads from one area to another area in a rippling way. If the virus spreads in a radiating way, then lockdown should be an effective countermeasure to contain the pandemic. On the other hand, if it spreads indiscernibly or randomly, then a lockdown decision would have lesser or little effect on the containment. We mainly combine graphs and metric to compute correlation matrices, which would measure whether the virus spreads in a rippling way. The metric used is to measure the boundary (or county) distances between counties. We take 3073 counties and equivalents in the USA and explore the property of contagion with respect to distance. The distance between any two counties is measured by the number of neighbours (or counties) between them. Then, we study the relation between contagion and distances. The relation between distance (complexity of neighbouring) and confirmed cases (contagion) is further explored. RESULTS: Then, we study the relation between contagion and distances. The relation between distance (complexity of neighbouring) and confirmed cases (contagion) could be explored. Our research shows county lockdown in the USA plays no important role in containing the spread of coronavirus for the time being.

Although several studies have reported that green tea catechins (GTCs) might prevent influenza virus infection, this remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies with 5048 participants that examined the effect of GTC administration on influenza prevention. In a random-effects meta-analysis of five RCTs, 884 participants treated with GTCs showed statistically significant effects on the prevention of influenza infection compared to the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% CIs 0.51–0.89, p = 0.005) without evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, p = 0.629). Similarly, in three cohort studies with 2223 participants treated with GTCs, there were also statistically significant effects (RR 0.52, 95% CIs 0.35–0.77, p = 0.001) with very low evidence of heterogeneity (I(2) = 3%, p = 0.358). Additionally, the overall effect in the subgroup analysis of gargling and orally ingested items (taking capsules and drinking) showed a pooled RR of 0.62 (95% CIs 0.49–0.77, p = 0.003) without heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, p = 0.554). There were no obvious publication biases (Egger’s test (p = 0.138) and Begg’s test (p = 0.103)).

Yet, establishing the causal effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is difficult because they do not occur arbitrarily. We exploit a quasi-random source of variation for identification purposes –namely, regional differences in the placement on the pandemic curve following an unexpected and nationwide lockdown. Our results reveal that regions where the outbreak had just started when the lockdown was implemented had 1.62 fewer daily deaths per 100,000 inhabitants when compared to regions for which the lockdown arrived 10+ days after the pandemic’s outbreak. As a result, a total of 4,642 total deaths (232 deaths/daily) could have been avoided by the end of our period of study –a figure representing 23% of registered deaths in Spain at the time. We rule out differential pre-COVID mortality trends and self-distancing behaviors across the compared regions prior to the swift lockdown, which was also uniformly observed nationwide. In addition, we provide supporting evidence for contagion deceleration as the main mechanism behind the effectiveness of the early adoption of NPIs in lowering the death rate, rather than an increased healthcare capacity.","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina; Borra, Cristina; Rivera-Garrido, Noelia; Sevilla, Almudena",Econ Hum Biol,152,26

The Smith Papyrus (2600 ~ 2200 B.C.) described the use of copper surfaces to sterilize chest wounds and drinking water. Brass and bronze on doorknobs can discourage microbial spread in hospitals, and metal-base surface coatings are used in hygiene-sensitive environments, both as inactivators and modulators of cellular immunity. A limitation of these approaches is that the reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) generated at metal surfaces also damage human cells by oxidizing their proteins and lipids. Silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4)) is a non-oxide ceramic compound with known surface bacterial resistance. We show here that off-stoichiometric reactions at Si(3)N(4) surfaces are also capable of inactivating different types of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses independent of whether their structure presents an envelop or not. The antiviral property of Si(3)N(4) derives from a hydrolysis reaction at its surface and the subsequent formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in doses that could be metabolized by mammalian cells but are lethal to pathogens. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of viral RNA and in situ Raman spectroscopy suggested that the products of Si(3)N(4) hydrolysis directly react with viral proteins and RNA.

Data were collected in real time between March 19 and May 11, 2020, for patients who were delayed to cellular therapy. We evaluated the proportion of delayed patients who ultimately received cellular therapy, reasons for not proceeding to cellular therapy, and changes in disease and health status during delay. A total of 85 patients were delayed, including 42 patients planned for autologous HCT, 36 patients planned for allogeneic HCT, and 7 patients planned for CAR-T therapy. Fifty-six of these patients (66%) since received planned therapy. Five patients died during the delay. The most common reason for not proceeding to autologous HCT was good disease control in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias (75%).

On 18 September, the Ethiopian Minister of Health advised the Parliament the possibility of reopening schools provided certain conditions were met. Schools are currently reopening in the country for the first time since March 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the knowledge and preventive health behaviours toward COVID-19 and associated factors among secondary school students. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 370 secondary school students were included. Bivariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression model were fitted to identify the predictors of knowledge about COVID-19. Simple and multiple linear regression analysis were done to identify factors associated with preventive behaviour. A p<0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: Only one-fourth (23.5%, 95% CI 19.5% to 28.1%) of the participants had a good knowledge about COVID-19. The mean score of preventive behaviour was 22.8±SD 6.2. Marital status, religion, father education, living arrangement and sources of information were significantly associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Being female and using health professionals as source of information increased the engagement in preventive behaviours. On the other hand, student whose father employed in non-governmental organisation and other jobs had decreased engagement in preventive health behaviours. CONCLUSION: Significant number of the students had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and poorly engaged in COVID-19 preventive behaviour. Thus, it is suggested to include and disseminate about COVID-19 in related academic sessions, using school clubs and minimedias. The sources of COVID-19-related information need to strengthen the dissemination of tailored, credible and timely message to enhance the knowledge and engagement of the students in preventive behaviours.","Handebo, Simegnew; Adugna, Asmamaw; Kassie, Ayenew; Shitu, Kegnie",BMJ Open,152,1

Recently Covid-19 added to the list of possible causes, emerging as a concrete threat for already frail patients. CASE REPORT: a 75-years-old stage-III NSCLC patient underwent radical radio-chemotherapy followed by consolidation durvalumab at our Institution. After four cycles, immunotherapy was suspended due to symptomatic pneumonitis responsive to oral steroids. Nevertheless, he suddenly developed fever and severe dyspnea. Chest radiography described diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltrates and RT-PCR confirmed the diagnosis of Covid-19. His clinical conditions worsened despite antiviral therapy and supplemental oxygen and the patient died three days after admission. DISCUSSION: this paper highlights the remarkable clinical and radiological similarity of pneumonitis causated by Covid-19 and immunotherapy, hampering differential diagnosis and corroborating the hypothesis that inflammatory molecules, and possibly PD-L1, play a central role in Covid-19 pathogenesis.","Guerini, Andrea Emanuele; Borghetti, Paolo; Filippi, Andrea Riccardo; Bonù, Marco Lorenzo; Tomasini, Davide; Greco, Diana; Imbrescia, Jessica; Volpi, Giulia; Triggiani, Luca; Borghesi, Andrea; Maroldi, Roberto; Pasinetti, Nadia; Buglione, Michela; Magrini, Stefano Maria",Clin Lung Cancer,152,1

OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the current research was to investigate the effects of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice root) on HSV-1. One of the objectives of the current research was to determine the efficacy and the effect of the elapsed incubation time of treating the Vero cells infected with HSV-1 by G. glabra. In addition, the effect of cells pretreatment with licorice root extract, preincubation of virus with licorice root extract, and the antiviral activity were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Vero cells were incubated after adding different concentrations of aqueous extracts of G. glabra. The cells were incubated during various time courses. Cytotoxicity assay, determining the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)), and incubation of HSV-1 with licorice root extract prior to viral infection were performed. RESULTS: Internal association among different experiment groups showed the significant difference in the efficacy of the extract with regard to incubation period between one and four hours, one and eight hours, four and 12 hours, and eight and 12 hours. Moreover, there was a significant difference with regard to efficacy among the pretreatment of cells with extract for two hours, incubation of virus with extract for one hour, incubation of virus with extract for two hours. CONCLUSIONS: G. glabra showed the characteristics of a novel antiviral medication; however, more in vitro experiments are needed to determine the antiherpetic activities of the G. glabra.","Sabouri Ghannad, Masoud; Mohammadi, Avid; Safiallahy, Sohayla; Faradmal, Javad; Azizi, Mona; Ahmadvand, Zohreh",Jundishapur J Microbiol,152,10

Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates macrophage signaling and activation. Acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor, was administered off-label to 19 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (11 on supplemental oxygen; 8 on mechanical ventilation), 18 of whom had increasing oxygen requirements at baseline. Over a 10-14 day treatment course, acalabrutinib improved oxygenation in a majority of patients, often within 1-3 days, and had no discernable toxicity. Measures of inflammation – C-reactive protein and IL-6 – normalized quickly in most patients, as did lymphopenia, in correlation with improved oxygenation. At the end of acalabrutinib treatment, 8/11 (72.7%) patients in the supplemental oxygen cohort had been discharged on room air, and 4/8 (50%) patients in the mechanical ventilation cohort had been successfully extubated, with 2/8 (25%) discharged on room air. Ex vivo analysis revealed significantly elevated BTK activity, as evidenced by autophosphorylation, and increased IL-6 production in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19 compared with blood monocytes from healthy volunteers. These results suggest that targeting excessive host inflammation with a BTK inhibitor is a therapeutic strategy in severe COVID-19 and has led to a confirmatory international prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.","Roschewski, Mark; Lionakis, Michail S.; Sharman, Jeff P.; Roswarski, Joseph; Goy, Andre; Monticelli, M.

For instance, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) occurred in 2019 has been plaguing many countries. Aiming at controlling the spread of COVID-19, countries around the world have adopted various mitigation and suppression strategies. However, how to comprehensively eva luate different mitigation strategies remains unexplored. To this end, based on the Artificial societies, Computational experiments, Parallel execution (ACP) approach, we proposed a system model, which clarifies the process to collect the necessary data and conduct large-scale computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies. Specifically, we established an artificial society of Wuhan city through geo-environment modeling, population modeling, contact behavior modeling, disease spread modeling and mitigation strategy modeling. Moreover, we established an evaluation model in terms of the control effects and economic costs of the mitigation strategy. With respect to the control effects, it is directly reflected by indicators such as the cumulative number of diseases and deaths, while the relationship between mitigation strategies and economic costs is built based on the [Formula: see text] emission. Finally, large-scale simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the mitigation strategies of six countries. The results reveal that the more strict mitigation strategies achieve better control effects and less economic costs.","Chen, Hailiang; Zhu, Zhengqiu; Ai, Chuan; Zhao, Yong; He, Cheng; He, Ming; Chen, Bin",Environ Res,152,5

We show that convalescent-phase sera neutralize pseudotyped viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.1.248, COH.20G/677H, 20A.EU2, and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor loss in titer. Similarly, antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer, an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses, and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by natural infection and by the Pfizer vaccine will maintain protection against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248 variants but that monoclonal antibody therapy may be less effective for patients infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2.","Tada, Takuya; Dcosta, Belinda M.; Samanovic, Marie I.; Herati, Ramin S.; Cornelius, Amber; Zhou, Hao; Vaill, Ada; Kazmierski, Wes; Mulligan, Mark J.; Landau, Nathaniel R.",mBio,152,10
