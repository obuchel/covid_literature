203,Self-Interest versus Group-Interest in Antiviral Control,2008-02-13,"Antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs.","van Boven, Michiel; Klinkenberg, Don; Pen, Ido; Weissing, Franz J.; Heesterbeek, Hans",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2592701/,106
5351,Individual Risk and Collective Fears:,2004,"Cystoisospora suis is a pathogen that causes diarrhea in pigs and can lead to serious disease. Species identification, especially by histopathological examination, is often difficult because of morphologically similar parasites such as Eimeria species. In this study, we used histopathological, bacteriological, virological, and parasitological methods to identify the cause of the disease in two piglets with severe diarrhea. Villous atrophy, diffuse necrosis, and flattening of mucosal epithelial cells were found in the ilea of examined piglets, and coccidian parasites were found in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. In some merozoites in the meronts, the presence of two nuclei indicated type 1 merozoites, characteristic of C. suis. According to Cystoisospora-specific PCR targeting the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) gene, the sequences of the products were 98.5% similar to those of C. suis. Escherichia coli (O149 serogroup) exhibiting a virulence factor profile (LT, STb, and EAST1 as toxins and F4 as a colonization factor) was detected in one piglet. No other bacteria or significant enteric viruses were found. Co-infection with C. suis and E. coli could imply aggravation of the disease, although further study is needed to assess the pathogenicity of this interaction. This study is the first to clarify by molecular analysis the sequences of C. suis detected in piglets in Japan.","Matsubayashi, Makoto; Takayama, Hideko; Kusumoto, Masahiro; Murata, Misato; Uchiyama, Yuka; Kaji, Masaya; Sasai, Kazumi; Yamaguchi, Ryosaku; Shibahara, Tomoyuki",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088846/,106

6576,Determinants of stated willingness to pay for public goods: A study in the headline method,1994,"The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses usually cause severe diseases and high mortality in infected humans. However, the tissue tropism and underlying pathogenesis of H5N1 virus infection in humans have not been clearly elucidated yet. In this study, an autopsy was conducted to better understand H5N1 virus distributions in tissues of infected humans, and whether H5N1 virus can replicate in extrapulmonary tissues. We found that the lungs had the higher viral load than the spleen, whereas no detectable viruses in tissues of heart, liver, kidney, large intestine, small intestine, or brain. Specifically, the viral load was higher in the left lung (7.1 log10 copies per ml) in relation to the right lung (5.7 log10 copies per ml), resulting in more severe pathological damage in the left lung, and lung tissues contained both positive- and negative-stranded viral RNA. However, there existed a low level of H5N1 viruses in the spleen (3.8 log10 copies per ml), with the absence of positive-stranded viral RNA. Our results indicate that replication of H5N1 viruses mainly occurs in the lungs, and the degree of lung damage is highly correlated with the viral load in the lungs. The low-load viruses in the spleen might be introduced through blood circulation or other ways.","Zhou, Jing-Jiao; Fang, Dan-Yun; Fu, Jie; Tian, Jiang; Zhou, Jun-Mei; Yan, Hui-Jun; Liang, Yu; Jiang, Li-Fang",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101767/,106
7504,"Patient Safety Tools: SARS, Smallpox, Monkeypox, and Avian Flu",2005-06-24,"BACKGROUND: For oncology nurses, compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfactions are frequently experienced psychosocial consequences of the oncology work environment. Surveying such phenomena helps to understand how nurses feel and behave when cancer care is provided. Besides, tracking the evolving nature of those three concepts can lend a hand for the early detection of personal and professional suffering of nurses while offering some healing remedies to their struggling bodies and souls. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the level of compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a group of specialized oncology nurses. Besides, this study aimed to detect some probable interesting inferences between compassion satisfaction and the concept of rest and leisure. Correlations between compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction were investigated. Correlations between oncology nurses’ scores on the three subscales and a group of demographic, organizational and leisure-related variables were examined. METHODS: This study adopted a descriptive correlation design to survey compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a convenient sample of 100 oncology nurses who work in a specialized cancer care centre. Participants completed compassion fatigue self-test developed by Figely (Compassion fatigue, New York: Brunner/Mazel. B. HudnallStamm, Traumatic Stress Research Group; 1995–1998. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bhstamm/index.htm, 1995) and a literature-based demographic survey. Analysis of data included descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation co-efficient. RESULTS: Nurses reported a low level of compassion satisfaction, moderate risk for burn out and an extremely high risk for compassion fatigue. Results revealed significant negative relationships among compassion satisfaction and the number of dependents per nurse. Additionally the correlation between compassion satisfaction and the nurses’ number of hours slept was positive. Only two components of the concept rest and leisure yielded statistical significance when correlated to the concept of compassion satisfaction. A significant negative relationship was observed between compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue while a strong positive relationship was observed between compassion fatigue and burn out. CONCLUSIONS: The studied oncology nurses sample had evidently low level of compassion satisfaction when contrasted to the significantly increased risks of burn out and compassion fatigue. Thus, health authorities and management are advised to care, in a holistic approach, for nurses who work in oncology departments. Staff-oriented services that offer comfort, reward, leisure, screening, consultation and support are urgently recommended.","Jarrad, Reem Ahmad; Hammad, Sawsan",Ann Gen Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110622/,106

Laboratories using an assay that detects only toxin A as their primary diagnostic test risk misdiagnosis of cases or outbreaks in the institutions they serve. Repeat testing can account for a significant portion of a laboratory's C. difficile testing workload.

9891,Natural variability of biochemical biomarkers in the macro‐zoobenthos: Dependence on life stage and environmental factors,2017-08-03,"Plant diversity fosters productivity in natural ecosystems. Biodiversity effects might increase agricultural yields at no cost in additional inputs. However, the effects of diversity on crop assemblages are inconsistent, probably because crops and wild plants differ in a range of traits relevant to plant–plant interactions. We tested whether domestication has changed the potential of crop mixtures to over‐yield by comparing the performance and traits of major crop species and those of their wild progenitors under varying levels of diversity. We found stronger biodiversity effects in mixtures of wild progenitors, due to larger selection effects. Variation in selection effects was partly explained by within‐mixture differences in leaf size. Our results indicate that domestication might disrupt the ability of crops to benefit from diverse neighbourhoods via reduced trait variance. These results highlight potential limitations of current crop mixtures to over‐yield and the potential of breeding to re‐establish variance and increase mixture performance.","Chacón‐Labella, Julia; García Palacios, Pablo; Matesanz, Silvia; Schöb, Christian; Milla, Rubén",Ecol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163516/,106

12837,Disparity in childhood stunting in India: Relative importance of community-level nutrition and sanitary practices,2020-09-01,"The use of cell therapies has recently increased for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (ATII) are the main cell-based therapies used for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Many pre-clinical studies have shown that both therapies generate positive outcomes; however, the differences in the efficiency of MSCs or ATII for reducing lung damage remains to be studied. We compared the potential of both cell therapies, administering them using the same route and dose and equal time points in a sustained acute lung injury (ALI) model. We found that the MSCs and ATII cells have similar therapeutic effects when we tested them in a hydrochloric acid and lipopolysaccharide (HCl-LPS) two-hit ALI model. Both therapies were able to reduce proinflammatory cytokines, decrease neutrophil infiltration, reduce permeability, and moderate hemorrhage and interstitial edema. Although MSCs and ATII cells have been described as targeting different cellular and molecular mechanisms, our data indicates that both cell therapies are successful for the treatment of ALI, with similar beneficial results. Understanding direct cell crosstalk and the factors released from each cell will open the door to more accurate drugs being able to target specific pathways and offer new curative options for ARDS.","Guillamat-Prats, Raquel; Camprubí-Rimblas, Marta; Puig, Ferranda; Herrero, Raquel; Tantinyà, Neus; Serrano-Mollar, Anna; Artigas, Antonio",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7464506/,106
14378,LEADING IN CRISIS,2020-09-01,"Patient safety is a priority in healthcare, yet it is unclear how sources of errors should best be analyzed. Eye tracking is a tool used to monitor gaze patterns in medicine. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of visual attention among critical care nurses performing non-simulated, routine patient care on invasively ventilated patients in an ICU. ICU nurses were tracked bedside in daily practice. Eight specific areas of interest were pre-defined (respirator, drug preparation, medication, patient data management system, patient, monitor, communication and equipment/perfusors). Main independent variable and primary outcome was dwell time, secondary outcomes were hit ratio, revisits, fixation count and average fixation time on areas of interest in a targeted tracking-time of 60 min. 28 ICU nurses were analyzed and the average tracking time was 65.5 min. Dwell time was significantly higher for the respirator (12.7% of total dwell time), patient data management system (23.7% of total dwell time) and patient (33.4% of total dwell time) compared to the other areas of interest. A similar distribution was observed for fixation count (respirator 13.3%, patient data management system 25.8% and patient 31.3%). Average fixation time and revisits of the respirator were markedly elevated. Apart from the respirator, average fixation time was highest for the patient data management system, communication and equipment/perfusors. Eye tracking is helpful to analyze the distribution of visual attention of critical care nurses. It demonstrates that the respirator, the patient data management system and the patient form cornerstones in the treatment of critically ill patients. This offers insights into complex work patterns in critical care and the possibility of improving work flows, avoiding human error and maximizing patient safety.

15032,Data-driven policies needed to turn the tide on diabetes,2020-11-12,"Data about variations in stroke incidence and subsequent major adverse outcomes are essential to inform secondary prevention and prioritizing resources to those at the greatest risk of major adverse end points. We aimed to describe the age, sex, and socioeconomic differences in the rates of first nonfatal stroke and subsequent major adverse outcomes. METHODS: The cohort study used linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics data from the United Kingdom. The incidence rate (IR) ratio of first nonfatal stroke and subsequent major adverse outcomes (composite major adverse cardiovascular events, recurrent stroke, cardiovascular disease-related, and all-cause mortality) were calculated and presented by year, sex, age group, and socioeconomic status based on an individual’s location of residence, in adults with incident nonfatal stroke diagnosis between 1998 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 82 774 first nonfatal stroke events were recorded in either primary care or hospital data—an IR of 109.20 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 108.46–109.95). Incidence was significantly higher in women compared with men (IR ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.12–1.15]; P<0.001). Rates adjusted for age and sex were higher in the lowest compared with the highest socioeconomic status group (IR ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.08–1.13]; P<0.001). For subsequent major adverse outcomes, the overall incidence for major adverse cardiovascular event was 38.05 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 37.71–38.39) with a slightly higher incidence in women compared with men (38.42 versus 37.62; IR ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00–1.04]; P=0.0229). Age and socioeconomic status largely accounted for the observed higher incidence of adverse outcomes in women. CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, incidence of initial stroke and subsequent major adverse outcomes are higher in women, older populations, and people living in socially deprived areas.","Akyea, Ralph K.; Vinogradova, Yana; Qureshi, Nadeem; Patel, Riyaz S.; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Ntaios, George; Asselbergs, Folkert W.; Kai, Joe; Weng, Stephen F.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7834661/,106

We sought to analyze 24-month adverse event (AE) rates, including a temporal analysis of the risk profile, associated with the thoracotomy approach for the HVAD system. METHODS: AEs from the LATERAL trial were evaluated over 2 years postimplant. Data was obtained from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support database for 144 enrolled United States and Canadian patients. Temporal AE profiles were expressed as events per patient year. RESULTS: During 162.5 patient years of support, there were 25 driveline infections (0.15 events per patient year), 50 gastrointestinal bleeds (0.31 events per patient year), and 21 strokes (0.13 events per patient year). Longitudinal AE analysis at follow-up intervals of <30 and 30 to 180 days, and 6 to 12 and 12 to 24 months revealed the highest AE rate at <30 days, with a decrease in total AEs within the first 6 months. After 6 months, most AE rates either stabilized or decreased through 2 years, including a 95% overall freedom from disabling stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Two-year follow-up of the LATERAL trial revealed a favorable morbidity profile in patients supported with the HVAD system, as AE rates were more likely to occur in the first 30 days postimplant, and overall AE rates were significantly reduced after 6 months. Importantly, 2-year freedom from disabling stroke was 95%. These data further support the improving AE profile of patients on long-term HVAD support.

Here, we map these human-wildlife conflicts across Africa. Eighty-two percent of sites containing lions and elephants are adjacent to areas with considerable human pressure. Areas at severe risk of conflict (defined as high densities of humans, crops, and cattle) comprise 9% of the perimeter of these species’ ranges and are found in 18 countries hosting, respectively, ~ 74% and 41% of African lion and elephant populations. Although a variety of alternative conflict-mitigation strategies could be deployed, we focus on assessing the potential of high-quality mitigation fences. Our spatial and economic assessments suggest that investments in the construction and maintenance of strategically located mitigation fences would be a cost-effective strategy to support local communities, protect people from dangerous wildlife, and prevent further declines in lion and elephant populations.","Di Minin, Enrico; Slotow, Rob; Fink, Christoph; Bauer, Hans; Packer, Craig",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138028/,106

This was a cross-sectional analysis of the UK Biobank cohort study of community-based adults from 22 UK centers. Linear associations were determined between neuroimaging markers (white matter hyperintensity [WMH] volume and diffusion imaging indices) and mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure (PP), both unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, antihypertensive medication, BP source, and assessment center. In 37 041 participants aged 45 to 82 years (53% female), univariable analyses demonstrated that increases in both BP components were associated with greater WMH volume and white matter injury on diffusion indices, with a larger effect for PP (standardized effect size for WMH: mean arterial BP: 0.182 [95% CIs, 0.170–0.193]; PP: 0.285 [95% CIs, 0.274–0.296]). In multivariable analyses, associations with mean arterial pressure remained similar, but associations with PP diminished, reflecting covariance with age and risk factors (standardized effect size for WMH: mean arterial BP: 0.106 [95% CIs, 0.095–0.117]; PP: 0.011 [95% CIs, −0.001 to 0.023]). The synergistic interaction between PP and age increased the effect of age on WMH and diffusion indices. Both macrostructural and microstructural white matter injury had similar associations with the pulsatile and steady components of hypertension, although PP accentuated the relationship between age and white matter damage.","Wartolowska, Karolina A.; Webb, Alastair J.S.",Hypertension,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260341/,106

Possibility of genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and reported zoonotic RNA viruses found associated previously with some Plasmodium species was explored by utilizing NCBI database. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse correlation between SARS-CoV-2 disease burden and incidence of Malaria. Our analysis also showed that a 12 base pair region encoding a part of surface glycoprotein of SARS- CoV-2 aligned with the Plasmodium associated zoonotic viral genome.

Modern high-performance networks offer Hardware-assisted tag matching and rendezvous offload to enable communication progress without involving the host CPU. However, hardware based offload cannot be used in many situations due to various hardware limitations and performance issues. Furthermore, hardware-based designs cannot provide good overlap for common communication patterns involving unexpected messages or non-contiguous datatypes. In this paper, we address these limitations by designing a communication-aware overlap engine for MPI that uses novel hardware-assisted and software-based solutions to extract overlap for both expected and unexpected messages. The proposed design adapts to the application’s communication requirements including message size, datatype, and relative timing of processes using heuristics and history-driven predictions. We evaluate the proposed designs against state-of-the-art MPI libraries and show up to 41% and 22% reduction in latency for collective operations and stencil-based application kernels on 1024 and 128 nodes, respectively, as well as 23% improvement in communication performance of the P3DFFT application.","Bayatpour, Mohammadreza; Hashmi Maqbool, Jahanzeb; Chakraborty, Sourav; Kandadi Suresh, Kaushik; Ghazimirsaeed, Seyedeh Mahdieh; Ramesh, Bharath; Subramoni, Hari; Panda, Dhabaleswar K.",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295353/,106

35367,"Developing countries, markets, and the coronavirus: two challenges",2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The syphilis epidemic continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, despite several recent disease control initiatives. Though our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the biology of the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum has improved over the last two decades, further research is necessary to improve clinical diagnosis and disease management protocols. Additionally, such research efforts could contribute to the identification of possible targets for the development of an effective vaccine to stem syphilis spread. METHODS: This study will recruit two cohorts of participants with active syphilis infection, one with de novo infection, one with repeat infection. Whole blood specimens will be collected from each study participant at baseline, 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks, to track specific markers of their immunological response, as well as to compare humoral reactivity to Treponema pallidum antigens between the two groups. Additionally, we will use serum specimens to look for unique cytokine patterns in participants with early syphilis. Oral and blood samples, as well as samples from any syphilitic lesions present, will also be collected to sequence any Treponema pallidum DNA found. DISCUSSION: By furthering our understanding of syphilis pathogenesis and human host immune response to Treponema pallidum, we will provide important data that will help in development of new point-of-care tests that could better identify active infection, leading to improved syphilis diagnosis and management. Findings could also contribute to vaccine development efforts.","Osias, Ethan; Hung, Phoebe; Giacani, Lorenzo; Stafylis, Chrysovalantis; Konda, Kelika A.; Vargas, Silver K.; Reyes-Díaz, E.

This is based on an extensive study of Syrian refugee settlement experiences in one large Canadian city (Edmonton) and one small Canadian city (Lethbridge). The findings argue that contrary to existing scholarly literature, small municipalities such as Lethbridge were more creative, nimble, and efficient in settling Syrian newcomers. In small cities, however, lack of denominational and non-denominational organizations to complement government assistance, the onset of compassionate fatigue among the city dwellers, and limited retention of newcomers due to limited employment opportunity are real threats to the settlement process immediately after newcomers’ arrival and in the long term. A more substantial role of municipal governments in the refugee resettlement process is recommended to offset the disproportionate burden settlement sector carries.","Agrawal, Sandeep; Sangapala, Pradeep",J Int Migr Integr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334125/,106

40130,Developing Countries Markets and the Coronavirus Two Challenges,2020-08-25,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse relationships of social stratification on physical activity (PA) prevalence and barriers in the European population. METHODS: Data were retrieved from Eurobarometer 88.4, a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2017 with 28,031 over 15-year-old inhabitants of the European Union. PA prevalence was calculated along with the probability to be physically inactive by social stratification. Logistic regressions were run in the inactive population to show the social class effect on each barrier adjusted by sociodemographic factors employing a propensity score matched method. RESULTS: Low social class presented higher inactivity prevalence (43.11%), whilst the high social class reported the lowest prevalence (23.30%). Also, the low (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.47–0.58) and middle (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.64–0.79) social classes were less likely to be active compared to high social class. In the inactive population, the low social class had mostly higher odds to report each barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Social class is a relevant factor for low PA, with more barriers in the lower social classes. Public health institutions should implement strategies on more influential PA barriers and disadvantaged social groups.

Based on previous research, we consider trolling as context-bound and suggest that relevance theory and common grounding theory can explain why people may attend and react to certain types of troll posts in one forum, but pay scant attention to them in another. We postulate two hypotheses on how successful (i.e., disruptive) trolling varies according to context: that trolls’ messaging strategies appear in different frequencies in political and interest forums (H1), and that context-matching strategies also produce longer futile conversations (H2). Using Hardaker’s categorization of trolling strategies on a covert–overt continuum, our statistical analysis on a dataset of 49 online conversations verified H1: in political forums covert strategies were more common than overt ones; in interest forums the opposite was the case. Regarding H2 our results were inconclusive. However, the results motivate further research on this phenomenon with larger datasets.","Paakki, Henna; Salovaara, Antti; Vepsäläinen, Heidi",Disinformation in Open Online Media,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573649/,106

It is crucial to understand why the virus transmission seems to spread more easily in some regions than others. The residuals, with respect to the modeled COVID-19 per-day hospitalized patients in intensive care unit, are correlated to the meteorological and air-pollutant variables in four major metropolitan areas in Italy during a strict lockdown implemented by the Italian government, making the analysis independent from socio-economic factors. The results show that COVID-19 pandemic–related infections are slowed down by higher tropospheric ozone concentrations and eased by the atmospheric particulate. We quantitatively assessed that higher levels of tropospheric ozone, already proven effective against viruses and microbial contaminants, play a role in flagging COVID-19 pandemic transmission. Because the tropospheric ozone production is depending, among others, by air-quality and sunlight, this can explain why the virus is spreading in different ways.","Lolli, S.; Vivone, G.",Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7737909/,106

Research is needed to examine the pandemic’s effect on informal caregivers’ caregiving intensity and burden. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was conducted to explore self-reported changes in caregiver intensity (CI) and caregiver burden (CB) due to the pandemic to identify factors associated with changes in responsibilities and burdens. In June 2020, informal caregivers providing care to someone aged 50+ (n=835) reported their current and pre-pandemic caregiving intensity and burden. Data were collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Chi-square tests were used to examine bivariate associations between pandemic time (pre vs. post) differences in CI and CB. Multinomial regression was used to assess multivariate predictors of changes to CI and CB due to COVID-19. Results showed a significant U-shaped association between initial CB and CB change due to COVID-19. Higher levels of initial CB were associated with both a significant decrease in CB during COVID-19 (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.06-1.67), and a significant increase in CB during COVID-19 (OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.05-1.43). There were no significant associations between initial CB and changes in CI due to COVID-19, although older caregivers were more likely to experience a decrease in CB due to caregiving (OR 1.02, 95%CI 1.00-1.05). These mixed results suggest that caregivers with high initial CB experienced the most extreme changes to CB due to COVID-19. Future planned analyses will focus on understanding the potential drivers behind these unexpected results.","Cohen, Steven; Kunicki, Zachary; Drohan, Megan; Greaney, Mary",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741654/,106

In this presentation, AgeLab researchers will describe findings among a sub-population of study participants deemed to be at highest health risks for the virus: adults ages 60 and over. Findings demonstrate that the largest group of participants stayed informed about COVID-19 primarily through online sources. As a result of the virus, most had made changes to their health and hygiene practices, including implementing social distancing measures, and the majority had changed at least one of their purchasing behaviors, most often buying more products than usual online. Second only to participants’ physical health concerns related to COVID-19 were their financial health concerns, both related to near-term finances and longer-term financial goals. From this study, policy and practice implications emerge across public, private, and non-profit sectors that, taken together, can prepare older adults and their loved ones to survive and thrive during global emergencies.","Miller, Julie; D’Ambrosio, Lisa; Balmuth, Alexa; Brady, Samantha; Raue, Martina; Patskanick, Taylor; Rudnik, John; Coughlin, Joseph",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7742595/,106
43728,‘Why Me?’ The Role of Perceived Victimhood in American Politics,2021-01-02,"Based on an ad hoc online survey about risk perception and preventive behaviours, we describe three chronological phases related to how people in Germany perceived the Corona pandemic between March 22 and May 10, 2020. In general, participants reported to be less concerned about their own risk than about the risk faced by others. However, a good portion of those who thought that they themselves were low risk actually wrote about their belief that they nevertheless had a responsibility to behave in ways that benefited others, even if it came at a cost to themselves. In loose reference to Immanuel Kant’s notion that humans have a rational duty to act in a socially responsible manner, we interpret people’s comments about other-regarding behaviour as an initiation of a Kantian tendency during the Corona pandemic. Based on these findings, we suggest that policy makers may do better in times of crisis than nudging, incentivizing, or compelling the public by law. They can perhaps accomplish more by (also) nurturing people’s innate sense of the need for socially responsible action to be taken in order to meet the daunting challenges of present and future crises.","Feufel, Markus A.; Schmid, Christine; Westfal, Viola",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7757079/,106
44669,Implementing a National Approach to Research Ethics Review during a Pandemic – the Irish Experience,2020-11-16,"Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to a hazardous event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires integrating a multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. To react appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and Economics to understand these dynamics. In the short run, they might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as information and misinformation accessible to individuals and the formation and revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible to individuals is, amongst others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the amount of circulating misinformation. The formation and revision of individual (and probably false) beliefs and individual fact-checking and interpretation of information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns inherent to information during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition, and motives. We argue that, to get a deep(er) understanding of the dynamics emerging from infodemics, the fields of Business and Economics should integrate the perspectives of Computer Science and Information Systems, (Computational) Linguistics, and Cognitive Science into the wider context of economic systems (e.g., organizations, markets or industries) and propose a way to do so. As research on infodemics is a strongly interdisciplinary field and the integration of the above-mentioned disciplines is a first step towards a holistic approach, we conclude with a call to action which should encourage researchers to collaborate across scientific disciplines and unfold collective creativity, which will substantially advance research on infodemics.","Leitner, Stephan; Gula, Bartosz; Jannach, Dietmar; Krieg-Holz, Ulrike; Wall, Friederike",SN Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798384/,106

This study uses a cross-sectional design, with purposive snowball sampling, for primary survey data collected over 10 weeks starting the first week in April 2020. A total of 374 adults participated in the study. Logistic binary regression was used to identify key predictors among sociodemographic characteristics, stress related to COVID-19, and perceived stress of group membership for those who reported IPV experiences. A t test was used to statistically differentiate between IPV-reporters and non-IPV reporters based on perceived stress measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. Results indicated that respondents who reported renting, lost income due to COVID-19, and increased nutritional stress were all more likely to belong to the IPV-reporters group. These findings provide insight into additional stressors related to the ongoing pandemic, such as stress due to income loss, nutritional stress, and renting, and their likelihood of increasing IPV victimization.

45977,COVID-19 and Book Publishing: Impacts and Insights for 2021,2021-02-19,"This article synthesises longitudinal deliberations between two architects and an educator, seeking common ground about learning spaces in schools. As the impetus for new and refurbished school buildings continues in New Zealand, it is timely to unpack instinctual disciplinary practices to better understand space and place in schools. We undertook a process of ‘bumping’ ideas against one another, establishing intersections around the nature of physical spaces created, inhabited, appropriated and used for educational purposes. The process of documenting our deliberations was dialogic and autoethnographic. Through interrogating ideas about space and place in literature and images, we explored how classrooms function for teaching and learning, and opportunities for both intimate and social learning and teaching. We sought to clarify how architects translate ideas about flexible learning, collaboration and whole class teaching into the design of schools and classrooms. We shared knowledge about pedagogy and architecture, and from these iterative dialogic practices, we offer ideas about educational spaces and places from those positions. As disciplinary professionals, we had internalised so much knowledge and expertise within our own fields,we realised that articulating it to others can be a struggle. We have shared the crafting of this article to partially compensate for misplacing the words to express how and why we do what we do in our own practices. We believe that it matters not only that learning spaces are designed well, but also that architects and educators can talk with rather than past each other.","Wright, Noeline; Thompson, Trent; Horne, Tim",NZ J Educ Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883886/,106

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate impressions of users who work in the intensive care unit (ICU) of APP NAS in the APP and WEB modules, comparing them with classical methods of score evaluation: printed paper (PP) and/or spreadsheet (SS). METHODS: This was a longitudinal, quantitative-descriptive study with professional nurses working in the intensive care of a University Hospital in Brazil. For the assessment test, the quality assessment process model was used, according to the NBR ISO / IEC 9126-1 standard employing the Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS). The research participants were nurses and nursing residents (n = 9) working in an ICU for at least 3 months in the institution. QUIS allows the evaluation of the following domains by grouping questions for each study group: general impressions, functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, and maintainability. RESULTS: Statistically significant satisfaction scores (p < 0.05) were observed in APP NAS when comparing to the classical methods (PP and SS) in the evaluated characteristics except for reliability. CONCLUSION: Our data showed broad approval of the APP NAS when comparing to classical methods making the software viable for implementation in ICUs of hospitals.","da Silva, Rosilene; Magalhães, Daniel Souza Ferreira",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7899621/,106

The present study proposed a new methodological approach to extract useful inherent patterns or rules for accident causation using association rule mining (ARM) of both incident narratives (unstructured texts) and categorical data. Incidents data from an integrated steel plant for a period of four years (2010–2013) are used for model building and analysis. In the first phase, the text mining approach is employed to find out the basic events that could lead to the occurrences of faults or incident events. In the second phase, text-based ARM has been used to extract the useful rules from unstructured texts as well as structured categorical attributes. A total of 23 best item-set rules are extracted. The findings help the management of the plant to augment the cause and effect analysis of accident occurrences as well as quantifying the effects of the causes, which can also be automated to minimize the human involvement.","Sarkar, Sobhan; Vinay, Sammangi; Djeddi, Chawki; Maiti, J.",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972003/,106

Despite the pre-existing need for organizationally based infrastructure to support these workers, the ongoing crisis necessitates the production of a guide for workers to access self-care procedures that are useful now. This guide seeks to intuitively organize self-care practices and procedures according to their type. It describes direct interventions for clinicians to remedy their own occupationally induced stressors, as well as provide conceptual strategies to foster sustainable resiliency-focused behaviors. Finally, this guide seeks to define a variety of self-care concepts and practices that match the range of clinicians working to stymie the pervasive effects of the pandemic. It excludes practices that conflict with CDC recommendations to prevent COVID-19 exposure and spread, such as any practice where maintaining social distance is not possible.

In education, numerous stakeholders stayed at home and their academic plans were modified and adapted to an entire virtual environment. This was the case of a live event (Science Café) whose purpose was to disseminate knowledge through Facebook and YouTube. Thus, this study aimed at verifying if there was knowledge construction in social networks through user interactions by using 1,083 comments posted by the audience. Comments were coded according to validated frameworks for language taxonomy and collaborative knowledge construction. Results show that the predominant interaction is that in which viewers pose questions to speakers. Our analyses also revealed that attendees hardly reached the highest levels of knowledge construction through unguided interaction. Often, user interactions went beyond emotional expressions towards evaluation and therefore, could reach a higher level of knowledge construction. This study shows that social networks may offer informal spaces for deliberation and collaborative interaction with the potential to support learning if guided properly. This research aims to contribute empirical evidence to the growing body of literature that online interactions in informal environments may provide productive learning.","Ocaña, Mauro; Mejía, Rebeca; Larrea, Carolina; Analuisa, Carolina; Freire, Carla","Artificial Intelligence, Computer and Software Engineering Advances",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978643/,106

However, how the virus impacts societies and government responses to the crisis raises serious criminological questions. In this chapter, I briefly address three. I will start by looking at the effects of COVID-19 and particularly the lockdowns on criminal activities. My second question is whether we should rethink our response to crimes that may facilitate future pandemics, particularly wildlife trafficking.

49591,From the Metropolitan Areas to the Post-metropolitan Dimension,2020-11-05,"Most of the proposed communication protocols exploiting the collaborative nature of WSNs and its correlation characteristics improve energy efficiency. However, they follow the traditional layered protocol architectures; specifically, the majority of these communication protocols are individually developed for different networking layers, i.e., transport, network, medium access control (MAC), and physical layers. While they may realize high performance in terms of the metrics related to each of these individual layers, they are not jointly optimized to maximize the overall network performance while minimizing the energy expenditure. Considering the scarce energy and processing resources of WSNs, joint optimization, and design of networking layers, i.e., cross-layer design, stands as the most promising alternative to inefficient traditional layered protocol architectures. The basic principle of cross-layer design is to make information available to all levels of the protocol stack. It allows the definition of protocols or mechanisms that do not meet the isolation layers of the OSI model (van der Schaar M, Shankar NS, Wirels Commun 12(4):50–58, 2005; Srivastava V, Motani M, Commun Mag 43(12):112–119, 2005). In fact, cross-layer integration and design techniques result in significant improvement in terms of energy conservation in WSNs (van Hoesel L, Nieberg T, Wu J, Havinga PJM, Wirel Commun 11(6):78–86, 2004; Yetgin H, Cheung KTK, El-Hajjar M, Hanzo L, Trans Veh Technol 64(8):3795–3803, 2015). Several researches started by focusing on the cross-layer interaction and design to develop new communication protocols (Melodia T, Vuran MC, Pompili D, The state of the art in cross-layer design for wireless sensor networks. Vol 3883, in Lecture Notes in Computer Science-Wireless Systems and Network Architectures in Next Generation Internet (EuroNGI), by M Cesana and L Fratta, Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, pp 78–92, 2005). Yet, these works either provide analytical results without communication protocol design or perform pairwise cross-layer design within limited scope, e.g., only MAC and network layers, which do not consider all of the networking layers involved in WSNs communication, such as transport, network, MAC, and physical layers. Considering the scarce energy and processing resources of WSNs, joint optimization, and design of networking layers, i.e., cross-layer design, stands as the most promising alternative to inefficient traditional layered protocol architectures. There are considerable benefits of rethinking the protocol functions of networking layers in a unified way so as to provide a single communication module for efficient communication in WSNs.","Fahmy, Hossam Mahmoud Ahmad","Concepts, Applications, Experimentation and Analysis of Wireless Sensor Networks",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980925/,106

51050,MyCOVIDRisk app: development and utilisation of a COVID-19 risk assessment and mitigation application,2021-03-30,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical and surgical wards were reassigned as COVID-19 cohort wards to accommodate the number of patients admitted with the virus. Nurses and healthcare assistants (HCAs) from various departments and backgrounds were redeployed to these areas. Within the geriatrics population, patients with severe COVID-19 often have high oxygen requirements and can rapidly deteriorate. Therefore, we conducted a quality improvement project within the geriatrics COVID-19 ward focused on improving patient safety by improving oxygen administration to patients. We also aimed to enhance the knowledge and confidence levels of nurses and HCAs in regards to oxygen administration. METHOD: From April–July 2020, we compared the oxygen that was administered to COVID-19 patients against the oxygen therapy that was documented on observation charts. This included whether the correct type of device, flow rate and target oxygenation saturations were used. We carried out multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles including a staff education session on oxygen administration, placed an oxygen guidelines poster on each patient’s bedside, administered a short quiz and distributed reminder lanyard cards. We also conducted a staff survey comparing knowledge and confidence on oxygen administration before and after an education session. RESULTS: Overall there has been an improvement in oxygen charting and administration after 4 PDSA cycles. There is 100% correct use of oxygen device and correct setting of oxygen flow rate after the 2nd and 3rd PDSA cycles. After the teaching session, all staff reported feeling more confident in oxygen management. Based on the audit data and quiz results, there was an improvement in knowledge of oxygen administration. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that by using simple time-efficient and cost-effective interventions, improvements can be made in oxygen administration and subsequently patient safety. This has the potential to influence prognostic outcomes among the geriatrics population with COVID-19.","Hickson, L; Liu, A K L; Bailey, G; Bruce, S; Kawafi, K; Reid, D; Gowda, V",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989654/,106
51535,Risky behaviour and non-vaccination,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Since the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic infection, several studies have been performed to discuss the clinical picture, laboratory finding, and imaging features of this disease. The aim of this study is to demarcate the imaging features of novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) in different age groups and outline the relation between radiological aspect, including CT severity, and clinical aspect, including age, oxygen saturation, and fatal outcome. We implemented a prospective observational study enrolled 299 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (169 males and 130 females; age range = 2–91 years; mean age = 38.4 ± 17.2). All patients were submitted to chest CT with multi-planar reconstruction. The imaging features of NCIP in different age groups were described. The relations between CT severity and age, oxygen saturation, and fatal outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: The most predominant CT features were bilateral (75.4%), posterior (66.3%), pleural-based (93.5%), lower lobe involvement (89.8%), and ground-glass opacity (94.7%). ROC curve analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff age that was highly exposed to moderate and severe stages of NCIP was 38 years old (AUC = 0.77, p < 0.001). NCIP was noted in 42.6% below 40-year-old age group compared to 84% above 40-year-old age group. The CT severity was significantly related to age and fatal outcome (p < 0.001). Anterior, centrilobular, hilar, apical, and middle lobe involvements had a significant relation to below 90% oxygen saturation. A significant negative correlation was found between CT severity and oxygen saturation (r = − 0.49, p < 0.001). Crazy-paving pattern, anterior aspect, hilar, centrilobular involvement, and moderate and severe stages had a statistically significant relation to higher mortality. CONCLUSION: The current study confirmed the value of CT as a prognostic predictor in NCIP through demonstration of the strong relation between CT severity and age, oxygen saturation, and the fatal outcome. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, this study is considered to be an extension to other studies discussing chest CT features of COVID-19 in different age groups with demarcation of the relation of chest CT severity to different pattern and distribution of NCIP, age, oxygen saturation, and mortality rate.","Metwally, Maha Ibrahim; Basha, Mohammad Abd Alkhalik; Zaitoun, Mohamed M.

The IoT-cloud-based healthcare model requirement is utmost in this situation to provide a better decision in the covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, an attempt has been made to perform predictive analytics regarding the disease using a machine learning classifier. This research proposed an enhanced KNN (k NearestNeighbor) algorithm eKNN, which did not randomly choose the value of k. However, it used a mathematical function of the dataset’s sample size while determining the k value. The enhanced KNN algorithm eKNN has experimented on 7 benchmark COVID-19 datasets of different size, which has been gathered from standard data cloud of different countries (Brazil, Mexico, etc.). It appeared that the enhanced KNN classifier performs significantly better than ordinary KNN. The second research question augmented the enhanced KNN algorithm with feature selection using ACO (Ant Colony Optimization). Results indicated that the enhanced KNN classifier along with the feature selection mechanism performed way better than enhanced KNN without feature selection.

There are limited long term data. We assessed the long-term efficacy data and safety after switching from adalimumab to adalimumab biosimilar Imraldi in patients with IBD. METHODS: A prospective single-centre observational study involving patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis switched from adalimumab originator to adalimumab biosimilar and reviewed up to 24months. Efficacy and loss of response were measured using the Harvey–Bradshaw (HB) index and partial Mayo score for patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. Blood tests including C-reactive protein, adalimumab drug levels and antidrug antibodies were monitored. We have recorded side effects and possible serious adverse effects including COVID 19 infection. RESULTS: 113 patients were switched to Adalimumab biosimilar Imraldi from Adalimumab originator between January 2019 to March 2019. After 12 months of treatment, 25 patients interrupted treatment and 89 (78.8%) continued. These were analysed after 24 months of treatment - 57 (52.3%) continued on Imraldi. Of those who discontinued, 9 were switched back to Adalimumab originator due to side effects, and 34 stopped treatment - 16 patients due to loss of response, 11 patients developed antibodies, 5 underwent a surgery, 4 were in remission and 4 did not tolerate side effects. There was no statistical difference in CRP or Adalimumab levels prior to switch, at 12 months and at 24 months between the patients who continued or discontinued treatment. Overall, 18 of the patients who completed 24 months of treatment reported side effects, most frequently pain after injection (9 patients), followed by skin rash and recurrent infections (in 3 patients each). No patient was diagnosed with COVID 19 during until now. CONCLUSION: After 24 months of follow up, 52.3% patients continued on adalimumab biosimilar and no serious side effects were reported.

Although the pathogenesis is not completely understood, endothelial inflammation is suspected to be a major causative factor for the systemic manifestations of COVID‐19. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of SARS‐Cov‐2 spike protein on pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the small airway region of viable human lungs. We verified the expression of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (Ace‐2), the receptor for SARS‐Cov‐2 spike protein, in pulmonary ECs using flow cytometry analysis and immunofluorescence labeling. Treating ECs with recombinant spike protein caused increased F‐actin stress fibers, enhanced phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2, and disruption of adherens junction continuity. In addition to the junction and cytoskeletal changes, spike protein‐treated ECs showed increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and enhanced adherence for monocytic cells. Interestingly, there was a significant accumulation of von Willebrand factor long strands on the cell surface in ECs isolated from COVID‐19 positive human lungs, as well as on ECs from normal human lungs following spike protein treatment. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the SARS‐Cov‐2 spike protein is capable of directly activating human lung ECs and promoting inflammation/coagulopathy.","Chatterjee, Victor; Yang, Xiaoyuan; Ma, Yonggang; Yuan, Sarah",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239876/,106
55778,Cultures of Victory and the Political Consequences of Foundational Legitimacy in Croatia and Kosovo,2019-10-11,"Renal ischemia is the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) that might be exacerbate lupus activity through neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and apoptosis. Here, the renal ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) was performed in Fc gamma receptor 2b deficient (Fcgr2b-/-) lupus mice and the in vitro experiments. At 24 h post-renal I/R injury, NETs in peripheral blood neutrophils and in kidneys were detected using myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE) and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), as well as kidney apoptosis (activating caspase-3), which were prominent in Fcgr2b-/- mice more compared to wild-type (WT). After 120 h renal-I/R injury, renal NETs (using MPO and NE) were non-detectable, whereas glomerular immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition and serum anti-dsDNA were increased in Fcgr2b-/- mice. These results imply that renal NETs at 24 h post-renal I/R exacerbated the lupus nephritis at 120 h post-renal I/R injury in Fcgr2b-/- lupus mice. Furthermore, a Syk inhibitor attenuated NETs, that activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; a NETs activator) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a potent inflammatory stimulator), more prominently in Fcgr2b-/- neutrophils than the WT cells as determined by dsDNA, PAD4 and MPO. In addition, the inhibitors against Syk and PAD4 attenuated lupus characteristics (serum creatinine, proteinuria, and anti-dsDNA) in Fcgr2b-/- mice at 120 h post-renal I/R injury. In conclusion, renal I/R in Fcgr2b-/- mice induced lupus exacerbation at 120 h post-I/R injury partly because Syk-enhanced renal NETs led to apoptosis-induced anti-dsDNA, which was attenuated by a Syk inhibitor.","Saisorn, Wilasinee; Saithong, Supichcha; Phuengmaung, Pornpimol; Udompornpitak, Kanyarat; Bhunyakarnjanarat, Thansita; Visitchanakun, Peerapat; Chareonsappakit, Awirut; Pisitkun, Prapaporn; Chiewchengchol, Direkrit; Leelahavanichkul, Asada",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269073/,106

Many surveys were cancelled, including those for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), the largest fishery in the United States. To partially mitigate the loss of survey information, we deployed three uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with echosounders to extend the ship-based acoustic-trawl time series of pollock abundance. Trawling was not possible from USVs, so an empirical relationship between pollock backscatter and biomass established from previous surveys was developed to convert USV backscatter observations into pollock abundance. The EBS is well suited for this approach since pollock dominate midwater fishes in the survey area. Acoustic data from the USVs were combined with historical surveys to provide a consistent fishery-independent index in 2020. This application demonstrates the unique capabilities of USVs and how they could be rapidly deployed to collect information on pollock abundance and distribution when a ship-based survey was not feasible. We note the limitations of this approach (e.g. higher uncertainty relative to previous ship-based surveys), but found the USV survey to be useful in informing the stock assessment in a situation where ship-based surveys were not possible.","De Robertis, Alex; Levine, Mike; Lauffenburger, Nathan; Honkalehto, Taina; Ianelli, James; Monnahan, Cole C; Towler, Rick; Jones, Darin; Stienessen, Sarah; McKelvey, Denise",ICES J Mar Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499815/,106

The present study evaluates the risk of postoperative deterioration and the protective potential of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IOM), with a special reference to the conus lipomas treated with the radical approach. METHODS Forty toddlers (< 24 months) underwent complete perioperative neurological and urological assessment, including urodynamic study (UDS). The dysraphisms were subgrouped according to Pang's classification. IOM was applied in all patients: transcranial motor evoked potentials (tMep) combined with mapping were recorded in all cases while bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) was evaluable just in 7 cases. RESULTS At preoperative evaluation, 11 children already had UDS impairment and 2 had motor disturbances before neurosurgery. At 1-month follow-up, preoperative motor disturbances were stable, 7/11 UDS alterations normalized, and the remaining 4 were stable. At 6-month follow-up, all motor deficits and 8/11 preoperative UDS alterations had improved. Unfortunately, 7 children with previously normal UDS experienced a new impairment after surgery: 2/7 normalized while 5/7 did not recover. This postoperative permanent urodynamic impairment occurred in 4 chaotic lipoma (CLchaos) and in one terminal myelocystocele (TMC) that means a surgical deterioration rate of 22% for the high risk cases. CONCLUSIONS This small highly selected series confirms that early de-tethering may stop or revert the spontaneous neuro-urological deterioration: in fact, preoperative UDS impairment was frequent (27.5%) and improved in all the low surgical risk cases (limited dorsal myeloschisis, filar, transitional and dorsal lipomas). On the contrary, in CLchaos and TMC, early de-tethering was unable to revert preoperative UDS impairment, and radical surgery carried a high risk of new neuro-urological deterioration directly caused by the operation. In our experience, IOM had a protective role for motor functions, while it was less effective for the neuro-urological ones, probably due to the anesthesiology regimens applied. In conclusion, among the dysraphisms, CLchoas proved to be the worst enemy that often camouflages at MRI. Affording it without all possible IOM weapons carries a high risk to harm the patient.","Valentini, Laura Grazia; Babini, Micol; Cordella, Roberto; Beretta, Elena; Destro, Francesca; Murabito, Paolo; Caldiroli, Dario; Devigili, Grazia; Selvaggio, Giorgio",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-020-04838-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728933/,106

60486,Workplace justice and intention to leave the nursing profession.,2019,"The potential of Iris pseudacorus and the associated periphytic biofilm for biodegradation of two common pharmaceutical contaminants (PCs) in urban wastewater was assessed individually and in consortium. An enhanced removal for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was achieved in consortium (59%) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (50%) and periphytic biofilm (7%) at concentration of 5 mg L-1. Conversely, individual sets of periphytic biofilm (77%) outperformed removal of doxylamine succinate (DOX) compared to individual sets of I. pseudacorus (59%) and consortium (67%) at concentration of 1 mg L-1. Enhanced relative abundance of microflora containing microalgae (Sellaphora, Achnanthidium), rhizobacteria (Acidibacter, Azoarcus, Thioalkalivibrio), and fungi (Serendipita) in periphytic biofilm was observed after treatment. SMX treatment for five days elevated cytochrome P450 enzymes' expressions, including aniline hydroxylase (48%) and aminopyrine N-demethylase (54%) in the periphytic biofilm. Nevertheless, I. pseudacorus showed 175% elevation of aniline hydroxylase along with other biotransformation enzymes, such as peroxidase (629%), glutathione S-transferase (514%), and dichloroindophenol reductase (840%). A floating bed phytoreactor planted with I. pseudacorus and the periphytic biofilm consortium removed 67% SMX and 72% DOX in secondary wastewater effluent. Thus, the implementation of this strategy in constructed wetland-based treatment could be beneficial for managing effluents containing PCs.","Yadav, Nikita; Govindwar, Sanjay P; Rane, Niraj; Ahn, Hyun-Jo; Xiong, Jiu-Qiang; Jang, Min; Kim, Sang Hyoun; Jeon, Byong-Hun",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118536/,106

METHODS Incidence and mortality age-standardized rates (ASR) were calculated, and trends were identified by determining the Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC). Five-year relative survival were estimated. RESULTS The overall incidence ASR (1996-2012) was 164.2/1,000,000 in both genders. In boys was 176.6/1,000,000, in girls it was 151.8/1,000,000. Overall mortality ASR for both gender were 69.3/1,000,000. Incidence rates (AAPC: -0.5; 95 %CI: -2.4;1.4) and mortality rates (AAPC: 0.0; 95 %CI: -2.6;2;7) were stable in the period. Five-year relative survival for all cancers were 63.9 %, with the highest survival rates for retinobastoma (83.5 %), germ cell tumors (79.8 %), and lymphomas (72.7 %). It was observed an increase in survival in the period from de 62.8 % (1996 a 2003) to 65.0 % from 2004 to 2012. CONCLUSIONS Children and adolescent cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher in Goiania, but both are stable overall. The relative survival slighly improved in the period but remained lower mainly for leukemias.","de Oliveira, Max Moura; E Silva, Diego Rodrigues Mendonça; Ramos, Fabrícia Rezende; Curado, Maria Paula",Cancer epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2020.101795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818795/,106

Social network analysis was used to analyze the key organizations and their connections in crucial response tasks. RESULTS Three national health authorities (Central MERS Management Headquarters [CMMH], Korea Centers for Disease Control [KCDC], Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW]) led the response. CMMH, which did not appear in the government's response plans, played a significant role in all 3 networks. KCDC also was involved in all 3 networks, but was most prominent in the laboratory testing network. MOHW appeared only in the patient management network. Each health authority coordinated and collaborated with distinctive types of organizations in the networks, but unclear lines of responsibilities also were found. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated that the roles and responsibilities of health authorities at the national level were fragmented and lacked clarity.

Although machine learning (ML) have shown to improve predictions on the biological potential of chemicals and accelerate the discovery of drugs over the past decade, new methods and their combinations have improved their performance and established promising perspectives regarding ML in the search for new antivirals.Areas covered: The authors consider some interesting areas that deal with different ML techniques applied to antivirals. Recent innovative studies on ML and antivirals were selected and analyzed in detail. Also, the authors provide a brief look at the past to the present to detect advances and bottlenecks in the area.Expert opinion: From classical ML techniques, it was possible to boost the searches for antivirals. However, from the emergence of new algorithms and the improvement in old approaches, promising results will be achieved every day, as we have observed in the case of SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of this study was to analyze the application value of ZIC5 in the prognosis evaluation of LC. Materials and Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of ZIC5 in LC tissues and adjacent normal controls were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Chi-square test was performed to estimate the association between ZIC5 expression and clinical features. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The prognosis analysis was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Compared with that of noncancerous tissues, the expression of ZIC5 in LC tissues was significantly increased at both protein and mRNA levels (p < 0.001). Moreover, ZIC5 expression showed a positive correlation with differentiation (p = 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.016). Survival analysis suggested that high expression of ZIC5 predicted shorter OS (log rank test, p = 0.007). ZIC5 might be an independent prognostic biomarker for LC (hazard ratio = 2.892; 95% confidence interval, 1.297-6.449; p = 0.009).

66460,How could robotics help establish a new norm after COVID-19?,2021-01-20,"Patients with kidney disease experience strikingly high cardiovascular risk in the absence of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking or elevation of cholesterol associated to low-density lipoprotein. Kidney failure remains independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes, underlining the specific adverse influence of kidney disease on cardiovascular risk. Vascular injury develops in asymptomatic patients with kidney failure early in the course of the disease. Defective arterial vasodilation, increased arterial stiffness, increased intima-media thickness, and vascular calcification develop in patients with kidney disease long before clinical evidence of cardiovascular events. Even mildly reduced kidney function is associated with subclinical vascular disease which is a predictor of worse cardiovascular outcome in patients with kidney failure, similarly to the general population and patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance is a typical feature of kidney disease that occurs during the entire span of the disorder, from mild dysfunction to the dialysis phase. Insulin resistance (or its clinical manifestations, the metabolic syndrome or its components) is independently associated with subclinical vascular injury in patients with kidney disease. Additionally, the risk for developing incident kidney disease and for rapid decline of kidney function is higher in patients with insulin resistance. Animal protein consumption increases dietary acid load and intensifies insulin resistance. Consistently, meat intake promotes diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure while consumption of plant-based food is protective against the development of vascular disease. Insulin resistance is a robust cardiovascular risk factor in the general population, patients with diabetes and patients with kidney disease.","Adeva-Andany, María M; Fernández-Fernández, Carlos; Adeva-Contreras, Lucía; Carneiro-Freire, Natalia; Domínguez-Montero, Alberto; Mouriño-Bayolo, David",Current cardiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573403x16999201210200012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305710/,106

66960,"""Slow research"" in the time of Covid-19.",2020,"More than 420,000 tonnes of plastic waste is produced every year in New York City (NYC). This plastic represents 15% of municipal solid waste in NYC and is in line with New York State and United States averages. This material is managed by NYC's dual-stream recycling system and industry-leading material recovery facilities. However, not all plastic collected for recycling (diverted) is ultimately sold to be remanufactured into new products (recovered). This study utilizes publicly available data to quantify and compare the diversion and recovery rates of residential plastics in NYC to provide quantitative context of such a process in a large metropolitan area. In 2018, 35.2% of plastics suitable for recycling were diverted, indicating a potential to improve collection. Of these, only 53.4% of plastics diverted for recycling were ultimately recovered through sale into the markets. This is aligned with the theoretical maximum recycling potential described in other scholarly work. The 53.4% recovery rate of diverted plastics indicates that an increase in diversion would not yield an equivalent increase in recovery. Additionally, barriers to the recovery of plastic waste impact the actual recycling rate. The literature and this study recognize that contamination, technology limitations, and the availability of markets all influence the sorting and selling of plastics. Furthermore, plastic recycling has recently received significant attention due to the implementation of China's National Sword policy. This study demonstrates that from 2017 to 2018, while the sales of plastics #3-7 decreased, the overall recovery rate of plastics in NYC was not impacted by China's National Sword policy.","Ventola, Vanessa; Brenman, Eliza; Chan, Grace; Ahmed, Tarek; Castaldi, Marco J","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x211009968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832354/,106

The proportion of CHC patients aged ≥65 doubled in the last ten years, yet little is known about this population. We aim to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the older adult CHC population. DESIGN Cross sectional analysis. SETTING The nationally representative 2014 Health Center Patient Survey. PARTICIPANTS CHC patients ≥55 years. MEASURES We used descriptive statistics to characterize older adults across demographic and clinical variables. To determine differences by age, we stratified into three groups (55-64, 65-74, 75+ years). We used t-tests and chi-squared to calculate p values and survey weights to make national estimates. RESULTS We included 1875 older adults ≥55 years, representing over 4.2 million people. Older adults were mostly aged 55-64 (60%), female (51%), and white (60%). The majority (73%) had Medicare or Medicaid and 47% reported fair or poor health. Regardless of age, older adults had an average of three chronic conditions and 0.6 impairments in activities of daily living (ADL). Healthcare utilization was not significantly different across age groups with most taking ≥5 prescription medications (54%) and one in five reporting ≥2 emergency department visits or ≥1 hospitalization in the last year. CONCLUSIONS Adults 55-64 who attend CHCs have similar disease burden as adults ≥65.

The heterotrophic bacterium Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134 contains several enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation, but how these enzymes work together to oxidize sulfide in the bacterium has not been studied. Using gene-deletion and whole cell assays, we determined that the bacterium uses sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase to oxidize sulfide to polysulfide, which is further oxidized to sulfite by persulfide dioxygenase. Sulfite spontaneously reacts with polysulfide to produce thiosulfate. The Sox system oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfate. Flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase enhances thiosulfate oxidation by the Sox system, but couples with the Sox system for sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the absence of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Thus, C. pinatubonensis JMP134 contains a main pathway and a contingent pathway for sulfide oxidation.Importance We establish a new pathway of sulfide oxidation with thiosulfate as a key intermediate in Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134. The bacterium mainly oxidizes sulfide by using sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, and the Sox system with thiosulfate as a key intermediate. Although the purified and reconstituted Sox system oxidizes sulfide, its rate of sulfide oxidation in C. pinatubonensis JMP134 is too low to be physiologically relevant. The findings reveal how these sulfur oxidizing enzymes participate in sulfide oxidation in a single bacterium.","Xin, Yufeng; Gao, Rui; Cui, Feifei; Lü, Chuanjuan; Liu, Honglei; Liu, Huaiwei; Xia, Yongzhen; Xun, Luying",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01835-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917752/,106

The notion of life satisfaction is related to many factors, such as personality traits, moods and various life events, and poses challenges in various aspects of everyday life. Given that mental health is one of the determinants of the quality of life of older adults, it is reasonable to conduct research among this growing group of the population. The aim of this study was to assess life satisfaction and depressive symptoms in mentally active older adults in Poland. METHODS The study covered 125 attendees at the University of Healthy Senior (UHS) and 125 auditing students at the University of Psychogeriatric Prophylaxis (UPP), organised by the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Medical University of Bialystok, of whom 78.3% were female and 21.7% male. The study was conducted using four standardised scales: the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Beck Depression Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS Seniors who participated in the study were satisfied with their lives; the average SWLS score was 23 points. Men rated their level of satisfaction higher than women: the median score on the SWLS was 26 points for men and 23 points for women. Life satisfaction and mental disorders did not differ on the basis of sex, age, or education (the type of place of education attended). As the level of depression increased, life satisfaction decreased. Statistically significant correlations of average strength were found between the point values of the four measures of depression under consideration and were evenly distributed from 0.57 to 0.69. CONCLUSIONS The high level of life satisfaction and a low level of mental disorders should be maintained in this population, and additional educational activities should be organised among seniors on a large scale. There were no differences in the distribution of psychometric measure scores among the three compared age groups of respondents in this study. Each of the questionnaires used measured of different aspects of depressive conditions, and it is worth using them in parallel rather than interchangeably.","Van Damme-Ostapowicz, Katarzyna; Cybulski, Mateusz; Galczyk, Monika; Krajewska-Kulak, Elżbieta; Sobolewski, Marek; Zalewska, Anna",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02405-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407761/,106

This review aims to summarise the evidence on the strength of the association between dietary patterns and the prevalence and incidence of COPD. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of seven databases between 1 January 1980 and 30 November 2019. Two reviewers independently reviewed each manuscript through the screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessment stages. Data from eight observational studies that met the inclusion criteria were extracted and random-effects meta-analysis was subsequently conducted. Results Eight observational studies (all eight reporting on healthy dietary patterns and three on unhealthy dietary patterns) met the inclusion criteria and data were extracted to include in the meta-analysis. Consumption of a healthy dietary pattern was associated with a lower risk of COPD (pooled OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.94). Consumption of unhealthy dietary patterns was associated with a higher risk of COPD (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.84-1.76); however, the results were not statistically significant and had high heterogeneity (I2=91%). Conclusion Our results suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with a lower prevalence of COPD, while unhealthy dietary patterns are not. More studies, particularly adequately powered longitudinal studies, are needed to further elucidate the effects of healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns on risk of COPD.","Parvizian, Michael K; Dhaliwal, Manreet; Li, Jeremy; Satia, Imran; Kurmi, Om P",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00168-2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420316/,106

BACKGROUND At present, COVID-19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world. Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. DESIGN Case-control Study. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April, 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilization group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalization. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement. RESULTS Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnea between the two groups. The variables with P < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation. CONCLUSION Clinicians may warn the exacerbation of COVID-19 facing above risk factors and associated characteristics, and adjust the diagnosis and treatment plan to delay the disease progression, reduce complications and mortality and improve the prognosis of patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Patients with certain risk factors associated with COVID-19 diseases exacerbation should be observed and targeted by using effective early interventions.","Fan, Ying; Xuefei, Wang; Zhang, Jun; Daorong, Mo; Xuexia, Xiao",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331072/,106

71324,The precarious position of postdocs during COVID-19.,2020-05-29,"Importance Cardiac injury with attendant negative prognostic implications is common among patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Whether cardiac injury, including myocarditis, also occurs with asymptomatic or mild-severity COVID-19 infection is uncertain. There is an ongoing concern about COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology among athletes because myocarditis is an important cause of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Observations Prior to relaxation of stay-at-home orders in the US, the American College of Cardiology's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Section endorsed empirical consensus recommendations advising a conservative return-to-play approach, including cardiac risk stratification, for athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19. Emerging observational data coupled with widely publicized reports of athletes in competitive sports with reported COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology suggest that myocardial injury may occur in cases of COVID-19 that are asymptomatic and of mild severity. In the absence of definitive data, there is ongoing uncertainty about the optimal approach to cardiovascular risk stratification of athletes in competitive sports following COVID-19 infection. Conclusions and Relevance This report was designed to address the most common questions regarding COVID-19 and cardiac pathology in athletes in competitive sports, including the extension of return-to-play considerations to discrete populations of athletes not addressed in prior recommendations. Multicenter registry data documenting cardiovascular outcomes among athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19 are currently being collected to determine the prevalence, severity, and clinical relevance of COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology and efficacy of targeted cardiovascular risk stratification. While we await these critical data, early experiences in the clinical oversight of athletes following COVID-19 infection provide an opportunity to address key areas of uncertainty relevant to cardiology and sports medicine practitioners.","Kim, Jonathan H; Levine, Benjamin D; Phelan, Dermot; Emery, Michael S; Martinez, Mathew W; Chung, Eugene H; Thompson, Paul D; Baggish, Aaron L",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.5890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104154/,106

Material and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 150 women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) who underwent sacrocolpopexy with (n=41) and without concomitant rectopexy (n= 109) at a single community hospital from December 1, 2015 to June 30, 2019. Preoperative Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) and urodynamic testing was used in evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse. Patients were followed for 12-weeks postoperatively and a 12-week postoperative POP-Q assessment was completed. The incidence of new or recurrent posterior prolapse was compared between cohorts. Results Patient demographics did not statistically differ between cohorts. Post-surgical posterior wall prolapse was reduced in the robotic assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) + rectopexy group compared to RASC alone, however this did not reach statistical significance. There were no patients who underwent concomitant rectopexy and RASC that needed recurrent posterior wall prolapse surgery, compared to eight-percent of patients that underwent isolated RASC procedures. Conclusion Our findings suggest a reduction in the need for subsequent posterior wall surgery when rectopexy is performed at the time of sacrocolpopexy. In our study, no future surgery for POP was found in the concomitant sacrocolpopexy and rectopexy group, while eight percent of the RASC only group required future POP surgery. Our study, however, was underpowered to elucidate a statistically significant difference between groups. Future studies are needed to confirm a reduced risk of posterior wall prolapse in patients who undergo concomitant RASC and rectopexy.","Baracy, Michael G; Richardsona, Casey; Mackeya, Kyle R; Hagglund, Karen H; Aslam, Muhammad Faisal",Journal of the Turkish German Gynecological Association,https://doi.org/10.4274/jtgga.galenos.2021.2021.0032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109716/,106

Multiple vaccine candidates with reassuring safety and efficacy profiles have advanced to phase 3 clinical trials in adults. The purpose of this review is to describe the burden of COVID-19 in children, to update pediatricians about adult COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, to discuss the importance of COVID-19 vaccine trials in children and to instill confidence in the established vaccine development and licensure processes. RECENT FINDINGS Children of all ages are at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease manifestations. Children are also susceptible to downstream effects of COVID-19, including social isolation and interruption in education. Developing a pediatric COVID-19 vaccine could prevent disease, mitigate downstream effects and enable children to re-engage in their world. SUMMARY Children could benefit both directly and indirectly from vaccination.

In view of these risks, the French drug agency (ANSM) decreed in April, 2017 the implementation of secure prescription pads. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of this regulatory measure on the prescription of zolpidem and other sedative medications (zopiclone, benzodiazepines and antihistamines) in long-term users of zolpidem and factors associated. METHODS We performed an historical cohort study using data from the Generalist Sample of Beneficiaries (EGB). All patients aged over 18 years old who were long-term users (at least 3 months) before the measure were enacted. We analysed the reimbursement trajectories of zolpidem, zopiclone, benzodiazepines and antihistamines (hydroxyzine and alimemazine) up to two years after the measure using a state sequence analysis. RESULTS Overall, 2,502 patients were analysed. A four-cluster typology was identified: continuation of zolpidem (n=1,044, 42%), discontinuation of sedative medications (n=766, 31%), change to zopiclone (n=537, 21%) and change to hypnotic benzodiazepines (n=155, 6%). The most frequently prescribed hypnotic benzodiazepine was lormetazepam. We identified age, sex, treatment for psychiatric or addictive disorder and volume of zolpidem use before the measure as factors associated to different reimbursement trajectories after the regulatory change. CONCLUSION The regulatory change for zolpidem prescriptions reduced exposure to zolpidem among long-term users and had also a broad impact on prescriptions of other sedative medications. Switching to other medications that also present a potential risk of abuse or dependence should be carefully monitored.","Istvan, Marion; Caillet, Pascal; Rousselet, Morgane; Guerlais, Marylène; Laforgue, Edouard-Jules; Gérardin, Marie; Jolliet, Pascale; Feuillet, Fanny; Victorri-Vigneau, Caroline",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506976/,106

Despite its challenges, LVR can be performed with relatively minimal patient trauma thus creating the potential for same-day discharge. Our aim was to assess the safety of day-case LVR and identify factors associated with same-day discharge. METHOD Data were prospectively collected on all patients (n = 120) from June 2008 to October 2011. Variables included demographics, perioperative details and postoperative course. Primary outcome was length of stay and secondary outcome was symptom improvement at the latest outpatient follow-up. Patients discharged the same day after LVR were compared with those who stayed overnight or longer. RESULTS Indications included rectocele and internal prolapse (47%), full-thickness rectal prolapse (44%) and other (9%). Mean operative time was 97 min, same-day discharge occurred with 23% (n = 27) and 67% (n = 80) were discharged on postoperative day 1. In terms of complications, 89% had none, 8% minor and 3% major, including one 24-h readmission for pain. Logistic regression identified younger age (P = 0.054) and private insurance status (P < 0.001) as being significantly associated with same-day discharge. Although surgical indication (P < 0.001), no prior hysterectomy (P = 0.012) and use of biological mesh (P = 0.012) had significant association they were probably confounded by age. CONCLUSION In selected patients with rectal prolapse or obstructed defaecation, same-day discharge after LVR is feasible and safe. Our analysis identified quicker discharge in the private system with younger patients. Nevertheless, in unselected patients 90% were discharged by the first operative day.","Powar, M P; Ogilvie, J W; Stevenson, A R L",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23320615/,106

METHODS Ninety-six PD patients, which included thirty-nine postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype and fifty-seven tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, were enrolled and allocated to training and validation datasets with a ratio of 7:3. A total of five types of index, consisting of mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), degree of centrality (DC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), and functional connectivity (FC), were extracted. The features were then selected using a two-sample t-test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) models based on the separate index and multilevel indices were built, and the performance of models was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Feature importance was evaluated using Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values. RESULTS The optimal SVM model was obtained based on multilevel rs-fMRI indices, with an AUC of 0.934 in the training dataset and an AUC of 0.917 in the validation dataset. The AUCs of the models based on the separate index were ranged from 0.783 to 0.858 for the training dataset and from 0.713 to 0.792 for the validation dataset.

78575,The outcome of untreated flexor pollicis longus rupture in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,2020-08-17,"This study determined whether sago porridge ingested immediately after exercise (Exercise 1) in warm-humid conditions (30 ± 1°C, 71 ± 4 % RH; 20 km·h-1 frontal airflow) conferred more rapid recovery, as measured by repeat performance (Exercise 2), compared to a control condition. Eight well-trained, male cyclists/triathletes (34 ± 9 y, VO2peak 70 ± 10 ml·kg-1·min-1, peak aerobic power 413 ± 75 W) completed two 15-min time-trials pre-loaded with 15-min warm-up cycling following >24h standardization of training and diet. Mean power output was not different between trials during Exercise 1 (286 ± 67 vs. 281 ± 59 W), however, was reduced during Exercise 2 for control (274 ± 61 W) but not sago (283 ± 60 W) that led to a significant performance decrement (vs. Exercise 1) of 3.9% for control and an improvement (vs. control) of 3.7% for sago during Exercise 2 (P < 0.05). Sago ingestion was also associated with higher blood glucose concentrations during recovery compared to control. These results indicate that feeding sago during recovery from exercise in a warm-humid environment improves recovery of performance during a subsequent exercise bout when compared to a water-only control. As these effects were larger than the test-retest coefficient of variation for work completed during the 15-min time-trial (2.3%) it can be confidently concluded that the observed effects are real.","Che Jusoh, Mohd Rahimi; Stannard, Stephen R; Mündel, Toby",Temperature,https://doi.org/10.1080/23328940.2016.1179382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28349084/,106

Perianal fistulas are the most frequent findings in fistulizing Crohn's disease. While enterocutaneous fistulas are rare, they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Detailed evaluation of the fistula tract by advanced imaging techniques is required to determine the most suitable management options. The fundamentals of perianal fistula management are to evaluate the complexity of the fistula tract, and exclude proctitis and associated abscess. The main goals of the treatment are abscess drainage, which is mandatory, before initiating immunosuppressive medical therapy, resolution of fistula discharge, preservation of continence and, in the long term, avoidance of proctectomy with permanent stoma. The management of enterocutaneous fistulas comprises of sepsis control, skin care, nutritional optimization and, if needed, delayed surgery.","Gecse, Krisztina; Khanna, Reena; Stoker, Jaap; Jenkins, John T; Gabe, Simon; Hahnloser, Dieter; D'Haens, Geert",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640613487194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24917961/,106

Diagnoses, priority levels, modes of patient's transportation, waiting times and outcomes were analysed. RESULTS During the lockdown phase, we ob-served a reduction in the access to emergency surgical departments of 84.45% and 79.78%, com-pared with the Pre-Lockdown2019 and Pre-Lockdown2020 groups, respectively. Patient's transportation, hospitalization and patients discharge with indications to an outpatient visit, waiting and total times exhibited a significant difference during the lockdown (p<0.005).

79200,Interprofessional socialisation: Insights in crisis.,2020-08-01,"The cheetah population in Namibia is the largest free-ranging population in the world and a key population for research regarding the health status of this species. We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive free-ranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences. The strong humoral immune responses to FeLV vaccination demonstrate that cheetahs can respond to the vaccine and that vaccination against FeLV infection may be beneficial should FeLV infection ever become a threat, as was seen in Iberian lynx and Florida panthers.","Krengel, Annika; Cattori, Valentino; Meli, Marina L; Wachter, Bettina; Böni, Jürg; Bisset, Leslie R; Thalwitzer, Susanne; Melzheimer, Jörg; Jago, Mark; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Hofer, Heribert; Lutz, Hans",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.00705-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25809630/,106

METHODS We used the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child/Young Adult (n = 6,315) and the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n = 3,666). Depressive symptoms were measured using five items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression scale. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 16-25 years were identified using growth mixture models. We estimated the effect of childhood family income, parental education, and parental unemployment on trajectory membership using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variances. RESULTS We identified four similar trajectories in the two countries: (1) low stable; (2) mid-peak; (3) increasing; and (4) decreasing. Relatively more Americans were in the low-stable trajectory group than Canadians (77.6% vs. 64.9%), and fewer Americans were in the decreasing group (7.1% vs. 19.1%). In the U.S., childhood family income in the bottom two quartiles was related to higher rates of increasing trajectory membership compared with income in the top quartile (incidence rate ratios: 1.59-1.79, p < .05), but not in Canada. In the U.S., parental education at a high school level was associated with higher rates of decreasing trajectory membership compared with higher education (incidence rate ratio = 1.45, confidence interval: 1.10-1.91; p = .01), but not in Canada. CONCLUSIONS Depressive symptoms may take a similar course in the transition to adulthood within these two countries.

The present study therefore aimed to compare the short-term outcomes of single-port laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for elderly patients with colon cancer (≥70 years) with those in younger patients (41-69 years; control group). Among 100 patients with colorectal cancer who had been treated with single-port laparoscopic surgery between January 2011 and December 2014, 56 (56.0%) were ≥70 years of age. The results of treatment and short-term outcomes in the elderly group (n=56) were retrospectively compared with the younger patients in the control group (n=44). The sex distribution, body mass index, history of prior surgery and the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification were similar between the groups. Onodera's prognostic nutritional index demonstrated significant differences between the elderly and control groups (38.3 vs. 49.8; P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in the mean length of surgery (219.5±73.5 vs. 201.4±76.5 min; P=0.43), estimated blood loss (32.2±74.5 vs. 36.1±90.2 ml; P=0.10), postoperative complications (10.9 vs. 7.1%; P=0.78), length of postoperative hospital stay (9.6±12.5 vs. 7.3±3.0 days; P=0.23) or number of harvested lymph nodes (21.8±24.3 vs. 22.5±11.3; P=0.87) between the elderly and control groups.

80320,Behind the Mask: New Challenges to Gaining Patient Trust.,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A crossover, double-blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate once-daily incremental vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation (IVA) training over 2 years in people with stable and chronic peripheral vestibular hypofunction. METHODS Twenty-one patients with peripheral vestibular hypofunction were randomly assigned to intervention-then-control (n = 12) or control-then-intervention (n = 9) groups. The task consisted of either x1 (control) or IVA training, once daily every day for 15 minutes over 6-months, followed by a 6-month washout, then repeated for arm 2 of the crossover. Primary outcome: vestibulo-ocular reflex gain. Secondary outcomes: compensatory saccades, dynamic visual acuity, static balance, gait, and subjective symptoms. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Between-group differences were analyzed using a linear mixed model with repeated measures. RESULTS On average patients trained once daily 4 days per week. IVA training resulted in significantly larger VOR gain increase (active: 20.6% ± 12.08%, P = 0.006; passive: 30.6% ± 25.45%, P = 0.016) compared with x1 training (active: -2.4% ± 12.88%, P = 0.99; passive: -0.6% ± 15.31%, P = 0.68) (P < 0.001). The increased IVA gain did not significantly reduce with approximately 27% persisting over the washout period. x1 training resulted in greater reduction of compensatory saccade latency (P = 0.04) and increase in amplitude (P = 0.02) compared with IVA training. There was no difference between groups in gait and balance measures; however, only the IVA group had improved total Dizziness Handicap Inventory (P = 0.006). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest IVA improves VOR gain and reduces perception of disability more than conventional x1 training. We suggest at least 4 weeks of once-daily 4 days-per-week IVA training should be part of a comprehensive vestibular rehabilitation program.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A356).","Rinaudo, Carlo N; Schubert, Michael C; Cremer, Phillip D; Figtree, William V C; Todd, Christopher J; Migliaccio, Americo A",Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT,https://doi.org/10.1097/npt.0000000000000369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369452/,106

However, the efficacy of initial AAD administration during CPR in improving long-term prognosis remains unknown. This study retrospectively evaluated the effect of AAD administration during CPR on 1-month prognosis in the SOS-KANTO 2012 study population. METHODS AND RESULTS Of the 16,164 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, 1350 shock-refractory patients were included: 747 patients not administered AAD and 603 patients administered AAD. Statistical adjustment for potential selection bias was performed using propensity score matching, yielding 1162 patients of whom 792 patients were matched (396 pairs). The primary outcome was 1-month survival. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients with favorable neurological outcome at 1 month. Logistic regression with propensity scoring demonstrated an odds ratio (OR) for 1-month survival in the AAD group of 1.92 (P < 0.01), whereas the OR for favorable neurological outcome at 1 month was 1.44 (P = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS Significantly greater 1-month survival was observed in the AAD group compared with the non-AAD group. However, the effect of ADD on the likelihood of a favorable neurological outcome remains unclear. The findings of the present study may indicate a requirement for future randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of ADD administration during CPR on long-term prognosis.","Amino, Mari; Inokuchi, Sadaki; Yoshioka, Koichiro; Nakagawa, Yoshihide; Ikari, Yuji; Funakoshi, Hiraku; Hayakawa, Katsura; Matsuzaki, Masakazu; Sakurai, Atsushi; Tahara, Yoshio; Yonemoto, Naohiro; Nagao, Ken; Yaguchi, Arino; Morimura, Naoto",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1097/fjc.0000000000000388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27002279/,106
81785,Covid-19: UK advisory panel members are revealed after experts set up new group.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Gaming disorder was included in the latest revision of the International Classification of Diseases (11th ed.). Worldwide, prevalence estimates of gaming disorder are considerably heterogeneous and often appear to be exceedingly high. However, few studies have examined the methodological, cultural and/or demographic factors that might explain this phenomenon. This review employed meta-analytic techniques to compute the worldwide-pooled prevalence of gaming disorder and evaluate the potential contributing factors for varied prevalence estimates. METHOD Prevalence estimates were extracted from 53 studies conducted between 2009 and 2019, which included 226,247 participants across 17 different countries. Study findings were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. Subgroup and moderator analyses examined potential sources of heterogeneity, including assessment tool and cut-off, participant age and gender, sample size and type, study region, and year of data collection. RESULTS The worldwide prevalence of gaming disorder was 3.05% (confidence interval: [2.38, 3.91]); this figure was adjusted to 1.96% [0.19, 17.12] when considering only studies that met more stringent sampling criteria (e.g. stratified random sampling). However, these estimates were associated with significant variability. The choice of screening tool accounted for 77% of the variance, with the Lemmens Internet gaming disorder-9, Gaming Addiction Identification Test and Problematic Videogame Playing scales associated with the highest estimates. Adolescent samples, lower cut-off scores and smaller sample size were significant predictors of higher prevalence. Gaming disorder rates were approximately 2.5:1 in favor of males compared to females. CONCLUSION The worldwide prevalence of gaming disorder appears to be comparable to obsessive-compulsive disorder and some substance-related addictions, but lower than compulsive buying and higher than problem gambling. Gaming disorder prevalence rates appear to be inflated by methodological characteristics, particularly measurement and sampling issues.","Stevens, Matthew Wr; Dorstyn, Diana; Delfabbro, Paul H; King, Daniel L",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420962851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028074/,106
81956,With hope in our hearts.,2020-05-14,"OBJECTIVES Minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) has been introduced in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, offering clinical benefits owing to reduced hemodilution and no blood-air interface. Yet, the effects of MECC on the intraoperative microvascular perfusion in comparison with conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC) have not been studied so far. METHODS The current study aimed to analyze alterations in microvascular perfusion at 4 predefined time points (T1-T4) during on-pump CABG using orthogonal polarization spectral imaging. Forty patients were randomized for being operated on with either MECC or CECC. Changes in functional capillary density (FCD), blood flow velocity, and vessel diameter were analyzed by a blinded investigator. RESULTS After start of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and aortic crossclamping (T2), both groups showed a significant drop of FCD, with a significantly higher FCD in the MECC group (206.8 ± 33.6 cm/cm² in CECC group versus 217.8 ± 35.3 cm/cm² in MECC group; P = .034). In the late phase of the ECC (T3), FCD in the MECC group was already recovered, whereas FCD in the CECC group was still significantly depressed (223.1 ± 35.6 cm/cm² in MECC group; P = .100 vs T1; 211.1 ± 36.9 cm/cm² in CECC group; P = .017 vs T1). After termination of ECC (T4), FCD recovered in both groups to baseline. Blood flow velocity tended to be higher in the MECC group, with a significant intergroup difference after aortic crossclamping (T2). CONCLUSIONS Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging data reveal an impairment of microvascular perfusion during on-pump CABG. Changes in FCD indicate a faster recovery of the microvascular perfusion in MECC during the reperfusion period. Beneficial recovery of microvascular organ perfusion could partly explain the perioperative advantages reported for MECC.","Donndorf, Peter; Kühn, Franziska; Vollmar, Brigitte; Rösner, Jan; Liebold, Andreas; Gierer, Philipp; Steinhoff, Gustav; Kaminski, Alexander",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.05.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22698563/,106

In this study, we explored the role of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-related proteins in four types of breast cancer tissues. METHODS Mitochondrial fractions were taken from four breast cancer tissues (luminal A, luminal B, Her2 -overexpression, and TNBC) and the expression of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins was observed by western blot and ELISA. In addition, the expression of hsp10, hsp60, and clpp in mitochondria was observed by western blot in breast cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, and confirmed by ELISA. The expression levels of hsp10 and hsp60 were correlated with clinicopathological parameters in 114 breast cancer patients. RESULTS We found an increase in the performance of mitochondrial polyubiquitinated proteins in breast cancer tissues of luminal A, luminal B, Her2-overexpression, and TNBC. The mitochondrial hsp10, hsp60, and clpp are abundantly expressed in breast cancer tissues rather than adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression levels of mitochondrial hsp10 and hsp60 were highest in histological grade 3 breast cancer tissues. Additionally, mitochondria with high hsp60 expression were more present in Her2-positive tumors. CONCLUSIONS We observed that mtUPR was specifically activated in breast cancer tissues but inactivated in normal mammary tissue. MtUPR had also exhibited a particular increase in Her2-overexpression tumors but not in ER- or PR-positive tumors. Taken together, we suggested that mtUPR may act as a potential candidate for developing novel Her2-overexpression breast cancer therapy.","Chen, Fang-Ming; Huang, Li-Ju; Ou-Yang, Fu; Kan, Jung-Yu; Kao, Li-Chun; Hou, Ming-Feng",Breast cancer research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10549-020-05729-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601970/,106
82380,Occlusive dressings and the healing of standardized abrasions.,2008,"PURPOSE Experimental animal models of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have shown that the updated airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) methodologies may significantly improve oxygenation, maximize lung recruitment, and attenuate lung injury, without circulatory depression. This led us to hypothesize that early application of APRV in patients with ARDS would allow pulmonary function to recover faster and would reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation as compared with low tidal volume lung protective ventilation (LTV). METHODS A total of 138 patients with ARDS who received mechanical ventilation for <48 h between May 2015 to October 2016 while in the critical care medicine unit (ICU) of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive APRV (n = 71) or LTV (n = 67). The settings for APRV were: high airway pressure (Phigh) set at the last plateau airway pressure (Pplat), not to exceed 30 cmH2O) and low airway pressure ( Plow) set at 5 cmH2O; the release phase (Tlow) setting adjusted to terminate the peak expiratory flow rate to ≥ 50%; release frequency of 10-14 cycles/min. The settings for LTV were: target tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight; Pplat not exceeding 30 cmH2O; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) guided by the PEEP-FiO2 table according to the ARDSnet protocol. The primary outcome was the number of days without mechanical ventilation from enrollment to day 28. The secondary endpoints included oxygenation, Pplat, respiratory system compliance, and patient outcomes. RESULTS Compared with the LTV group, patients in the APRV group had a higher median number of ventilator-free days {19 [interquartile range (IQR) 8-22] vs. 2 (IQR 0-15); P < 0.001}. This finding was independent of the coexisting differences in chronic disease. The APRV group had a shorter stay in the ICU (P = 0.003). The ICU mortality rate was 19.7% in the APRV group versus 34.3% in the LTV group (P = 0.053) and was associated with better oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, lower Pplat, and less sedation requirement during the first week following enrollment (P < 0.05, repeated-measures analysis of variance). CONCLUSIONS Compared with LTV, early application of APRV in patients with ARDS improved oxygenation and respiratory system compliance, decreased Pplat and reduced the duration of both mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.","Zhou, Yongfang; Jin, Xiaodong; Lv, Yinxia; Wang, Peng; Yang, Yunqing; Liang, Guopeng; Wang, Bo; Kang, Yan",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-017-4912-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936695/,106

84054,Recognizing Delirium: The Value of Having Geriatric Training as an Advanced Practice Clinician and Using a Framework of Age-Friendly Care.,2020-11-01,"Compromise in inspiratory breathing following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) is caused by damage to descending bulbospinal axons originating in the rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) and consequent denervation and silencing of phrenic motor neuron (PhMNs) that directly control diaphragm activation. In a rat model of high-cervical hemisection SCI, we performed systemic administration of an antagonist peptide directed against phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a central inhibitor of neuron-intrinsic axon growth potential. PTEN antagonist peptide (PAP4) robustly restored diaphragm function, as determined with electromyography recordings in living SCI animals. PAP4 promoted substantial, long-distance regeneration of injured rVRG axons through the lesion and back toward PhMNs located throughout the C3-C5 spinal cord. These regrowing rVRG axons also formed putative excitatory synaptic connections with PhMNs, demonstrating reconnection of rVRG-PhMN-diaphragm circuitry. Lastly, re-lesion through the hemisection site completely ablated functional recovery induced by PAP4. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that axon regeneration in response to systemic PAP4 administration promoted recovery of diaphragmatic respiratory function after cervical SCI.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Using non-invasive and only transient systemic delivery of an antagonist peptide that targets PTEN, we promoted significant regeneration of bulbospinal respiratory axons into and through a large lesion site in a rat model of cervical SCI, as well as growth of these axons back into the intact distal spinal cord for several spinal segments. We also found that these regenerating axons synaptically reconnected with their appropriate post-synaptic respiratory motor neuron targets, resulting in reconnection of the damaged neural circuit. Furthermore, by showing that re-lesion of regenerating axons resulted in complete loss of PTEN peptide-induced diaphragm recovery, we demonstrate that long-distance axon regeneration can drive recovery of respiratory function following cervical SCI.","Urban, Mark W; Ghosh, Biswarup; Block, Cole G; Strojny, Laura R; Charsar, Brittany A; Goulão, Miguel; Komaravolu, Sreeya S; Smith, George M; Wright, Megan C; Li, Shuxin; Lepore, Angelo C",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0096-19.2019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427403/,106

METHODS Five electronic databases were searched until January 2019. An a-priori diet quality index was included if it applied a scoring structure to rate child or adolescent (aged 0-18-years) dietary intakes relative to dietary or nutrient guidelines. Diagnostic accuracy studies and prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes were appraised using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist. RESULTS From 15,577 records screened, 128 unique paediatric diet quality indices were identified from 33 countries. Half of the indices' scores rated both food and nutrient intakes (n = 65 indices). Some indices were age specific: infant (< 24-months; n = 8 indices), child (2-12-years; n = 16), adolescent (13-18 years; n = 8), and child/adolescent (n = 14). Thirty-seven indices evaluated for validity and/or reliability. Eleven of the 15 indices which investigated associations with prospective health outcomes reported significant results, such as improved IQ, quality of life, blood pressure, body composition, and prevalence of metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Research utilising diet quality indices in paediatric populations is rapidly expanding internationally. However, few indices have been evaluated for validity, reliability, or association with health outcomes. Further research is needed to determine the validity, reliability, and association with health of frequently utilised diet quality indices to ensure data generated by an index is useful, applicable, and relevant.

COVID-19 diagnosis at an early stage can aid in the timely cure of patients, lowering the mortality rate. In this reported research, three-phase model is proposed for COVID-19 detection. In Phase I, noise is removed from CT images using a denoise convolutional neural network (DnCNN). In the Phase II, the actual lesion region is segmented from the enhanced CT images by using deeplabv3 and ResNet-18. In Phase III, segmented images are passed to the stack sparse autoencoder (SSAE) deep learning model having two stack auto-encoders (SAE) with the selected hidden layers. The designed SSAE model is based on both SAE and softmax layers for COVID19 classification.

88053,Living with COVID-19: Voices from the grassroots.,2021-06-03,"PURPOSE To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. METHODS Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide-compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. RESULTS Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5-31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm (2) (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. CONCLUSION Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stent-graft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain.","Eberhardt, Karla Maria; Sadeghi-Azandaryani, Mojtaba; Worlicek, Stefanie; Koeppel, Thomas; Reiser, Maximilian F; Treitl, Marcus",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/13-4349mr2.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502498/,106

88450,Effect of delay in diagnosis on transmission of COVID-19.,2020-03-11,"The growing number of industrial carbon emissions have resulted in a significant increase in the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), which, in turn, will have a major impact on climate change. Therefore, the reduction, storage, and reuse of CO2 is an important concern in modern society. Calcium oxide (CaO) is known to be an excellent adsorbent of CO2 in a high-temperature environment. However, since deterioration of the adsorbent is likely to occur after repeated cycles of adsorption under high temperature conditions, it would be desirable to mitigate this phenomenon, in order to maintain the stability of CaO. In the present study, common eggshell waste was used as the starting material. The main component of eggshell waste is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which was purified to produce CaO. Different surfactants and amino-containing polymers were added to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents with different configurations and pore sizes. The amount of CO2 adsorbed was determined using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the CO2 adsorption capacity of the synthetic CaO recovered from purified eggshell waste could reach 0.6 g-CO2/g-sorbent, indicating a good adsorption capacity. CaO modified with a dopamine-containing polymer was shown to have an adsorption capacity of 0.62 g-CO2/g-sorbent. Moreover, it showed an excellent adsorption capacity of 0.40 g-CO2/g-sorbent, even after 10 cycles of CO2 adsorption. The present study suggests that using eggshell waste to synthesize CaO-based adsorbents for effective CO2 adsorption can not only reduce environmental waste, but also have the potential to capture greenhouse gas CO2 emissions, which conforms to the principles of green chemistry.","Hsieh, Shu-Ling; Li, Fang-Yu; Lin, Pei-Ying; Beck, David E; Kirankumar, Rajendranath; Wang, Gan-Jie; Hsieh, Shuchen",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351299/,106

While most suffer from mild symptoms, some patients progress to severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated systemic hyperinflammation. METHODS First, to characterize key cytokines and their dynamics in this hyperinflammatory condition, we assessed abundance and correlative expression of a panel of 48 cytokines in patients progressing to ARDS as compared to patients with mild disease. Then, in an ongoing randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), we analyzed rapid effects of CPT on the systemic cytokine dynamics as a correlate for the level of hypoxia experienced by the patients. RESULTS We identified an anti-inflammatory role of CPT independent of its neutralizing antibody content. CONCLUSIONS Neutralizing antibodies, as well as reductions in circulating interleukin-6 and interferon-γ-inducible protein 10, contributed to marked rapid reductions in hypoxia in response to CPT.

This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on GI fellowship training. Methods A web-based questionnaire was sent out to GI fellows in Korea between 15 February and 15 March 2021. The questionnaire included questions regarding the characteristics of GI fellows, perception of COVID-19 outbreak, impact of COVID-19 outbreak, and telemedicine on the education of a GI fellowship. Results Among 111 answers, 94 respondents were analyzed. The GI fellows were provided with sufficient information about the COVID-19 outbreak (74.7%), well educated, and provided with personal protective equipment use (74.7% and 83.9%, respectively). On the other hand, outpatient schedule and volume decreased in 25.5% and 37.8% of respondents, respectively. Moreover, endoscopy sessions and volume decreased in 51.1% and 65.6% of respondents, respectively. As a result, 78.9% of respondents were concerned that the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affected their education. Telemedicine utilization was introduced during the COVID-19 outbreak, but only 20.0% and 10.6% of respondents agreed that telemedicine has benefits from the patient's and doctor's perspectives, respectively. In addition, only 25.9% of respondents were willing to continue telemedicine if adequately reimbursed, and 68.2% of respondents were concerned that it adversely affected their education. Conclusions The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected GI fellowship training in Korea for outpatient clinics, gastrointestinal endoscopy, educational conferences, and telemedicine. This study highlights that GI fellowship training needs more attention in the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shin, Hyun Phil; Cha, Jae Myung; Kim, Beom Kyung; Myung, Dae-Seong; Moon, Sung-Hoon; Song, Myeong Jun; Yoon, Seung Bae; Yoo, In Kyung; Lee, Jeong Hoon; Jun, Baek Gyu; Hyun, Jong Jin",The Korean journal of gastroenterology = Taehan Sohwagi Hakhoe chi,https://doi.org/10.4166/kjg.2021.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035196/,106

OBJECTIVE We performed a prospective analysis of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients during and after hospitalization. METHODS We enrolled 171 COVID-19 intensive care unit patients. POCUS of the lungs was performed with phased array (2-4 MHz), convex (2-6 MHz) and linear (10-15 MHz) transducers, scanning 12 lung areas. Chest computed tomography angiography was performed to exclude suspected pulmonary embolism. Survivors were clinically and sonographically evaluated during a 4 month period for evidence of residual lung injury. Chest computed tomography angiography and echocardiography were used to exclude pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chest high-resolution-computed-tomography to exclude interstitial lung disease (ILD) in symptomatic survivors. RESULTS Cox regression analysis showed that lymphocytopenia (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.68-0.96, p = 0.048), increased lactate (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.46, p = 0.049), and D-dimers (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.03-1.44, p = 0.03) were mortality predictors. Non-survivors had increased incidence of pulmonary abnormalities (B-lines, pleural line irregularities, and consolidations) compared to survivors (p < 0.05). During follow-up, POCUS with clinical and laboratory parameters integrated in the semi-quantitative Riyadh-Residual-Lung-Injury scale had sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.89) and specificity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.94-0.95) in predicting ILD.

Our preliminary deep sequencing analysis showed altered expression of CTBP1-AS2 in osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, CTBP1-AS2 was inversely correlated with miR-130a. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in OA. METHODS Synovial fluid was collected from 62 OA patients and 62 healthy controls. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression levels of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in synovial fluid. Cell transfections were performed to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to assess the effects of CTBP1-AS2 on the methylation of miR-130a. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the roles of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in regulating proliferation of chondrocytes. RESULTS The results showed that CTBP1-AS2 was upregulated in OA and inversely correlated with miR-130a. In chondrocytes of OA patients, overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to increased methylation of miR-130a gene and downregulated expression of miR-130a, while overexpression of miR-130a did not affect the expression of CTBP1-AS2. In contrast, no interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a was observed in chondrocytes from healthy adults. Analysis of chondrocyte proliferation showed that overexpression of miR-130a led to increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes extracted from OA patients. Overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to decreased proliferation rate of chondrocytes and reversed the effects of overexpressing miR-130a. CONCLUSION Therefore, CTBP1-AS2 is upregulated in OA and may increase the methylation of miR-130a gene to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation.Key Points• CTBP1-AS2 is overexpressed in OA and may downregulate miR-130a through methylation to suppress the proliferation of chondrocytes.• The interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a is indirect and mediated by certain pathological mediators.","Zhang, Hongfei; Li, Jinglian; Shao, Weiguang; Shen, Naipeng",Clinical rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05113-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388751/,106

When controlling for various factors, treatment with a combination of antipsychotics including clozapine (OR = 2.28, 95% CI, 1.13-4.62, P = .022) and clozapine alone (OR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.30-4.32, P = .005) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia-related hospitalization compared to treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine alone. Conclusions The findings of this study in combination with other published literature support an association of an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of clozapine, although this cannot be interpreted as causal. These data show that use of clozapine alone or in combination with other antipsychotics significantly increases risk of pneumonia, although this finding cannot be deemed causal due to study design.","Milano, Victoria R; Kayhart, Bryce M; Morgan, Robert J; DeSimone, Daniel C; Mara, Kristin C; Leung, Jonathan G",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,https://doi.org/10.4088/pcc.20m02594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767873/,106
92294,Covid-19: Government to issue new guidance on DNAR orders after legal challenge.,2020-07-15,"As in other areas of the health system, COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on hospital compounding. This area has faced numerous challenges, including the shortage of frequent-use products (hydroalcoholic solutions, lopinavir/ritonavir suspension), the use of new preparations for SARS-CoV-2 (tocilizumab, remdesivir), or requests from overwhelmed wards unable to assume the safe preparation of a high volume of medications (intravenous solutions). The demand for all types of preparations (topic and oral medications, intravenous solutions) has increased dramatically. This increase has highlighted the shortage of resources allocated to this area, which has made it difficult to meet the high demand for preparations. In addition, the pandemic has revealed the scarcity of research on such basic aspects as agent stability and drug compatibility. One of the most relevant conclusions drawn from the COVID-19 pandemic is that the basic areas of hospital pharmacy, along with other, must be maintained and reinforced, as these are the areas that make us essential.","Alonso-Herreros, José María; Berisa-Prado, Silvia; Cañete-Ramírez, Carme; Dávila-Pousa, Carmen; Flox-Benítez, María Del Pilar; Ladrón de Guevara-García, Margarita; López-Cabezas, Carmen; Martín de Rosales-Cabrera, Ana María; Ramos-Martínez, Beatriz",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533671/,106

Endovascular techniques have emerged as preferable alternatives to surgical ligation for treatment of CBS. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study periprocedural complications and outcomes of CBS patients treated with coil embolization and covered stents. METHODS A comprehensive literature search identified studies that reported outcomes of endovascular treatment of CBS published from 2000 to April 2016. Outcomes included technical success, postoperative rebleeding, survival time, and perioperative complications. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS Twenty-five noncomparative studies with 559 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Technical success rate was 100% in both coiling and covered stenting groups. Median survival time was 3 months (range, 0-96 months) for all CBS patients. Overall perioperative mortality was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%-17%). Postoperative rebleeding rate was 27% (95% CI, 19%-367%). Perioperative stroke and infection rates were 3% (95% CI, 1%-6%) and 1% (95% CI, 0%-5%), respectively. At last follow-up, 39% of patients were alive (95% CI, 29%-48%). CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization and stent grafts may both be safe treatment options for CBS with few perioperative complications and high rates of technical success, but prognosis after treatment remains poor. In general, noncomparative studies do not demonstrate differences between the two techniques with respect to periprocedural complications and patient outcomes.","Bond, Kamila M; Brinjikji, Waleed; Murad, Mohammed H; Cloft, Harry J; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2016.11.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236928/,106
92754,A stochastic compartmental model to simulate the Covid-19 epidemic spread on a simple network.,2020-01-01,"OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to discover unknown differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), analyze their functions and enriched signaling pathways, and identify hub genes correlating with BPD incidence and evolvement. RESULTS Of 1289 DEGs identified, 568 were downregulated and 721 were upregulated. The DEGs were mainly associated with oxidative stress, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix, inflammation, cell cycle, and protein binding. Eight DEGs were identified as hub genes, including C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (Cxcl5), connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), interleukin 6 (IL6), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (Mapk14), platelet and endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (Timp1), and TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (Timp2). IL6 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of neonates with BPD. CONCLUSIONS Hence, BPD involves complex biological changes. Our findings indicate that inflammation and angiogenesis may play major roles in BPD pathogenesis and that IL6 has the potential to serve as a biomarker for early BPD diagnosis.","Yan, Weiheng; Jiang, Miaomiao; Zheng, Jun",Biotechnology letters,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10529-020-02986-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803430/,106

These heterostructures were prepared using a novel low temperature (100 °C) nonhydrothermal low power microwave (300 W) assisted method. Formation of interband C 2p states was found to be responsible for the band gap narrowing of the carbon doped heterojunctions. The most active photocatalyst obtained after 60 min of microwave irradiation exhibits a 2-fold higher visible-light induced photocatalytic activity in contrast to the standard commercial photocatalyst Evonik-Degussa P-25. Staphylococcus aureus inactivation rate constant for carbon-doped nano-heterojunctions and the standard photocatalyst was 0.0023 and -0.0081 min(-1), respectively. It is proposed that the photoexcited electrons (from the C 2p level) are effectively transferred from the conduction band of brookite to that of anatase causing efficient electron-hole separation, which is found to be responsible for the superior visible-light induced photocatalytic and antibacterial activities of carbon-doped anatase-brookite nano-heterojunctions.","Etacheri, Vinodkumar; Michlits, Georg; Seery, Michael K; Hinder, Steven J; Pillai, Suresh C",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/am302676a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379473/,106

Current management strategies, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, can be efficacious but these therapies put patients at risk for toxicities associated with invasive forms of support. Areas covered: In this manuscript, we discuss intravenous oxygen (IVO2), a novel method to improve oxygen delivery that involves intravenous administration of a physiologic solution containing dissolved oxygen at hyperbaric concentrations. After a brief review of the physiology behind supersaturated fluids, we summarize the current evidence surrounding IVO2. Expert commentary: Although not yet at the stage of clinical testing in the United States and Europe, IVO2 has been used safely in Asia. Furthermore, preliminary laboratory data have been encouraging, suggesting that IVO2 may play a role in the management of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure in years to come. However, significantly more work needs to be done, including definitive evidence that such a therapy is safe, before it can be included in an intensivist's arsenal for hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Gehlbach, Jonathan A; Rehder, Kyle J; Gentile, Michael A; Turner, David A; Grady, Daniel J; Cheifetz, Ira M",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2017.1267568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27910706/,106

We herein report our experience with the use of SPLS for total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (RP/IPAA). METHODS All patients who underwent a RP/IPAA using SPLS between June and September 2009 were identified from a prospectively maintained laparoscopic database. All procedures were performed with the use of a 5-mm Olympus EndoEye™ and traditional laparoscopic instruments via a SILS™ port placed at the planned ileostomy site. RESULTS There were five patients (3 male) included in the study. Median age was 43 years (range=13-47 years). Median body mass index was 20.66 kg/m2 (range=14.63-25.97 kg/m2). Diagnoses included ulcerative colitis (n=4) and familial adenomatous polyposis (n=1). Median ASA score was 2 (range=1-3). Median operative time was 153 min (range=132-278 min). Median estimated blood loss was 100 ml (range=50-200 ml). There were no conversions to either a conventional laparoscopic or an open procedure. Median time to return of bowel function was 2 days. Median length of stay was 4 days (range=3-6 days). Postoperative complications included two patients with partial small-bowel obstructions. Both resolved with conservative management. All patients had their ileostomies closed. CONCLUSION RP/IPAA using SPLS is a safe technique. Additional studies are needed to compare SPLS to conventional laparoscopy and open surgery with respect to operative times, convalescence, and outcomes.","Geisler, Daniel P; Kirat, Hasan T; Remzi, Feza H",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1518-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21197548/,106

Mean follow-up was 8 (range 1-14) months. RESULTS Technical success reached 100%. Complications (one major and one minor) occurred in two cases. Complete ablation, obtained in 68.4% of cases, showed no significant correlation with either cancer histological type or with lesion diameter. At follow-up, treatment failures occurred in 60% of cases; lesion diameter was the only prognostic factor for maintaining complete ablation. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary results should encourage further trials of this technique.

DESIGN Mixed-method systematic review. DATA SOURCES CINAHL, Medline, PsychINFO, and SocINDEX (January 2007-February 2018). REVIEW METHODS Papers were screened by two independent reviewers using an online screening tool and data were extracted using a standardized data extraction table. Parallel-results convergent synthesis was used to synthesize evidence from included qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies. Quality appraisal and risk of bias assessment were conducted. RESULTS Fifteen studies were included with three main themes and six sub-themes: (a) programme impact (impact on ward-level and senior nurses and impact on nursing students and educators); (b) programme characteristics (characteristics leading to positive outcomes and characteristics leading to negative outcomes); and (c) programme implementation (implementation barriers and implementation facilitators). Compassionate care education programmes helped enhance nurses' ability to engage in reflective practice, deal with clinical challenges, and gain confidence. The importance of nurturing compassionate care delivery in nursing education was highlighted in the literature. Various nursing-level, patient-level, and organizational barriers to compassionate care delivery were identified. CONCLUSION The impact of compassionate care educational programmes on nurses was predominantly positive. Further evaluation of the long-term impact of these programmes on nurses, patients, and organizations is warranted. IMPACT Optimal delivery of compassionate care can be achieved by building organizational infrastructures that support nurses from all levels to attend education programmes and lead on compassionate care delivery.","Coffey, Alice; Saab, Mohamad M; Landers, Margaret; Cornally, Nicola; Hegarty, Josephine; Drennan, Jonathan; Lunn, Cora; Savage, Eileen",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162701/,106

BACKGROUND The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. APPLICATION The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","Wang, Xiaomei; Markert, Carl; Sasangohar, Farzan",Human factors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720821998110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682467/,106

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a comprehensive literature search for studies on the endovascular treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms. From each study we abstracted the following data: immediate occlusion, long-term occlusion, long-term good neurologic outcome, perioperative morbidity, perioperative mortality, rebleed (ruptured only), recurrence, and retreatment. We performed subgroup analyses of patients undergoing deconstructive-versus-reconstructive techniques. Meta-analysis was performed by using a random effects model. RESULTS Seventeen studies with 478 patients were included in this analysis. Sixteen studies had at least 6 months of clinical/angiographic follow-up. Endovascular treatment was associated with high rates of long-term occlusion (87.0%; 95% CI, 74.0%-94.0%) and low recurrence (7.0%; 95% CI, 5.0%-10.0%) and retreatment rates (3.0%; 95% CI, 2.0%-6.0%). Long-term good neurologic outcome was 84.0% (95% CI, 65.0%-94.0%). Deconstructive techniques were associated with higher rates of long-term complete occlusion compared with reconstructive techniques (88.0%; 95% CI, 35.0%-99.0% versus 81.0%; 95% CI, 64.0%-91.0%; P < .0001). Deconstructive and reconstructive techniques were both associated with high rates of good neurologic outcome (86.0%; 95% CI, 68.0%-95.0% versus 92.0%; 95% CI, 86.0%-95.0%; P = .10). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of vertebrobasilar dissecting aneurysms is associated with high rates of complete occlusion and good long-term neurologic outcomes. Deconstructive techniques are associated with higher occlusion rates. There was no statistical difference in neurologic outcomes between groups, possibly due to low power.","Sönmez, Ö; Brinjikji, W; Murad, M H; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. METHODS A cohort of 158 employees, who were identified as high risk to respiratory biohazard exposure, were invited to participate in the RPP. We provided a bundle of interventions, which included an online training package, and mandatory quantitative fit testing. The main outcomes included the participants' knowledge and attitude toward respiratory protection equipment (RPE), which were assessed via an online survey. Their donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques on four different types of N95 respirators were also assessed by an observer using a pre-determined marking sheet. We compared these outcomes before and after participation in the program. RESULTS There was a total of 125 participants, all of whom completed the knowledge and attitude assessment, and 69 completed the skill assessment before and after the program. There was a statistically significant improvement in their knowledge scores, donning and doffing skills, and user seal check techniques after participation in the RPP. Participants also reported significant increased level of confidence in their RPE knowledge, training and skills; and workplace safety. CONCLUSION This initial report of the implementation of a novel RPP in a Victorian major tertiary hospital provides guidance on the benefits to respiratory protection, staff knowledge, skills, confidence and morale that can be acquired from a scalable online training package combined with mandatory quantitative fit testing.","Williams, D; Kave, B; Begg, F; Marshall, C; Segal, R; Ng, I","Infection, disease & health",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2021.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176771/,106

Consistent with these studies, this qualitative framing analysis assesses how obesity is framed in more recent mainstream news coverage. Framing patterns identified in this analysis represent a notable departure from those identified in earlier studies, specifically as relevant to troubling the individual/environmental attribution binary that historically has characterized public discourse around obesity, in particular, and health more broadly. These findings signal important shifts for contemporary cultural attitudes toward obesity and, accordingly, public health policies designed to redress the issue.

96962,Serology assays to manage COVID-19.,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND The natural history and optimal treatment of upper extremity (UE) deep venous thromboses (DVT's) remains uncertain as does the clinical significance of catheter-associated (CA) UE DVT's. We sought to analyze predictors of UE DVT resolution and hypothesized that anticoagulation will be associated with quicker UE DVT clot resolution and that CA UE DVT's whose catheters are removed will resolve more often than non-CA UE DVT's. METHODS All patients on the surgical intensive care unit service were prospectively followed from January 2008 to May 2010. A standardized DVT prevention protocol was used and screening bilateral UE and lower extremity duplex examinations were obtained within 48 hours of admission and then weekly. Computed tomography angiography for pulmonary embolism was obtained if clinically indicated. Patients with UE DVT were treated according to attending discretion. Data regarding patient demographics and UE DVT characteristics were recorded: DVT location, catheter association, occlusive status, treatment, and resolution. The primary outcome measure was UE DVT resolution before hospital discharge. Interval decrease in size on the subsequent duplex after UE DVT detection was also noted. UE DVTs without a follow-up duplex were excluded from the final analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify independent predictors of UE DVT resolution. RESULTS There were 201 UE DVT's in 129 patients; 123 DVTs had a follow-up duplex and were included. Fifty-four percent of UEDVTs improved on the next duplex, 60% resolved before discharge, and 2% embolized. The internal jugular was the most common site (52%) and 72% were nonocclusive. Sixty-four percent were CAUEDVT's and line removal was associated with more frequent improvement on the next duplex (55% vs. 17%, p = 0.047, mid-P exact). Sixty-eight percent of UEDVTs were treated with some form of anticoagulation, but this was not associated with improved UE DVT resolution (61% vs. 60%). Independent predictors of clot resolution were location in the arm (odds ratio = 4.1 compared with the internal jugular, p = 0.031) and time from clot detection until final duplex (odds ratio =1.052 per day, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION A majority of UE DVT's are CA, more than half resolve before discharge, and 2% embolize.

More recently, a porcine dermal matrix injection has been proposed as infill biomaterial to treat fistulas. METHODS We propose a novel approach consisting in non-cutting seton positioning followed by flap repair associated with dermal matrix injection into the fistula tracts after several weeks. RESULTS We report our experience with this two-staged procedure on 11 consecutive patients with recurrent high trans-sphincteric fistulas with a minimum follow-up of 6 months.

The title compounds were evaluated for their in vivo bronchodilator activity on guinea pigs. All the test compounds exhibited good protection against histamine-induced bronchospasm. The structure-activity relationships based on the results obtained for these series were studied. Incorporation of an aryl ring with halo substitution to the theophylline bioisostere increases its potency.

A 35-year-old man underwent LDLT using a right lobe graft as an aid for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in 2005. Follow-up endoscopic and computed tomography (CT) examinations showed esophagogastric varices with splenomegaly in 2009 that increased (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], medium in number and intermediate between localized and circumferential red color signs [RC2]; gastric varices [GV]: extension from the cardiac orifice to the fornix [Lg-cf], moderator enlarged, beady varices [F2], absent red color signs [RC0]). A portal venous flow to the esophagogastric varices through a large left gastric vein was also confirmed. Preoperative Child-Pugh was grade B and score was 9. Because these esophagogastric varices had a high risk of variceal bleeding, we proceeded with a laparoscope-assisted Hassab's operation. Operative time was 464 minutes. Blood loss was 1660 mL. A graft liver biopsy was also performed and recurrence of PSC was confirmed histologically. It was suggested that portal hypertension and esophagogastric varices were caused by recurrence of PSC. Postoperative complications were massive ascites and enteritis. Both of them were treated successfully. This patient was discharged on postoperative day 43. Follow-up endoscopic study showed improvement in the esophagogastric varices (esophageal varices [EV]: locus superior [Ls], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0], gastric varices [GV]: adjacent to the cardiac orifice [Lg-c], no varicose appearance [F0], absent red color signs [RC0]) at 6 months after the operation. We also confirmed the improvement of esophagogastric varices by serial examinations of CT.","Kobayashi, T; Miura, K; Ishikawa, H; Oya, H; Sato, Y; Minagawa, M; Sakata, J; Takano, K; Takizawa, K; Nogami, H; Kosugi, S-I; Wakai, T",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2013.10.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767398/,106

We used a physical model for simulation to explore fire safety through a series of ignition trials. An HFNO device was attached to a 3D-printed nose with nostrils connected to a degutted raw chicken. The HFNO device was set at twenty combinations of different oxygen concentration and gas flow rate. An electrocautery and diode laser were applied separately to a fat cube in the cavity of the chicken. Ten 30 s trials of continuous energy source application were conducted. An additional trial of continuous energy application was conducted if no ignition was observed for all the ten trials. A total of eight short flashes were observed in one hundred electrocautery tests; however, no continuous fire was observed among them. There were thirty-six events of ignition in one hundred trials with laser, twelve of which turned into violent self-sustained fires. The factors found to be related to a significantly increased chance of ignition included laser application, lower gas flow, and higher FiO2. The native tissue and smoke can ignite and turn into violent self-sustained fires under HFNO and continuous laser strikes, even in the absence of combustible materials. The results suggest that airway surgeries must be performed safely with HFNO if only a short intermittent laser is used in low FiO2.","Chang, Man-Yun; Chen, Jui-Hung; Lin, Shih-Pin; Teng, Wei-Nung; Liao, Shu-Wei; Ting, Chien-Kun; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Chiang, Hui-Hua Kenny; Su, Fu-Wei",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-021-00690-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783692/,106

99740,"[2020, Year of nurses and Year of COVID-19].",2020,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations on the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and is associated with chronic infection and inflammation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that LPS-induced CFTR dysfunction in airway epithelial cells is due to an early oxidative stress. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an approved anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant drug for auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, but its role in the CF has never been investigated. In this study, we examined the effect of DMF on CF-related cytokines expression, ROS measurements and CFTR channel function. We found that DMF reduced the inflammatory response to LPS stimulation in both CF and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells, both as co-treatment and therapy, and restored LPS-mediated decrease of Trikafta™-mediated CFTR function in CF cells bearing the most common mutation, c.1521_1523delCTT (F508del). DMF also inhibited the inflammatory response induced by IL-1β/H2O2 and IL-1β/TNFα, mimicking the inflammatory status of CF patients. Finally, we also demonstrated that DMF exhibited an anti-oxidant effect on CF cells after different inflammatory stimulations. Since DMF is an approved drug, it could be further investigated as a novel anti-inflammatory molecule to ameliorate lung inflammation in CF and improve the CFTR modulators efficacy.","Laselva, Onofrio; Allegretta, Caterina; Di Gioia, Sante; Avolio, Carlo; Conese, Massimo",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10082132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440900/,106

Endoscopic therapy with argon plasma coagulation (APC) is widely used for treatment of GAVE, but most patients continue to require repeated blood transfusions and multiple endoscopic procedures (refractory GAVE). We describe our initial experience regarding safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy in treating patients with refractory GAVE. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively enrolled seven patients with refractory GAVE who had multiple prior treatments with APC. These patients were treated with RFA (HALO90 ULTRA Ablation Catheter System; Covidien, GI Solutions, Sunnyvale, CA) at Ertan Digestive Disease Center at our tertiary University Hospital. RESULTS Seven patients underwent a total of 12 RFA procedures for treatment of refractory GAVE. The median number of RFA procedures was 2 (Range, 1 - 3). Average pre- and post-procedural hemoglobin were 9.3 g/dL and 10.16 g/dL, respectively. Five of seven patients (71 %) were transfusion-free after the RFA treatments while two patients continued to require blood transfusions. There were no complications in this series. CONCLUSION RFA can be an effective alternative to APC for treatment of GAVE refractory to previous endoscopic therapy. Additional studies are needed to identify which subset of patients will benefit the most with RFA treatment.","Jana, Tanima; Thosani, Nirav; Fallon, Michael B; Dupont, Andrew W; Ertan, Atilla",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1391323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26135652/,106

Eleven studies only included female participants, while four included both male and female participants. The fifteen studies unanimously concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic caused negative psychological impacts on fertility care. Risk factors included female sex, single marital state, previous ART failure, prior diagnoses of anxiety or depression, and length of time trying to conceive. Specific concerns included the worry and frustration of clinic closure, concerns about pregnancy and COVID-19 infection, and advancing age. There were contrasting beliefs on whether the decision to stop fertility treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic was justified. In addition, we found that many patients preferred to resume fertility treatment, despite anxieties regarding the risk of the COVID-19 virus. We recommend that fertility providers screen patients for risk factors for poor mental health and tailor support for virtual care.","Kirubarajan, Abirami; Patel, Priyanka; Tsang, Jackie; Prethipan, Theebhana; Sreeram, Padmaja; Sierra, Sony",Human fertility,https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2021.1938245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114919/,106

Cold-induced reduction in endothelial barrier function may play a role. β(2)-adrenergic activation elevates cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which maintains endothelial barrier properties. In this study, we tested whether β-adrenergic stimulation could influence the increase in fluid extravasation observed during hypothermic CPB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fourteen pigs randomly received terbutaline infusion (T-group) (n=7) or a control infusion (C-group) (n=7). All animals were given 60 min of normothermic CPB, followed by 90 min of hypothermic CPB. Fluid input and losses, plasma volume, colloid osmotic pressures (plasma, interstitial fluid), hematocrit, serum proteins and total tissue water content were measured and the fluid extravasation rates (FER) calculated. STATISTICS by SPSS. Values presented as mean ± SD. Repeated measure analysis of variance was performed and a t-test used when appropriate. RESULTS The commencement of normothermic CPB resulted in a 20% hemodilution, with an abrupt increase in fluid requirements during the first 10 min. FER increased from 0.18 (0.06) pre-bypass to 0.78 (0.27) ml/kg/min (T-group) (p=0.002) and from 0.16 (0.05) to 0.93 (0.26) ml/kg/min (C-group) (p<0.001) with no between-group differences. Thereafter, FER stabilized at a level of 0.32 (0.13) and 0.27 (0.14) ml/kg/min in the T-group and C-group, respectively. After the start of cooling, FER increased in the T-group to 0.55 (0.12) ml/kg/min (P=0.046) and in the C-group to 0.54 (0.13) ml/kg/min (P=0.006), with no between-group differences (P=0.738). CONCLUSION In the present experimental study, we were unable to demonstrate any clinically relevant modulating effect of terbutaline on fluid extravasation during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.","Husby, P; Brekke, H K; Mongstad, A; Farstad, M; Haugen, O; Kvalheim, V L",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659112450308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711715/,106

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess whether anti-cancer therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy will increase the severity and mortality of cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The search timeperiod was from 1st of December 2019 to 23rd of January 2021, to identify observational studies that compared the disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients receiving and not receiving anti-cancer therapy. Two independent reviewers used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of the included studies.

We aimed to investigate how neurointerventionalists perceive the importance and frequency of errors and the resulting complications in endovascular UIA treatment, and which steps could be taken to prevent them. METHODS An international multidisciplinary survey was conducted among neurointerventionalists. Participants provided their demographic characteristics and neurointerventional treatment volume. They were asked about their perceptions on the importance and frequency of different errors in endovascular UIA treatment, and which solutions they thought to be most effective in preventing these errors. RESULTS Two-hundred-thirty-three neurointerventionalists from 38 countries participated in the survey. Participants identified errors in technical execution as the most common source of complications in endovascular UIA treatment (40.4% thought these errors constituted a relatively or very large proportion of all complication sources), closely followed by errors in decision-making/indication (32.2%) and errors related to management of unexpected events (28.4%). Simulation training was thought to be most effective in reducing technical errors, while cognitive errors were believed to be best minimized by abandoning challenging procedures, more honest discussion of complications and better standardization of procedure steps. CONCLUSION Neurointerventionalists perceived both technical and cognitive errors to be important sources of complications in endovascular UIA treatment. Simulation training, a cultural change, higher acceptance of bail-out strategies and better standardization of procedures were perceived to be most effective in preventing these.","Ospel, Johanna Maria; Kashani, Nima; Mayank, Arnuv; Cimflova, Petra; Heran, Manraj; Pandey, Sachin; Peeling, Lissa; Gopinathan, Anil; Lopes, Demetrius; Kocer, Naci; Goyal, Mayank","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019920947857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727309/,106

Topsoil samples near the refinery had high Sb levels (∼3250 mg kg-1) but relatively low concentrations of other toxic metal(loid)s. However, several soil samples taken at greater depth from the near-field landfill site contained high concentrations of As and Pb, as well as extremely high Sb contents (∼21,400 mg kg-1). X-ray absorption fine structure analysis showed that Sb in the soils from both sites was present as Sb(V) in the form of tripuhyite (FeSbO4), a stable mineral. Three-dimensional principal coordinate analysis showed that microbial community compositions in samples with high toxic metal(loid)s concentrations were significantly different from other samples and had lower microbial populations (∼104 MPN g-1). Sequential extraction results revealed that Sb is present primarily in the stable residual fraction (∼99 %), suggesting low Sb bioavailability. However, microbial redundancy analysis suggested that the more easily extractable Pb might be the major factor controlling microbial community compositions at the site.","Park, Soo-Chan; Boyanov, Maxim I; Kemner, Kenneth M; O'Loughlin, Edward J; Kwon, Man Jae",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818830/,106

The authors performed a series of simulations to estimate the demand for hospital beds (health micro-regions) as well as to ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators (health macro-regions) under different scenarios of intensity (infection rates equivalent to 0.01, 0.1, and 1 case por 100 inhabitants) and time horizons (1, 3, and 6 months). The results reveal a critical situation in the system for meeting this potential demand, with numerous health micro-regions and macro-regions operating beyond their capacity, compromising the care for patients, especially those with more severe symptoms. The study presents three relevant messages. First, it is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Brazilian population, allowing more time for the reorganization of the supply and relieve the pressure on the health system. Second, the expansion of the number of available beds will be the key. Even if the private sector helps offset the deficit, the combined supply from the two sectors (public and private) would be insufficient in various macro-regions. The construction of field hospitals is important, both in places with a history of ""hospital deserts"" and in those already pressured by demand.

Multimedia resources are gaining attention as a modality to support recruitment efforts; however, there is a lack of guidance for the development of such tools. This qualitative study explores the perspectives of eligible stem cell donors on an educational whiteboard video about stem cell donation, generating insights into how whiteboard videos and related multimedia may be optimized for donor recruitment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Eight semistructured focus groups were conducted with 38 potential donors from the most-needed demographics (young, male, and non-Caucasian) after they had watched a 3.5-minute whiteboard video explaining key concepts in stem cell donation (https://youtu.be/V4fVBtxnWfM). Constructivist grounded theory was used to identify themes and to develop a framework for understanding participants' preferred features of recruitment multimedia. RESULTS Participants identified a range of features contributing to the effectiveness of recruitment multimedia, adding that the whiteboard video is an effective, integrated, and readily accessible format for supporting donor recruitment. Topics that participants felt are important to address include knowledge gaps regarding donation procedures, concerns about donor safety, and the particular need for specific donor demographics. Suggested avenues for improvement include the addition of donor/recipient/patient personal experiences, attention-grabbing hooks, and a call to action including opportunities for further learning. CONCLUSIONS Several considerations were generated to inform the development of future multimedia for donor education/recruitment and are relevant to donor recruitment organizations worldwide.","Li, Edward W; Lee, Anna; Vaseghi-Shanjani, Maryam; Anagnostopoulos, Alexander; Jagelaviciute, Gabriele; Kum, Elena; Petraszko, Tanya; Elmoazzen, Heidi; Allan, David; Fingrut, Warren",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269472/,106

106432,"Achieving zero covid is not easy, but the alternative is far worse.",2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND Webinars have recently replaced in-person medical conferences, including paediatric cardiology conferences, given the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference. Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7). RESULTS We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually. CONCLUSIONS While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia.","Duane, Brett; Lyne, Alexandra; Faulkner, Theresa; Windram, Jonathan D; Redington, Andrew N; Saget, Sophie; Tretter, Justin T; McMahon, Colin J",Cardiology in the young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951121000718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685550/,106

This retrospective analysis of a UK centre's experience provides insight into clinical and radiographic outcomes. METHODS Electronic patient records, diagnostic and procedural images and written procedural records for patients treated with the PED between August 2009 and April 2014 were reviewed. Follow-up TOF MRA was performed after treatment. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed and compared with other PED studies. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with 30 attempted PED treatments were reviewed representing 3.5% of the treated aneurysm patient cohort. 63.6% (21/33) of the aneurysms were wide-necked (>4 mm), 60.6% (20/33) were large or giant (≥10 mm). The mean aneurysm sac diameter was 12.0 mm; the mean neck width was 4.5 mm. Mortality and morbidity rates were 3.3% and 10.0%, respectively. The total adequate occlusion rate was 78.1% (25/32) at 18 months. The neck width of aneurysms with residual sac filling and complete occlusion differed significantly (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Highly selected aneurysms treated with a PED in a UK centre have similar occlusion and complication rates when compared to non-UK studies. Again, it appeared that delayed aneurysm rupture remained a risk for PED treatment in large or giant aneurysms. Follow-up with TOF MRA gave similar occlusion results compared to those obtained with DSA in other studies. The influence of neck size on occlusion rate should be examined in future PED studies.","Yang, Shih-Hung; Hampton, Timothy; Kandasamy, Naga; Hart, Jonathan; Ashmore, Jonathan; Walsh, Daniel C; Tolias, Christos M; Booth, Thomas C",British journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/02688697.2017.1354121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28748748/,106

METHODS Patients who underwent an elective LESS TEP inguinal hernia repair between December 2008 and September 2010 in a single center were enrolled prospectively in this study. Patient demographic data, hernia characteristics, and operative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. An Alexis wound retractor was placed through the 2-cm subumbilical incision as a homemade transumbilical access platform after the preperitoneal space was created by a balloon dissector. Standard procedures of TEP all were finished using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS Of the 100 patients in this study, 2 underwent conversion to LESS transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. The remaining 98 patients received successful LESS TEP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon. No patient required open or conventional laparoscopic conversion. However, one patient did experience recurrence. The mean operative time was 64.2 min, and the hospital stay was 1.54 days. One patient with a history of bladder surgery had a minor intraoperative bladder injury. No major postoperative complication occurred, but 11 patients had seroma or hematoma, 2 had epididymitis, 2 had urinary tract infection, 1 had wound dehiscence, 1 had wound infection, and 1 had urinary retention. This single-arm observational study was limited by the absence of a control cohort. CONCLUSIONS Based on our experience, in the hands of experienced laparoscopic surgeons, LESS TEP repair for adult inguinal hernia using the homemade port as an access platform is feasible and safe and provides acceptable operative outcomes.","Chung, Shiu-Dong; Huang, Chao-Yuan; Wang, Shuo-Meng; Hung, Shun-Fa; Tsai, Yao-Chou; Chueh, Shih-Chieh; Yu, Hong-Jeng",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1761-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21638177/,106

While some guidelines recommend inclusion of costs associated with productivity losses/gains, very little guidance is provided about the productivity elements to include and their calculation approach. Areas covered: We conducted a systematic review of CEAs for vaccines and vaccine programs published between 1 January 2010 and 19 November 2019 that included productivity costs using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The kind of productivity elements included their calculation approach, and the impact of their inclusion on cost-effectiveness are summarized. Among 88 studies identified, productivity elements included were reported for 71 studies (81%) with absenteeism being the most commonly included element. Only 24 studies (27%) reported the approach used to calculate productivity costs (human capital vs. friction approach). Most studies (81%) reported a more favorable cost-effectiveness with the inclusion of productivity losses/gains. Expert opinion: Inclusion of productivity losses/gains for CEAs for vaccines has resulted in more favorable cost-effectiveness based on the studies reviewed. However, clearer guidance on the productivity elements to include by disease area and more transparency on the calculation method used may be needed.","Yuasa, Akira; Yonemoto, Naohiro; LoPresti, Michael; Ikeda, Shunya",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1881484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593223/,106
106862,Acute Care Management During a Pandemic.,2021,"Staufen (STAU)1-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) is a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism in mammals that degrades mRNAs harboring a STAU1-binding site (SBS) in their 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs). We show that SMD involves not only STAU1 but also its paralog STAU2. STAU2, like STAU1, is a double-stranded RNA-binding protein that interacts directly with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase up-frameshift 1 (UPF1) to reduce the half-life of SMD targets that form an SBS by either intramolecular or intermolecular base-pairing. Compared with STAU1, STAU2 binds ~10-fold more UPF1 and ~two- to fivefold more of those SBS-containing mRNAs that were tested, and it comparably promotes UPF1 helicase activity, which is critical for SMD. STAU1- or STAU2-mediated augmentation of UPF1 helicase activity is not accompanied by enhanced ATP hydrolysis but does depend on ATP binding and a basal level of UPF1 ATPase activity. Studies of STAU2 demonstrate it changes the conformation of RNA-bound UPF1. These findings, and evidence for STAU1-STAU1, STAU2-STAU2, and STAU1-STAU2 formation in vitro and in cells, are consistent with results from tethering assays: the decrease in mRNA abundance brought about by tethering siRNA-resistant STAU2 or STAU1 to an mRNA 3' UTR is inhibited by downregulating the abundance of cellular STAU2, STAU1, or UPF1. It follows that the efficiency of SMD in different cell types reflects the cumulative abundance of STAU1 and STAU2. We propose that STAU paralogs contribute to SMD by ""greasing the wheels"" of RNA-bound UPF1 so as to enhance its unwinding capacity per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed.","Park, Eonyoung; Gleghorn, Michael L; Maquat, Lynne E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1213508110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23263869/,106

We sought to investigate the independent and combined effects of PC and platelet reactivity on thrombotic and bleeding risk after coronary artery implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES). Patients enrolled in the prospective, multicenter Assessment of Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy with Drug-Eluting Stents study were stratified by PC tertiles. The study cohort comprised 8,402 patients. By linear regression analysis, lower PC was strongly and independently associated with higher platelet reactive units (PRUs) on clopidogrel. After multivariable adjustment (including PRU and aspirin reactive units), high, but not low, PC tertile was independently associated with higher risk of thrombotic complications, including spontaneous myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. Although no independent association was observed between PC tertiles and hemorrhagic risk, both high and low PC tertiles were associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality. After stratification of PC tertiles by tertiles of PRUs, the crude risk of thrombotic complications was highest in patients in the high PC and high PRU tertiles. By multivariable adjustment, PRU increases were uniformly associated with higher risk of thrombotic events across PC tertiles, without evidence of interaction. In conclusion, higher PCs and higher PRUs act independently and synergistically in determining thrombotic risk. Alongside PRU, PCs could be a simple hematological parameter to consider for risk stratification and in tailoring duration and potency of pharmacologic platelet inhibition after DES implantation.","Giustino, Gennaro; Kirtane, Ajay J; Généreux, Philippe; Baber, Usman; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Neumann, Franz-Josef; Weisz, Giora; Maehara, Akiko; Rinaldi, Michael J; Metzger, Christopher; Henry, Timothy D; Cox, David A; Duffy, Peter L; Mazzaferri, Ernest L; Brodie, Bruce R; Stuckey, Thomas D; Dangas, George D; Francese, Dominic P; Litherland, Claire; Mehran, Roxana; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27067621/,106

107967,Electricity-consumption data reveals the economic impact and industry recovery during the pandemic.,2021-10-07,"OVERVIEW Streptococcus canis is most prevalent in cats, but recently S equi subsp zooepidemicus has been recognised as an emerging feline pathogen. S CANIS INFECTION S canis is considered part of the commensal mucosal microflora of the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, genital organs and perianal region in cats. The prevalence of infection is higher in cats housed in groups; and, for example, there may be a high rate of vaginal carriage in young queens in breeding catteries. A wide spectrum of clinical disease is seen, encompassing neonatal septicaemia, upper respiratory tract disease, abscesses, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, polyarthritis, urogenital infections, septicaemia, sinusitis and meningitis. S EQUI SUBSP ZOOEPIDEMICUS INFECTION S equi subsp zooepidemicus is found in a wide range of species including cats. It was traditionally assumed that this bacterium played no role in disease of cats, but it is now considered a cause of respiratory disease with bronchopneumonia and pneumonia, as well as meningoencephalitis, often with a fatal course. Close confinement of cats, such as in shelters, appears to be a major risk factor. As horses are common carriers of this bacterium, contact with horses is a potential source of infection. Additionally, the possibility of indirect transmission needs to be considered. DIAGNOSIS Streptococci can be detected by conventional culture techniques from swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or organ samples. Also real-time PCR can be used, and is more sensitive than culture. TREATMENT In suspected cases, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as soon as possible and, if appropriate, adapted to the results of culture and sensitivity tests.","Frymus, Tadeusz; Addie, Diane D; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Horzinek, Marian C; Hosie, Margaret J; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Möstl, Karin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15588454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26101315/,106

We included 22 studies. Interventions that resulted in increased adherence were most of the education-based strategies, consumption monitoring by volunteer health workers or family members, SMS reminders, free provision of supplements, a multicomponent intervention with community mobilization, and a participatory action research intervention. In several studies, increased adherence was accompanied by beneficial effects on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Given the heterogeneity of study designs and methods used to define and measure adherence, a meta-analysis was not appropriate.

However, tumors in the subcapsular location are still technically challenging. This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of computed tomographic-guided percutaneous RFA with hydrodissection for hepatic malignancies in the subcapsular location. METHODS A total of 103 patients with 253 hepatic lesions were treated with computed tomographic-guided percutaneous RFA. Computed tomographic-guided percutaneous RFA with hydrodissection was performed in 15 patients with 15 hepatic nodules. All tumors located in the hepatic subcapsular location were considered difficult to treat on planning sonography. Hydrodissection was performed with 5% dextrose in water or saline solution in displacing adjacent structures ≥ 10 mm away from the liver capsule. Two RFA systems with multitined expandable electrodes or straight internally cooled single electrodes were used for treatment of hepatic malignancies. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of this technique were analyzed on follow-up contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Hydrodissection was successfully achieved in 15 (100%) patients, displacing the adjacent structures ≥ 10 mm that were originally < 10 mm away from the liver capsule with administration of a mean of 376 mL of dextrose in water or saline solution. The average distance between an adjacent structure and the liver capsule after hydrodissection was 1.50 ± 0.40 cm and 0.11 ± 0.15 cm prior to hydrodissection, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). No complication related to hydrodissection occurred during the follow-up period. The primary technical success rate of percutaneous RFA for tumor was 100% (15/15) at 1-month follow-up imaging. There were three minor complications (20%, 3/15) related to the RFA procedure. CONCLUSION Computed tomographic-guided percutaneous RFA with hydrodissection is a feasible, safe, and effective technique in the treatment of hepatic malignancies in the subcapsular location.","Liu, Chang-Hsien; Yu, Chih-Yung; Chang, Wei-Chou; Dai, Ming-Shen; Hsiao, Cheng-Wen; Chou, Yu-Ching; Huang, Guo-Shu",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2015.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26507775/,106

Elevation is thought to improve patient comfort, as well as decrease swelling, wound complications, and the risk of compartment syndrome. Elevating a limb with increased compartment pressures, however, has been shown to reduce perfusion pressure and contribute to tissue ischemia. This investigation aims to advance our understanding of the tissue effects of limb elevation using a healthy patient model. OBJECTIVE To quantify the effects of elevation, experimentally induced ischemia, and immobilization on muscle oxygen saturation in the human leg using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). DESIGN Experimental crossover study. SETTING Orthopaedic Surgery research laboratory, Stanford Hospitals & Clinics. PATIENTS FOR PARTICIPATION Twenty-six healthy volunteers. METHODS Using transcutaneous sensors, we measured muscle oxygen saturation of the anterior compartment of the left (control) leg at 0, 15, and 30 cm of elevation relative to the heart using NIRS. A standardized short leg splint and a thigh tourniquet inflated to 50 mmHg were then applied to the right (experimental) leg to simulate a traumatized state. NIRS measurements were then repeated, again at 0, 15, and 30 cm of elevation. Muscle oxygen saturation values at various degrees of elevation of the control and experimental limb were then compared and analyzed by the use of a crossover study design and mixed-effects regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Muscle oxygen saturation at varying levels of elevation in both the (1) control leg and (2) experimental leg in a simulated traumatic state. RESULTS Male (18) males and female (8) patients between 22 and 62 years of age (mean 29.8 years) were enrolled. Mean regional muscle oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the control limbs at 0, 15 and, 30 cm of elevation were 74.2%, 72.5%, and 70.6%, respectively, whereas mean rSO2 of the experimental limbs were 66.3%, 65.0%, and 63.3%. A statistically significant decrease of rSO2 was observed (mean 7.65%) in the experimental limbs compared with the control limbs. As elevation increased, there was a statistically significant decrease in rSO2 of 0.12% per centimeter of elevation. Elevation did not decrease the rSO2 in the experimental limb to a greater degree than in the control limb. CONCLUSION Increasing levels of elevation in a human limb results in progressively compromised muscle oxygen saturation as measured by NIR.","Palanca, Ariel A; Yang, Arthur; Bishop, Julius A","PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmrj.2015.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26261022/,106
109609,The COVID-19 challenge.,2020-05-02,"In Europe over 5.25 billion tonnes of waste has been landfilled between 1995 and 2015. Among this large amount of waste, plastic represents typically 5-25 wt% which is significant and has the potential to be recycled and reintroduced into the circular economy. To date there is still however little information available of the opportunities and challenges in recovering plastics from landfill sites. In this review, the impacts of landfill chemistry on the degradation and/or contamination of excavated plastic waste are analysed. The feasibility of using excavated plastic waste as feedstock for upcycling to valuable chemicals or liquid fuels through thermochemical conversion is also critically discussed. The limited degradation that is experienced by many plastics in landfills (>20 years) which guarantee that large amount is still available is largely due to thermooxidative degradation and the anaerobic conditions. However, excavated plastic waste cannot be conventionally recycled due to high level of ash, impurities and heavy metals. Recent studies demonstrated that pyrolysis offers a cost effective alternative option to conventional recycling. The produced pyrolysis oil is expected to have similar characteristics to petroleum diesel oil. The production of valuable product from excavated plastic waste will also increase the feasibility of enhanced landfill mining projects. However, further studies are needed to investigate the uncertainties about the contamination level and degradation of excavated plastic waste and address their viability for being processed through pyrolysis.","Canopoli, L; Fidalgo, B; Coulon, F; Wagland, S T",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2018.03.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29622377/,106

In all cases, resected tissues were evaluated by histopathologically and the diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum was confirmed. Hysterectomy was performed in two cases due to peri-partum hemorrhage that disrupted hemodynamics. None of the patients had complications such as visceral organ injury and wound infection.Conclusion: Our technique of uterine sparing surgery seems to be safe and effective in the management of placenta accreta spectrum without increasing complication rates.","Cırpan, Teksin; Akdemir, Ali; Okmen, Fırat; Hortu, Ismet; Ekici, Huseyin; Imamoglu, Metehan","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2019.1702019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31830832/,106
110353,"Covid-19: Push to reopen schools risks new wave of infections, says Independent SAGE.",2020-05-28,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most frequent malignant hematological disease. Dihydrocelastrol (DHCE) is synthesized by hydrogenated celastrol, a treterpene isolated from Chinese medicinal plant Tripterygium regelii. In this study, we first reported the anti-tumor activity of DHCE on MM cells. We found that DHCE could inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis through caspase-dependent way in vitro. In addition, DHCE could inactivate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and downregulate the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in MM. It also retained its activity against MM cell lines in the presence of IL-6. Furthermore, treatment of MM cells with DHCE resulted in an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Notably, DHCE reduced the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 in MM cell lines. Additionally, its efficacy toward the MM cell lines could be enhanced in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589), which implied the possibility of the combination treatment of DHCE and LBH589 as a potential therapeutic strategy in MM. In addition, treatment of NCI-H929 tumor-bearing nude mice with DHCE (10 mg/kg/d, i.p., 1-14 days) resulted in 73% inhibition of the tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, the results of our present study indicated that DHCE could inhibit cellular proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in myeloma cells mediated through different mechanisms, possibly through inhibiting the IL-6/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. And it may provide a new therapeutic option for MM patients.","Hu, Liangning; Wu, Huiqun; Li, Bo; Song, Dongliang; Yang, Guang; Chen, Gege; Xie, Bingqian; Xu, Zhijian; Zhang, Yong; Yu, Dandan; Hou, Jun; Xiao, Wenqin; Sun, Xi; Chang, Gaomei; Zhang, Yiwen; Gao, Lu; Dai, Bojie; Tao, Yi; Shi, Jumei; Zhu, Weiliang",Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1093/abbs/gmx021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338993/,106

111988,The RADxSM Tech Process: Accelerating Innovation for COVID-19 Testing.,2021,"PURPOSE/AIM The optic nerve (ON) becomes taut during adduction beyond ~26° in healthy people and patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), but only retracts the globe in POAG. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate this difference. MATERIALS AND METHODS MRI was obtained in 2-mm quasi-coronal planes in central gaze, and smaller (~23-25°) and larger (~30-31°) adduction and abduction in 21 controls and 12 POAG subjects whose intraocular pressure never exceeded 21 mmHg. ON cross-sections were analyzed from the globe to 10 mm posteriorly. Area centroids were used to calculate ON path lengths and changes in cross-sections to calculate elongation assuming volume conservation. RESULTS For both groups, ON path was nearly straight (<102.5% of minimum path) in smaller adduction, with minimal further straightening in larger adduction. ON length was redundant in abduction, exceeding 103% of minimum path for both groups. For normals, the ON elongated 0.4 ± 0.5 mm from central gaze to smaller adduction, and 0.4 ± 0.5 mm further from smaller to larger adduction. For POAG subjects, the ON did not elongate on average from central gaze to smaller adduction and only 0.2 ± 0.4 mm from smaller to larger adduction (P = .045 vs normals). Both groups demonstrated minimal ON elongation not exceeding 0.25 mm from central gaze to smaller and larger abduction. The globe retracted significantly more during large adduction in POAG subjects than normals (0.6 ± 0.7 mm vs 0.2 ± 0.5 mm, P = .027), without appreciable retraction in abduction. For each mm increase in globe axial length, ON elongation in large adduction similarly increased by 0.2 mm in each group. CONCLUSIONS The normal ON stretches to absorb force and avert globe retraction in adduction. In POAG with mild to severe visual field loss, the relatively inelastic ON tethers and retracts the globe during adduction beyond ~26°, transfering stress to the optic disc that could contribute to progressive neuropathy during repeated eye movements.","Clark, Robert A; Suh, Soh Youn; Caprioli, Joseph; Giaconi, JoAnn A; Nouri-Mahdavi, Kouros; Law, Simon K; Bonelli, Laura; Coleman, Anne L; Demer, Joseph L",Current eye research,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1817491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911989/,106

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy with a gel-sealed hand-assist access device (GelPort), which is a wound sealing device that permits the access of the hand to the surgical field, free trocar site choice within it, and rapid conversion to open surgery if necessary, while preserving the pneumoperitoneum/pneumoretroperitoneum. METHODS Seventy-five consecutive donors receiving this procedure were retrospectively studied. A 2-cm skin incision was made at the midpoint between the tip of the 12th rib and superior border of the iliac bone in the midaxillary line, through which retroperitoneal space was made. Preperitoneal wound with a 6 - 7-cm pararectal incision in the upper abdominal region was connected to the retroperitoneal space. A GelPort was put inside the pararectal surgical wound. The principle was pure retroperitoneoscopic surgery; hand-assist was applied for retraction of the kidney in the renal vessel control and graft extraction. RESULTS The mean operation time including waiting time for recipient preparation was 242.2±37.0 (range: 214.0-409.0) min, and the mean amount of blood loss was 164.3±146.6 (range: 10.0-1020.0) ml. The mean WIT was 2.8±1.0 (range: 1.0-6.0) min. The shortage of renal vessels or ureter was observed in none of the grafts. No donor experienced blood transfusion, open conversion, or injury of other organs. Blood loss was greater in patients with body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher than in those with BMI of <25 kg/m2 (218.4±98.8 vs. 154.8±152.1 ml, P=0.031). No donor had postoperative ileus or reported wound pain leading to decreased activity of daily life or wound cosmetic problem. CONCLUSIONS Retroperitoneoscopic hand-assisted donor nephrectomy with the mentioned approach was suggested to be a feasible option without compromising safety, although further improvement in surgical techniques is warranted.","Arai, Kei; Nishiyama, Tsutomu; Hara, Noboru; Kasahara, Takashi; Saito, Kazuhide; Takahashi, Kota",BMC urology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2490-13-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374442/,106

We recently conducted a retrospective study to assess the feasibility and safety of the procedure. METHODS The study involved 182 patients (159 men, 23 women) who underwent S-TAPP herniorrhaphy between June 2010 and February 2015 for 202 groin hernias (162 unilateral hernias, 20 bilateral hernias). We examined patient characteristics, hernia type and presentation, operation time, conversion to another repair procedure, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain, morbidities, and postoperative hospital stay. We further evaluated operation time and morbidity by comparison between cases of simple unilateral hernia and cases of complicated unilateral hernia, which was defined as (1) a recurrent hernia, (2) hernia following radical prostatectomy, or (3) an incarcerated omental or bowel hernia. RESULTS Five types of hernia were treated: indirect inguinal, direct inguinal, femoral, combined inguinal, and other (a urinary bladder hernia). Operation time was 92.5 ± 29.1 min for the unilateral hernias and 135.7 ± 24.5 min for the bilateral hernias. No major bleeding occurred. Postoperative pain was short-lived and easily managed. Overall morbidity was 8.2% (15/182 patients), and only one postoperative complication (recurrence) required surgical intervention (repeat S-TAPP). Average postoperative stay was 6.7 ± 2.6 days. Two patients experienced numbness in the outer thigh, but this resolved naturally. One superficial surgical site infection developed and was easily treated. Operation times were greater for the complicated vs. simple hernias, but the time differed significantly (p = 0.02) only between radical prostatectomy-associated hernia and simple hernia. No complicated hernia required conversion to traditional laparoscopic repair, but in simple unilateral hernia group one conversion to traditional laparoscopic repair was required for difficulties encountered in the dissection of the large indirect inguinal hernia sac. The incidence of seroma was higher, though not statistically, in the complicated (n = 3) vs. simple hernia group. CONCLUSIONS S-TAPP repair of groin hernia was shown to be a feasible, safe procedure. The advantages are well understood, and further studies are warranted to confirm the long-term benefits suggested by our study.","Tanoue, K; Okino, H; Kanazawa, M; Ueno, K",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-016-1540-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27785630/,106

However, relatively little is known about their physiological interactions with biological systems and, to date, no comparative biological studies have been done. This study compares titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) in multilayered and delaminated forms with graphene variants to assess the impact of variable physical properties on cellular inflammatory response to endotoxin stimulus. No significant impact on cell metabolism or induction of inflammatory pathways leading to cell death was observed. No significant increase in markers of blood cell activation and haemolysis occurred. Whilst graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), graphene oxide (GO) and Ti3C2Tx showed insignificant antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli, silver nanoparticle-modified GO (GO-Ag) induced bacterial cell death and at a lower dose than silver nanoparticles. All nanomaterials significantly reduced bacterial endotoxin induced THP-1 monocyte IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-α cytokine production by >99%, >99% and >80% respectively, compared to control groups.

Methods: A total of 294 children and 92 adults with CHB infection who were treated at four hospitals in Chongqing from 2011 to 2018 were collected. The BCP / PC region of HBV was amplified by PCR and sequenced directly to comparatively analyze the gene mutation conditions in this region. The two sample means were compared by the t-test, and the nonparametric data was compared by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. χ2 test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the data rates of the two groups. Results: Children and adult patients were dominated by genotype B; accounting for 76.9% and 71.7%, respectively, and genotype C accounted for 23.1% and 28.3%, respectively. In the children group, the mutation rates of ten nucleotide sites containing nt 1679, 1721, 1753, 1757, 1758, 1762, 1764, 1775, 1856 and 1858 of the genotype C samples was significantly higher than that of genotype B samples. The mutation rates of G1721a, C1856t and T1858c of genotype C samples were 30.9%, 16.2% and 30.9%, respectively, while the mutation rates of genotype B samples were 0.4%, 0, 0, P < 0.001, respectively. In the adult group, the only three sites containing nt 1679, 1758, and 1775 of the genotype C sample had a higher mutation rate than the genotype B samples. The combined mutations pattern were only detected in children with genotype C samples, but not in children and adult with genotype B samples. Further analysis showed that the age of G1721A/A1775G/T1858C containing combined mutation group was significantly lower than that of the non-mutation group [(4.58 ± 2.53) years vs. (6.53 ± 4.02) years, P = 0.012].

Conclusion: The frequencies of mutations in the BCP/PC region of HBV-infected children in genotype C samples were significantly higher than that of genotype B samples. Genotype-related combined site mutations were only found in children with genotype C samples, and were also associated with younger patients and high HBV-DNA titers.","Bai, J X; Deng, H J; Huang, Y",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn501113-20200725-00424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911905/,106

High levels of circulating cytokines were reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Neopterin produced by macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma, which is an important cytokine in the anti-viral immune response, hence it can be used to predict the severity of disease in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVES In this study, it was aimed to determine the prognostic value of the neopterin for the prediction of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN This single-center, prospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. Severe and mild COVID-19 cases were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings as well as serum neopterin levels on hospital admission. To assess the prognostic utility of neopterin between the severe and mild COVID-19 groups, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. RESULTS The median serum neopterin level was 4 times higher in COVID-19 patients than the healthy controls (46 vs. 12 nmol/L; p<0.001). The AUC value of serum neopterin was 0.914 (95% CI; 0.85 to 0.97). The sensitivity and specificity of serum neopterin for the cut-off value of 90 nmol / L to identify severe COVID-19 cases were 100 % and 76 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Serum neopterin levels on hospitalization were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 disease than mild COVID-19 patients.

In addition to maternal mortality, information on maternal near miss and severe maternal morbidity are important in maternal healthcare. We aimed to determine the incidence, causes and outcome of severe maternal morbidity and near miss, and the sociodemographic and obstetric factors associated with these at a tertiary care teaching hospital in Delhi. Methods. Women admitted with severe maternal morbidity and near miss, as defined by the WHO study group, were included in the study. The incidence ratio of near miss and severe morbidity in the hospital was determined, and a case-control study was conducted to study the factors associated with the occurrence of near miss. Information was obtained from hospital records and interviews, using a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. Results. The incidence ratio of near miss was 6.85/ 1000, and severe morbidity was 11.38/1000 live births. Hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the common causes of cases of near miss and severe morbidity. Coagulation dysfunction (62%) was the most common organ dysfunction, followed by uterine dysfunction (22%). Older age (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, confidence interval [CI] 1.02-3.93), the absence of formal education (OR 2.05, CI 1.11-3.75), <18 years of age at marriage (OR 2.01, CI 1.21-3.32), lower income (OR 3.8, CI 1.88-7.64), gravida of four or more (OR 2.25, CI 1.21-4.17) and residence outside Delhi (OR 9.31, CI 4.36-19.90) were significant predictors of near miss. Sepsis, hypertensive disorders and haemorrhage were the most common underlying conditions in women who died. The foetal outcome was a live birth in 64% of near-miss cases and 62% among severe morbidity. Conclusions. The burden of severe maternal morbidity and near miss is high.

116307,Values in a time of rules.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVES Despite the fact that the most effective treatment for morbid obesity today is gastric bypass surgery, some patients develop life-threatening nutritional complications associated with their weight loss. METHODS Here we examine the influence of the altered anatomy and digestive physiology on pancreatic secretion and fat absorption. Thirteen post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients who had lost >100 lbs in the first year following surgery and who gave variable histories of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, were selected for study. Food-stimulated pancreatic enzyme secretion and GI hormone responses were measured during 2 h perfusions of the Roux limb with a standard polymeric liquid formula diet and polyethylene glycol marker, with collections of secretions from the common channel distal to the anastomosis and blood testing. Fat absorption was then measured during a 72 h balance study when a normal diet was given containing ~100 g fat/d. RESULTS Result showed that all patients had some fat malabsorption, but eight had coefficients of fat absorption <80%, indicative of steatorrhea. This was associated with significantly lower feed-stimulated secretion rates of trypsin, amylase, and lipase, and higher plasma peptide-YY concentrations compared with healthy controls. Five steatorrhea patients were subsequently treated with low quantities of pancreatic enzyme supplements for 3 months, and then retested. The supplements were well tolerated, and fat absorption improved in four of five patients accompanied by an increase in lipase secretion, but body weight increased in only three. Postprandial breath hydrogen concentrations were elevated with some improvement following enzyme supplementation suggesting persistent bacterial overgrowth and decreased colonic fermentation. CONCLUSIONS Our investigations revealed a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal abnormalities, including fat malabsorption, impaired food stimulated pancreatic secretion, ileal brake stimulation, and bacterial overgrowth, in patients following RYGB which could be attributed to the breakdown of the normally highly orchestrated digestive anatomy and physiology.","O'Keefe, Stephen J D; Rakitt, Tina; Ou, Junhai; El Hajj, Ihab I; Blaney, Elizabeth; Vipperla, Kishore; Holst, Jens-Jules; Rehlfeld, Jens",Clinical and translational gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ctg.2017.39; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28771242/,106

The reflectance spectra obtained from the imaging system have been compared to pointwise reference measures obtained with contact spectrophotometers. To assess and identify the influence of glare, we present the Glare Effect (GE) index, which compares the contrast of the grayscale patches of the CC in the hyperspectral images with the contrast of the reference spectra of the same patches. We evaluate, in both spatial and spectral domains, the amount of glare affecting every hyperspectral image in each acquisition scenario, clearly evidencing an unwanted light contribution to the reflectance spectra of each point, which increases especially for darker pixels and pixels close to light sources or bright patches.","Signoroni, Alberto; Conte, Mauro; Plutino, Alice; Rizzi, Alessandro",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764366/,106

117650,Machine learning applications in tobacco research: a scoping review.,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND Adults infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have had high rates of thrombosis. A novel condition in children infected with SARS-CoV-2, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), has limited data on their prothrombotic state or need for thromboprophylaxis. OBJECTIVES We aimed to analyze the prothrombotic state using coagulation profiles, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters and clinical outcomes, to determine if this could aid in risk stratification for thromboprophylaxis. METHODS This analysis included patients (< 21 years of age) with a diagnosis of MIS-C (n=40) and controls (presenting with suspicion of MIS-C but later ruled out; n=26). RESULTS MIS-C patients had higher levels of inflammatory markers including D-dimer (p<0.0001), compared to controls, along with evidence of hypercoagulability on ROTEM with elevated FIBTEM MCF (p<0.05). For MIS-C patients with D-dimers >1000 ng/mL, there was a significant correlation of FIBTEM MCF (p<0.0001) with a mean value of 37.4 (standard deviation 5.1). D-dimer >2144 ng/mL was predictive of intensive care unit admission (area under the curve (AUC) 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99; p<0.01; sensitivity: 82%, specificity: 75%), and elevated FIBTEM MCF (AUC 1 for >2500 ng/mL). MIS-C patients (50%) received enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis (in addition to aspirin) with significant improvement in their inflammatory and ROTEM parameters upon outpatient follow up; none developed symptomatic thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Despite an observed prothrombotic state, none of the MIS-C patients (on aspirin alone or in combination with enoxaparin) developed symptomatic thrombosis. ROTEM, in addition to coagulation profiles, may be helpful to tailor thromboprophylaxis in critically ill MIS-C patients.","Al-Ghafry, Maha; Vagrecha, Anshul; Malik, Marium; Levine, Chana; Uster, Eliza; Aygun, Banu; Appiah-Kubi, Abena; Vlachos, Adrianna; Capone, Christine A; Rajan, Sujatha; Palumbo, Nancy; Misra, Nilanjana; Mitchell, Elizabeth C; Wolfe, Lawrence C; Lipton, Jeffrey M; Shore-Lesserson, Linda; Acharya, Suchitra S",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872443/,106

It also deprived them of in-person counselling services and social support. These changes have put students at a greater risk of developing mental illness. The objective of this review is to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances in higher education students during the pandemic. A systematic search of English and Chinese databases was conducted current to January 1st, 2021. The quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Eighty-nine studies (n=1,441,828) were included. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep disturbances was 34%, 32% and 33%, respectively. The prevalence values differ based on geographical regions, diagnostic criteria, education level, undergraduate year of study, financial situation, living arrangements and gender. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms synthesized in this study was higher compared to pre-pandemic prevalence in similar populations. Evidently, mental health screening and intervention should be a top priority for universities and colleges during the pandemic.","Deng, Jiawen; Zhou, Fangwen; Hou, Wenteng; Silver, Zachary; Wong, Chi Yi; Chang, Oswin; Drakos, Anastasia; Zuo, Qi Kang; Huang, Emma",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984824/,106

Results found that participants reported a significant increase in alcohol consumption as a result of the pandemic. Furthermore, this increase in consumption related to a decline in psychological health. Exploratory analyses found that a decline in psychological health correlated with negative impacts in several life areas (financial, resource, social, and academic) and a decline in time management skills. However, spending time on leisure activities and spending time in-person with family and friends negatively correlated with psychological decline.

121061,Nursing Policies and Protocols: Do Nurses Really Use Them?,2020-11-23,"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) frequently cause hospital admissions among adults. Diagnostic viral reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) of nose and throat swabs (NTS) is useful for patient care by informing antiviral use and appropriate isolation. However, automated RT-PCR systems are not amenable to utilizing sputum due to its viscosity. We evaluated a simple method of processing sputum samples in a fully automated respiratory viral panel RT-PCR assay (FilmArray). Archived sputum and NTS samples collected in 2008-2012 from hospitalized adults with RTI were evaluated. A subset of sputum samples positive for 10 common viruses by a uniplex RT-PCR was selected. A sterile cotton-tip swab was dunked in sputum, swirled in 700 μL of sterile water (dunk and swirl method) and tested by the FilmArray assay. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on ""dunked"" sputum and NTS samples for influenza A (Flu A), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus OC43 (OC43), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Viruses were identified in 31% of 965 illnesses using a uniplex RT-PCR. The sputum sample was the only sample positive for 105 subjects, including 35% (22/64) of influenza cases and significantly increased the diagnostic yield of NTS alone (302/965 [31%] versus 197/965 [20%]; P = 0.0001). Of 108 sputum samples evaluated by the FilmArray assay using the dunk and swirl method, 99 (92%) were positive. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed higher mean viral loads in dunked sputum samples compared to NTS samples for Flu A, RSV, and HMPV (P = 0.0001, P = 0.006, and P = 0.011, respectively). The dunk and swirl method is a simple and practical method for reliably processing sputum samples in a fully automated PCR system. The higher viral loads in sputa may increase detection over NTS testing alone.","Branche, Angela R; Walsh, Edward E; Formica, Maria A; Falsey, Ann R",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01523-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25056335/,106

Measurement of peritoneal fluid urea nitrogen (UN) and creatinine (Cr) is a diagnostic tool to detect the urinary tract leakage (UTL). We evaluated its application in colorectal surgery. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review study. We enrolled patients with iatrogenic UTL, and measured their UN and Cr levels in peritoneal fluid and compared them with those in blood and urine. Meanwhile, we assigned patients without UTL to a control group and compared clinical parameters of both groups. RESULTS Twenty-three patients with iatrogenic UTL were recruited. The overall incidence was 0.5%. UN level in peritoneal fluid (322 ± 56 mg/dL) was significantly higher than that in blood (18.7 ± 4.0 mg/dL, p < 0.001); Cr level in peritoneal fluid (69.7 ± 14.3 mg/dL) was also significantly higher than that in blood (1.5 ± 0.5 mg/dL, p < 0.001). UN level in peritoneal fluid was significantly higher in the iatrogenic UTL group than in the control group (322 mL/dL vs. 9.3 mL/dL, p < 0.001); Cr level in peritoneal fluid was also significantly higher (69.7 mg/dL vs. 0.98 mg/dL, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION When increased peritoneal drainage is found postoperatively in colorectal surgery, measurement of UN and Cr levels in peritoneal fluid can be a useful diagnostic tool to determine intraperitoneal iatrogenic UTL.","Wang, Jui-Ho; Kung, Ya-Hsin; King, Tai-Ming; Chang, Min-Chi; Hsu, Chao-Wen",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2015.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25769933/,106
121518,COVID-19: don't forget deaf people.,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Because of high frequency, high morbidity, and difficulty of repair, incisional hernias in obese patients represent a particularly vexing and common problem for surgeons. The objective of this study was to describe a highly selective technique for incisional hernia repair with panniculectomy in the morbidly obese. We also describe perioperative characteristics and preliminary outcomes for a limited series of patients who underwent this procedure. METHODS We performed a preperitoneal partial mesh underlay with a panniculectomy (PUPP) on 10 patients with incisional hernias and a body mass index (BMI)>40 kg/m(2). The hernia repair was performed by a general surgery team, and the panniculectomy was performed by a plastic surgery team. We retrospectively analyzed perioperative variables for each patient. Phone interviews were conducted to obtain follow-up. RESULTS Mean patient age was 53 years (range 32-75 yr) with mean BMI of 46 kg/m(2) (range 41-60 kg/m(2)). Patients had a history of 3.4 average prior abdominal operations, and a median of 3 prior hernia repairs. The average operative time was 371 minutes with a mean estimated blood loss of 162 ccs. Three patients experienced a minor wound complication. There were no major wound complications, and the 30-day mortality rate was zero. At a median and average follow-up time of 805 and 345 days, respectively, one patient developed a hernia recurrence. Patients were satisfied with their appearance and the hernia repair, with mean satisfaction scores of 4.3 and 4.9 out of 5 (very satisfied), respectively. CONCLUSION The PUPP hernia repair is a viable option for incisional herniorrhaphy and concurrent panniculectomy in the morbidly obese.","Okusanya, Olugbenga T; Scott, Mary F; Low, David W; Morris, Jon B",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2013.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24139924/,106

Beyond the difficulties in caring for Covid-19 in detention, prison infirmaries, where they exist, are rarely integrated into the health system in practice. Administrations provide little for the vital needs of prisoners. Dietary deficiencies are frequent, skin diseases recurrent and prisoners are most often dependent on the financial means of their families or NGOs when it comes to access to health care. The social illegitimacy of the prison population and the reluctance of States to offer convicted prisoners what they do not guarantee to the general population are two arguments put forward to justify what amounts to necropolitics. At the same time, international actors working in prisons essentially target pathologies with epidemic potential, constrained by funding sources (UNAIDS, Global Fund) supporting population-wide health strategies. Here we would like to return to these two logics and develop an argument for a decompartmentalized approach to prison health. Beyond the recognition of individual health experience and epidemiological concerns, addressing prison health globally contributes to the restoration of prisoners' dignity and rights by the State, a necessary condition for the maintenance of citizenship beyond confinement.","Le Marcis, Frédéric",Sante publique,https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.205.0583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723964/,106

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. Material and Methods Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. Results The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A; Bernabeu-Wittel, J; Linares-Barrios, M; Russo-de la Torre, F; Garcia-Doval, I; Del Rio-de la Torre, E",Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adengl.2020.10.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012150/,106

Since specific antiviral treatments have not been developed yet and its fatal rate is almost high, early and fast detection is critical for controlling the outbreak. In this study, a piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor has been designed for detecting COVID-19 samples directly without requiring preparation steps. The biosensor acts as a transducer and is coated with the related antibody. When the SARS-CoV-2 antigens adsorbed on the microcantilever top surface through their spike proteins, a surface stress due to the mass change would be prompted leading to the measurable tip deflection and floating voltage. To obtain a biosensor with optimum parameters, different shapes and piezoelectric materials have been assessed and it was concluded that a Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) biosensor in a shape of a holed punched form triangle, represented the best result. Therefore, the highly sensitive microcantilever biosensor can detect COVID-19 in clinical samples with various viral loads, rapidly. Also, it is selective enough to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses with similar symptoms.","Kabir, Hannaneh; Merati, Mohsen; Abdekhodaie, Mohammad J",Journal of medical engineering & technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2021.1921067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998955/,106

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of the right eyes of 181 subjects: 89 POAG patients and 92 healthy subjects. Using the Triton SS-OCT device (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), CM length (CML), area (CMA) and thickness measured 1000 µm (CMT1), 2000 µm (CMT2) and 3000 µm (CMT3) from the scleral spur were determined in the temporal and nasal quadrants. POAG patients were subjected to visual field (VF) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment. CM dimensions were then assessed for correlation with VF mean defect (MD), mean RNFL thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS Mean CMLs were 4325 ± 340 µm and 4195 ± 843 µm for the healthy subjects and POAG patients, respectively (p = 0.17). Mean CM thicknesses were CMT1 = 546 ± 56 µm, CMT2 = 326 ± 44 µm and CMT3 = 174 ± 16 µm in the healthy eyes versus CMT1 = 534 ± 108, CMT2 = 332 ± 99 and CMT3 = 183 ± 74 in the POAG eyes, with no significant differences detected (all p ≥ 0.25). In the temporal quadrant, mean CMA was 1.12 ± 0.29 mm2 and 1.15 ± 0.24 mm2 for the healthy and POAG subjects, respectively (p = 0.45). No correlations were observed between CM measurements and RNFL thickness (p ≥ 0.15), IOP or VF MD (p ≥ 0.14) in POAG subjects irrespective of glaucoma severity (p ≥ 0.19). CONCLUSIONS While SS-OCT proved useful to measure CM dimensions in vivo, these dimensions did not differ between healthy individuals and POAG subjects. In the patients with POAG, no correlations were detected between CM dimensions and VF, RNFL or IOP.","Kudsieh, Bachar; Fernández-Vigo, José Ignacio; Shi, Hang; De Pablo Gómez de Liaño, Lucía; Ruiz-Moreno, José María; García-Feijóo, Julián; Fernández-Vigo, José Ángel",International ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01405-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388672/,106

The World Health Organization has named the SARS-CoV-2 related as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and declared it as a pandemic. There is a limited data about the COVID-19 disease for the pediatric patients. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, treatment and clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department with the suspicion of COVID-19. Between March 11 and June 16, 2020, patients aged between 1 month-18 years admitted to the pediatric emergency department and who have an indication for sampling for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with the suspicion of COVID-19 according to the current guidelines published by the Ministry of Health were included in the study. The demographic characteristics, symptoms, durations and the history of contact with the suspected/definite COVID-19 cases were questioned in the patients with positive results. Physical examination, laboratory and imaging data of the patients were recorded. According to clinical severity, patients were divided into five groups. Treatment methods, ward/intensive care unit admission, length of stay at hospital, and prognosis were recorded. Of the 237 patients included in the study, 45 (18.9%) of the samples were positive and 192 (81.1%) were negative. There was a history of contact with COVID-19 positive case in 38 (85.6%) of COVID-19 PCR positive patients. The mean time for onset of symptoms after contact was 3.5 ± 1.7 days. Twenty-one of the patients (46.6%) were asymptomatic and the most common symptom was fever (34.1%) and cough (27.3%). Of the patients whose laboratory tests were requested, lymphopenia wasdetected in 50% and 52.3% of procalcitonin, 23.5% of C-reactive protein and 64.7% of D-dimer values were found to be high. Chest radiography was obtained from 45.4% of the patients; 90.0% were evaluated as normal, bronchovascular change, pleural effusion and consolidation were detected in one of each (5.0%) patient. Thorax computed tomography (CT) was obtained from 4 (9.0%) patients. One patient had normal CT findings, two patients had consolidation, one patient had peripheral ground-glass appearance and one patient had pleural effusion. Antibiotics were started in 38.6% of the patients and the most commonly used antibiotic was azithromycin (34.1%). Oseltamivir was started in one (2.3%) patient, and 10 (24.7%) patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. There were no serious and critical cases according to the clinical severity. Pediatric patients constitute a small part of COVID-19 individuals in the community, and a significant part of them are asymptomatic, and patients who are symptomatic present with a mild clinic. In our study, most of the patients had a history of contact with COVID-19 positive cases, therefore, it should be questioned when evaluating a pediatric patient. There were no specific findings for COVID-19 positive patients in terms of laboratory and radiology.","Şık, Nihan; Özlü, Canan; Karaoğlu Asrak, Hatice; Erbaş, İrem Ceren; Çakıl Güzin, Ayşe; Atakul, Gizem; Atay, Özge; Appak, Özgür; Sayıner, Ayça Arzu; Uzuner, Nevin; Asilsoy, Suna; Belet, Nurşen; Yılmaz, Duygül; Duman, Murat",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.70086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33107292/,106

We next document the ability of global warming to disrupt the development of those organisms with temperature-dependent sex-determination or with phenologies coordinating that organism's development with those of other species. The thermotolerance of Homo sapiens is also related to key developmental factors concerning brain development and maintenance, and the development of corals, the keystone organisms of tropical reefs, is discussed in relation to global warming as well as to other anthropogenic changes. While teratogenic and endocrine-disrupting compounds are not discussed in this essay, the ability of glyphosate herbicides to block insect development is highlighted.

We use probabilistic modeling based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We illustrate that it is possible to build an accurate GP model of a 51-dimensional PES based on 5000 randomly distributed ab initio calculations with a global accuracy of <0.2 kcal/mol. Our approach uses GP models with composite kernels designed to enhance the Bayesian information content and represents the global PES as a sum of a full-dimensional GP and several GP models for molecular fragments of lower dimensionality. We demonstrate the potency of these algorithms by constructing the global PES for the protonated imidazole dimer, a molecular system with 19 atoms. We illustrate that GP models thus constructed can extrapolate the PES from low energies (<10 000 cm-1), yielding a PES at high energies (>20 000 cm-1). This opens the prospect for new applications of GPs, such as mapping out phase transitions by extrapolation or accelerating Bayesian optimization, for high-dimensional physics and chemistry problems with a restricted number of inputs, i.e., for high-dimensional problems where obtaining training data is very difficult.","Sugisawa, Hiroki; Ida, Tomonori; Krems, R V",The Journal of chemical physics,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0023492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962371/,106

According to recent studies, the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in severe cases of COVID-19 infection significantly worsens the prognosis of these patients. The pathological changes in kidneys might be caused directly by the cytopathic effect mediated by local replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) or indirectly because of systemic immune response or hypercoagulation, so-called immunothrombosis. Other causes, such as hypovolemia and hypoxia, may also contribute to AKI. Acute kidney disease often develops in elderly patients with underlying comorbidities or in critically ill patients with severe respiratory failure.

DESIGN This investigation was a retrospective cohort study. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (SEER-18 Regs Custom registry, November 2018) was reviewed for all cases of head and neck malignant teratomas from 1975 to 2016. A log rank test was used to compare survival between infant, pediatric, and adult HNMT, and between head and neck and non-head and neck malignant teratomas. Infant, pediatric, and adult patients were defined as younger than one year old, younger than 18 years old, and older than 18 years old, respectively. RESULTS Sixty-three malignant teratoma cases (1.96%) occurred in the head and neck region from 1975 to 2016, including 11 adult (17.46%) and 52 (82.54%) pediatric patients. 79.37% (50 patients) were diagnosed during infancy. The most common location was the soft tissue of the head and neck in pediatric patients (65.38%) and the thyroid gland in adults (54.54%). The 5-year survival was 45.83% (±7.19%) in infants and 46.00% (±7.05%) in pediatric patients. There were differences in 1-year and 5-year survival between pediatric HNMT and non-head and neck malignant teratomas, (76.01% versus 86.20%) (p = 0.022) and (46.00% versus 67.10%) (p < 0.001), respectively. There was no difference in 1-year and 5-year survival between pediatric patients and adults with HNMT, (76.01% versus 81.81%) (p = 0.618) and (46.00% versus 54.54%) (p = 0.560), respectively. CONCLUSION HNMT occurred most frequently in patients under the age of 1. Prognosis of pediatric HNMT is poor in comparison to pediatric non-head and neck malignant teratomas. Repeat studies after accumulating more patients in the database would be beneficial to confirm our findings.","Ramsey, Tam; Curran, Kent; Mouzakes, Jason; Gildener-Leapman, Neil; Galati, Lisa",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2021.110672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740550/,106

Aims To validate the Pittsburgh response to endovascular therapy (PRE) score in a randomized controlled trial (Trevo2) comparing stent retriever (Trevo) to the Merci device. Methods Trevo2 participants with internal carotid, M1 and M2 middle cerebral artery occlusions with prospectively collected baseline stroke severity (NIHSS), degree of hypodensity (CT ASPECTS), and three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) were included. Multivariable regression was used to confirm association between PRE score variables (age, NIHSS, and ASPECTS), medical comorbidities, randomization arm, and reperfusion status (mTICI2B/3) with good outcome (three-month modified Rankin Scale 0-2). Predictive power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) for good outcome of pre-treatment prognostic scores (PRE, THRIVE, HIAT2) was compared. Rates of good outcome were compared between successfully reperfused (mTICI2B/3) and non-reperfused (mTICI0-2A) patients across previously identified PRE score risk groups. Results Age, NIHSS, ASPECTS, reperfusion status, and randomization arm were independent predictors of good outcome. PRE score had moderate predictive power (AUC = 0.75) for good outcome and was comparable to other pre-treatment scores. Reperfusion resulted in maximal treatment benefit in patients with PRE score 0-24 (60% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.002) but not in those with PRE ≥50 (11.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.49). Conclusion The PRE score is a validated predictor of functional outcome and a tool for patient selection for endovascular therapy in anterior large vessel occlusion stroke. Our finding of limited benefit of reperfusion in patients with PRE score ≥50 needs to be prospectively validated.","Ali Raza, Syed; Xiang, Bin; Jovin, Tudor G; Liebeskind, David S; Shields, Ryan; Nogueira, Raul G; Rangaraju, Srikant",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493016677984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27811307/,106

The insertion of the CD8+ D(d)Env(311) epitope into the NA stalk resulted in a decrease in viral fitness that was reflected in lower lung viral titres. While not affecting the magnitude of endogenous primary influenza-specific responses, the introduction of the D(d)Env(311) CD8+ T cell epitope altered the hierarchy of responses following secondary challenge.

Few studies have addressed practice trends in postoperative rhinoplasty care or questioned the frequency of packing and splinting. Many conventional postoperative techniques remain controversial (eg, packing). OBJECTIVE To investigate current postoperative practices in the United States, correlating the results with surgical education, practice type, and complication rates. METHODS An online survey was distributed to members of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Respondents were polled about their background, route of education, type of practice, frequency and preference of postoperative nasal care, and most frequent rhinoplasty complications. Statistical analysis was performed with the χ(2) test. RESULTS Of the 1550 total surveys sent, 126 responses were received (8.1%). The majority of respondents were in private practice (86%) and trained in plastic surgery (83%). Approximately 33% continue to regularly employ packing following rhinoplasty, but data show that surgeons performing 21 or more rhinoplasties per year were less likely to utilize packing (P = .06). Those surgeons with higher rhinoplasty case volumes were significantly more likely to utilize a secondary therapy (eg, steroids, arnica) in combination with ice packs (P = .03) to prevent postoperative ecchymosis. Finally, surgeons with lower rhinoplasty case volumes reported more frequent postoperative nasal tip deformities (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative rhinoplasty care varies greatly among practicing aesthetic surgeons. Importantly, a high percentage of private practice aesthetic surgeons continue to utilize nasal packing following rhinoplasty. However, these numbers trend downward in surgeons who perform rhinoplasties more frequently.","Kelley, Brian P; Koshy, John; Hatef, Dan; Hollier, Larry H; Stal, Samuel",Aesthetic surgery journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090820x10395507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317116/,106
129398,Maintaining our vision for tissue viability beyond the pandemic.,2021-03-11,"MHC molecules are found in all jawed vertebrates and are known to present peptides to T lymphocytes. In mammals, peptides can hang out either end of the peptide-binding groove of classical class II molecules, whereas the N and C termini of peptides are typically tightly bound to specific pockets in classical class I molecules. The chicken MHC, like many nonmammalian vertebrates, has a single dominantly expressed classical class I molecule encoded by the BF2 locus. We determined the structures of BF2*1201 bound to two peptides and found that the C terminus of one peptide hangs outside of the groove with a conformation much like the peptides bound to class II molecules. We found that BF2*1201 binds many peptides that hang out of the groove at the C terminus, and the sequences and structures of this MHC class I allele were determined to investigate the basis for this phenomenon. The classical class I molecules of mammals have a nearly invariant Tyr (Tyr84 in humans) that coordinates the peptide C terminus, but all classical class I molecules outside of mammals have an Arg in that position in common with mammalian class II molecules. We find that this invariant Arg residue switches conformation to allow peptides to hang out of the groove of BF2*1201, suggesting that this phenomenon is common in chickens and other nonmammalian vertebrates, perhaps allowing the single dominantly expressed class I molecule to bind a larger repertoire of peptides.","Xiao, Jin; Xiang, Wangzhen; Zhang, Yongli; Peng, Weiyu; Zhao, Min; Niu, Ling; Chai, Yan; Qi, Jianxun; Wang, Fei; Qi, Peng; Pan, Chungang; Han, Lingxia; Wang, Ming; Kaufman, Jim; Gao, George F; Liu, William J",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341185/,106

This infectious virus is transmitted by direct contact and indirectly via airborne route, whereas contamination through inanimate objects/surfaces/equipment is uncertain. To limit the potential spread of the pathogen in the food industry, close working between individuals should be avoided and both personal and respiratory hygiene activities should be enforced. Despite the high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2, being an enveloped virus with a fragile lipid envelop, is sensitive to biocidal products and sanitizers commonly used in the food factory. In the context of the building design, interventions that promote healthy air quality should be adopted, especially in food areas with high-occupancy rates for prolonged times, to help minimize the potential exposure to airborne SARS-CoV-2. Air ventilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, are effective and easy-to-organize tools to reduce the risk of transmission through the air.

Subsequent changes in primary PCI, including the use of potent P2Y12 inhibitors, frequent radial intervention, and pre-hospital medication administration, were incorporated into the EUROMAX (European Ambulance Acute Coronary Syndrome Angiography) trial, which assigned 2,218 patients to bivalirudin versus heparin ± GPI before primary PCI. OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to examine the outcomes of procedural anticoagulation with bivalirudin versus heparin ± GPI for primary PCI, given the evolution in primary PCI. METHODS Databases from HORIZONS-AMI and EUROMAX were pooled for patient-level analysis. The Breslow-Day test evaluated heterogeneity between trials. RESULTS A total of 5,800 patients were randomized to bivalirudin (n = 2,889) or heparin ± GPI (n = 2,911). The radial approach was used in 21.3% of patients, prasugrel/ticagrelor was used in 18.1% of patients, and GPI was used in 84.8% of the control group. Bivalirudin compared with heparin ± GPI resulted in reduced 30-day rates of major bleeding (4.2% vs. 7.8%; relative risk [RR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43 to 0.66; p < 0.0001), thrombocytopenia (1.4% vs. 2.9%, RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.71; p = 0.0002), and cardiac mortality (2.0% vs. 2.9%; RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.97; p = 0.03), with nonsignificantly different rates of reinfarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Bivalirudin resulted in increased acute (<24 h) stent thrombosis rates (1.2% vs. 0.2%; RR: 6.04; 95% CI: 2.55 to 14.31; p < 0.0001), with nonsignificantly different rates of subacute stent thrombosis. Composite net adverse clinical events were lower with bivalirudin (8.8% vs. 11.9%; RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.86; p < 0.0001). There was no significant heterogeneity between the 2 trials for these outcomes, and results were consistent across major subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Despite increased acute stent thrombosis, primary PCI with bivalirudin improved 30-day net clinical outcomes, with significant reductions in major bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and transfusions compared with heparin ± GPI, results that were consistent with evolution in PCI technique and pharmacotherapy.

Five aspects of their review are striking: (i) welfare chauvinism is higher in tax-funded healthcare systems; (ii) PRRPs in coalition with liberal or social democratic parties are able to shift welfare reform in a more chauvinistic direction; (iii) coalitions involving PRRPs can buffer somewhat the drift to welfare chauvinism, but not by much; (iv) the European Union (EU) and its healthcare policies has served somewhat as a check on PRRPs' direct influence on healthcare welfare chauvinism; (v) PRRPs perform a balancing act between supporting their base and protecting elected power. We note that PRRPs are not confined to Europe and examine the example of Trump's USA, arguing that the Republican Party he dominates now comes close to the authors' definition of a PRRP. We applaud the authors' scoping review for adding to the literature on political determinants of health but note the narrow frame on welfare policy could be usefully expanded to other areas of public policy. We examine three of such areas: the extent to which policy protects those who are different from mainstream society in terms of race, ethnicity, gender or sexuality; the debate between free trade and protectionism; and the rejection of climate change science by many PRRPs. Our analysis concludes that PRRPs promote agendas which are antithetical to eco-socially just population health, and conclude for a call for more research on the political determinants of health.","Labonté, Ronald; Baum, Fran",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729282/,106

The prepared catalysts were characterized by SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis, XPS, XRD, and FTIR, which proved that the modification method successfully introduced the C bridge into the carbon nitride molecular system and increased the structural defects of the catalyst. The Carbon-bridge-modified MLD/CN/Fe3O4 also had good visible-light response and charge-separation and transport abilities in the photoelectrochemical test. Degradation results showed that the photo-Fenton degradation of TC reached 95.8%, and the mineralization rate was 55.7% within 80 min at 80 mM H2O2 dosage, 0.5 g/L catalyst dosage, and near-neutral pH by 0.8MLD/CN/Fe3O4. Moreover, the oxidation products and mineralization pathways of TC were explored by LC-MS. Toxicity analysis indicated low environmental threat of the intermediates in TC mineralization. EPR analysis and H2O2 decomposition efficiency analyses showed an improvement in the H2O2 decomposition performance of 0.8MLD/CN/Fe3O4. This work could provide a valuable insight for the application of heterogeneous photo-Fenton technology in wastewater treatment.","Zhang, Xiao; Ren, Bin; Li, Xi; Liu, Biming; Wang, Shiwen; Yu, Peng; Xu, Yanhua; Jiang, Guoqiang",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118537/,106

One possible model of care delivery is called the ""medical home"". The medical home is not a residential home, but a system where a patient's healthcare is coordinated through a primary care physician to ensure necessary care is received when and where the patient needs it. We compared the continuity of care among autistic adult patients at a specialized primary care medical home designed to remove barriers to care for autistic adults, called the CAST, to matched national samples of autistic adults with private insurance or Medicare. Continuity of primary care among CAST patients was significantly better than that of matched national samples of autistic adult Medicare beneficiaries and similar to that of privately insured autistic adults. Our findings suggest that medical homes, like CAST, are a promising solution to improve healthcare delivery for the growing population of autistic adults.","Hand, Brittany N; Coury, Daniel L; White, Susan; Darragh, Amy R; Moffatt-Bruce, Susan; Harris, Lauren; Longo, Anne; Garvin, Jennifer H",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320953967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907353/,106
133255,Usability and the Rapid Deployable Infectious Disease Decision Support System.,2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND In adults, xenon has only minimal hemodynamic side effects when compared with other anesthetics. Moreover, in preclinical experiments, xenon has been demonstrated to possess cardio- and neuroprotective properties. Altogether, the favorable hemodynamic profile combined with its potential for organ-protection could render xenon an attractive option for anesthesia in children with cardiovascular compromise. AIMS The aim of this study was to explore safety and feasibility of sevoflurane-augmented xenon anesthesia in school-aged children and to assess early postoperative neurocognitive effects of xenon-sevoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia when compared to a control group that did not have anesthesia. METHODS Forty children aged 4-12 years, suffering from congenital heart disease, undergoing diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization were randomized to either xenon-augmented sevoflurane anesthesia or sevoflurane alone. Safety was assessed by the incidence of intraprocedural hemodynamic instability and feasibility by anesthetic depth and respiratory profile. In addition, neurocognitive performance was assessed preoperatively, 2 hours after discharge from PACU and at 24 hours after anesthesia using the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks system. A healthy control group of 22 age- and gender-matched children not exposed to anesthesia underwent an identical neurocognitive test battery, at comparable time intervals. RESULTS Overall hemodynamics did not differ between groups. Xenon-sevoflurane anesthesia resulted in decreased intraoperative ephedrine requirements (median [IQR]) (0.00 mg/kg [0.00-0.00] vs 0.00 mg/kg [0.00-0.01], P = 0.047). Only neurocognitive tests in the domain of alertness were significantly impaired 2 hours postoperatively in both anesthesia groups in comparison with the control group (alertness variability: P = 0.02, odds ratio 5.8), but recovered at 24 hours. For working memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and motor coordination tasks, no significant interaction effects of anesthesia were found in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSION In this pilot trial, xenon-augmented sevoflurane anesthesia in school-aged children was feasible, and associated with decreased ephedrine requirements. All children exposed to anesthesia showed impaired neurocognitive performance in the immediate postoperative period when compared to control children; however, without significant differences between both treatment groups.","Devroe, Sarah; Lemiere, Jurgen; Van Hese, Laura; Gewillig, Marc; Boshoff, Derize; Poesen, Koen; Van de Velde, Marc; Rex, Steffen",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30004615/,106

Its diagnosis is very difficult in the preoperative period: it is usually an incidental finding. CASE PRESENTATION We report an unusual case of perforated gangrenous appendicitis with peri-appendicular abscess occurring in an irreducible Amyand's hernia. An 80-year-old male, with chronic obstructive disease and pulmonary emphysema, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, underwent urgent surgery, under local anesthesia, for right incarcerated inguinoscrotal hernia. He was found to have a perforated gangrenous appendicitis with peri-appendicular abscess within a right indirect inguinal hernia sac. Appendicectomy and Bassini's hernia repair were performed under local anesthesia without any complications. CLINICAL DISCUSSION The treatment of Amyand's hernia is not standardized. The current generally accepted algorithm for Amyand's hernia is essentially contingent on the appendix's condition within the hernia sac. CONCLUSION Appendectomy and primary herniorrhaphy, under local anesthesia, for type 3 of Amyand's hernia, is a safe procedure and easy to perform and, if confirmed by further study, could be part of every surgeon's knowledge.","Caruso, Giovambattista; Toscano, Chiara; Evola, Giuseppe; Benfatto, Salvatore Antonio Maria; Reina, Martina; Reina, Giuseppe Angelo",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.01.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33482451/,106

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n=30) with intestinal lesions requiring an enterectomy. METHODS Stapled 1-stage functional end-to-end anastomosis and resection using a GIA-60 and a TA-55 stapling devices were performed under supervision of senior residents and faculty surgeons by junior surgeons previously trained in the technique on pigs. Procedure duration and technical problems were recorded. Short-term results were collected during hospitalization and at suture removal. Long-term outcome was established by clinical and ultrasonographic examinations at least 2 months after surgery and from written questionnaires, completed by owners. RESULTS Mean±SD procedure duration was 15±12 minutes. Postoperative recovery was uneventful in 25 dogs. One dog had anastomotic leakage, 1 had a localized abscess at the transverse staple line, and 3 dogs developed an incisional abdominal wall abscess. No long-term complications occurred (follow-up, 2-32 months). CONCLUSION Stapled 1-stage functional end-to-end anastomosis and resection is a fast and safe procedure in the hand of nonexpert but trained surgeons.","Jardel, Nicolas; Hidalgo, Antoine; Leperlier, Dimitri; Manassero, Mathieu; Gomes, Aymeric; Bedu, Anne Sophie; Moissonnier, Pierre; Fayolle, Pascal; Begon, Dominique; Riquois, Elisabeth; Viateau, Véronique",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2010.00784.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21223317/,106
134853,Preserving Clinical Trial Integrity During the Coronavirus Pandemic.,2020-03-25,"OBJECTIVE Chlorine dioxide (CD) gas has been used as a fumigant in the disinfection of biosafety laboratories. In this study, some experiments were conducted to assess the inactivation of spores inoculated on six materials [stainless steel (SS), painted steel (PS), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), polyurethane (PU), glass (GS), and cotton cloth (CC)] by CD gas. The main aims of the study were to determine the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas and the effect of prehumidification before decontamination on sporicidal efficacy. METHODS Material coupons (1.2 cm diameter of SS, PS, and PU; 1.0 cm×1.0 cm for PVC, GS, and CC) were contaminated with 10 μl of Bacillus subtilis var. niger (ATCC 9372) spore suspension in mixed organic burden and then dried in a biosafety cabinet for 12 h. The spores were recovered by soaking the coupons in 5 ml of extraction liquid for 1 h and then vortexing the liquid for 1 min. RESULTS The log reductions in spore numbers on inoculated test materials exposed to CD gas [0.080% (volume ratio, v/v) for 3 h] were in the range of from 1.80 to 6.64. Statistically significant differences were found in decontamination efficacies on test material coupons of SS, PS, PU, and CC between with and without a 1-h prehumidification treatment. With the extraction method, there were no statistically significant differences in the recovery ratios between the porous and non-porous materials. CONCLUSIONS The results reported from this study could provide information for developing decontamination technology based on CD gas for targeting surface microbial contamination.","Li, Yan-ju; Zhu, Neng; Jia, Hai-quan; Wu, Jin-hui; Yi, Ying; Qi, Jian-cheng",Journal of Zhejiang University.

136481,"Taking Language Samples Home: Feasibility, Reliability, and Validity of Child Language Samples Conducted Remotely With Video Chat Versus In-Person.",2020-11-13,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a group of metalloenzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals (O2˙-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen (O2). As the first line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage, SODs are expected to play an important role in the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases. However, the clinical applications of SODs have been severely limited by their structural instability and high cost. Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme-like activity, are more stable, and economical, can be easily modified and their activities can be adjusted. Due to their excellent characteristics, nanozymes have attracted widespread attention in recent years and are expected to become effective substitutes for natural enzymes in many application fields. Importantly, some nanozymes with SOD-like activity have been developed and proved to have a mitigating effect on diseases caused by oxidative stress. These studies on SOD-like nanozymes provide a feasible strategy for breaking through the dilemma of SOD clinical applications. However, at present, the specific catalytic mechanism of SOD-like nanozymes is still unclear, and many important issues need to be resolved. Although there are many comprehensive reviews to introduce the overall situation of the nanozyme field, the research on SOD-like nanozymes still lacks a systematic review. From the structure and mechanism of natural SOD enzymes to the structure and regulation of SOD-like nanozymes, and then to the measurement and application of nanozymes, this review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SOD-like nanozymes. The existing shortcomings and possible future research hotspots in the development of SOD-like nanozymes are summarized and prospected. We hope that this review would provide ideas and inspirations for further research on the catalytic mechanism and rational design of SOD-like nanozymes.","Zhao, Hanqing; Zhang, Ruofei; Yan, Xiyun; Fan, Kelong",Journal of materials chemistry.

In this article we report our technique of laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up (TEGPUL) in LGEA, based on the open approach of Spitz. Differences between TEGPUL and the original technique are the absence of a pyloromyotomy, the peel-away technique, the gastric pull-up through the distal esophagus, and its extracorporeal section. We performed the technique in 10 patients: 6 girls and 4 boys. Six had esophageal atresia type III (60%), three had esophageal atresia type I (30%) and one had esophageal atresia type II (10%). Mean time in surgery was 4.43 hours (range, 3.3-7 hours). Average stay in the pediatric intensive care unit was 5.9 days (range, 3-25 days). Average time under mechanical ventilation was 4.6 days (range, 2-8 days). Average total hospital stay was 19.4 days (range, 11-40 days). Oral feeding began at 15.6 days (range, 5-30 days). We believe these steps and the early realization of the technique will reduce the morbidity and mortality among these patients and decrease the number of contraindications to gastric pull-up. Nevertheless, a valid conclusion will require more studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up.","Parilli, Alejandra; García, Wilfredo; Mejías, José Gregorio; Galdón, Ivet; Contreras, Gregory",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

It is indicated for treatment of heparin induced thrombocytopenia as well as for prophylaxis during percutaneous coronary intervention. There are no reports describing the protocols for its use during neurointerventional procedures. We report on a series of three patients where argatroban was used in a series of three patients who underwent endovascular interventional procedures. RESULTS Argatroban was given in a loading dosage of 4 μg/kg/min for 10 min followed by an infusion of 1.0 μg/kg/min. During the procedure, no procedural complications were reported.

This study aimed to determine whether wedge resection can provide comparable prognoses for elderly patients with NSCLC. METHODS The study analyzed the clinicopathologic findings and surgical outcomes during a median follow-up period of 39.6 months for 156 patients with solid dominant (consolidation-to-tumor ratio > 0.5) small (whole tumor size ≤ 2 cm) NSCLC among 892 patients 80 years of age or older with medically operable lung cancer between April 2015 and December 2016. RESULTS The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates after wedge resection and after segmentectomy plus lobectomy did not differ significantly (86.5 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 74.6-93.0 % vs 83.7 % 95 % CI, 74.0-90.0 %; P = 0.92). Multivariable Cox regression analysis of OS with propensity scores showed that the surgical procedure was not an independent prognostic predictor (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.39-1.8; P = 0.64). The 3-year OS rates were slightly better after wedge resection for 97 patients who could tolerate lobectomy than after segmentectomy plus lobectomy (89.4 %; 95 % CI, 73.8-95.9 % vs 75.8 %; 95 % CI, 62.0-85.2 %; P = 0.14). The cumulative incidence of other causes for death was marginally higher after segmentectomy plus lobectomy than after wedge resection (P = 0.079).

The number of refusals after naloxone administration were compared across the before-pandemic interval (01/01/20 to 02/15/20) and the during-pandemic interval (03/16/20 to 04/30/20). For comparison the incidence of all other patient refusals before and during COVID-19 as well as the incidences of naloxone administration before and during COVID-19 were also reported.Results: Prior to the widespread knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 of 164 (14.6%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. During the pandemic, 55 of 153 (35.9%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. Subjects receiving naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic were at greater risk of refusal of transport than those receiving naloxone prior to the pandemic (RR =2.45; 95% CI 1.6-3.76). Among those who did not receive naloxone, 2067 of 6956 (29.7%) patients were not transported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2483 of 6016 (41.3%) were not transported during the pandemic. Subjects who did not receive naloxone with EMS were at greater risk of refusal of transport during the COVID-19 pandemic than prior to it (RR =1.39; 95% CI 1.32-1.46).Conclusion: In this single EMS system, more than a two-fold increase in the rate of refusal after non-fatal opioid overdose was observed following the COVID-19 outbreak.","Glenn, Melody J; Rice, Amber D; Primeau, Keith; Hollen, Adrienne; Jado, Isrealia; Hannan, Philipp; McDonough, Sharon; Arcaris, Brittany; Spaite, Daniel W; Gaither, Joshua B",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1834656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054530/,106
138423,Informal Caregiver Decision-Making Factors Associated With Technology Adoption and Use in Home Healthcare: A Systematic Scoping Review.,2019,"BACKGROUND Controversy exists regarding many aspects of decision making pertaining to same-day versus staged bilateral TKA (BTKAs), including patient selection, perioperative management decisions, and other important choices. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES In the absence of suitable randomized trials, we sought to determine areas of consensus among national experts on the following questions: (1) What are the comparative risks of same-day BTKAs compared with unilateral TKA (UTKA) and staged BTKAs? (2) Who should be considered an appropriate candidate for same-day BTKAs? (3) What constitutes appropriate workup and perioperative management for BTKAs? (4) What is the optimal time between procedures if same-day BTKAs are not deemed appropriate? (5) Are there orthopaedic or rehabilitation considerations for BTKAs that might outweigh medical contraindications? METHODS In the setting of a consensus conference of national experts in orthopaedic surgery, anesthesiology, perioperative medicine, and epidemiology, the major questions surrounding same-day BTKAs were addressed by using an extensive literature review and the modified Delphi process. The process concluded with a meeting of participants and formulation of consensus statements. RESULTS Eighty-one percent of participants agreed that BTKAs are more invasive and complex procedures associated with increased risk for perioperative adverse events compared with UTKA in an unselected group of patients. The consensus group agreed that physicians and hospitals should consider using more restrictive patient selection criteria and exclude those with a modified cardiac risk index greater than 3 to mitigate the potentially increased risk. The majority of the group agreed that perioperative assessment and management should reflect the higher level of acuity of same-day BTKAs. Eighty-one percent of participants agreed that if a patient is not deemed a candidate for same-day BTKAs, a second TKA should be scheduled no sooner than 3 months after the first. The entire group agreed that when there is a conflict between the orthopaedic need and the medical adequacy of same-day BTKAs, the medical concern for the patient's safety should prevail over the orthopaedic need. CONCLUSIONS Experts perceived that same-day BTKAs increase medical risk, and thus a systematic approach to the management of patients should be taken to minimize complications.","Memtsoudis, Stavros G; Hargett, Mary; Russell, Linda A; Parvizi, Javad; Cats-Baril, William L; Stundner, Ottokar; Sculco, Thomas P",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11999-013-2976-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23564364/,106

139053,A stakeholder meeting exploring the ethical perspectives of immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery.,2020-09-21,"Background The use of sealing devices has been established in thyroid surgeries. Recently, LigaSure Small Jaw (LS), a new device that utilizes bipolar energy, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in different head and neck procedures. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency and safety of LS use in thyroid surgery compared to Harmonic Focus Scalpel (HS), a well-established device. Methods A prospective study was conducted to compare the efficacy of LS versus the HS. We evaluated 301 patients who underwent surgery at a North American academic institution. Patients were allocated into two groups according to LS or HS use. All patients underwent vocal cord assessment using direct laryngoscopy preoperatively and postoperatively. Analyses were performed to examine the difference in perioperative outcomes resulting from the utilization of either device. Results No difference was seen in operative time between both groups (124.20 ± 68.44 minutes in HS vs 125.20 ± 72.13 minutes in LS, P = .99). Overall complications were similar between both groups (22.86% in HS vs 13.84% in LS, P = .05). However, LS use was also associated with a lower incidence of postoperative transient hypocalcemia as compared to the HS (P = .025). No significant difference was found between both groups regarding the incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (P = .52). Conclusion The use of the LS is safe, feasible, and is associated with comparable outcomes to HS. Both intraoperative and postoperative variables were similar between both devices. Future larger studies are warranted to further investigate the effect on postoperative transient hypocalcemia.","Hammad, Abdulrahman Y; Deniwar, Ahmed; Al-Qurayshi, Zaid; Mohamed, Hossam Eldin; Rizwan, Aslam; Kandil, Emad",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350616639143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009687/,106
139091,The unwanted legacies of COVID-19.,2021-04-01,"The authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

However, measuring the genomic integrity of these cells throughout a study is a costly endeavor that is commonly forgone. Here, we validate the identity of cancer cell lines in three pharmacogenomic studies and screen for genetic drift within and between datasets. Using SNP data from these datasets encompassing 1,497 unique cell lines and 63 unique pharmacological compounds, we show that genetic drift is widely prevalent in almost all cell lines with a median of 4.5%-6.1% of the total genome size drifted between any two isogenic cell lines. This study highlights the need for molecular profiling of cell lines to minimize the effects of passaging or misidentification in biomedical studies. We developed the CCLid web application, available at www.cclid.ca, to allow users to screen the genomic profiles of their cell lines against these datasets.

Currently, there is no evidence that even if RAS inhibitors increase expression and activity of ACE2, that they would increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating greater viral entry or worsen outcomes in patients with COVID-19. At this time, there is no clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors should be discontinued in stable patients with COVID-19.

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an endeavor to generate 3-dimensional (3D) molecular atlases of healthy and diseased kidney biopsies using multiple state-of-the-art OMICS and imaging technologies across several institutions. Obtaining rigorous and reproducible results from disparate methods and at different sites to interrogate biomolecules at a single cell level or in 3D space is a significant challenge that can be a futile exercise if not well controlled. We describe a ""follow the tissue"" pipeline for generating a reliable and authentic single cell/region 3D molecular atlas of human adult kidney. Our approach emphasizes quality assurance, quality control, validation and harmonization across different OMICS and imaging technologies from sample procurement, processing, storage, shipping to data generation, analysis and sharing. We established benchmarks for quality control, rigor, reproducibility and feasibility across multiple technologies through a pilot experiment using common source tissue that was processed and analyzed at different institutions and different technologies. A peer review system was established to critically review quality control measures and the reproducibility of data generated by each technology before being approved to interrogate clinical biopsy specimens. The process established economizes the use of valuable biopsy tissue for multi-OMICS and imaging analysis with stringent quality control to ensure rigor and reproducibility of results and serves as a model for precision medicine projects across laboratories, institutions and consortia.","El-Achkar, Tarek M; Eadon, Michael T; Menon, Rajasree; Lake, Blue B; Sigdel, Tara K; Alexandrov, Theodore; Parikh, Samir; Zhang, Guanshi; Dobib, Dejan; Dunn, Kenneth W; Otto, Edgar A; Anderton, Christopher R; Carson, Jonas M; Luo, Jinghui; Park, Chris; Hamidi, Habib; Zhou, Jian; Hoover, Paul; Schroeder, Andrew; Joanes, Marianinha; Azeloglu, Evren U; Sealfon, Rachel; Winfree, Seth; Steck, Becky; He, Yongqun; D'Agati, Vivette Denise; Iyengar, Ravi; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Barisoni, Laura; Gaut, Joseph; Zhang, Kun; Laszik, Zoltan; Rovin, Brad; Dagher, Pierre C; Sharma, Kumar; Sarwal, Minnie; Hodgin, Jeffrey B; Alpers, Charles E; Kretzer, Matthias; Jain, Sanjay; The Kidney Precision Medicine Project, For",Physiological genomics,https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00104.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197228/,106

However, high-resolution manometry (HRM) and EPT require increased equipment costs over conventional systems and evidence demonstrating a significant diagnostic advantage of EPT over CLT is limited. Our aim was to investigate whether the inter-rater agreement and/or accuracy of esophageal motility diagnosis differed between EPT and CLT. METHODS Forty previously completed patient HRM studies were selected for analysis using a customized software program developed to perform blinded independent interpretation in either EPT or CLT (six pressure sensors) format. Six experienced gastroenterologists with a clinical focus in esophageal disease (attendings) and six gastroenterology trainees with minimal manometry experience (fellows) from three academic centers interpreted each of the 40 studies using both EPT and CLT formats. Rater diagnoses were assessed for inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy, both for exact diagnosis and for correct identification of a major esophageal motility disorder. RESULTS The total group agreement was moderate (κ=0.57; 95% CI: 0.56-0.59) for EPT and fair (κ=0.32; 0.30-0.33) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between attendings was good (κ=0.68; 0.65-0.71) for EPT and moderate (κ=0.46; 0.43-0.50) for CLT. Inter-rater agreement between fellows was moderate (κ=0.48; 0.45-0.50) for EPT and poor to fair (κ=0.20; 0.17-0.24) for CLT. Among all raters, the odds of an incorrect exact esophageal motility diagnosis were 3.3 times higher with CLT assessment than with EPT (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.4-4.5; P<0.0001), and the odds of incorrect identification of a major motility disorder were 3.4 times higher with CLT than with EPT (OR: 3.4; 2.4-5.0; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Superior inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of esophageal motility diagnoses were demonstrated with analysis using EPT over CLT among our selected raters. On the basis of these findings, EPT may be the preferred assessment modality of esophageal motility.","Carlson, Dustin A; Ravi, Karthik; Kahrilas, Peter J; Gyawali, C Prakash; Bredenoord, Arjan J; Castell, Donald O; Spechler, Stuart J; Halland, Magnus; Kanuri, Navya; Katzka, David A; Leggett, Cadman L; Roman, Sabine; Saenz, Jose B; Sayuk, Gregory S; Wong, Alan C; Yadlapati, Rena; Ciolino, Jody D; Fox, Mark R; Pandolfino, John E",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2015.159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032151/,106

Several new pharmacologic treatments designed for tinnitus patients without specific origin had been developed but their efficacy remains unclear. Methods The current Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatments for tinnitus management in tinnitus patients without specific or treatable origin (i.e. primary tinnitus). Databases were searched from inception to April 5th, 2021. All network meta-analytic procedures were conducted under the frequentist model. We calculated the effect size of outcomes with different rating scales with standardized mean difference. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020177742. Findings Overall, 36 RCTs were included with 2,761 participants. The main results revealed that pharmacologic interventions with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) and those with anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) were associated with superior improvement in tinnitus severity and response rate compared to placebo/control. Oral amitriptyline were associated with the highest improvement in tinnitus severity and the fourth highest response rate. None of the investigated interventions was associated with different changes in quality of life compared to placebo/control. All the investigated treatments were associated with similar drop-out rate to placebo/control. Interpretation The current NMA suggests a potential role for treatments with brain-acting effect (for example, amitriptyline, acamprosate, and gabapentin) or anti-inflammation/anti-oxidant effect (for example, intra-tympanic dexamethasone injection plus oral melatonin) as the preferable effective treatments for tinnitus without specific or treatable origin.

Further, the compounds were assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal activity. Antibacterial screening was done by employing broth micro-dilution method and compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activity (MIC, 50-1.56 µg/mL) against different human pathogenic bacteria, viz. B. cerus, B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa and drug resistant strain (DRS) of E. coli. A great synergistic effect was observed during evaluation of ∑FIC, where a combination study was performed using standard references, viz. chloramphenicol and kanamycin. The MIC data obtained from different methods of combination approach revealed 4-128 fold more potency compared to compounds tested alone. The results clearly indicated the possibility of these compounds as active ingredients of drug regimen used against MDR strains. Antifungal screening were also performed employing two different methods, viz. serial dilution method and zone inhibition method, clearly indicated that compounds were also potentially active against several species of pathogenic fungal strains, viz. A. flavus, A. niger, F. oxysporum and C. albicans. The assessment of structure activity relationship (SAR) clearly revealed that presence of less polar and more hydrophobic substituents positively favours the antibacterial activity, conversely, more polar and hydrophilic substituents favours the antifungal activities. Thus, the results positively endorsed the compounds as potent antibacterial and antifungal agents which could be developed as possible drug regimens.","Chaurasia, Himani; Singh, Vishal K; Mishra, Richa; Yadav, Aditya K; Ram, Nand K; Singh, Prashant; Singh, Ramendra K",Bioorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.105227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399320/,106

For decades, scientists have been developing indices to describe and evaluate the depth of anaesthesia. Historically, mean alveolar gas concentration (MAC) values for volatile anaesthetics have been used to target a predefined level of anaesthesia. MAC values were however not established to differentiate between the hypnotic and analgesic components of anaesthesia. Indices were therefore developed that measure the effect of hypnotics predominantly on the brain (in contrast to an effect on the spinal cord) with the vision to be able to measure the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. Although monitors measuring the depth of anaesthesia are still not capable of measuring the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, brain monitoring has proved to help clinicians control the depth of anaesthesia. Clinical trials have shown that the use of brain-monitoring devices can lead to a reduction of intraoperative drug consumption, reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, facilitate recovery from anaesthesia compared to routine care and can also lead to a reduction of intraoperative awareness. However a study demonstrating both a reduced intraoperative drug consumption and at the same time a reduction of intraoperative awareness due to the use of brain-monitoring devices has not been published yet.","Ellerkmann, Richard K; Soehle, Martin; Kreuer, Sascha",Best practice & research.

146591,Paving the post-covid Rhinology era with ERS!,2021-05-30,"Arachnids are the second most successful terrestrial animal group after insects [1] and were one of the first arthropod clades to successfully invade land [2]. Fossil evidence for this transition is limited, with the majority of arachnid clades first appearing in the terrestrial fossil record. Furthermore, molecular clock dating has suggested a Cambrian-Ordovician terrestrialization event for arachnids [3], some 60 Ma before their first fossils in the Silurian, although these estimates assume that arachnids evolved from a fully aquatic ancestor. Eurypterids, the sister clade to terrestrial arachnids [4-6], are known to have undergone major macroecological shifts in transitioning from marine to freshwater environments during the Devonian [7, 8]. Discoveries of apparently subaerial eurypterid trackways [9, 10] have led to the suggestion that eurypterids were even able to venture on land and possibly breathe air [11]. However, modern horseshoe crabs undertake amphibious excursions onto land to reproduce [12], rendering trace fossil evidence alone inconclusive. Here, we present details of the respiratory organs of Adelophthalmus pyrrhae sp. nov. from the Carboniferous of Montagne Noire, France [13], revealed through micro computed tomography (μ-CT) imaging. Pillar-like trabeculae on the dorsal surface of each gill lamella indicate eurypterids were capable of subaerial breathing, suggesting that book gills are the direct precursors to book lungs while vascular ancillary respiratory structures known as Kiemenplatten represent novel air-breathing structures. The discovery of air-breathing structures in eurypterids indicates that characters permitting terrestrialization accrued in the arachnid stem lineage and suggests the Cambrian-Ordovician ancestor of arachnids would also have been semi-terrestrial.","Lamsdell, James C; McCoy, Victoria E; Perron-Feller, Opal A; Hopkins, Melanie J",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916114/,106

147030,Effects of wearing lower leg compression sleeves on locomotion economy.,2018,"Viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is complicated by the mostly irreplaceable nature of neurons, as the loss of neurons has the potential to result in permanent damage to brain function. However, whether neurons or other cells in the CNS sometimes survive infection and the effects of infection on neuronal function is largely unknown. To address this question, we used the rJHM strain (rJ) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus that causes acute encephalitis in susceptible strains of mice. To determine whether neurons or other CNS cells survive acute infection with this virulent virus, we developed a recombinant JHMV that expresses Cre recombinase (rJ-Cre) and infected mice that universally expressed a silent (floxed) version of tdTomato. Infection of these mice with rJ-Cre resulted in expression of tdTomato in host cells. The results showed that some cells were able to survive the infection, as demonstrated by continued tdTomato expression after virus antigen could no longer be detected. Most notably, interneurons in the olfactory bulb, which are known to be inhibitory, represented a large fraction of the surviving cells. In conclusion, our results indicated that some neurons are resistant to virus-mediated cell death and provide a framework for studying the effects of prior coronavirus infection on neuron function.IMPORTANCE We developed a novel recombinant virus that allows the study of cells that survive an infection by a central nervous system-specific strain of murine coronavirus. Using this virus, we identified neurons and, to a lesser extent, nonneuronal cells in the brain that were infected during the acute phase of the infection and survived for approximately 2 weeks until the mice succumbed to the infection. We focused on neurons and glial cells within the olfactory bulb because the virus enters the brain at this site. Our results show that interneurons of the olfactory bulb were the primary cell type able to survive infection. Further, these results indicate that this system will be useful for functional and gene expression studies of cells in the brain that survive acute infection.","Wheeler, D Lori; Athmer, Jeremiah; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01099-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28835503/,106

In some patients, perhaps because of their specific anatomy or physical activity, it seems to have a major function as a hip stabilizer. Therefore, after a complete LT tear, this group of patients may have persistent hip pain and mechanical symptoms probably related to microinstability and subtle subluxation. We present the case of a female patient with a complete LT tear. This had been treated by debridement and anterior capsule tightening, followed by prolonged rehabilitation. However, she had persistent symptoms. An LT reconstruction with a novel surgical technique was performed. The LT was reconstructed with double-stranded semitendinosus graft. The acetabular end was fixed with 2 anchors, and the femoral end was passed into a bone tunnel and fixed with an interference screw. After surgery, the patient's modified Harris Hip Score and Non-Arthritic Hip Score improved from 53 and 73 to 100 and 95, respectively, at 12 months of follow-up. At repeat arthroscopy 15 months after surgery, it was observed that the graft had resorbed, although the 2 Ticron stitches (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) remained firmly attached and were still acting as a small synthetic ligament.","Amenabar, Tomas; O'Donnell, John",Arthroscopy techniques,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2012.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23766991/,106

However, youth-friendliness in this area has not been clearly defined and there is a lack of information about the characteristics that make such services youth friendly. The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the literature available on youth-friendly mental health and substance use services in order to identify the characteristics, outline the expected impacts, and establish a definition. METHODS A scoping review of seven databases and grey literature sources was conducted. Twenty-eight documents were retained as relevant to the research questions. Relevant data from these documents was extracted, analyzed and presented to stakeholders, including youth, caregivers and service providers to validate and refine the results. RESULTS Youth-friendly mental health and substance use services include integrated, inclusive, confidential and safe organization and policy characteristics; bright, comfortable, environment with informational materials; welcoming and genuine service providers with appropriate communication and counselling skills; an accessible location; minimal wait times; and individualized and innovative approaches. All areas in which youth friendliness should be implemented in a mental health and substance use service organization had a core value of youth voice. CONCLUSION Improving the youth friendliness of mental health and substance use services includes incorporating youth voice in organization, policy, environment, service providers, and treatment services, and has implications for treatment uptake, engagement and satisfaction. Further research is required to determine the impact of youth friendliness in such services.","Hawke, Lisa D; Mehra, Kamna; Settipani, Cara; Relihan, Jaqueline; Darnay, Karleigh; Chaim, Gloria; Henderson, Joanna",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4066-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31029109/,106
148482,A guide to writing grant proposals for nursing research.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND Exercise intolerance limits chronic restrictive respiratory failure (CRF) patients from participating in daily activities. The specific modalities that could improve exercise tolerance in these patients remain to be established. OBJECTIVE To investigate exercise endurance and associated physiological responses with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise in restrictive CRF patients. METHODS Eighteen patients (63+/-11 years, total lung capacity (TLC)=59+/-16% of predicted value) performed maximal exercise in spontaneous breathing conditions (MWLE) and during two constant workload exercise (CWLE) tests at 75% Pmax, with or without NIV in random order. ""NIV Responders"" were defined by an increase in CWLE duration of more than 50% when using NIV. RESULTS For the whole group, CWLE duration when using NIV increased from 5.6+/-4.6 to 9.6+/-8.1 min. Increase in CWLE duration correlated with reduction in heart rate and oxygen desaturation, and dyspnea relief during exercise. NIV responders (n=9) showed more severe lung restriction (TLC: 2.6+/-0.7 versus 3.5+/-1.1L; forced vital capacity: 1.0+/-0.16 versus 1.46+/-0.38 L). At the end of MWLE, responders had a lower Vt (0.60+/-0.09 versus 0.89+/-0.34 L), a higher dead-space ratio (0.51+/-0.06 versus 0.38+/-0.12) and lower oxygen pulse (4.5+/-1.2 versus 7.4+/-3.9 ml/beat). CONCLUSION In severely restrictive patients, NIV during exercise significantly improved exercise duration and tolerance and increased alveolar ventilation.

METHODS Faecal samples (n=1,283) were collected during the 2011 calving season from calves that were 1-5 and 9-21 days-old on 97 dairy farms, and were analysed for the presence of bovine group A rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium and Salmonella spp., and K99. Farm-level prevalences were calculated and relationships between demographic variables and the presence of enteropathogens were examined using logistic regression models. RESULTS Of the 97 farms, 93 (96%) had at least one sample infected with enteropathogens. The standardised farm prevalences of bovine group A rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and C. parvum were 46, 14 and 18%, respectively, in calves that were 1-5 days-old, and 57, 31 and 52%, respectively, in calves that were 9-21 days-old. The farm-level prevalence of K99 was 11% in calves that were 1-5 days-old. Salmonella spp. were found in three and four samples, from calves that were 1-5 and 9-21 days-old, respectively. No associations between explanatory variables and the presence of the enteropathogens were identified at the farm level. At the calf level, the odds of C. parvum shedding and of co-infection with any combination of pathogens were greater in calves that were 9-21 than 1-5 days-old. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study provides epidemiological estimates of the prevalence of calves' enteropathogens in New Zealand, which could be used for infection risk assessment or estimation of the environmental loads of pathogens shed in cattle faeces.","Al Mawly, J; Grinberg, A; Prattley, D; Moffat, J; French, N",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2014.966168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25237728/,106

DESIGN Prospective case-control study. SETTING Academic tertiary care centre. POPULATION Pregnant women with known outcomes prospectively sampled. METHODS PCF RNA extracted from women at 22-24weeks (5 sPTB≦32weeks and 5 term) was hybridised to gene expression arrays. Differentially regulated RNAs for sPTB≦32weeks were initially selected based on p-value compared to control (p<0.01) and fold change (≥1.5x). Potential markers were then reordered by narrowness of distribution. Final marker selection was made by searching the Metacore™ database to determine whether the PCF RNA interacted with a reported set of myometrial Preterm Initiator genes. RNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR and tested in a second group of 40 women (20 with sPTB ≦32weeks (mean gestation 26.5, standard deviation ±2.6weeks), 20 with spontaneous term delivery (40.1±0.9weeks) sampled 16-19+5weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Identification of PCF RNAs predictive of sPTB≦32weeks. RESULTS 297 PCR RNAs were differentially expressed in sPTB≦32weeks. Further selection retained 99 RNAs (86 mRNAs and 13 miRs) and 5 of these interacted in silica with 7 Preterm Initiator genes. Four of 5 RNAs were confirmed and tested on the validation group. The expression of each confirmed PCF RNA was significantly higher in sPTB≦32weeks. In vitro study of the 4 mRNAs revealed higher expression in placenta of women with sPTB≦32weeks and the potential to interfere with myometrial quiescence. CONCLUSIONS The PCF RNA markers are highly associated with sPTB≦32weeks by 16weeks.","Weiner, Carl P; Dong, Yafeng; Zhou, Helen; Cuckle, Howard; Ramsey, Risa; Egerman, Robert; Buhimschi, Irina; Buhimschi, Catalin",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.16736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969600/,106

Different degrees of liver injury or liver dysfunctions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, currently, it remains unclear to what extent liver diseases should be considered as significant risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Moreover, the mechanisms involved in liver injury in severe COVID-19 infection are not yet well understood. AREA COVERED This review summarizes the current evidence on liver function abnormalities in COVID-19 patients and the effects of pre-existing liver disease on the disease severity. This review also illustrates the possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver injury, as well as provides recommendations to prevent liver damage in COVID-19 infection. EXPERT OPINION The elevated levels of ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin are common in more severe patients than non-severe or mild COVID-19 patients. Patients with pre-existing medical conditions including chronic hepatic diseases are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 infection. The drug's effects, possible viral inclusion in liver cells, systemic inflammation and hypoxia are potential causes of liver injury in severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, further studies are needed focusing on the pre-existing hepatic diseases on prevention, treatment and outcome of COVID-19.","Ali, Nurshad; Hossain, Khaled",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2020.1794812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649840/,106

The risk of getting an infection with COVID-19 might impact the emotional well-being in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate quality of life (QoL) for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey, including questions about demographics, concerns of COVID-19 impact on cancer treatment and outpatient clinic visits, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire was sent to patients with cancer at the Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. The survey was open from 15th May to 29th May 2020, and 4.571 responded. Results were compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study' conducted by the Danish Cancer Society to elucidate experiences with the Danish healthcare system prior to COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS In total, 9% of patients with cancer had refrained from consulting a doctor or the hospital due to fear of COVID-19 infection, and 80% were concerned about contracting COVID-19 to some extent. Seventeen patients were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean global QoL and emotional functioning (EF) scores were 71.3 and 82.8, respectively. In comparison to the 'Barometer Study', no clinical significant differences in QoL and EF scores were observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that being 'Concerned about contracting corona-virus' was correlated with lower QoL and EF scores. Factors associated with being concerned of contracting COVID-19 were comorbid conditions, incurable cancer, receiving medical cancer treatment and female gender. CONCLUSION Danish patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic did not have lower scores of QoL and emotional functioning compared to the Danish 'Barometer Study'. However, the study suggests that concerns of contracting COVID-19 was correlated with lower scores of QoL.","Jeppesen, Stefan S; Bentsen, Kristian K; Jørgensen, Trine L; Holm, Hanne S; Holst-Christensen, Linda; Tarpgaard, Line S; Dahlrot, Rikke H; Eckhoff, Lise",Acta oncologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2020.1830169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031010/,106

A trauma-informed (TI) approach is preferred when working with patients with ACEs. The Professional ACEs-Informed Training for Health© (PATH©) educational program and simulation experience using standardized patients (SP) was developed to help healthcare professionals address ACEs with adults. PATH© is a 3-4 hour curriculum comprised of lecture and discussion, video-based demonstration, simulation experience, and debriefing. It was first developed for primary care (PC) residents in family medicine and internal medicine, and subsequently modified for occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) students. This study evaluates a preliminary dataset focusing on PATH© skills of PC residents and OT and PT students during simulation. Recordings of 53 learner-SP encounters from 15 OT and PT students and 38 PC residents were coded using standardized behavioral codes. A subset of ten recordings of PC residents who participated in simulations in the first and fourth year of the training program allowed for evaluation of training outcomes over time. Results showed that medical residents and OT and PT students demonstrated skills during SP encounters congruent with TI training on addressing ACEs with adults, particularly in explaining ACEs, demonstrating empathy, collaborative treatment planning, and stigma reduction. PC residents showed both positive and negative changes in PATH©-specific skills from year 1 to 4 of the training program.

PURPOSE To compare infection rates in intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving disposable versus reusable ECG-LWs. METHODS Matched adult ICUs were randomly assigned to disposable or reusable ECG-LWs. Outcomes were bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and chest surgical site infections. Patients' characteristics and infections were collected from hospital databases. Event rates were described by using total counts and rates per 100 patient days and were compared between groups by using generalized linear mixed-effect models weighted by patients' ICU length of stay. RESULTS Overall, 4056 patients from 6 ICUs received disposable and 3184 patients from 5 ICUs received reusable ECG-LWs. The characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, except patients receiving disposable ECG-LWs were less likely to be discharged home (P = .03) and had more comorbid conditions (P = .002). Overall infection rates did not differ between ECG-LW groups, between groups in matched ICUs, between groups by infection type, or when only patients with ICU stays longer than 48 hours were considered (2578 cases). In multivariate analyses, infection rates did not differ between all patients in ECG-LW groups or for patients with ICU stays beyond 48 hours (both P = .10).

Nevertheless, in several nations these expenses continue to increase. While recent research has emphasized the lack of funding, poor policy design and corruption as the main culprits, little is known about the politics of establishing federal regulatory agencies ensuring that state governments adhere to national insurance reimbursement and coverage procedures. This article fills in this lacuna by providing an alternative perspective, one that accounts for differences between nations in the creation of regulatory institutions, with an emphasis instead on governing elite strategies to campaign on access to health care during transitions to democracy, civil societal mobilization, constitutional constraints and the national electoral incentives to overcome ineffective decentralization processes. The cases of Indonesia and China are introduced as examples of how and why their differences in this political process accounted for Indonesia's success and China's failure to ensure financial protection.","Gómez, Eduardo J","Health economics, policy, and law",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1744133116000293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27839519/,106

However, the effect of tumour-derived exosomes on MDSCs and its mechanism are not clear. Here, we reported that breast cancer cells (4T1)-secreted exosomes (BCC-Ex) were able to differentiate bone marrow cells into MDSCs and significantly inhibited the proliferation of T lymphocytes to provide an immunosuppressive microenvironment for cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. The number of MDSCs in bone marrow and spleen of 4T1 tumour-bearing mice and BCC-Ex infused mice was significantly higher than that of normal mice, whereas the number of T lymphocytes in spleen was significantly decreased. In addition, BCC-Ex markedly promoted the differentiation of MDSCs from bone marrow cells or bone marrow cells derived macrophages, seen as the increased expressions of MDSCs-related functional proteins Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, BCC-Ex significantly down-regulated the expressions of chemokine receptor CXCR4 and markedly up-regulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in bone marrow cells and macrophages and remarkably inhibited the division and proliferation of T cells. Importantly, CXCR4 agonist, CXCL12, could reverse the function of BCC-Ex, indicating that BCC-Ex-induced MDSCs might be dependent on the down-regulation of CXCR4. Western blot showed that BCC-Ex significantly promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 in bone marrow cells, resulting in the inhibitions of the proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow cells, and the aggravation of the differentiation of bone marrow cells into MDSCs.","Liu, Quan-Wen; Chen, Yong; Li, Jing-Yuan; Xiao, Ling; Zhang, Wen-Jie; Zhao, Jia-Le; Gu, Hao-Cheng; Wu, Han-You; Zuo, Guo-Si-Lang; Deng, Ke-Yu; Xin, Hong-Bo",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.16559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955151/,106

Herein we performed SILS for totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) on three cases. CASES Three males of 72, 49, and 73 years old with the diagnoses of bilateral primary inguinal hernia underwent single incision TEP. The operative steps of single incision TEP are very similar to those of a traditional laparoscopic TEP. The difference between them is a 2 cm infraumbilical incision for the placement of three (5 mm) trocars in single incision TEP. We preferred to use a 30° 5 mm laparoscope with some routine laparoscopic instruments during the surgical procedure. All the hernia defects were repaired with VyproII of 15 × 10 cm (Ethicon, NJ, USA). The operations took 32, 26, and 65 min, respectively, with no obvious inconvenience. RESULTS All three patients were discharged on the second postoperative day uneventfully. The postoperative follow-up showed no recurrence in the three patients up to now. CONCLUSION The single incision TEP using an access port device is safe and feasible.

METHODS This retrospective study was undertaken in a tertiary care epilepsy center in India. Consecutive patients with EE who had received IVMP as adjunctive therapy for a minimum of 3 months and had at least one pre-and post-steroid EEG each, were identified and a structured questionnaire was used to collect information including outcomes at 3 months post-steroid course completion and beyond, as available. RESULTS Ninety-seven patients (M:F=71:26) fulfilling the inclusion criteria with a mean age at onset of seizures being 20.52 ± 25.69 months were included. Commonest seizure types were myoclonic (66%); Lennaux-Gastaut and West Syndromes accounted for 57 % and 24 % patients respectively. The etiology was unknown in 52 %. All children were on a combination of standard anti-seizure drugs. The duration of IVMP pulse therapy was 7.72 ± 6.25 months. One-fourth (26 %) patients experienced minor adverse events. Greater than 50 % seizure burden reduction was seen in 66 % patients at 3 months with seizure-freedom in 25 %. A total of 45 (46 %) patients became seizure-free in the cohort eventually with continuation of steroids beyond 3 months. Children with idiopathic EEs, normal neuroimaging, myoclonic jerks, and West syndrome showed the best response. The presence of burst-suppression and generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA) predicted inadequate response. CONCLUSIONS Adjunct pulse doses of IVMP are safe, well-tolerated, and effective in reducing seizures and improving global outcomes in children with idiopathic EEs, West syndrome, normal neuroimaging, and myoclonic jerks. Seizure freedom might be delayed in a subset of these patients, hence duration of therapy beyond 3 months may be warranted.","Chatterjee, Aparajita; Mundlamuri, Ravindranadh Chowdary; Kenchaiah, Raghavendra; Asranna, Ajay; Nagappa, M; Bindu, P S; Seshagiri, D V; Viswanathan, Lakshminarayanapuram Gopal; Shreedhar, A S; Duble, Sisir; Rangarajan, Anush; Khilari, Madhuri; Bharath, Rose Dawn; Saini, Jitender; Thennarasu, K; Taly, Arun B; Sinha, Sanjib",Epilepsy research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2021.106611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740698/,106

The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility of an alternative way of interpreting DST results. METHODS A total of 50 patients with major depression aged 41.0 +/- 11.4 years old participated in the study. Past and present suicide attempts were recorded. Psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), the Newcastle Depression Diagnostic Scale (NDDS), the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale (DMS) and the General Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale. The 1 mg DST protocol was used. Analysis methods included the chi square test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with Fisher least significant difference (LSD) as post hoc tests. RESULTS In all, 34 patients (68%) were suppressors, 16 (32%) were non-suppressors and 14 patients had cortisol values above 5 microg/dl at baseline. Baseline cortisol level did not influence the classical DST interpretation. A total of 18 patients (36%) showed an increase of their cortisol levels after dexamethasone administration and 32 patients (64%) showed a decrease. Reducers had less melancholic features, similar levels of depression, better sleep and less suicidal thoughts in comparison to increasers. No relationship of DST to suicidality was found. DISCUSSION The present study explored the pattern of cortisol response to dexamethasone suppression and suggested an alternative way of coding and interpreting the DST on the basis of whether the cortisol levels remain stable or increase vs decrease after the administration of cortisol. The results put forward a complex way of understanding the relationship of the DST results with clinical symptoms.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Gonda, Xenia; Rihmer, Zoltan; Fokas, Costas; Iacovides, Apostolos",Annals of general psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/1744-859x-7-22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014558/,106

METHODS We retrospectively collected data from 80 consecutive diagnostic vitrectomies performed using a one-port (n = 40) or a three-port approach (n = 40). Cases of suspected postoperative endophthalmitis were not included in the study. Several variables were compared among groups, including length of surgery, postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), diagnostic success and surgical complications. RESULTS The mean duration of surgery was shorter in the one-port group when compared to the three-port group (15 ± 8 min vs. 49 ± 30; p = 0.0001). The patients were observed for a mean follow-up of 19 months (range 1-84). In the one-port group, the mean BCVA improved from 1.31 ± 0.96 to 0.57 ± 0.59 logarithm of minimum resolution (LogMAR) (p = 0.0009). In the three-port group, BCVA improved from 0.98 ± 0.76 to 0.51 ± 0.76 LogMAR (p = 0.0005). The difference in mean postoperative BCVA between groups was not significative at the last follow-up. One-port vitrectomy yields to a final diagnosis in 80% of the cases, and three-port vitrectomy in 48%. Most of the one-port vitrectomies were carried out under topical anesthesia. After surgery, in both groups three eyes developed a retinal detachment. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study, the one-port diagnostic vitrectomy has proven to be as effective and safe as the three-port approach, allowing a reduction in surgical times. One-port diagnostic vitrectomy might be considered as the first option for those cases where more complex surgical procedures are not needed.","Coassin, Marco; Braconi, Lorenzo; Sborgia, Giancarlo; Mangano, Giuseppe; Mastrofilippo, Valentina; Di Zazzo, Antonio; Fontana, Luigi; Cimino, Luca",International ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01504-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647949/,106

METHODS Patients were registered prospectively. Indications for surgery included classical cervical insufficiency, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) or two conizations/cervical amputation.

The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) developed guidance at the start of the pandemic for prioritising surgical patients based on the urgency of different procedures. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHT) has extended this to all aspects of elective care to enable standardised decision-making based on clinical priority, clinical harm and patient vulnerability. This was a clinically led project that involved close collaboration with lay partners, who were concerned that the RCS guidance lacked the sensitivity to reflect individual patients' needs. Our novel elective care recovery matrix is designed to be applicable across all elective care services and at Trust or system level. Implementation at ICHT progressed rapidly: as of 28 August 2020 >200 consultants have received training on the process and 58% of all surgical orders have been prioritised using the new framework (5,134/8,800). While COVID-19 was the driver, the applicability can be wider and could inform new ways of working.

162738,Assessing the impact of adherence to Non-pharmaceutical interventions and indirect transmission on the dynamics of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study,2021-08-24,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that counteract the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN also functions to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to those of untreated samples. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-β-pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest murine hepatitis virus (MHV) ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response, and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.IMPORTANCE CoVs encode multiple antagonists that prevent or disrupt an efficient innate immune response. Additionally, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines currently exist for human CoV infections. Therefore, the study of CoV innate immune antagonists is essential for understanding how CoVs overcome host defenses and to maximize potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we sought to determine the contributions of nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance to the innate immune response. We show that viruses lacking nsp14 ExoN activity are more sensitive than wild-type MHV to restriction by exogenous IFN-β and that viruses produced in the presence of an antiviral state are less capable of establishing a subsequent viral infection. Our results support the hypothesis that murine hepatitis virus ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response.","Case, James Brett; Li, Yize; Elliott, Ruth; Lu, Xiaotao; Graepel, Kevin W; Sexton, Nicole R; Smith, Everett Clinton; Weiss, Susan R; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01531-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29046453/,106

163145,Auxiliary Diagnosis of COVID-19 Based on 5G-Enabled Federated Learning,2021,"To address the challenge of the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes were fabricated to effectively capture and inactivate coronavirus aerosols. With an ultrafine fiber diameter (∼ 200 nm) and a small pore size (∼ 1.5 µm), the optimized membranes caught 99.2% of the aerosols of the murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), a coronavirus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, rose bengal was used as the photosensitizer for the membranes because of its excellent reactivity in generating virucidal singlet oxygen, and the membranes rapidly inactivated 98.9% of MHV-A59 in virus-laden droplets only after 15 min irradiation of simulated reading light. Singlet oxygen damaged the virus genome and impaired virus binding to host cells, which elucidated the mechanism of disinfection at a molecular level. Membrane robustness was also evaluated, and no efficiency reduction for filtering MHV-A59 aerosols was observed after the membranes being exposed to both indoor light and sunlight for days. Nevertheless, sunlight exposure photobleached the membranes, reduced singlet oxygen production, and compromised the performance of disinfecting MHV-A59 in droplets. In contrast, the membranes after simulated indoor light exposure maintained their excellent disinfection performance. In summary, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed to capture and kill airborne environmental pathogens under ambient conditions, and they hold promise for broad applications as personal protective equipment and indoor air filters. Synopsis Photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous filters with excellent capture-and-kill performance against coronaviruses were designed and implemented to prevent the airborne transmission of COVID-19.

Due to the limited research into prison staff experience, this paper aims to explore what staff find most challenging, how they cope, what support they would like and rewarding aspects of their work.Design/methodology/approachThis service development project was facilitated through a staff well-being event. A qualitative approach was used and 74 staff members provided anonymised responses. An inductive and data-driven approach was used to analyse the data, and the trustworthiness of the analysis was considered using criteria established by Lincoln and Guba (1985).FindingsThematic analysis identified six themes, namely, the challenging nature of the work, interactions with prisoners, staff interactions, inadequate resources, staff support and development and coping strategies. Key findings include managing distress, self-harm and violence and limited resources presenting challenges. Role variety and opportunities to support prisoners were reported as positive. A variety of coping strategies were identified. Wider availability of supervision and reflective practice was suggested by staff.Practical implicationsRecommendations for increased staff support are made.

163845,Modeling the Spread and Control of COVID-19,2021,"Since the migrant surge in 2015, social inclusion has become a crucial issue to be addressed effectively by the European Union, given that 39% of the population born outside of the EU member states faces the risk of poverty or social exclusion. Adding to that, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected migrant households worldwide, rendering migrant integration an urgent matter for national governments. Discrimination, racism, xenophobia, and radicalization are all societal threats emerging in periods of massive migrant flows and need appropriate policy measures to be employed in migrant host countries to tackle them. This paper suggests the integration of a multiple criteria decision analysis method, namely PROMETHEE, for policy making with regard to migrant social exclusion. In light of previous research findings and the recent release of the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020, the authors argue that the method proposed could help policy makers to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented policies, spot the discrepancies between policies and policy outcomes, and motivate knowledge sharing among the EU member states. The findings include a ten-year comparative list of the EU member states (2010–2019) driven by social inclusion indicators for the foreign-born (non-EU-born) population. The results are rather sensitive to changes in the data utilized but they provide an overall comparative picture of social inclusion policy effectiveness in the EU during the past decade. © 2021 by the authors.

The use of performance-based evaluations is valuable, but lacks the subjects’ point of view during task performance.ObjectivesThe aim of the current presentation is to bring together performance-based observation and cognitive science methods to provide insights regarding real-life behavior and problem solving in SMI populations.MethodsIn this quasi-experimental study, forty-three individuals performed the Test of Grocery Shopping Skills (TOGSS) while wearing an eye-tracking device. Eye-movement patterns served as a proxy of executive functions in people with and without SMI during a real-life ingredient selection task. We hypothesized that significant differences will be found between people with SMI and controls in TOGSS sub-outcomes as well as in eye-fixation durations.ResultsTOGSS sub-outcomes indicative of performance efficiency (time and redundancy) were significantly higher in the research group compared to matched controls (P<0.01). Average fixation duration was found to be significantly higher for the research group compared to matched controls (P<0.05) for two of the four item-selection tasks.ConclusionsThese preliminary findings indicate that when confronted with a selection task, individuals with SMI spend more dwelling time while selecting ingredients. Further analyses on these data will examine how this time is spent (e.g. focusing on irrelevant information). The outlined approach may prove beneficial in illuminating specific behavioral and physiological difficulties in individuals with SMI, particularly in the evolving Covid-19 situation, which poses novel social and health-related challenges on real-life tasks.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Regev, S.; Josman, N.; Mendelsohn, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.372,106

Recent Literature on Italy's ‘New Provinces’ of South Tyrol and the Julian March,2021,"Sports entrepreneurship has been considered an important part of sports organisations when overcoming crisis situations. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the crisis derived from COVID-19 on sports entrepreneurship and whether there are differences in the prediction of entrepreneurship on service quality in non-profit sports clubs. To this end, 145 sports clubs were analysed before and after the outbreak of the virus in society. Paired sample-t tests were carried out to determine the differences in variables studied before (Time I) and after (Time II) the COVID-19 outbreak, and correlations and hierarchical linear regressions were used to analyse the relationship between the variables studied in the two different stages. The results obtained show that risk-taking and innovation are significantly higher after the appearance of COVID-19, while proactivity has not undergone significant changes. Finally, the relationship between sports entrepreneurship and service quality is positive and significant in both stages but stronger before the crisis.","Escamilla-Fajardo, Paloma Calabuig-Moreno Ferran Gómez-Tafalla Ana M.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208493,106

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

164633,"Establishing virtual multidisciplinary round in belfast trust nursing homes: Pharmacist, nursing & healthcare team collaboration",2021,"Purpose: A significant body of literature suggests that shipping companies operate in an extremely volatile and risky environment, relying on the effective use of information to remain competitive. However, decision-making in this market is demanding because of the high uncertainty, market competition and significant capital investments. Moreover, the rapid spread of COVID-19 renders information uncertainty a daunting challenge for companies engaged in global trade. Hence, this study aims to explore the information behavior of managers in a time of crisis seems compelling. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides novel insights into the information behavior of senior managers by adopting a qualitative approach. Forty-nine semi-structured face-to-face interviews with individuals from Hellenic shipping companies were conducted. Moreover, this study explores the extant theory qualitatively, using the grounded theory methodology and shows that an unprecedented event (pandemic crisis) can redefine the information behavior of managers. Findings: This study highlights the importance of information in decision-making. Moreover, the results show that, during a pandemic, managers resort to alternative information sources, adopt collaborative information behaviors and take advantage of digital technology. Originality/value: There is limited research in exploring the information behavior of managers in times of pandemics. This research underscores the fact that during a crisis, managers seek information from digital information resources and decision-making assumes a more decentralized form. This study concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2021, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.","Gerakoudi-Ventouri, K.",Maritime Business Review,https://doi.org/10.1108/mabr-10-2020-0062,106

Sustainable development efforts like the Atlanta BeltLine have been exacerbating inequalities since well before COVID-19. Known as a Black mecca, the region is the birthplace of the Civil Rights movement and also boasts a high concentration of higher education institutions (HEIs) as well as the most Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the country. In 2017, HEIs and other stakeholders banded together to launch a regional network - Regional Centres of Expertise (RCE) Greater Atlanta - that builds on the region's strengths to place equity and justice at the center of sustainable development. This RCE is part of a global network of over 170 United Nations-affiliated RCEs on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) that advance the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through education and training. The importance of the network's focus on establishing deep collaborations among stakeholders, with an emphasis on youth and marginalized communities, has become especially clear as members grapple with the disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, three members reflect on how the network is helping advance sustainable development and preparing the region's youth to be sustainability change agents who take equity and justice seriously.

166808,Analysis on the Development Trend of COVID-19 Outbreak in Beijing Based on the Cluster Analysis and SEIR Model,2020,"Type I CRISPR-Cas3 uses an RNA-guided multi Cas-protein complex, Cascade, which detects and degrades foreign nucleic acids via the helicase-nuclease Cas3 protein. Despite many studies using cryoEM and smFRET, the precise mechanism of Cas3-mediated cleavage and degradation of target DNA remains elusive. Here we reconstitute the CRISPR-Cas3 system in vitro to show how the Escherichia coli Cas3 (EcoCas3) with EcoCascade exhibits collateral non-specific ssDNA cleavage and target specific DNA degradation. Partial binding of EcoCascade to target DNA with tolerated mismatches within the spacer sequence, but not the PAM, elicits collateral ssDNA cleavage activity of recruited EcoCas3. Conversely, stable binding with complete R-loop formation drives EcoCas3 to nick the non-target strand (NTS) in the bound DNA. Helicase-dependent unwinding then combines with trans ssDNA cleavage of the target strand and repetitive cis cleavage of the NTS to degrade the target dsDNA substrate. High-speed atomic force microscopy demonstrates that EcoCas3 bound to EcoCascade repeatedly reels and releases the target DNA, followed by target fragmentation. Together, these results provide a revised model for collateral ssDNA cleavage and target dsDNA degradation by CRISPR-Cas3, furthering understanding of type I CRISPR priming and interference and informing future genome editing tools.","Yoshimi, Kazuto; Takeshita, Kohei; Kodera, Noriyuki; Shibumura, Satomi; Yamauchi, Yuko; Omatsu, Mine; Kunihiro, Yayoi; Yamamoto, Masaki; Mashimo, Tomoji",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.18.452824,106
166974,Coronavirus containment depends on human rights: freedom of expression and press are needed to fight pandemic. (Special Issue: Human rights in healthcare during COVID-19 and other pandemics.),2021,"Introduction: The state of epidemic, caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, introduced in Poland on 20 March 2020, significantly affected the situation of entities conducting medical activities, patients and medical staff. Therefore, the activity of the legislator introducing legal provisions regulating the functioning of the healthcare system under epidemic conditions is not surprising. One of the directions of the changes introduced was to regulate specific principles of conduct in the event of exposure to SARS CoV-2 virus infection, suspicion or diagnosis of infection with this virus, as well as suspicion or diagnosis of the disease caused by it (COVID 19). Objective: The aim of the study is to present selected regulations regarding the procedure in the case of exposure to SARS CoV-2 virus infection, suspected or diagnosed infection with this virus, as well as suspected or diagnosed disease caused by it (COVID 19). Materials and method: Acts of universally binding law on preventing and combatting infections and infectious diseases in Poland and Acts of universally binding law adopted in connection with the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus were used. The method of analysing legal Acts and references was used. Conclusions: In the case of airborne diseases in people, limiting the spread of an infectious agent is inseparably connected with the need to limit contact of infected people or people suspected of contact with an infectious agent with healthy people. This, in turn, would not be possible without mechanisms guaranteeing effective and sufficient isolation of these people. Due to the nature of these activities, they must be associated with a limitation of basic personal rights, such as freedom of movement or voluntary submission to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.Alternate abstract: Wprowadzenie i cel pracy: Obowiązujący w Polsce od 20 marca 2020 r. stan epidemii związany z zakażeniami wiru-sem SARS-CoV-2 znacząco wpłynął na sytuację podmiotów wykonujących działalność leczniczą, pacjentów i personelu medycznego. Nie dziwi więc, iż ustawodawca wprowadził przepisy prawa regulujące funkcjonowanie systemu ochrony zdrowia w warunkach epidemii. Celem pracy jest przedstawie-nie wybranych regulacji dotyczących postępowania w razie narażenia na zakażenie wirusem SARS-CoV-2, podejrzenia lub rozpoznania zakażenia tym wirusem, a także podejrzenia lub rozpoznania choroby nim wywołanej (COVID-19). Rozwiązania prawne: Od 28 lutego 2020 r. zakażenie wirusem SARS-CoV-2 zostało objęte przepisami ustawy o zapobieganiu i zwalczaniu zakażeń i chorób zakaźnych u ludzi. Pozwoliło to na zastosowanie określonych w powyższej ustawie instrumentów prawnych wobec osób podejrzanych o zakażenie i zakażonych tym wirusem. W przypadku zakażenia SARS--CoV-2 ustawodawca przewidział obowiązek kwarantanny, nadzoru epidemiologicznego, hospitalizacji, izolacji lub izolacji w domu. Podsumowanie: W przypadku chorób przenoszonych dro-gą powietrzną u ludzi ograniczenie rozprzestrzeniania się czynnika zakaźnego nierozerwalnie wiąże się z koniecznością ograniczenia kontaktu osób zakażonych lub podejrzanych o kontakt z czynnikiem zakaźnym z osobami zdrowymi. To z kolei nie byłoby możliwe bez mechanizmów gwarantujących skuteczną i wystarczającą izolację tych osób. Ze względu na charakter tych czynności muszą one wiązać się z ogranicze-niem podstawowych dóbr osobistych, takich jak swoboda przemieszczania się czy dobrowolność poddawania się za-biegom diagnostycznym lub terapeutycznym.","Augustynowicz, Anna Waszkiewicz Michał Czerw Aleksandra",Journal of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.26444/monz/131926,106
167104,School yard biodiversity determines short-term recovery of disturbed skin microbiota in children,2021-09-05,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic broke out in December 2019 and now is characterized as a pandemic. The effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, both for case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely being used worldwide. Although it is the standard case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests were developed. Methods: One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and autumn 2019, were also tested as negative controls. Results: The test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. Conclusion: This test can be used for epidemiological investigations especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitation of the kits or low levels of antibodies after infection. The different sensitivity in age and sex groups supports the hypothesis that different people show different immune responses to this virus.","shamsollahi, hamid reza; Amini, Mostafa; Alizadeh, Shaban; Nedjat, Saharnaz; Akbari-Sari, Ali; Rezaei, Mehdi; Allameh, Seyed Farshad; Fotouhi, Akbar; Yunesian, Masud",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20090209,106
167136,Football is “the most important of the least important things”: The Illusion of Sport and COVID-19,2020,"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder defined by a platelet count < 100 × 109/L without explanation, and an increased risk of bleeding. ITP itself as well as its treatments have multifaceted, often poorly understood impacts on patients’ quality of life (QoL). These effects include impact on activities of daily living, emotional health, energy, ability to think well and clearly, and productivity in the workplace. There are limited data on which individual aspects of ITP are perceived both by patients and physicians as having the greatest impact on QoL. Understanding patients’ perspectives is vital to optimize their QoL by specifying particular areas in need of therapy. I-WISh 1.0 was an exploratory, cross-sectional survey in which 1507 patients with ITP and 472 physicians across 13 countries completed separate, but related, online surveys that included assessments of ITP signs and symptoms, impact of symptoms, and patient-physician relationships. These findings have been presented at previous ASH and EHA congresses, and manuscripts are currently in preparation. However, although I-WISh 1.0 provided considerable insights into unexplored facets of the effects of ITP, an all-too-large number of gaps in understanding still remain. In response to this, I-WISh 2.0 is currently being developed. The objectives of the I-WISh 2.0 patient and physician cross-sectional surveys include: (1) to further explore the burden of fatigue and how it affects patients' lives, including what makes it better or worse;(2) to assess the emotional impact of living with chronic ITP, especially in relation to depression;(3) to assess how treatments for ITP can impact activities of daily living (positively and negatively);(4) to further relate effects of treatment to patients' QoL;and (5) to explore how telemedicine affects healthcare delivery for patients with ITP. Furthermore, data from subsets of patients will address (6) the impact of COVID-19 in patients with ITP;and (7) special issues affecting ITP in pregnancy. A steering committee of ITP expert physicians and patient advocacy group representatives are designing and will endorse the patient and physician surveys now nearing readiness after several meetings to determine the areas of greatest need of assessment. In addition, a control group will be included. Survey launch and data collection are scheduled to commence in early Q4 2020. Patients and physicians will complete similar online surveys. Both patient and physician surveys include a screener and sections of questions related to the specific objectives of I-WISh 2.0. The surveys include updates to key topics in I-WISh 1.0 (impact of fatigue, impact on daily life, treatment of ITP, emotional impact of ITP);validated patient-reported outcome tools to measure fatigue (MFIS-5), presence and severity of depression (PHQ-9), work-related burden (WPAI), and impact on quality of life (ILQI) tools;and questions related to COVID-19, telemedicine (remote patient monitoring), and pregnancy and ITP. Patients will be recruited to I-WISh 2.0 via treating physicians and patient advocacy groups, and will be included if they are ≥ 18 years of age, diagnosed with ITP, and agree to participate. Participating physicians will be required to be actively managing patients with ITP and have a minimum caseload of 3 ITP patients currently under their care;physicians must also have a primary specialty of hematology or hematology-oncology. Approval will be sought from an independent centralized Institutional Review Board. Data analysis will be primarily descriptive and correlative in nature. Breakdown by country and geographic areas will be included. A global sample is planned from 21 countries across 6 continents, with the aim of surveying more than 2000 patients and 600 physicians. I-WISh 2.0 will be the largest observational global survey ever conducted in ITP. If accepted, preliminary data are planned to be presented at the ASH meeting. I-WISh 2.0 will build on the strengths of I-WISh 1.0, which highlighted areas requir ng further assessment and will explore aspects of ITP of great interest that were neither conclusively addressed in the first survey nor well-studied in the past.

Should certain principles of distributive and territorial justice, claims of occupancy, freedom of movement, respect, etc., be extended to include non-human nature? In recent months, Europe has begun to explore many of these concerns, noting the trauma experiences of COVID-19 and their interconnection with deepening ecological and health problems as a stimulus to action. This paper notes the relevance of these crisis experiences in moving political debate on the loss of biological diversity forward, prompting a need to extend normative horizons of the common good to include more biologically diverse communities.","Skillington, T.",Social Sciences-Basel,https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci9090166,106

The teleworking aspect has gained momentum during COVID-19 and it has been used extensively by the firms to maintain their operations. This study aims to examine the impact of COVID-19 policies, adoption of advanced technology, and teleworking on firm productivity in Romania with a sample of 328 including the Vice President, Operation Manager, General manager, Logistics Manager, Procurement Manager, and Information system manager while the collected data was analyzed using the CB SEM technique. After analyzing the collected data, we have found that the COVID-19 pandemic plays an imperative role in increasing teleworking practices in Romania, while the COVID-19 pandemic is not viewed as a significant factor in the adoption of advanced technology in Romania. On the other side, this pandemic negatively affects Romania's firm productivity, whereas teleworking and the adoption of advanced technology positively affect the Romanian firms' productivity. Lastly, the adoption of advanced technology helps in increasing the pattern of teleworking in Romania. The increased use of teleworking practices has been regarded as an important practice in Romania to follow the COVID-19 policies imposed by the government on one side, yet to keep the business operation in the smooth run by working from home through employing the technology to maintain the firm productivity.","Khan, S.

Cancellations of placements such as student assistantships severely disrupted this transition. Furthermore, a tailored teaching programme was implemented locally to aid the new doctors.MethodsA nationwide survey to graduating doctors and a focus group at The Hillingdon Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (THH) were conducted to identify concerns. We explored the students’ impression of the disruptive effects fof COVID-19, and the subsequent consequences this had on their preparedness and confidence. Subsequent analysis of the identified areas formed the basis of a teaching programme with 6 main domains: practical skills, attending arrest calls, prescribing independently, making referrals, prioritising jobs and on-call shifts.Results440 students across 32 UK medical schools responded to the survey. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations, and student assistantships had significantly affected the students’ perception of preparedness in starting as doctors (respectively p=0.025;0.008;0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p=0.0005). Locally, 90% (n=9) did not have a student assistantship whilst only 50% (n=5) had shadowed on call shifts throughout the entirety of medical school.A pre- and post-teaching intervention questionnaire was performed. This showed an average increase of 26.4% in how participants scored their confidence and competencies post-intervention.ConclusionsThe transition after undergraduate training is a steep learning curve. It is clear that student assistantships designed specifically to aid the transition should be protected and enhanced. Finally, in addition to the mandatory training all trainees receive, the taught material during induction should be tailored more towards new doctors’ needs.","Choi, Byung Alhilani Michel Jegatheeswaran Lavandan Minocha Amal Mutengesa Ernest",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.123,106

Through content analysis, the article focuses on Twitter behaviours during a pandemic crisis period (March 23 to April 23, 2020). The study that analyses up to 14 (first listed MEPs) Twitter accounts and a total N of 2101 tweets looks at clarifying if the COVID-19 pandemic has promoted or discouraged the growth of a European Public Sphere. The results show that audience involvement depended on certain online conducts of the MEP rather than on his or her constant activity. Those behaviours produced as well that the COVID-19 debate was mostly restricted to the political elite, who neither allow European civil society to take part in the discussion or communicate to the general public with the aim of shaping a European Public Sphere.

The main aim of the study was to assess the safety of this approach, through the risk of developing severe neonatal infection. Material and Methods: Prospective observational study from April 2020 to February 2021 on the approach and neonatal follow-up of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 at the time of delivery in a hospital with advanced neonatal care, where rooming in and breastfeeding were promoted whenever possible. We collected data during hospital admission and over the phone during the neonatal period. Results: We included 77 infants born to mothers with COVID-19 (3.8% of newborns born during the time of study), median gestational age 39 weeks + 5 days and median birth weight 3270 g;9% were born premature (versus 12% born premature among newborns born during the time of study). Rooming-in took place in all of them although 4% were briefly admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit;88% were discharged home up to day three, 97% were breastfed at the time of discharge and 90% were still breastfed by the end of the neonatal period. We completed neonatal follow-up of 63 newborns, eight of them developed COVID-associated symptoms, three with need of medical evaluation;40% had no medical assessment after being discharged. Out of 77, 5% of infants were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total of four, one mild, three asymptomatic), with no significant differences during hospital stay or follow-up. Discussion: Neonatal infection was uncommon and mild, and there was no increase in prematurity. Rooming-in and breastfeeding were safe and should be promoted whenever clinically possible. Follow-up care after hospital discharge needs improvement. Conclusion: Infants born to mothers with COVID-19 were safely roomed in with their mothers and exclusively breastfed.","Brito, I.; Sousa, R.; Sanches, B.; Franco, J.; Marcelino, S.; Costa, A.",Acta Medica Portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.15441,106

However, systematic and quantitative assessment of grain virtual water flow on environmental impacts has rarely been conducted. This study analyzes the flow patterns of China's interprovincial and international grain virtual water and resulting environmental impacts during 2019–2020, with a focus on water-saving and environmental benefits. Results showed that the main importers and exporters of environmental impact flow were inconsistent with those of virtual water flow, and maize trade was the main contributor to these flows. China's grain virtual water flow resulted in approximately 2.21 Gm3 water loss and increased the impacts on water scarcity and human health by 1.61 Gm3 deprived and 3.42 × 104 DALY, respectively. Nevertheless, the grain virtual water flow generated benefits in ecosystem quality by 1.20 × 10−3 species. yr, compared with the no-grain transfer scenario. Exporting maize from Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces dominated water loss and environmental burdens, whereas exporting rice from Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces contributed mostly to water-saving and environmental benefits. Importing grains from abroad also contributed to water-saving and ecosystem quality impact reduction. Measures, including improving irrigation water productivity and developing a regional compensation mechanism for dominant maize exporters, strengthening green water management in dominant rice-exporting areas, achieving the diversified development of China's trade partners, and implementing strict tariff quota administration, are suggested to alleviate environmental impacts and ensure grain security. • Impact-oriented analysis on China's grain virtual water flow was conducted. • The flow patterns of impacts presented discrepancies from those of virtual water. • Grain virtual water flow led to water loss and increase environmental burdens. • Water loss and environmental deterioration were mainly ascribed to maize trade. • Rice trade played an important role in water-saving and burden reduction.

Two conceptual models were used to frame the discussion: the theoretical framework of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) to discuss the challenges that the unprecedented context of the COVID-19 pandemic has created for social workers;and the Job Demands and Resources model (JD-R) to understand job demands perceived as stressors and burnout. Based on convergent mixed methods, the study sample consisted of 83 social workers employed in statutory and private social services in Romania, from different areas of intervention. Results showed that social workers perceived a high level of job stress related to work during the pandemic, which was associated with higher levels of burnout in the areas of personal burnout (average score 55.9) and work-related burnout (average score 52.5). Client-related burnout was lower (average score 38.4), indicating that stress was generated mainly by organisational factors and work-related factors (workload, aligning to new legislative rules and decisions, inconsistency, instability, ambiguity of managerial decisions, and lack of clarity of working procedures) and less by client-related stressors (lack of direct contact with clients, risk of contamination, managing beneficiaries’ fears, and difficulties related to technology). High job demands and limited job resources (managerial and supervisory support, financial resources, and recognition and reward) led to a high to very high level of work-related burnout for 15.7% and an upper-medium level for 44.2% of respondents. A group of 27.7% reported lower to medium levels of work-related burnout, while 14.5% had very low levels, managing to handle stress factors in a healthy manner. Study results pointed to the importance of organisational support and the development of a self-care plan that help to protect against job stress and burnout. Recommendations were made, putting forward the voice of fieldworkers and managers fostering initiatives and the application of sustainability-based measures and activities designed to deal with the challenges of the VUCA environment.","Dima, Gabriela Meseșan Schmitz Luiza Șimon Marinela-Cristina",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137109,106

Patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletic diseases, and especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, being one of the vulnerable classes of chronic patients, were recommended to follow the government's rules1. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate DAS-28-ESR in patients with rheumatoid arthritis before and after lockdown period. Methods: This is a multi-center observational study including 85 patients which were evaluated before and after lockdown for their disease activity score according to DAS-28-ESR score. They had been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis more than 5 years ago. A thorough physical examination was performed before and after the lockdown period. It included examination of tender and swollen joints and patient's global health. They were completed with all required laboratory data, including erythrosedimentation rate. For a more accurate calculation, DAS-28-ESR was used in an electronic version. Patients with other inflammatory or infective diseases were excluded from the study. All data were statistically evaluated using statistical tests such as t-student test. Results: The first group (the one before lockdown) had an average DAS-28-ESR of 4.7 while after the lockdown period, the average DAS-28-ESR was 5.16. After statistically evaluating all data, it was found that there exists a significant difference between DAS-28-ESR score before and after COVID-19 lockdown (p=0.0011). Conclusion: Our study showed that lockdown period due to COVID-19 pandemic, has aggravated disease activity in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. This may be consequence of various causes such as physical inactivity and difficulty to follow-up or to take the medication properly.","Jordhani, M.; Ruci, D.; Skana, F.; Memlika, E.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.576,106

172035,The Importance of Undergraduate Research: A Gateway to Possibilities,2021,"Problem, research strategy, and findings Millions of North Americans stopped riding public transit in response to COVID-19. We treat this crisis as a natural experiment to illustrate the importance of public transit in riders' abilities to access essential destinations. We measured the impacts of riders forgoing transit through a survey of transportation barriers completed by more than 4,000 transit riders in Toronto and Vancouver (Canada). We used Heckman selection models to predict six dimensions of transport disadvantage and transport-related social exclusions captured in our survey. We then complemented model results with an analysis of survey comments describing barriers that individuals faced. Lack of access to alternative modes is the strongest predictor of a former rider experiencing transport disadvantage, particularly neighborhood walkability and vehicle ownership. Groups at risk of transport disadvantage before COVID-19, particularly women and people in poorer health, were also more likely to report difficulties while avoiding public transit. Barriers described by respondents included former supports no longer offering rides, gendered household car use dynamics, and lack of culturally specific or specialized amenities within walking distance. Takeaway for practice Policymakers should plan for a level of redundancy in transportation systems that enables residents to access essential destinations when unexpected service losses occur. Designing communities that enable residents to walk to those essential destinations will help reduce the burdens faced by transit riders during crises that render transit unfeasible. At the same time, planners championing active travel as an alternative to transit during such crises also need to devise solutions for former transit riders for whom active travel is ill suited, for example, due to physical challenges with carrying groceries or needing to chaperone children.","Palm, M.; Allen, J.; Liu, B.

172148,"Sustainable Construction Investment, Real Estate Development, and COVID-19: A Review of Literature in the Field",2021,"Near-infrared to visible (NIR-VIS) face recognition is the most common case in heterogeneous face recognition, which aims to match a pair of face images captured from two different modalities. Existing deep learning based methods have made remarkable progress in NIR-VIS face recognition, while it encounters certain newly-emerged difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19, since people are supposed to wear facial masks to cut off the spread of the virus. We define this task as NIR-VIS masked face recognition, and find it problematic with the masked face in the NIR probe image. First, the lack of masked face data is a challenging issue for the network training. Second, most of the facial parts (cheeks, mouth, nose etc.) are fully occluded by the mask, which leads to a large amount of loss of information. Third, the domain gap still exists in the remaining facial parts. In such scenario, the existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation caused by the above issues. In this paper, we aim to address the challenge of NIR-VIS masked face recognition from the perspectives of training data and training method. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous training method to maximize the mutual information shared by the face representation of two domains with the help of semi-siamese networks. In addition, a 3D face reconstruction based approach is employed to synthesize masked face from the existing NIR image. Resorting to these practices, our solution provides the domain-invariant face representation which is also robust to the mask occlusion. Extensive experiments on three NIR-VIS face datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and cross-dataset-generalization capacity of our method.","Du, Hang; Shi, Hailin; Liu, Yinglu; Zeng, Dan; Mei, Tao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06761v1.pdf,106
172254,World Science against COVID-19: Gender and Geographical Distribution of Research.,2021-09-29,"Various stressors such as viral infection lead to the suppression of cap-dependent translation and the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), since the stress-induced phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 [eIF2(αP)] tightly binds to eIF2B to prevent it from exchanging guanine nucleotides on unphosphorylated eIF2. Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) evades this cap-dependent translation suppression through the interaction between its nonstructural protein NSs and host eIF2B. Our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed that SFSV NSs binds to the α-subunit of eIF2B in a competitive manner with eIF2(αP). Together with SFSV NSs, eIF2B exhibits normal nucleotide exchange activity even in the presence of eIF2(αP). A genome-wide ribosome profiling analysis clarified that SFSV NSs in human cultured cells attenuates the ISR. Furthermore, SFSV NSs exhibited neuroprotective effects against the ISR-inducing stress. Since the ISR inhibition is beneficial in various neurological disease models, SFSV NSs is promising as a therapeutic ISR inhibitor.","Kashiwagi, Kazuhiro; Shichino, Yuichi; Osaki, Tatsuya; Sakamoto, Ayako; Nishimoto, Madoka; Takahashi, Mari; Mito, Mari; Weber, Friedemann; Ikeuchi, Yoshiho; Iwasaki, Shintaro; Ito, Takuhiro",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.447466,106

Thousands of people have died due to this COVID-19 (Coronavirus) epidemic, and still the whole world is struggling to prevent this epidemic. Initially, the government had only an option to stop this epidemic and that was to declare complete lockdown. But during this time phase of lockdown, many people became unemployed. To stop this scenario and for the sake of employment and other financial economy, our government has decided to unlock various sectors. This unlock phase has increased the risk of outbreak of COVID-19 so to avoid risk and to stop spreading of this pandemic disease, the government has issued some important guidelines to be followed mandatorily by each individual during this unlock process. The face mask is one of the compulsory guidelines issued by the government. Wearing a face mask may reduce the chances of spreading corona virus. Many people roaming in public places without wearing a face mask. To monitor such kind of people at a time is not easy manually.

In those who had their COPD confirmed by spirometry (n=229), PPA = 100.0% and NPA = 77.0%, AUC=0.97. The algorithm demonstrates high agreement with clinical diagnosis and rapidly detects COPD in subjects presenting with or without other infective lung illnesses. The algorithm can be installed on a smartphone to provide bedside diagnosis of COPD in acute care settings, inform treatment regimens and identify those at increased risk of mortality due to seasonal or other respiratory ailments.","Porter, P.; Brisbane, J.; Abeyratne, U.; Bear, N.; Wood, J.; Peltonen, V.; Della, P.; Purdie, F.; Smith, C.; Claxton, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.05.20164731v1?rss=1,106
176571,Lockdown impact on age-specific contact patterns and behaviours in France,2020,"VMAF is a machine learning based video quality assessment method, originally designed for streaming applications, which combines multiple quality metrics and video features through SVM regression. It offers higher correlation with subjective opinions compared to many conventional quality assessment methods. In this paper we propose enhancements to VMAF through the integration of new video features and alternative quality metrics (selected from a diverse pool) alongside multiple model combination. The proposed combination approach enables training on multiple databases with varying content and distortion characteristics. Our enhanced VMAF method has been evaluated on eight HD video databases, and consistently outperforms the original VMAF model (0.6.1) and other benchmark quality metrics, exhibiting higher correlation with subjective ground truth data.","Zhang, Fan; Katsenou, Angeliki; Bampis, Christos; Krasula, Lukas; Li, Zhi; Bull, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06338v1.pdf,106
176583,A Model for the Outbreak of COVID-19: Vaccine Effectiveness in a Case Study of Italy,2021,"In epidemic situations, as in the current COVID-19 pandemic, wearing face-masks is one of the most effective practices imposed to protect people lives. This will be one of the daily-life routines for a prolonged period, especially in public areas. Therefore, there is a demand to provide an efficient face detection method to help in dealing with such abnormal situations where people wearing masks are under monitoring. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on multi-graph convolutional networks (MGCN) to accurately detect people wearing masks. Unlike conventional GCNs, the proposed model includes many convolutional filters to produce multi-graph structure in which we use a 4D facet tensor as an input function and a convergence layer to capture multiple face expressions. This multi-graph version of spectral convolution transforms the extracted facial relief and generalizes image frequencies using graph rows and columns eigenvalues. The proposed architecture is simple yet efficient with several layers, including multi-graph convolutional, max pooling, dropout and softmax. We evaluate the performance of masked-faces detection on the publicly available real-world masked face dataset (RWMFD). The experimental results show an accuracy of 97.9%, which proves the efficiency of our proposed model in detecting people wearing facemasks. © 2021 IEEE.","Alguzo, A.; Alzu'Bi, A.; Albalas, F.","12th International Conference on Information and Communication Systems, ICICS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icics52457.2021.9464553,106
177736,Study on the Impact of League Season Suspension and Cancellation Caused by the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic on Professional Basketball Players,2021,"Objective: To evaluate the added value of the use of upper arm length (UAL) along with MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) to diagnose and estimate the prevalence of wasting in comparison to current WHO standard and others MUAC based methods. Design: We included UAL to usual anthropometric measurements during a Mauritanian national 6-59-month-old cross-sectional nutritional survey. Children were classified into 3 groups UALG1, UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: [≤] 150 mm, 151-180, and > 180mm respectively. We used a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the best MUAC cut-off for each group with weight-for-height Z score as a reference standard. We compared the wasting prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, of all diagnostic methods. Findings: In total, 12 619 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%, 5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ < -2, MUAC < 125 mm and MUAC-UALG methods respectively. Using the MUAC-UALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from 17.98 % with MUAC < 125 mm to 39.43% with MUAC-UALG. The specificity decreased from 97.49% with MUAC < 125 to 92.71% with MUAC-UALG. With MUAC-height Z score and MUAC < 138 mm, sensitivity was 26.04% and 69.76%and specificity were 97.40%and 75.64% respectively. Conclusion: This alternative method using MUAC measuring tape to measure UAL increases the wasting diagnosis accuracy and allows for a better estimation of wasting prevalence. This method could be used as a potential alternative method for quick surveys in emergency settings such as Corona virus disease 2019 context.","Barro, M.; Baro, M.

Implementing the necessary infrastructure to sustain telepsychology programs within health care institutions requires detailed attention to a variety of domains. Despite the growing use of telepsychology, logistical considerations for the development of such programs are often unclear. Method: In order to clarify considerations regarding the use of telepsychology within partnering health care institutions, we describe the process of developing a telepsychology group intervention with parents of pediatric patients. Results: The development of a telepsychology program for parents at a large children's health care institution is discussed across four developmental phases: (a) curriculum development, (b) clinical framework, (c) program logistics, and (d) protocol and training infrastructure. Conclusion: Due to the growing need for telepsychological interventions for parents, both practitioners and health care institutions are tasked with collaborating to develop well-designed programs that are aligned with clinical best practices.","Goertz, M.

The theoretical framework of this paper builds on Nel Noddings' ethics of care, with a particular focus on reciprocity, empathy, communication, and community. The three Head Teachers were interviewed during the pandemic lockdown. These interviews are part of a larger study that interviewed teachers and Head Teachers during COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland, asking how this lockdown challenged and influenced their identity as educators. The focus on care is important as during lockdown in Scotland the focus of home learning was on pupils and families' well-being and care, rather than on performative acts of learning. This paper argues that the pandemic provided an alternative space for the Head Teachers to re-negotiate their caring role and identity in their understanding of being an educational leader.","Ferguson, P.; McKenzie, M.; Mercieca, D.; Mercieca, D.

178461,Risk assessment of COVID-19 based on a new structure of neural fuzzy probabilistic model,2021,"In the last decade, we have seen an increase in the use cases of digital technologies in our daily lives, including advanced systems such as our mobile applications, smart digital kiosks for intelligent retailing, touch screens for ordering food, or simple implementations such as the ticket machines in the butchers. However, from the perspective of interaction design, those sensing systems suffer from a range of limitations like low usability and poor hygiene. For example, the elderly or the disabled normally have huge difficulties when interacting with these types of digital systems. Moreover, the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made us to rethink the contact manner for interaction with the digital devices. Hence, in this paper, we have presented a novel solution for digital interaction through a contactless manner. Such a system can provide human gesture recognition and therefore it can be integrated into others to achieve contactless control. We have implemented a prototype based on cost efficient sensors to validate the idea’s feasibility. A sequence of real world experiments has also been conducted to evaluate its performance. This system is composed with 1) piece of hardware–a grid of ultrasound sensors to capture the distance information from a human body;2) a piece of software to analyse the data for gesture predictions. The analysis results then will be transformed into control commands to interact with the attached system. The experimental results have shown that the proposed system is capable of providing a contactless Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and also has a great opportunity to replace existing touching interaction manner with a remote control scheme.

178748,Patient acceptability of telephone follow up after cataract surgery,2020,"The NS5A non-structural protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a multifunctional protein involved in viral genomic replication, protein translation and regulation of cellular signaling pathways, and assembly of infectious virus particles. Previous report showed that NS5A inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling induced by poly(I:C); however, the mechanism was not elucidated. Here, we report that NS5A interacts with NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO),a regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, and that the zinc finger domain of NEMO essential for NEMO ubiquitination and IKK activation is required for the interaction of NEMO with NS5A. Viral infection or NS5A expression by itself reduced the protein level of NEMO. Mechanistic analysis revealed that NS5A mediated proteasomal degradation of NEMO. Ubiquitination assay showed that NS5A induced K27-but not K48-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO. In addition, NS5A blocked k63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, thereby inhibiting activation of IKK and NF-κB. These findings indicate that NS5A inhibits NF-κB signaling by mediating proteasomal degradation of NEMO and blocking k63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, thereby revealing a novel mechanism by which CSFV inhibits host innate immunity. Importance Classical swine fever (CSF) is a economically important swine viral disease leading to hemorrhagic fever and immuno-suppression. In order to successfully infect and replicate in a host cell, viruses have evolved various strategies to antagonize host innate immunity. It is known that CSFV non-structural protein Npro interacts with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and mediates its proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting the production of type I interferon. However, no other mechanism by which CSFV antagonizes host innate immunity has so far been reported. Here, we show that NS5A inhibits NF-κB signaling by mediating proteasomal degradation of NEMO and by blocking k63-linked polyubiquitination of NEMO, thereby revealing a novel mechanism by which CSFV antagonizes host innate immunity.","Li, Jiaying; Yu, Haixiao; Jiang, Wenjin; Ma, Ping; Feng, Zezhong; Lu, Yang; Tu, Changchun; Sun, Jinfu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449351,106

Our results reveal that the system-wide dynamic connectedness is heterogeneous over time and driven by economic events. Peaks have been reached during the Global Financial Crisis, European Governmental Debt Crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Further findings show that commodities such as Crude Oil, Grains, Livestock, Sugar, and Soybean Oil tend to be the main net transmitters of shocks while Corn, Lean Hogs, Soybeans, Cattle, and Wheat are the main receivers of shocks. Pairwise connectedness on the other hand shows that Crude Oil not only affects other commodity markets, but is also equally responsive to innovations that take place in most of these markets explaining the high interconnectedness of the network. Finally, we illustrate the importance of the chosen normalization technique employed in the connectedness framework as the retrieved findings have important implications for investors to design strategies for optimization of portfolio and asset allocation, reduction in downside risk along with hedging strategies.

179546,"Motion extrapolation in the flash-lag effect depends on perceived, rather than physical speed",2021-08-11,"We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 - 24.3 $M_{\odot}$ black hole and a compact object with a mass of 2.50 - 2.67 $M_{\odot}$ (all measurements quoted at the 90$\%$ credible level). The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg$^2$ at a distance of $241^{+41}_{-45}$ Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, $0.112^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to $\leq 0.07$. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1-23 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models for the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott, the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

179555,Crowded Cities: New Methodology in COVID-19 Risk Assessment,2021,"BackgroundAmidst the unprecedented outbreak of COVID-19, it is both critical and increasingly difficult for healthcare professionals to engage in the teamwork that will underlie an effective response to the pandemic. The simultaneous need for and challenge to teamwork, though, is not unique to healthcare.ResultsDrawing on management and organisational research conducted in healthcare as well as other industries, this article offers an overview of key, and robust, findings that highlight both what teamwork looks like and how to achieve it. I focus on two aspects of teamwork (the coordination of expertise and communication), and I review how leaders can jumpstart them by leveraging mechanisms including framing the work, using communication structures and engaging in leader inclusiveness.","Mayo, Anna T.",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000246,106
179600,Functional Data Analysis: Transition from Daily Observation of COVID-19 Prevalence in France to Functional Curves,2021-09-28,"Nowadays, most preclinical HIV treatment trials use a protocol of administering repeated low-dose challenges (RLCs) of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to macaques. Statistical analyses of treatment efficacy under the RLC protocol need to consider two confounding hypotheses, both pertinent biologically to HIV: (1) the non-infecting challenges may immunize animals against SIV; and (2) the animals may vary in intrinsic infectability (“frailty”). To explore the two hypotheses, a previous study (Regoes 2012) assembled a database from 7 articles with SIV-macaque treatment trials. With two explicable exceptions, Regoes concluded that the control data did not support either confounding hypothesis. Recent SIV-macaque trials present opportunities to evaluate the conclusions’ robustness. Accordingly, the present article assembles from 24 articles an updated database containing net survival curves from both control and treatment arms in SIV-macaque treatment trials. Broad patterns of statistical significance (at p<0.05, uncorrected for multiple testing) made it difficult to dismiss the confounding hypotheses completely in the controls. Although statistical analysis has focused on defense against variable frailty, only one set of controls showed significant variable frailty, whereas many sets showed significant immunization. As trials progressed, changes in the probability of infection per challenge were significant in 8/28 trials (1/3 trials using oral challenges; 2/4 trials using vaginal challenges; and 5/21 trials using rectal challenges). The results suggest the possibility that vaginal challenges may immunize animals faster than rectal challenges, and they also bear on previous conclusions that repeated exposure to HIV without treatment may have no effect on infectability or may even reduce it. Author Summary Many preclinical trials of HIV treatments rely on repeatedly administering low-dose SIV challenges to macaques until infection occurs. The repeated low-dose protocol reuses macaques and is more sensitive to subtle therapeutic efficacies than a protocol administering a single large dose to each macaque. The animal reuse raises some pertinent biological questions, notably: (1) do macaques have intrinsically variable infectabilities? and (2) do the repeated SIV challenges immunize macaques against infection? A 2012 study collected a database of eight macaque trials, concluding that variable infectability and immunization were at most sporadic and readily explicable. I expanded the 2012 database to twenty-eight trials, discovering that the conclusions were not robust. Although only 1/28 SIV-macaque trials showed variable infectability, 7/28 showed immunization, with few ready explanations. Statistical analysis of SIV-macaque trials has focused on the confounding effects of variable infectability to the neglect of immunization, so the expanded database provides a rich empirical resource. The trials have general medical importance because they provide a model for analyzing animal trials of infectious disease therapies and other sparse trials, e.g., for breast cancer. My findings also indirectly suggest that repeated human exposure to HIV inconsistently immunizes and can foster either immune priming or tolerance.","Spouge, John L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454270,106

The paper aims to give an overall picture of the authority of the husband and wife regarding the domestic and public rights in the family, as well as to deal with the issue on family economy during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study of this paper used the explorative-qualitative research methods, with data obtained by disseminating questionnaires and studying documents related to the responsibilities carried out by the husband and wife. An initial investigation was conducted by taking into account the provisions stipulated in the formal legality of positive law. The data were then analyzed by utilizing a descriptive phenomenological approach through the interpretation of the data obtained from observation, interview, documentation, and literature review. The findings of this study indicate that men and women have equal rights. The concept of nature show that there is normative justification between husband and wife, stating that the domestic responsibilities are closely related to the shared rights and obligations that are balanced within the family and society, and that both husband and wife have the same rights in taking legal actions. In this new normal era, to strengthen the economically weak family in the community requires joint co-operation between the husband and wife so that they can meet the needs of the family and create a harmonious family. © 2021 Samarah.

Many of these developments have been discussed even before the pandemic as a necessary reaction to economic and societal conditions that are increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. A situation that has become known by the acronym VUCA. The pandemic has accelerated and changed numerous of those developments. Through the systematic analysis of lessons learned during the pandemic, the BMBF-funded research project COVID19LL aims to identify successful solutions and measures that have emerged in three different German regions (Bavaria, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony). The aim of the project is to identify the problems companies and organizations face and what they have learned from the change process thus far. The project thus aims to ascertain whether innovative and digital forms of work created by the pandemic could lead to positive impulses, which might prove successful in the working world in the medium and long term and the extent to which these can be transferred to other industries. This paper presents the methodological approach and outlines first results of interviews with employers and employee representatives as well as company representatives in order to identify best practices and lessons learned. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bengler, K.; Nitsch, V.; Schmauder, M.; Adam, C.; Pütz, S.; Brandl, C.; Ott, G.; Jochum, G.","21st Congress of the International Ergonomics Association, IEA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74611-7_70,106

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is one of the leading causes of death in the age group of 15-29 years-old. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries, including Indonesia, ordered a nationwide physical distancing and limited public activities. Indonesia also restricts the public mobilities, leaving the college students, studying in different regions, isolated and confined to their flats, boarding houses, and apartments.ObjectivesTo find out the prevalence of Depression in College Students, living alone, in Pandemic 2020.MethodsCollege students aged 18 to 28 years old, were assessed using Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI-II), through Google Form, and shared using social media. We also grouped the participants to age, gender, religion, and types of housing, and did the multivariate analysis using median comparison and multinomial logistic regression.ResultsA total of 84 college students, who are living alone during the Pandemic 2020, participated in this study. We found that 33.3% of the population suffered from depression. The median score for the group of females, prefer not to say their religion, and living in the owned house have a higher median. While multinomial logistic regression study does not have any significant odd risks in the variables.ConclusionsThe results indicate that in time of nationwide physical distancing and limited public activities due to COVID-19 Pandemic, the prevalence of depression among college students living alone in Pandemic 2020 is 33%. One-fourth of them are with severe depression.","Kantohe, T.; Kurnijuanto, G.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.743,106

181419,“A matter of time”: Evidence-making temporalities of vaccine development in the COVID-19 media landscape,2021,"Objective: To determine risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among children and adolescents. Design: Nationwide, population-based cohort study. Setting: Norway from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2021. Participants: All Norwegian residents <18 years of age. Main outcome measures: Population-based health care and population registries were used to study risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and pre-existing chronic comorbidities. All residents were followed until age 18, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Hazard ratios (HR) estimated by Cox regression models were adjusted for testing frequency. Further, risk factors for admission to the hospital among the infected were investigated. Results: Of 1 182 796 residents, 22608 (1.9%) tested positive by polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow tests, of whom 107 (0.5%) were admitted to a hospital. Low family income (aHR 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.46), crowded housing (1.35, 1.30 to 1.39), household size, age, and area of living were independent risk factors for infection. A non-Nordic country of origin was the strongest risk factor (aHR 2.37, 95% CI 2.30 to 2.49), whereas chronic comorbidity was not associated with the risk of infection. Chronic comorbidity was associated with hospitalisation (aHR 4.15, 2.63 to 6.56), in addition to age, whereas socioeconomic status and country of origin did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and area of living were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these factors did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Chronic comorbidity was associated with the risk of admission but not with the overall risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2.","Stordal, K.; Ruiz, P. L.-D.; Greve-Isdahl, M.; Suren, P.; Knudsen, P.

Demographic, economic, health, and weather conditions were considered to identify countries that are inherently similar in nature. This grouping along with Covid-19 epidemiology data was used to cluster countries over a period of time after Covid-19 struck. We identified those countries which changed clusters over a time period and were influenced differently by the impact of Covid-19. We then looked at the government measures through the stringency index of containment measures and observed a relation in how different stringency measures impacted the countries differently even though they belonged to the same original group. We also observed that countries that eased restrictions quickly after containment measures had to go back to the earlier stringent measures. Gradual ease of containment measure was more efficient in tackling Covid-19. The inherent grouping of countries done in our study can be used in the future as well to deploy similar measures when faced with Covid-19 like pandemic situation. The strategies adopted on average by countries within each inherent cluster can become the base for handling Covid-19 or any such pandemic in the future. The significance of the work resides in the fact that the strategies would not be aligned to economic conditions of a nation (developed versus developing) or a single factor like healthcare facilities but based on a varied list of inherent factors using machine learning methods.","Darapaneni, N.; Venkatasubramanian, J.; Paduri, A.

182360,Effects of face masks on acoustic analysis and speech perception: Implications for peri-pandemic protocols,2020-10-08,"Abstract Machining of CFRP is challenging and necessitates efficient and robust process monitoring techniques to minimize the machining induced damage such as fiber pullouts and delamination. In this study, wavelet packet transform of forces signals was used to monitor the surface quality of CFRP subjected to conventional edge trimming. Conventional milling experiments were performed on unidirectional CFRP machined at differ fiber orientation angles - 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°. The feed rate was varied between 0.025 and 0.75 mm/tooth. Depending on the fiber orientation, the ten point average roughness Rz varied between 2.9 and 104.1 µm. A novel algorithm using Wavelet Packet Decomposition was proposed to identify the signal features that could effectively establish a correlation between signal features, process variables (feed and speed) and surface roughness Rz. A bank of 35 different mother wavelets with decomposition levels up to 10 was explored. Seven different features were calculated for the wavelet packets obtained upon decomposition. Optimal wavelet parameters were identified based on the regression statistics. Among others, two features – standard deviation and energy-entropy coefficient were identified as primary candidates which resulted in roughness prediction with R2>91%. In addition, the morphology and removal mechanisms of the machined surfaces was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The nexus between those surfaces and signals was established which corroborated the utility of the proposed algorithm.","Pahuja, Rishi; Mamidala, Ramulu",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315134; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315134,106

Hence, various spatial statistical methods, such as the heat map, global Moran’s I, geographic mean center, and emerging hot spot analysis were utilized comprehensively to mine and analyze spatiotemporal evolution patterns. The main findings were as follows: Overall, the spatial autocorrelation of confirmed cases gradually increased from the initial outbreak until September 2020 and then decreased slightly. The geographic centroid migration ranges of the pandemic in Asia, Europe, and Africa are wider than those in South America, Oceania, and North America. The spatiotemporal evolution pattern of the global pandemic mainly consisted of oscillating hot spots, intensifying cold spots, persistent cold spots, and diminishing cold spots.

183870,Infusion device standardisation and dose error reduction software.,2014,"Background: We report the progress of our support program activities (“Cancer Salon Rainbow”) in the last 6 years and consider the future direction. Methods: The cancer salon is opened to the public and conducted once a month in our hospital. The program consists of mini-lectures, relaxation, and interaction among the participants. In FY2019, the program also included a time to think about ACP. A questionnaire survey was conducted at each session. Results: The salon has been held 60 times from April 2014 to February 2020. Each annual numbers of participants were 369, 283, 376, 495, 389, and 299, respectively. Participants included many repeaters. They mainly consisted of cancer patients in our hospital and their families. A high percentage of them were women by sex, 60's by age. Main cancer patients were newly diagnosed within 5 years &lt; over 5 years by periods after diagnosis, breast cancer by site (43 % other than 5 major cancers), and under treatment. In FY2019, their purposes of participation were mainly reported “acquisition of professional information” 67%, “taking relaxation” 54%, and “meeting peers”, “exchanging information based on actual experience” 45%. 74% of them answered that they have changed after participation, “The way of thinking about cancer” 73%, “The way of thinking about life” 66%, and “How to deal with others” 54%. Conclusion: The number of participants and the rate of evaluations have been steady. The useful program, activated their self-management and peer-support function, changes they felt after the participation as well might be factors. In the future, first, in response to their voices, we are considering the restart of the salon in the era of COVID-19. Second, according to their needs, we will provide proper information, relaxation, and promotion of peer support continuously. Finally, we aim at creating the salon where new participants with more various backgrounds can participate.","Yamamoto, R.; Komatsuzaki, K.; Kojima, Y.; Inada, M.; Ooeda, Y.; Nakayama, A.; Chiba, S.; Sato, K.; Yamaguchi, H.; Fujii, H.",Annals of Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.05.755,106
184354,"Observation on China's efficient mobilization and external dependencies in COVID-19 detection reagents, vaccines and drugs development.",2020-09-01,"Collocated measurements using a condensation particle counter, differential mobility particle sizer and cloud condensation nuclei counter were realised in parallel in central Budapest from 15 April 2019 to 14 April 2020 to gain insight into the cloud activation properties of urban aerosol particles. The median total particle number concentration was 10.1 × 103 cm-3. The median concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at water vapour supersaturation (S) values of 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 % and 1.0 % were 0.59, 1.09, 1.39, 1.80 and 2.5 × 103 cm-3, respectively. The CCN concentrations represented 7–27 % of all particles. The CCN concentrations were considerably larger but the activation fractions were systematically substantially smaller than observed in regional or remote locations. The effective critical dry particle diameters (dc,eff) were derived utilising the CCN concentrations and particle number size distributions. Their median values at the five supersaturation values considered were 207, 149, 126, 105 and 80 nm, respectively;all of these diameters were positioned within the accumulation mode of the typical particle number size distribution. Their frequency distributions revealed a single peak for which the geometric standard deviation increased monotonically with S. This broadening indicated high time variability in the activating properties of smaller particles. The frequency distributions also showed fine structure, with several compositional elements that seemed to reveal a consistent or monotonical tendency with S. The relationships between the critical S anddc,eff suggest that urban aerosol particles in Budapest with diameters larger than approximately 130 nm showed similar hydroscopicity to corresponding continental aerosol particles, whereas smaller particles in Budapest were less hygroscopic than corresponding continental aerosol particles. Only modest seasonal cycling in CCN concentrations and activation fractions was seen, and only for large S values. This cycling likely reflects changes in the number concentration, chemical composition and mixing state of the particles. The seasonal dependencies of dc,eff were featureless, indicating that the droplet activation properties of the urban particles remained more or less the same throughout the year. This is again different from what is seen in non-urban locations. Hygroscopicity parameters (κ values) were computed without determining the time-dependent chemical composition of the particles. The median values for κ were 0.15, 0.10, 0.07, 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, at the five supersaturation values considered. The averages suggested that the larger particles were considerably more hygroscopic than the smaller particles. We found that the κ values for the urban aerosol were substantially smaller than those previously reported for aerosols in regional or remote locations. All of these characteristics can be linked to the specific source composition of particles in cities. The relatively large variability in the hygroscopicity parameters for a given S emphasises that the individual values represent the CCN population in ambient air while the average hygroscopicity parameter mainly corresponds to particles with sizes close to the effective critical dry particle diameter.","Imre, Salma Thén Wanda Máté Vörösmarty Gyöngyösi András Zénó",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11289-2021,106

184831,State heterogeneity in the associations of human mobility with COVID-19 epidemics in the European Union.,2020,"There remains a great challenge to minimize the spread of epidemics. This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.","Hartvigsen, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.06.21255015v1?rss=1,106
185583,Legislative Update: Coronavirus Legislation.,2020,"Understanding the factors that increase the transmissibility of the recently emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 (such as the Alpha, Epsilon, and Delta variants) can aid in mitigating their spread. The enhanced transmissibility could be attributed to one or more factors: higher stability on surfaces or within droplet nuclei suspended in air, increased maximal viral load or higher probability of infection. The relative importance of these factors on the transmission was examined using a validated stochastic-jump-continuous hybrid model. The transmissibility was quantified in terms of the household secondary attack rate (hSAR) which is the probability of transmission from an infected individual to a susceptible one in a household. We find that an increase in either the maximal viral load or the probability of infection is consistent with the observed hSAR of the variants. Specifically, in order to reach the relative increase in the hSAR of 40%, 55%, and 87% reported for the Epsilon, Alpha, and Delta variants (respectively), the maximal viral load should increase by 56%, 78%, and 125%, respectively. Alternatively, the probability of infection should increase by 34%, 53%, and 193%, respectively. Contrary to these results, even a dramatic increase in environmental stability increases hSAR by no more than 10%.","Arav, Y.; Fattal, E.; Klausner, Z.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.19.21260707v1?rss=1,106

Group B consisted of 5 patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS surgery with PEG hydrogel dural sealant capping. The immediate postoperative intracranial air volume was measured in all patients and compared between the 2 groups using the Welch test. Adverse effects were also examined in both groups. The intracranial air volume in Group A was 32.3 ± 12.3 ml (range 19.1-42.5 ml), whereas that in Group B was 1.3 ± 1.5 ml (range 0.0-3.5 ml), showing a significant difference (p < 0.005). No hemorrhage or venous air embolisms were observed in either group. The effect of brain shift was discriminated by STN recordings in Group B. These preliminary findings indicate that PEG hydrogel dural sealant capping may reduce adverse effects related to CSF leakage and brain shift during DBS surgery.","Takumi, Ichiro; Mishina, Masahiro; Hironaka, Kohei; Oyama, Kenichi; Yamada, Akira; Adachi, Koji; Hamamoto, Makoto; Kitamura, Shin; Yoshida, Daizo; Teramoto, Akira",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23358161/,106

188228,COVID-19 and New Jersey Employment Law.,2020,"There is a new public health problem around the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV). The disease ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) was caused by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Tongue picture was taken by digital camera and colors (red, green and blue) of tongue proper and coating were analyzed quantitatively with image processing software. RESULTS In the 69 patients of acute stage, the color of tongue proper was mostly light red (51 patients, 73.9%), with significant difference in comparing with other colors (P < 0.01). The color of tongue coating was mostly thin yellow (32 patients, 46.4%), and thin white was the second (29 patients, 42.0%). There was swollen tongue body in 5 patients (7.2%), teeth print on tongue margin in 12 cases (17.4%). In the 155 patients of recovery stage, the color of tongue proper was mostly dark pale (72 patients, 46.5%), the second light red (68 patients, 43.9%), color of tongue coating was mostly thin white (80 patients, 51.6%), which was significantly higher than other colors (P < 0.01), the second was yellow in tongue root region (31 patients, 20.0%). Swollen tongue body was found in 23 patients (14.8%) and teeth print on margin was found in 19 patients (12.3%). Most patients of ordinary state had light red tongue proper and thin white coating, patients of severe state mostly had dark pale tongue proper and yellow coating in root region, and the critical patients were mostly with dark pale proper and thick yellow coating. Patients with affected lung > or = 3 lobules mostly had pale dark proper and yellow coating on root, but those with involved lung < 3 lobules mostly had light red proper and thin white coating. CONCLUSION The colors detected quantitatively by the method described above could comparatively reflect the difference of tongue proper and coating sensitively.

Ultimately, such a model will be of use for studying SST2-targeted peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

Cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the shoulder of nude mice: nontransfected cells in the left shoulder and transfected cells in the right shoulder. BLI, SPECT/CT imaging, biodistribution analysis, and ex vivo autoradiography of the tumors were performed. BLI and SPECT/CT imaging were also performed on an intrahepatic tumor model in the rat. Caliper volume measurement of transfected tumors could be correlated with BLI measurements (R2 = .76). SPECT/CT imaging showed high levels of accumulation of 111In-DTPA-octreotide in control and transfected tumors, which was confirmed by biodistribution analysis and autoradiography. Subcapsular inoculation of transfected cells in rat liver resulted in an intrahepatic tumor, which could be visualized by both SPECT/CT and BLI. Transfection of CA20948 tumor cells did not alter the growth properties of the cell line or the expression of SST2. Transfected tumors could be clearly visualized by BLI and SPECT/CT imaging.

190160,A Personal Experience of Performing a Systematic Literature Review.,2018,"The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) translates its replicase gene (gene 1) into two co-amino-terminal polyproteins, polyprotein 1a and polyprotein 1ab. The gene 1 polyproteins are processed by viral proteinases to yield at least 15 mature products, including a putative RNA helicase from polyprotein 1ab that is presumed to be involved in viral RNA synthesis. Antibodies directed against polypeptides encoded by open reading frame 1b were used to characterize the expression and processing of the MHV helicase and to define the relationship of helicase to the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) and to sites of viral RNA synthesis in MHV-infected cells. The antihelicase antibodies detected a 67-kDa protein in MHV-infected cells that was translated and processed throughout the virus life cycle. Processing of the 67-kDa helicase from polyprotein 1ab was abolished by E64d, a known inhibitor of the MHV 3C-like proteinase. When infected cells were probed for helicase by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy, the protein was detected in patterns that varied from punctate perinuclear complexes to large structures that occupied much of the cell cytoplasm. Dual-labeling studies of infected cells for helicase and bromo-UTP-labeled RNA demonstrated that the vast majority of helicase-containing complexes were active in viral RNA synthesis. Dual-labeling studies for helicase and the MHV N protein showed that the two proteins almost completely colocalized, indicating that N was associated with the helicase-containing complexes. This study demonstrates that the putative RNA helicase is closely associated with MHV RNA synthesis and suggests that complexes containing helicase, N, and new viral RNA are the viral replication complexes.","Denison, M R; Spaan, W J; van der Meer, Y; Gibson, C A; Sims, A C; Prentice, E; Lu, X T",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10400784/,106

The aim of this study was to determine the adenovirus (AdV) types isolated from clinical specimens by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. A total of 22 AdV strains isolated between January 1st 2011 to May 31th 2011, from various samples (295 nasopharyngeal swabs, 42 conjunctival swabs, 13 stool) sent to our routine virology laboratory were included in the study. Of the 22 patients whose samples yielded adenovirus positivity, 8 were adult (4 were male; median age: 32.5 years) and 14 (7 were male; median age: 1 year) were children. Those specimens (14 nasopharyngeal swabs, 7 conjunctival swabs, 1 stool) were obtained from patients with URTIs (n= 6), LRTIs (n= 8), conjunctivitis (n= 7) and gastroenteritis (n= 1). For the isolation and identification of adenoviruses, rapid (shell vial) cell culture and direct immunofluorescence antibody methods were used, respectively. Molecular typing of adenoviruses were performed by PCR and sequencing of a partial region (hipervariable region 1-6) of the hexon gene. PCR primers (Adhex F1, Adhex R1) used for DNA amplification were from those described by Lu and Erdman, previously. If insufficient DNA was amplified from the first reaction for sequencing, a nested PCR was performed using Adhex F2 and Adhex R2 primers. Sequencing was performed using the amplification primers and Sequence Reagent Mix-DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc, USA) on ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Obtained adenovirus sequences were typed by BLAST analysis and three AdV types namely type 3, 4, and 8 were identified. In our study, AdV type 3 was detected in a gastroenteritis case and six cases with URTIs and LRTIs (n= 7, 31.8%). AdV type 8 was identified as the cause of conjunctivitis in seven patients and of URTIs and LRTIs in five patients (n= 12, 54.5%). AdV type 4 was found to be associated with URTI in one, and LRTIs in two patients (n= 3; 13.7%). Our data indicated that AdV type 8 was the most prevalent type in patients with conjunctivitis and URTIs, while AdV type 3 was the most prevalent type in patients with LRTI. BLAST analysis was thought to be useful for the molecular typing of adenoviruses. In conclusion, advanced studies with large number of specimens are necessary to achive a reliable, detailed national adenovirus database.","Ciçek, Candan; Sanlıdağ, Tamer; Akçalı, Sinem; Sayan, Murat; Yalaz, Mehmet; Metin, Dilek Yeşim",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23188574/,106

Members of the cyclophilin family are overexpressed in a range of human malignancies including hepatocellular cancer, pancreatic cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and glioblastoma multiforme, however, their precise role in tumourigenesis remains unclear. In recent years, mounting evidence supports a role for prolyl isomerisation during mammalian cell division; a process with striking similarity to plasma membrane remodelling during virus replication.

We first validate this method on the human influenza A viral genomes as well as on the human mitochondrial DNA database. We then apply the method to study the origin of the SARS coronavirus. We find that the majority of the SARS genome is most closely related to group 1 coronaviruses, with smaller regions of matches to sequences from groups 2 and 3. The information based similarity index provides a new tool to measure the similarity between datasets based on their information content and may have a wide range of applications in the large-scale analysis of genomic databases.","Yang, Albert C-C; Goldberger, Ary L; Peng, C-K",Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16241900/,106

Soil, vegetation and animals, including humans, are sources for aerial release of these living or dead cells. In the past, assessment of airborne microorganisms was mainly restricted to occupational health concerns. Indeed, in several occupations, exposure to very high concentrations of non-infectious airborne bacteria and fungi, result in allergenic, toxic or irritant reactions. Recently, the threat of bioterrorism and pandemics have highlighted the urgent need to increase knowledge of bioaerosol ecology. More fundamentally, airborne bacterial and fungal communities begin to draw much more consideration from environmental microbiologists, who have neglected this area for a long time. This increased interest of scientists is to a great part due to the development and use of real-time PCR techniques to identify and quantify airborne microorganisms. Even if the advantages of the PCR technology are obvious, researchers are confronted with new problems. This review describes the methodological state of the art in bioaerosols field and emphasizes the future challenges and perspectives of the real-time PCR-based methods for airborne microorganism studies.","Oppliger, Anne; Masclaux, Frederic G; Niculita-Hirzel, Helene",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21196388/,106

Pandemic preparedness has accelerated around the world in recent years in response to the perceived increased risk of a pandemic developing following the emergence of H5N1 avian influenza in domestic poultry flocks in Asia, Africa and Europe. There is a hierarchy of pandemic plans - international, national, state, and local - and harmonisation of all of these is imperative for a coordinated and effective response. At the national and state levels, plans have been developed for a whole-of-government response to a pandemic, in addition to plans specifically for the health sector.

Health workers are vulnerable and are at high risk of infection. AIMS To assess SARS-related stress and its immediate psychological impact and responses among health workers. METHOD Health workers in a tertiary hospital affected by SARS were invited to complete a questionnaire designed to evaluate exposure experience, psychological impact and psychiatric morbidity. The risk and rates of psychiatric morbidity were estimated for exposure experience. RESULTS Altogether, 1257 health workers successfully completed the survey. In the initial phase of the outbreak, when the infection was spreading rapidly, feelings of extreme vulnerability, uncertainty and threat to life were perceived, dominated by somatic and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. During the 'repair' phase, when the infection was being brought under control, depression and avoidance were evident. The estimated prevalence of psychiatric morbidity measured by the Chinese Health Questionnaire was about 75%. CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of SARS could be regarded as an acute episode of a bio-disaster, leading to a significantly high rate of psychiatric morbidity.","Chong, Mian-Yoon; Wang, Wen-Chih; Hsieh, Wen-Chien; Lee, Chun-Yi; Chiu, Nien-Mu; Yeh, Wei-Chiang; Huang, Otiao-Lai; Wen, Jong-Kwang; Chen, Chao-Long",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15286063/,106

A gene encoding a homologue to ACE2, termed collectrin (Tmem27), has been identified in immediate proximity to the ace2 locus. The in vivo function of collectrin was unclear. Here we report that targeted disruption of collectrin in mice results in a severe defect in renal amino acid uptake owing to downregulation of apical amino acid transporters in the kidney. Collectrin associates with multiple apical transporters and defines a novel group of renal amino acid transporters. Expression of collectrin in Xenopus oocytes and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells enhances amino acid transport by the transporter B(0)AT1. These data identify collectrin as a key regulator of renal amino acid uptake.","Danilczyk, Ursula; Sarao, Renu; Remy, Christine; Benabbas, Chahira; Stange, Gerti; Richter, Andreas; Arya, Sudha; Pospisilik, J Andrew; Singer, Dustin; Camargo, Simone M R; Makrides, Victoria; Ramadan, Tamara; Verrey, Francois; Wagner, Carsten A; Penninger, Josef M",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17167413/,106

Combinatorial chemistry significantly speeds up the synthesis of potential new drug candidates. Diversity considerations, as well as the use of 3D structural information of the biological targets, reduce the size of huge libraries to a reasonable number of rationally-designed ligands. New NMR techniques (SAR by NMR) allow the construction of high-affinity ligands from small molecules with much lower affinities. Computer-aided drug design uses building, linking, and/or rigid docking procedures to search for ligands for a certain binding site. Scoring functions provide a rank order of the designed ligands according to their estimated binding affinities. Further developments in computer-aided drug design are automated approaches for the flexible alignment of molecules, the flexible docking of ligands to their binding sites, and the stepwise assembly of synthetically easily accessible ligands from combinatorial libraries of fragments.","Kubinyi, H",Current opinion in drug discovery & development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19649785/,106
201543,"In the midst of crisis, a great opportunity",2020,"Thymocytes from adult BB rats can adoptively transfer autoimmune diabetes to athymic recipients. It is also known that the development of BB rat T-cells is recapitulated in adult thymus organ cultures (ATOCs). Based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that cells capable of the adoptive transfer of diabetes would be present in long-term ATOCs but could be rendered nondiabetogenic by co-culture with appropriate antigens. We observed that cells recovered from adult diabetes-resistant BB (BBDR) rat thymi cultured for up to 14 days can adoptively transfer disease to athymic WAG-rnu/rnu rats treated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid and a monoclonal antibody to preclude development of ART2a+ regulatory T-cells. Co-culture of adult BBDR thymi in the presence of BBDR thyrocytes had no effect on the ability of recovered cells to induce diabetes in 70-80% of adoptive recipients. In contrast, co-culture in the presence of islets prevented transfer of diabetes, on average, in >90% of recipients. Fresh islets, frozen islets, and islets pretreated with streptozotocin to deplete insulin were equally effective in preventing diabetes, but none prevented insulitis in nondiabetic recipients. Co-culture in the presence of islets was not associated with detectable alterations in phenotype or in the secretion of gamma-interferon or interleukin-4, either in cultures or in cells recovered from adoptive recipients. We conclude that islet antigens involved in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes in BB rats may be absent or deficient in BB rat thymi. Exposure of ATOCs to exogenous islets may lead to deletion or anergy of diabetogenic T-cells or to the positive selection of regulatory T-cells.","Whalen, B J; Marounek, J; Weiser, P; Appel, M C; Greiner, D L; Mordes, J P; Rossini, A A",Diabetes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11334440/,106

In January 2020, the World Health Association (WHO) declared the CO-VID-19 as an epidemic. Abnormal coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients currently are considered as prognostic factors of severity. Our aim is to summarize the current data available in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS An electronic search was performed in the Database of publications on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) of the World Health Organization. Thrombin Time (TT), Prothrombin Time (PT), Fibrinogen (FIB), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APPT), and D-Dimer have been detected as parameters to study in every COVID-19 patient. CLINICAL APPLICATION The coagulation function panel has been described to be altered in critical COVID-2019 patients. DIC, which plays an important role in advanced stage, is known to be associated with sepsis. Anticoagulant therapy, mainly with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), appears to be associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COV-ID-19. DISCUSSION Coagulation function in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection is significantly deranged compared with normal patients. FIB and D-Dimer/FDP are the most significantly altered values and the early deetection of alteration could be useful to address therapies. D-Dimer/FDP (DD/FDP) alteration correlates with severity. Markedly elevated D-Dimer can be used to guide the introduction of anticoagulation therapy and evaluate prognosis of COVID-19. In every patient admitted with SARS-CoV2 infection PT, FIB, D-Dimer/FDP, and platelets must be ordered. We suggest daily extraction for every patient admitted and tested positive for COVID-19.","Guevara-Noriega, Kerbi Alejandro; Lucar-Lopez, Gustavo Adolfo; Nuñez, Giselle; Rivera-Aguasvivas, Luis; Chauhan, Ishit",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581015/,106
201847,Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in kuwait using compartmental and logistic regression models,2020,"It has been found that a domain composed of 330 amino acids of the N terminus of murine coronavirus spike protein [S1N(330)] is involved in receptor-binding activity (H. Kubo, Y.K. Yamada, and F. Taguchi, J. Virol. 68:5403-5410, 1994). To delineate the amino acid sequences involved in receptor-binding activity, we have compared the S1N(330) proteins of seven different mouse hepatitis virus MHV strains that are able to utilize the MHV receptor protein. Three conserved regions (sites I, II, and III) were found to consist of more than 10 identical amino acids, and they were analyzed for receptor-binding activity by site-directed mutagenesis. S1N(330) with a substitution at position 62 from the N terminus of S1 in region I and that with substitutions at positions 212, 214, and 216 in region II showed no receptor-binding activity. The S1N(330) mutants without receptor-binding activity were not able to prevent virus binding to the receptor. These results suggest that the receptor-binding site on S1N(330) is composed of regions located apart from each other in the protein's primary structure, in which Thr at position 62 as well as amino acids located at positions 212, 214, and 216 are particularly important.","Suzuki, H; Taguchi, F",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8642698/,106

The respiratory tract is the structure most affected by COVID-19, and the serious form of the disease is characterized by severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypercoagulation. However, accumulating evidence shows that other organs could be reached by the virus, thus causing further comorbidities. To date, the exact route / routes of transmission of COVID-19 are still unclear. The respiratory tract is probably not the only route of transmission for this viral infection and some authors have also speculated that COVID-19 droplets, or infected hands, could contaminate the conjunctiva, which could therefore represent the initial site of an infection spread. Theoretically, the role of the ocular surface, a biological site still relatively unexplored, appears scientifically relevant in understanding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

202217,Can existing live vaccines prevent COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate clinical symptoms and epidemiologic features of emergency surgery patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). More than 5 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since December 2019 to the time of this publication. Thousands of emergency operations have been carried out since December 2019. To date, however, no literature has focused on the clinical symptoms of emergency surgery patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 164 emergency surgery patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1, 2020, to January 20, 2020. For this report, the final date of follow-up was February 5, 2020. The associated clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, demographic, radiologic, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 164 emergency surgery patients, the median age was 41 years (interquartile range, 29-89), and 136 (82.9%) were women. The associated main clinical symptom included fever (93 [56.7%])ï¼dry cough (56 [34.2%]), fatigue (86 [52.4%]), nausea (78 [47.6%]), and dizziness (77 [47%]). Of 54 emergency surgery patients infected with COVID-19, the median age was 46 years (interquartile range: 25-89), and 45 (83.3%) were women. The pathologic clinical symptoms investigated included fever (54 [100%]), fatigue (48 [88.9%]), nausea (52 [96.3%]), dizziness (46 [85.2%]), and dry cough (44 [81.5%]). The lymphopenia (0.37 × 109/L [interquartile range: 0.23-0.65]) and increased C-reactive protein (24.7 × 109/L [interquartile range: 13.57-38]) were observed. The preoperative fever and postoperative fever in emergency surgery patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this study. Of 54 emergency surgery patients with COVID-19, 15 (27.8%) showed preoperative fever, 54 (100%) had postoperative fever. Of 110 emergency surgery patients without COVID-19, 5 (4.5%) had preoperative fever, 31 (28.2%) patients had postoperative fever. In emergency surgery patients with COVID-19, the fever lasted more than 7 days, markedly exceeded the length of time non-COVID-19 patients experienced fever (approximately 3 days). Furthermore, 43 health care workers were exposed to emergency surgery patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and were infected with COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In our study, the clinical symptoms of emergency surgery patients infected with COVID-19 displayed marked differences from those reporting common COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, the health care workers were suspected to have been exposed to a great risk when caring for emergency surgery patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Management guidelines of emergency surgery patients are described in in this report.","Li, Jinpeng; Gao, Rongfen; Wu, Gaosong; Wu, Xiaolin; Liu, Zeming; Wang, Hongjing; Huang, Yihui; Pan, Zhenyu; Chen, Jincao; Wu, Xiaohui",Surgery,,106

We present and discuss the adverse effects observed in an acute psychiatric clinic that has admitted COVID-19 patients during the first three months of the pandemic in Turkey. METHODS: The COVID-19 treatment schemes were formed in accordance with the national and regional guidelines at the time of admittance, which were mainly based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs. The sample consisted exclusively of inpatients, and all patients were enrolled in the study regardless of their specific diagnosis or treatment schemes. RESULTS: 4 out of 23 patients (17.4%) had experienced adverse effects, two of which had mild hepatic enzyme elevation and one had mild sinus bradycardia. Of note is that we haven't encountered any serious complications or life-threatening events during inpatient treatment. The most emphasised adverse effect in the literature, namely QTc prolongation and ECG changes, were not observed in our sample. The adverse effects were not found to be significantly associated with patient-related factors nor dose of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: From our point of view, non-cardiac adverse effects should not be overlooked while treating comorbid psychiatric and COVID-19 patients. KEY POINTS Acute inpatient psychiatric treatment of patients who have comorbid COVID-19 is a complex situation requiring multidisciplinary action. Adverse drug reactions, which may or not result from the interaction of psychiatric and COVID-19 treatment, should be of concern for this patient group. While there is controversy over the benefits of some of the off-label COVID-19 medications, there should also be discussion over safety and concomitant medication use.

DESIGN: Open-source age-structured variant of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered compartmental mathematical model. Latin hypercube sampling and maximum likelihood estimation were used to calibrate to cumulative cases and cumulative deaths. SETTING: SW at a time considered early in the pandemic, where National Health Service authorities required evidence to guide localised planning and support decision-making. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available data on patients with COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The expected numbers of infected cases, deaths due to COVID-19 infection, patient occupancy of acute and IC beds and the reproduction ('R') number over time. RESULTS: SW model projections indicate that, as of 11 May 2020 (when 'lockdown' measures were eased), 5793 (95% credible interval (CrI) 2003 to 12 051) individuals were still infectious (0.10% of the total SW population, 95% CrI 0.04% to 0.22%), and a total of 189 048 (95% CrI 141 580 to 277 955) had been infected with the virus (either asymptomatically or symptomatically), but recovered, which is 3.4% (95% CrI 2.5% to 5.0%) of the SW population. The total number of patients in acute and IC beds in the SW on 11 May 2020 was predicted to be 701 (95% CrI 169 to 1543) and 110 (95% CrI 8 to 464), respectively. The R value in SW was predicted to be 2.6 (95% CrI 2.0 to 3.2) prior to any interventions, with social distancing reducing this to 2.3 (95% CrI 1.8 to 2.9) and lockdown/school closures further reducing the R value to 0.6 (95% CrI 0.5 to 0.7).

In fact, the COVID-19 infection may lead to a rapidly evolving and potentially fatal pneumonia. Moreover, computed tomography (CT) can be more sensitive than the COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, especially at the beginning of the disease. Only patients with mild features consistent with COVID-19 infection, negative COVID-19 test, or positive COVID-19 test but at low risk for disease progression should avoid imaging. However, imaging becomes mandatory if respiratory symptoms worsen. A CT pattern classification has been designed to help both radiologists and clinicians. The typical pattern of COVID-19 is depicted by multifocal, bilateral, and peripheral ground-glass opacities (with or without consolidations or crazy paving) or findings of organizing pneumonia. Moreover, CT has demonstrated a prognostic role in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Lung ultrasounds (LUS) are an emergent tool in the diagnosis of the disease. The adoption of LUS combined to chest X-rays in COVID-19 in pneumonia diagnosis is an interesting prospect that needs to be confirmed.","Landini, N.; Orlandi, M.; Fusaro, M.; Ciet, P.; Nardi, C.; Bertolo, S.; Catalanotti, V.; Matucci-Cerinic, M.; Colagrande, S.; Morana, G.",Journal of Cardiovascular Echography,,106

206179,Who is contributing? Scientific collaborations on COVID-19,2020,"Mathematical models of epidemiological systems enable investigation of and predictions about potential disease outbreaks. However, commonly used models are often highly simplified representations of incredibly complex systems. Because of these simplifications, the model output, of say new cases of a disease over time, or when an epidemic will occur, may be inconsistent with available data. In this case, we must improve the model, especially if we plan to make decisions based on it that could affect human health and safety, but direct improvements are often beyond our reach. In this work, we explore this problem through a case study of the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2016. We propose an embedded discrepancy operator---a modification to the model equations that requires modest information about the system and is calibrated by all relevant data. We show that the new enriched model demonstrates greatly increased consistency with real data. Moreover, the method is general enough to easily apply to many other mathematical models in epidemiology.","Morrison, Rebecca E.; Cunha, Americo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06220v1.pdf,106

The objective of the study was to investigate the side effects of the mRNA-1273 vaccine with detailed review of organ systems. A randomized, cross-sectional study using an independent online survey questionnaire was conducted to collect responses from HCWs. Of all participants, 87.8% (1116/1271) provided complete responses. Of them, 38.7% (432/1116) received the mRNA-1273 vaccine, among which, 89.35% were females; 425 of these 432 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients (98.34%) reported at least one or more symptoms. The results were classified based on the frequency of symptoms reported postvaccination. Of these, 254/432 (58.8%) were able to continue their daily routine activities. 108/432 (25%) temporarily had trouble to perform daily activities, 120/432 (27.78%) required transient time off from work, 17/432 (3.94%) required help from an outpatient provider, 1/432 (0.23%) required help from emergency department, and none of them were hospitalized. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, 97.02% of the HCWs did not intend to skip the second dose of vaccine. Among all the symptoms reported, localized pain, generalized weakness, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, nausea, joint pains, sweating, localized swelling at the injection site, dizziness, itching, rash, decreased appetite, muscle spasm, decreased sleep quality, and brain fogging were the most commonly reported symptoms (in descending order of occurrence). Most of the symptoms reported were nonlife threatening. Despite the wide array of self-reported symptoms, there appears to be a higher acceptance for this vaccine.","Kadali, Renuka Ananth Kalyan; Janagama, Ravali; Peruru, Sharanya; Gajula, Viswanath; Madathala, Rajasekhar R; Chennaiahgari, Nikhita; Malayala, Srikrishna V",J Med Virol,,106
206824,The Eurasian Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) in 2019-2020,2021,"Prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and recurrence of PCR-positive tests have been widely reported in patients after recovery from COVID-19, but some of these patients do not appear to shed infectious virus. We investigated the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of human cells in culture and that transcription of the integrated sequences might account for some of the positive PCR tests seen in patients. In support of this hypothesis, we found that DNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be integrated into the genome of infected human cells. We found target site duplications flanking the viral sequences and consensus LINE1 endonuclease recognition sequences at the integration sites, consistent with a LINE1 retrotransposon-mediated, target-primed reverse transcription and retroposition mechanism. We also found, in some patient-derived tissues, evidence suggesting that a large fraction of the viral sequences is transcribed from integrated DNA copies of viral sequences, generating viral-host chimeric transcripts. The integration and transcription of viral sequences may thus contribute to the detection of viral RNA by PCR in patients after infection and clinical recovery. Because we have detected only subgenomic sequences derived mainly from the 3' end of the viral genome integrated into the DNA of the host cell, infectious virus cannot be produced from the integrated subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 sequences.","Zhang, Liguo; Richards, Alexsia; Barrasa, M Inmaculada; Hughes, Stephen H; Young, Richard A; Jaenisch, Rudolf",Proc.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) is required for viral entry and development of COVID-19. ACE2 regulates the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that endows anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Preclinical data suggest ACE2 might be downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 binding, and treatments that increase ACE2 may prevent cardiopulmonary injury. Development, testing, and mass production of novel ACE2 therapies may take years, whereas more effective treatments for COVID-19 are needed urgently. Metformin is a widely available anti-diabetic agent that has an excellent safety profile, and clinical and preclinical data suggest metformin may offer cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19 via enhanced ACE2 expression.","Malhotra, Atul; Hepokoski, Mark; McCowen, Karen C; Y-J Shyy, John",iScience,,106

The occurrence of a cytokine storm in the lungs is a critical step in the disease pathogenesis, as it causes pathological lesions, pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, potentially resulting in death. Currently, there is no effective treatment that targets the cytokine storm and helps regenerate the damaged tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to act as anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory candidates and activate endogenous regeneration. As a result, MSC therapy is a potential treatment approach for COVID-19. Intravenous injection of clinical-grade MSCs into COVID-19 patients can induce an immunomodulatory response along with improved lung function. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are considered a potential source of MSCs for immunomodulation, tissue regeneration, and clinical application. Although some current clinical trials have treated COVID-19 patients with DPSCs, this therapy has not been approved. Here, we review the potential use of DPSCs and their significance in the development of a therapy for COVID-19.","Zayed, Mohammed; Iohara, Koichiro",Cell Transplant,,106

The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure toward exponentially expanding COVID-19. Thereto, high throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the receptor binding domain of spike protein (S-RBD) and ACE2 host cell receptor. Primary screening identified a few promising molecules for both the targets, which were further analyzed in details by their binding energy, binding modes through molecular docking, dynamics and simulations. Evidently, GR 127935 hydrochloride hydrate, GNF-5, RS504393, TNP, and eptifibatide acetate were found binding to virus binding motifs of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, KT203, BMS195614, KT185, RS504393, and GSK1838705A were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein. These identified molecules may effectively assist in controlling the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 by not only potentially inhibiting the virus at entry step but are also hypothesized to act as anti-inflammatory agents, which could impart relief in lung inflammation. Timely identification and determination of an effective drug to combat and tranquilize the COVID-19 global crisis is the utmost need of hour. Further, prompt in vivo testing to validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition efficiency by these molecules could save lives is justified.","Choudhary, Shweta; Malik, Yashpal S; Tomar, Shailly",Front Immunol,,106
208840,The countries that tamed covid-19,2020,"Background & objectives: Since the beginning of the year 2020, the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) impacted humankind adversely in almost all spheres of life. The virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with mild-to-severe respiratory illness. The currently available diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are mainly based on molecular assays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the only diagnostic method currently recommended by the World Health Organization for COVID-19. With the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to utilize other tests, which would determine the burden of the disease as well as the spread of the outbreak. Considering the need for the development of such a screening test, an attempt was made to develop and evaluate an IgG-based ELISA for COVID-19. Methods: A total of 513 blood samples (131 positive, 382 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were collected and tested by microneutralization test (MNT). Antigen stock of SARS-CoV-2 was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero CCL-81 cells. An IgG capture ELISA was developed for serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum samples. The end point cut-off values were determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Inter-assay variability was determined. Results: The developed ELISA was found to be 92.37 per cent sensitive, 97.9 per cent specific, robust and reproducible. The positive and negative predictive values were 94.44 and 98.14 per cent, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: This indigenously developed IgG ELISA was found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum samples. This assay may be used for determining seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a population exposed to the virus.","Sapkal, Gajanan; Shete-Aich, Anita; Jain, Rajlaxmi; Yadav, Pragya D; Sarkale, Prasad; Lakra, Rajen; Baradkar, Srikant; Deshpande, Gururaj Rao; Mali, Deepak; Tilekar, Bipin N; Majumdar, Triparna; Kaushal, Himanshu; Gurav, Yogesh; Gupta, Nivedita; Mohandas, Sreelekshmy; Deshpande, Ketki; Kaduskar, Ojas; Salve, Malvika; Patil, Savita; Gaikwad, Shivshankar; Sugunan, A P; Ashok, M; Giri, Sidhartha; Shastri, Jayanthi; Abraham, Priya; Gangakhedkar, Raman R",Indian J Med Res,,106

Before the pandemic, over 50% of children were not achieving physical activity guidelines.7 Despite restrictions allowing 60 minutes of exercise in a local area, nearly 30% of children report not leaving the house on a typical lockdown day.8 With parks, recreational areas, and sports clubs closed and screen time increased, there has been further reduction in physical activity in young people;this is more pronounced among ethnic minority communities.89 Like previous policy documents, the July 2020 UK Obesity Strategy does not go far enough to tackle underlying health inequalities linked with childhood obesity.10 It contains many previously proposed (but never implemented) strategies, and these measures are weak in comparison with other countries.101112 Convergence of the childhood obesity epidemic and the covid-19 pandemic means that now is the time for urgent and decisive action by government to protect the wellbeing of children and future health of the UK population.

210507,Special Issue: Communicating Risk and Uncertainty in the Face of COVID-19,2020,"Most viral pathogens causing epidemics and pandemics are zoonotic, emerging from wildlife reservoirs like SARS CoV2 causing the global Covid-19 pandemic, although animal origin of this virus remains a mystery. Cross-species transmission of pathogens from animals to humans is known as zoonosis. However, pathogens are also transmitted from humans to animals in regions where there is a close interaction between animals and humans by ‘reverse transmission’ (anthroponosis). Molecular evidence for the transmission of two zoonotic RNA viruses at the human-monkey interface in Rajasthan forests is presented here: a) the apathogenic Simian Foamy Viruses (SFV), and b): Influenza A viruses (IAV)-like virus, etiologic agent for human flu infecting wild Indian rhesus monkeys inhabiting Rajasthan forests. The data provide critical information on ecology and evolution of viruses of Public Health relevance. During replication, viral genomes mutate along the transmission route to adapt to the new hosts, generating new variants that are likely to have properties different from the founder viruses. Wild Indian monkeys are under-sampled for monitoring infectious diseases mainly because of the difficulties with sample collection. Monkeys are perceived as religious icons by the Hindus in India. It is extremely difficult to obtain permission from the Forest and Wildlife Department government authorities to collect wild simian blood samples for surveillance of infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens.

In order to make full use of EPA and DHA, it is necessary to prepare their high-purity component. In this paper, EPA and DHA were separated and purified by three-zone simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography with C18 used as stationary phase and ethanol-water as mobile phase. For the single column experiment, a separation unit of SMB, the effects of the ratio of ethanol to water, pH value and temperature on the separation were investigated. The equilibrium dispersion (ED) model was used to obtain the adsorption parameters of EPA and DHA by inverse method and genetic algorithm, and the accuracy of the adsorption parameters was verified by fitting the overloaded elution curves under different conditions. Based on the acquired nonlinear adsorption isotherms the complete separation region was found according to triangle theory. The effects of sample concentration, flow ratios of adsorption zone and rectification zone, and column distribution mode of SMB on the separation were investigated. Under the optimized SMB conditions, the experimental result was that without regard to the other components, the chromatographic purity and recovery values of EPA and DHA exceeded 99% with the productivity of 4.15 g/L/h, and the solvent consumption of 1.11 L/g.","Wei, Bofeng; Wang, Shaoyan",J Chromatogr A,,106

While the pandemic clearly poses a risk to the lives and wellbeing of vulnerable groups, necessary public health measures taken to delay or limit the spread of the virus have led to distinctive challenges for prevention, family support, court processes, placement and alternative care. The pandemic has also come about at a time when statutory changes to partnerships have led to a reduction in the importance of educational professional representation in the new formulation in England and Wales. OBJECTIVES: In this discussion paper, we propose a novel and pragmatic conceptual framework during this challenging time. PARTICIPANTS: We consulted with 8 education professionals and 4 field-based student social workers. SETTING: Bodies responsible for safeguarding have been working quickly to develop new approaches to fulfilling their responsibilities, for example through online home visits and case conferences. However, some communities have been highlighted as experiencing particular challenges because of the pandemic and its impacts. Protection of vulnerable children is increasingly dependent on individualised - and often pathologising - practice with a lack of emphasis on the importance of the social. Holistic consideration of the child is side-lined. RESULTS: Our framework comprises two phases: pandemic and aspirational. CONCLUSION: The framework illuminates the importance of interconnected sectors and multi-agency working, the need for resilient and adaptable support systems, and the need to promote the importance of children's rights and voices to be heard above the noise of the pandemic.","Levine, Diane Thembekile; Morton, Julie; O039,; Reilly, Michelle",Child Abuse Negl,,106

The first two cases of COVID-19 were detected in Venezuela on March 13, 2020. The aim of this study was the genetic characterization of Venezuelan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A total of 7 full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing, from patients of different regions of Venezuela, mainly from the beginning of the epidemic. Ten out of 11 isolates (6 complete genomes and 4 partial spike genomic regions) belonged to lineage B, bearing the D614G mutation in the Spike protein. Isolates from the first outbreak that occurred in the Margarita Island harbored an in-frame deletion in its sequence, without amino acids 83-85 of the NSP1 of the ORF1. The search for deletions in 48,635 sequences showed that the NSP1 gene exhibit the highest frequency of deletions along the whole genome. Structural analysis suggests a change in the N-terminal domain with the presence of this deletion. In contrast, isolates circulating later in this island lacked the deletion, suggesting new introductions to the island after this first outbreak. In conclusion, a high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were found circulating in Venezuela, with predominance of the D614G mutation. The first small outbreak in Margarita Island seemed to be associated with a strain carrying a small deletion in the NSP1 protein, but these isolates do not seem to be responsible for the larger outbreak which started in July.","Loureiro, Carmen L; Jaspe, Rossana C; D Angelo, Pierina; Zambrano, José L; Rodriguez, Lieska; Alarcon, Víctor; Delgado, Mariangel; Aguilar, Marwan; Garzaro, Domingo; Rangel, Héctor R; Pujol, Flor H",PLoS One,,106
213462,Covid-19: What is happening with the vaccine rollout?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The integration of high technology into health care systems is intended to provide new treatment options and improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care. Robotic-assisted surgery is an example of high technology integration in health care, which has become ubiquitous in many surgical disciplines. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand and measure current robotic-assisted surgery processes in a systematic, quantitative, and replicable manner to identify latent systemic threats and opportunities for improvement based on our observations and to implement and evaluate interventions. This 5-year study will follow a human factors engineering approach to improve the safety and efficiency of robotic-assisted surgery across 4 US hospitals. METHODS: The study uses a stepped wedge crossover design with 3 interventions, introduced in different sequences at each of the hospitals over four 8-month phases. Robotic-assisted surgery procedures will be observed in the following specialties: urogynecology, gynecology, urology, bariatrics, general, and colorectal. We will use the data collected from observations, surveys, and interviews to inform interventions focused on teamwork, task design, and workplace design. We intend to evaluate attitudes toward each intervention, safety culture, subjective workload for each case, effectiveness of each intervention (including through direct observation of a sample of surgeries in each observational phase), operating room duration, length of stay, and patient safety incident reports. Analytic methods will include statistical data analysis, point process analysis, and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018 and approved by the institutional review board of each institution in May and June of 2019 (CSMC and MDRH: Pro00056245; VCMC: STUDY 270; MUSC: Pro00088741). After refining the 3 interventions in phase 1, data collection for phase 2 (baseline data) began in November 2019 and was scheduled to continue through June 2020. However, data collection was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 65 observations across the 4 sites before the pandemic. Data collection for phase 2 was resumed in October 2020 at 2 of the 4 sites. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the largest direct observational study of surgery ever conducted with data collected on 680 robotic surgery procedures at 4 different institutions. The proposed interventions will be evaluated using individual-level (workload and attitude), process-level (perioperative duration and flow disruption), and organizational-level (safety culture and complications) measures. An implementation science framework is also used to investigate the causes of success or failure of each intervention at each site and understand the potential spread of the interventions.

One of the issues is the role of rituximab in improving the outcome. Here, we summarize the existing evidence, and comment on the literature on this topic. RECENT FINDINGS: Two randomized controlled studies have been published recently, with conflicting results. Although the evidence of the benefit of rituximab is limited, it is already incorporated into many treatment regimens, both in studies and in standard clinical practice. The use of rituximab in PCNSL is still a matter of debate. A positive effect on the outcome is uncertain. However, there are no clinical signs of significantly increased toxicity. The uncertain positive effect should therefore be weighed against the increased costs of the treatment.","Bromberg, Jacoline E C; van der Meulen, Matthijs; Doorduijn, Jeanette K",Curr Oncol Rep,,106

215081,Using Simulation to Teach Methods for Improving Patient Literacy about Medicines,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Increased autonomic arousal is a proposed risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few studies have prospectively examined the association between physiological responses to acute psychological stress prior to a traumatic event with later PTSD symptoms. The present prospective study examined whether cardiovascular responses to an acute psychological stress task prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic predicted PTSD symptoms related to the ongoing pandemic. METHOD: Participants (N = 120) were a subsample of an ongoing research study. Phase 1 consisted of a 10-minute baseline and 4-minute acute psychological stress task with blood pressure and heart rate recorded throughout. Phase 2 was initiated two weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the ongoing pandemic. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to examine whether cardiovascular stress reactivity predicted COVID-19 PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Heart rate reactivity significantly predicted IES-intrusion, b = -.208, t = -2.28, p = .025, DR = .041, CI: [-.021 - -.001] and IES-hyperarousal b = -.224, t = -2.54, p = .012, DR = .047, CI: [-0.22 - - .003], but not IES-avoidance (p = .077). These results remained statistically significant after adjustment for gender, socioeconomic status, baseline cardiovascular activity, neuroticism, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and adverse childhood experiences. There were no statistically significant associations between blood pressure with any of the IES-R subscales (p's > .12). CONCLUSIONS: Diminished heart rate responses (i.e., lower physiological arousal) to acute psychological stress prior to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly predicted reported PTSD symptoms during the crisis.","Ginty, Annie T; Young, Danielle A; Tyra, Alexandra T; Hurley, Page E; Brindle, Ryan C; Williams, Sarah E",Psychosom Med,,106

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 100 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with mild (n = 23), moderate (n = 37) or severe (n = 40) pneumonia classified according to the Japanese guidelines. Univariate Kruskal-Wallis and multivariate ordinal logistic analyses were used to examine whether CT parameters (opacity score, volume of opacity, % opacity, volume of high opacity, % high opacity and mean HU total on CT) as well as blood test parameters [procalcitonin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reactive protein, % lymphocyte, ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, hemoglobin A1c, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time (APTT), white blood cell count and creatinine] differed by disease severity. RESULTS: All CT parameters and all blood test parameters except procalcitonin and APPT were significantly different among mild, moderate and severe groups. By multivariate analysis, mean HU total and eGFR were two independent factors associated with severity (p < 0.0001). Cutoff values for mean HU total and eGFR were, respectively, - 801 HU and 77 ml/min/1.73 m2 between mild and moderate pneumonia and - 704 HU and 53 ml/min/1.73 m2 between moderate and severe pneumonia. CONCLUSION: The mean HU total of the whole lung, determined by the AI algorithm, and eGFR reflect the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Okuma, Tomohisa; Hamamoto, Shinichi; Maebayashi, Tetsunori; Taniguchi, Akishige; Hirakawa, Kyoko; Matsushita, Shu; Matsushita, Kazuki; Murata, Katsuko; Manabe, Takao; Miki, Yukio",Jpn. j. radiol.

216000,Transformation of dentistry in post COVID era,2020,"AIMS: To guarantee uninterrupted function of the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD), the pulse generator needs to be surgically replaced before the battery is depleted. The risks related to this replacement substantially impact long-term outcome for S-ICD recipients, as the majority will undergo one or several of these procedures in their lifetime. We aim to describe the procedural characteristics of the replacement procedure and to provide an insight in the complications associated with these replacements. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective analysis, data from replacement procedures and follow-up visits were collected from all patients who underwent elective S-ICD generator replacement in our tertiary centre from June 2014 until November 2019. Original device position was assessed using the PRAETORIAN score. Complications were defined as those requiring surgical intervention, systemic antibiotic treatment, or device extraction. Seventy-two patients were included, with a median follow-up of 1.9 years (IQR 0.6-3.3 years) after replacement. Battery depletion occurred after 5.9 ± 0.7 years. The pulse generator was repositioned in patients with a PRAETORIAN score &#8805;90 to minimize the defibrillation threshold. Although there was an increase in impedance compared to the implant procedure, first shock conversion rate during defibrillation testing was 91.4% with a success rate of 100% after multiple attempts. Two patients developed a complication after, respectively, 9 and 21 months, resulting in a complication rate of 1.4% per year. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 1.9 years, this study shows a low complication rate after S-ICD replacement, with a first shock conversion rate of 91.4%.","van der Stuijt, Willeke; Quast, Anne-Floor B E; Baalman, Sarah W E; de Wilde, Koen C; Brouwer, Tom F; Wilde, Arthur A M; Knops, Reinoud E",Europace,,106

The country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic is guided by the principle of Gross National Happiness (GNH), which prioritizes the well-being and happiness of people over conventional socioeconomic indicators. The king's leadership and government's decisions based on public health science helped in the control of the pandemic and reduce economic losses. The government implemented some unique and unconventional public health measures such as facility quarantine for those with high-risk exposure, an increase in quarantine period to 21 days, free testing and treatment, and population-based screening tests. Early and extensive contact tracing, extensive testing, effective communications, zoned travel restrictions, and adoption of physical distancing and hygiene measures limited COVID-19 transmissions within the country. Community participation from voluntary groups and civil society organizations helped deliver non-health services while hospitals provided uninterrupted routine health services through its primary healthcare network. All COVID-19 cases were treated in hospitals, and the country has had zero reported COVID-19 deaths.

Herein, we describe these associations with mortality in a largely minority underserved population. METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study included all adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 treated in our ICU between March 15 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: 128 critically ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 y [interquartile range 61-76], 45% female, and 64% Black); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) subjects died during their in-patient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Blacks had a greater proportion of women (52% vs 30%, P = .02) and subjects with hypertension (91% vs 78%, P = .035). Asthma (P = .03) was associated with lower in-patient death, primarily among Black subjects (P = .02). Among Black subjects, increased age (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.05-1.22] per year), positive fluid balance (odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.01-1.11] per 100 mL), and treatment with tocilizumab (odds ratio 25.0 [95% CI 3.5-180]) were independently associated with in-patient death, while higher platelets (odds ratio 0.65 [95% CI 0.47-0.89] per 50 × 103/mL) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (odds ratio 0.08 [95% CI 0.02-0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (odds ratio 1.75 [95% CI 0.94-3.25] per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximum lactate (odds ratio 1.43 [95% CI 0.96-2.13] per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (odds ratio 0.24 [95% CI 0.05-1.25]). During first 72 h of ventilation, those who died had less increase in [Formula: see text] (P = .046) and less reduction in PEEP (P = .01) and [Formula: see text] requirement (P = .002); these patterns did not differ by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Black and other race/ethnicity subjects had similar mortality rates due to COVID-19 but differed in factors that were associated with increased risk of death. In both groups, subjects who died were older, had a positive fluid balance, and less improvement in [Formula: see text], PEEP, and [Formula: see text] requirement on ventilation.","Chaudhary, Siddique; Benzaquen, Sadia; Woo, Jessica G; Rubinstein, Jack; Matta, Atul; Albano, Jeri; De Joy, Robert; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",Respir Care,,106

Although the terms refer to a political and public health strategy - contain the virus, flatten the peak of the epidemic, mitigate its effects - we offer a psychosocial reading that draws attention to the relation between time and care embedded in each term. We do so to call for the development of a form of care-ful attention under conditions that tend to prompt action rather than reflection, closing down time for thinking. Using Adriana Cavarero's notion of 'horrorism', in which violence is enacted at precisely the point that care is most needed, we discuss the ever-present possibility of failures within acts of care. We argue that dwelling in the temporality of delay can be understood as an act of care if delaying allows us to pay care-ful attention to violence. We then circle back to a point in twentieth-century history - World War II - that was also concerned with an existential threat requiring a response from a whole population. Our purpose is not to invoke a fantasised narrative of 'Blitz spirit', but to suggest that the British psychoanalytic tradition born of that moment offers resources for understanding how to keep thinking while 'under fire' through containing unbearable anxiety and the capacity for violence in the intersubjective space and time between people. In conditions of lockdown and what will be a long and drawn-out 'after life' of COVID-19, this commitment to thinking in and with delay and containment might help to inhabit this time of waiting - waiting that is the management and mitigation of a future threat, but also a time of care in and for the present.","Baraitser, Lisa; Salisbury, Laura",Wellcome Open Res,,106

The goal is to give a useful insight into the expectations of beyond 5G or 6G system with respect to IIoT. 3GPP completed the Release 16 version of its specifications in July 2020 a little behind the target of March 2020. The reality is that the growth of the Internet-of Things (IoT) has resulted in an explosion in the use of IoT devices leading to the prediction that IoT devices will exceed 25 billion in 2020 and may exceed 75 billion in 2025. This explosion has placed the direction of Release 16 on new features for eURLLC (enhanced Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication) and Industrial Internet of Things, including Time Sensitive Networks, enhanced location services and support for non public networks. The paper adopted short review of major works available on ieee Xplore between 1993-2020.

221858,A critical analysis of some recent medical research in science on COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To utilize a deep learning model for automatic detection of abnormalities in chest CT images from COVID-19 patients and compare its quantitative determination performance with radiological residents. METHODS: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists' reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm3. An average running speed of 20.3 s ± 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p < 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p < 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists. KEY POINTS: â¢ The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. â¢ The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. â¢ The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung.","Ni, Qianqian; Sun, Zhi Yuan; Qi, Li; Chen, Wen; Yang, Yi; Wang, Li; Zhang, Xinyuan; Yang, Liu; Fang, Yi; Xing, Zijian; Zhou, Zhen; Yu, Yizhou; Lu, Guang Ming; Zhang, Long Jiang",Eur Radiol,,106

Even though a massive data set analyzed with Data Science methods may provide a powerful solution to a problem, its adoption by relevant stakeholders is not guaranteed, due to adoption blockers such as lack of interpretability and transparency. In this context, this paper proposes a preliminary methodology toward bridging two disciplines, Data Science and Transportation, to solve urban problems with methods that are suitable for adoption. The methodology is defined by four steps where people from both disciplines go from algorithm and model definition to the building of a potentially adoptable solution. As case study, we describe how this methodology was applied to define a model to infer commuting trips with mode of transportation from mobile phone data.","Graells-Garrido, Eduardo; Pena-Araya, Vanessa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08956v1.pdf,106

To evaluate the adjuvant use of systemic oxygen-ozone administration in the early control of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. PROBIOZOVID is an ongoing, interventional, randomized, prospective, and double-arm trial enrolling patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. From a total of 85 patients screened, 28 were recruited. Patients were randomly divided into ozone-autohemotherapy group (14) and control group (14). The procedure consisted in a daily double-treatment with systemic Oxygen-ozone administration for 7 days. All patients were treated with ad interim best available therapy. The primary outcome was delta in the number of patients requiring orotracheal-intubation despite treatment. Secondary outcome was the difference of mortality between the two groups. Moreover, hematological parameters were compared before and after treatment. No differences in the characteristics between groups were observed at baseline. As a preliminary report we have observed that one patient for each group needed intubation and was transferred to ITU. No deaths were observed at 7-14 days of follow up. Thirty-day mortality was 8.3% for ozone group and 10% for controls. Ozone therapy did not significantly influence inflammation markers, hematology profile, and lymphocyte subpopulations of patients treated. Ozone therapy had an impact on the need for the ventilatory support, although did not reach statistical significance. Finally, no adverse events related to the use of ozone-autohemotherapy were reported.

224597,Comparative and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 epidemic interventions in Chinese provinces,2021,"The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has the potential to accelerate scientific research for Alzheimer's disease (AD). iPSCs are therefore increasingly considered for AD modeling and drug development. Nevertheless, most of the work conducted so far has mainly focused on iPSC models from patients with familial AD (fAD), while actually sporadic AD (sAD) is more prevalent and represents over 90% of the AD cases in the population. The development of more sAD models is therefore key for studying this multifactorial disorder. In fact, probing the unique genomes of sAD patients and their interaction with AD-associated environmental factors could contribute to a better understanding of this disease. However, initial iPSC-based models for sAD have shown a high degree of variability and inconsistencies in terms of AD hallmarks. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have been conducted for sAD so far. In addition, we critically assess important sources of variability related to the model in addition to those that might be explained by the heterogeneous nature of sAD. These considerations might aid in developing more consistent iPSC models of sAD, which could help in developing a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.","Riemens, R J M; Kenis, G; van den Beucken, T",Neurobiol Learn Mem,,106

To study such cooperative communication, we introduce Robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Natural Language (RobotSlang), a benchmark of 169 natural language dialogs between a human Driver controlling a robot and a human Commander providing guidance towards navigation goals. In each trial, the pair first cooperates to localize the robot on a global map visible to the Commander, then the Driver follows Commander instructions to move the robot to a sequence of target objects. We introduce a Localization from Dialog History (LDH) and a Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) task where a learned agent is given dialog and visual observations from the robot platform as input and must localize in the global map or navigate towards the next target object, respectively. RobotSlang is comprised of nearly 5k utterances and over 1k minutes of robot camera and control streams. We present an initial model for the NDH task, and show that an agent trained in simulation can follow the RobotSlang dialog-based navigation instructions for controlling a physical robot platform.

While all governments have struggled to respond to the pandemic, it is now becoming clear that some political leaders have performed much better than others. Among the worst performing are those that have risen to power on populist agendas, such as in the United States, Brazil, Russia, India, and the United Kingdom. Populist leaders have tended to: blame ""others"" for the pandemic, such as immigrants and the Chinese government; deny evidence and show contempt for institutions that generate it; and portray themselves as the voice of the common people against an out-of-touch 'elite.' In our short commentary, focusing on those countries with the most cases, we find that populist leaders appear to be undermining an effective response to COVID-19. Perversely, they may also gain politically from doing so, as historically populist leaders benefit from suffering and ill health. Clearly more research is needed on the curious correlation of populism and public health. Notwithstanding gaps in the evidence, health professionals have a duty to speak out against these practices to prevent avoidable loss of life.","McKee, Martin; Gugushvili, Alexi; Koltai, Jonathan; Stuckler, David",Int. j. health policy manag,,106

We use real-time data on the spread of Covid-19, governmental lockdown policies, and battle events to study the causal short-term effect of the pandemic on armed conflict. Our results suggest that both the spread of Covid-19 and lockdown policies exhibit a global Null effect with considerable regional heterogeneity.

Main outcome was defined as the cumulative number of cases of Covid-19 in the 14 days following the date when > 10 cumulative cases were reported. Negative binomial mixed effect models were applied to estimate the associations between the outcome and long-term exposure to air pollution at the regional level (PM10, PM2.5), after adjusting for relevant regional and country level covariates and spatial correlation.

227129,"Developing countries, markets, and the coronavirus: two challenges",2020,"(1) Background: Indoor air pollution can affect the well-being and health of humans Sources of indoor pollution with particulate matter (PM) are outdoor particles and indoor causes, such as construction materials, the use of cleaning products, air fresheners, heating, cooking, and smoking activities In 2017, according to the Global Burden of Disease study, 1 6 million people died prematurely because of indoor air pollution The health effects of outdoor exposure to PM have been the subject of both research and regulatory action, and indoor exposure to fine particles is gaining more and more attention as a potential source of adverse health effects Moreover, in critical situations such as the current pandemic crisis, to protect the health of the population, patients, and staff in all areas of society (particularly in indoor environments, where there are vulnerable groups, such as people who have pre-existing lung conditions, patients, elderly people, and healthcare professionals such as dental practitioners), there is an urgent need to improve long-and short-term health Exposure to aerosols and splatter contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and blood produced during dental procedures performed on patients rarely leads to the transmission of infectious agents between patients and dental health care staff if infection prevention procedures are strictly followed On the other hand, in the current circumstances of the pandemic crisis, dental practitioners could have an occupational risk of acquiring coronavirus disease as they may treat asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients Consequently, an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection could occur in dental offices, both for staff that provide dental healthcare and for other patients, considering that many dental procedures produce droplets and dental aerosols, which carry an infectious virus such as SARS-CoV-2 (2) Types of studies reviewed and applied methodology: The current work provides a critical review and evaluation, as well as perspectives concerning previous studies on health risks of indoor exposure to PM in dental offices The authors reviewed representative dental medicine literature focused on sources of indoor PM10 and PM2 5 (particles for which the aerodynamic diameter size is respectively less than 10 and 2 5 µm) in indoor spaces (paying specific attention to dental offices) and their characteristics and toxicological effects in indoor microenvironments The authors also reviewed representative studies on relations between the indoor air quality and harmful effects, as well as studies on possible indoor viral infections acquired through airborne and droplet transmission The method employed for the research illustrated in the current paper involved a desk study of documents and records relating to occupational health problems among dental health care providers In this way, it obtained background information on both the main potential hazards in dentistry and infection risks from aerosol transmission within dental offices Reviewing this kind of information, especially that relating to bioaerosols, is critical for minimizing the risk to dental staff and patients, particularly when new recommendations for COVID-19 risk reduction for the dental health professional community and patients attending dental clinics are strongly needed (3) Results: The investigated studies and reports obtained from the medical literature showed that, even if there are a wide number of studies on indoor human exposure to fine particles and health effects, more deep research and specific studies on indoor air pollution with fine particles and implications for workers’ health in dental offices are needed As dental practices are at a higher risk for hazardous indoor air because of exposure to chemicals and microbes, the occupational exposures and diseases must be addressed, with special attention being paid to the dental staff The literature also documents that exposure to fine particles in dental offices can be minimized by putting prevention into practice (personal rotection barriers such as masks, gloves, and safety eyeglasses) and also keeping indoor air clean (e g , high-volume evacuation, the use of an air-room-cleaning system with high-efficiency particulate filters, and regularly maintaining the air-conditioning and ventilation systems) These kinds of considerations are extremely important as the impact of indoor pollution on human health is no longer an individual issue, with its connections representing a future part of sustainability which is currently being redefined These kinds of considerations are extremely important, and the authors believe that a better situation in dentistry needs to be developed, with researchers in materials and dental health trying to understand and explain the impact of indoor pollution on human health © 2021 by

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or &#8805;58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or ""other""), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between £15,000 and £74,999. US and UK participants' median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was ""highly effective"" in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public's knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.","Geldsetzer, Pascal",J Med Internet Res,,106

230523,The Impact of Prioritisation and Dosing Intervals on the Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination in Europe: An Agent-Based Cohort Model (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: With the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, online teaching time has been extended continuously. The changes in teaching methods, teaching conditions, and teaching environment have brought great pressure and difficulties in adjustment to teachers, which have led to a series of physical and mental problems such as negativity, lack of confidence, and depression. The long-term accumulation of these problems makes teachers' turnover intention increasingly serious. METHODS: Based on these premises, this study took 449 high school teachers in China as research objects and investigated the relationship between high school teachers' resilience, job burnout, and turnover intention in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. RESULTS: The resilience of high school teachers had a significant negative predictive effect on job burnout and turnover intention (r = -0.473, p < 0.05; r = -0.283, p < 0.05), while job burnout had a significant positive predictive effect on turnover intention (r = 0.485, p < 0.05). At the same time, job burnout played a moderating role between resilience and turnover intention (&#955; = -0.019, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: This study suggests that society, schools, families, and individuals should adopt various strategies to improve teachers' adaptability and relieve teachers' job burnout, so as to solve the practical problem of teachers' high turnover intention and ensure continuous improvement and healthy development of online teaching.","Liu, Fei; Chen, Huaruo; Xu, Jie; Wen, Ya; Fang, Tingting",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,106

233886,A comparative study on wavelet denoising for high noisy CT images of COVID-19 disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. FINDINGS: If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. INTERPRETATION: Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

Therefore, they should have the essential competencies for approaching patients. Aims: The study aimed to identify essential competencies required for approaching patients with COVID-19. Methods: All postgraduate health professionals at the Syrian Virtual University SVU (n=28) were invited to participate in the study during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, resulting in 20 postgraduates accepting. The Delphi technique was adopted for identifying competencies in medical education and a virtual meeting was undertaken through the University Management System in order to provide instruction and create a list of competencies. Competency domains were divided into 'knowledge', 'skills', and 'attitudes' and were classified into four categories: etiology, assessment and diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Results: Fifty-two essential competencies were identified; 7 competencies on etiology, 7 related to assessment and diagnosis, 34 related to management, and 4 related to prognosis. Conclusion: It is hoped that the identified competencies would help health professionals to deliver the best health care for COVI-19 patients, as well as help policy-makers to support comprehensive training programmes that can equip health professionals with the required competencies to fight the pandemic.","Dashash, Mayssoon; Almasri, Bashar; Takaleh, Eman; Halawah, Alaa Abou; Sahyouni, Amal",East Mediterr Health J,,106
235301,Analysis of Impact of Goods and Services Tax on Indirect Taxes of Karnataka State,2020,"This paper develops and analyzes optimization models for rapid detection of viruses in large contact networks. In the model, a virus spreads in a stochastic manner over an undirected connected graph, under various assumptions on the spread dynamics. A decision maker must place a limited number of detectors on a subset of the nodes in the graph in order to rapidly detect infection of the nodes by the virus. The objective is to determine the placement of these detectors so as to either maximize the probability of detection within a given time period or minimize the expected time to detection. Previous work in this area assumed that the detectors are perfectly reliable. In this work, it is assumed that the detectors may produce false-negative results. In computational studies, the sample average approximation method is applied to solving the problem using a mixed-integer program and a greedy heuristic. The heuristic is shown to be highly efficient and to produce high-quality solutions. In addition, it is shown that the false-negative effect can sometimes be ignored, without significant loss of solution quality, in the original optimization formulation.","Agrawal, Sudesh K.; Hasenbein, John J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07788v1.pdf,106
235333,Anti-Asian violence and US imperialism,2020,"A large repertoire of IgA is produced by B lymphocytes with T-independent and T-dependent mechanisms useful in defense against pathogenic microorganisms and to reduce immune activation. IgA is active against several pathogens, including rotavirus, poliovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. It protects the epithelial barriers from pathogens and modulates excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases. An early SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral response is dominated by IgA antibodies responses greatly contributing to virus neutralization. The lack of anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgA and secretory IgA (sIgA) might represent a possible cause of COVID-19 severity, vaccine failure, and possible cause of prolonged viral shedding in patients with Primary Antibody Deficiencies, including patients with Selective IgA Deficiency. Differently from other primary antibody deficiency entities, Selective IgA Deficiency occurs in the vast majority of patients as an asymptomatic condition, and it is often an unrecognized, Studies are needed to clarify the open questions raised by possible consequences of a lack of an IgA response to SARS-CoV-2.","Quinti, Isabella; Mortari, Eva Piano; Fernandez Salinas, Ane; Milito, Cinzia; Carsetti, Rita",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,106
235454,The usefulness of the narrow band imaging (NBI) in decision-making process regarding second look procedure (SL) in laryngeal cancer follow-up after transoral laser microsurgery,2020,"Physiological fibrinolysis under normal conditions progresses slowly, in contrast to coagulation which is triggered rapidly to stop bleeding and defend against microbial invasion. Methods to detect fibrinolysis abnormalities are less simple and poorly standardized compared with common coagulation tests. Fibrinolysis can be accelerated by preparing euglobulin from plasma to reduce endogenous inhibitors, or by adding plasminogen activators to normal plasma. However, these manipulations complicate interpretation of results and diagnosis of a ""fibrinolysis deficit."" Many observational studies on antigen levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, zymogen or active enzyme have been published. However, conclusions are mixed and there are clear problems with harmonization of results. Viscoelastic methods have the advantage of being rapid and are used as point-of-care tests. They also work with whole blood, allowing the contribution of platelets to be explored. However, there are no agreed protocols for applying viscoelastic methods in acute care for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis or to direct therapy. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the dangers of associated coagulopathy provide new challenges. A common finding in hospitalized patients is high levels of D-dimer fibrin breakdown products, indicative of ongoing fibrinolysis. Well-established problems with D-dimer testing standardization signal that we should be cautious in using results from such tests as prognostic indicators or to target therapies.","Longstaff, Colin",Hamostaseologie,,106
235455,Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in Brazil by a generalized SEIR model,2020-05-22,"Almost half of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are estimated to be inaccurately reported by patients, inconsistently recorded in medical records, or not measured due to coding errors inherent to administrative claims. This retrospective observational study aimed to develop an algorithm capable of detecting acute COPD exacerbations (AECOPD) in healthcare claims and estimate costs associated with AECOPD over a 12-month period. Commercial and Medicare Advantage healthcare plan members (&#8805;40 years old) with evidence of COPD were identified from US healthcare-claims database. To refine the algorithm detecting AECOPD in claims data, sensitivity and positive-predictive value calculations were performed to compare AECOPD identification in healthcare claims versus medical charts. Analyses were also performed to examine total exacerbation-related costs for events identified with the new claims algorithm plus events missed. The final algorithm had a sensitivity of 84.9%, with a positive-predictive value of 67.5%. Medical records were abstracted for 402 patients. In the overall sample of healthcare claims (n = 243,998), the algorithm detected &#8805;1 AECOPD event in 61.3% of patients. The mean cost per patient during an AECOPD episode, identified by the final algorithm, was USD 6,760 (n = 301), with an incremental average cost of USD 607 (n = 122) to 'unobserved' episodes (not reported in claims data) among the chart sample. After multivariate modeling, predicted yearly exacerbation costs translated to USD 1.12 billion per 100,000 patients (USD 12,000 per patient), with 35.76 million associated with unobserved exacerbations. While the final algorithm warrants further validation and study, these findings highlight unobserved AECOPD and their economic burden.","Stanford, Richard H; Engel-Nitz, Nicole M; Bancroft, Timothy; Essoi, Breanna",COPD,,106

237187,Applications of 3D Printing Technology to Address COVID-19-Related Supply Shortages,2020,"COVID-19 vaccines are critical for ending the COVID-19 pandemic; however, current data about vaccination coverage and safety in pregnant women are limited. Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant women of reproductive age, and are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth (1-4). Pregnant women are eligible for and can receive any of the three COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States via Emergency Use Authorization.* Data from Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaboration between CDC and multiple integrated health systems, were analyzed to assess receipt of &#8805;1 dose (first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or a single dose of the Janssen [Johnson & Johnson] vaccine) of any COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, receipt of first dose of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine (initiation), or completion of a 1- or 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination series. During December 14, 2020-May 8, 2021, a total of 135,968 pregnant women were identified, 22,197 (16.3%) of whom had received &#8805;1 dose of a vaccine during pregnancy. Among these 135,968 women, 7,154 (5.3%) had initiated and 15,043 (11.1%) had completed vaccination during pregnancy. Receipt of &#8805;1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy was highest among women aged 35-49 years (22.7%) and lowest among those aged 18-24 years (5.5%), and higher among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (24.7%) and non-Hispanic White (White) women (19.7%) than among Hispanic (11.9%) and non-Hispanic Black (Black) women (6.0%). Vaccination coverage increased among all racial and ethnic groups over the analytic period, likely because of increased eligibility for vaccination and increased availability of vaccine over time. These findings indicate the need for improved outreach to and engagement with pregnant women, especially those from racial and ethnic minority groups who might be at higher risk for severe health outcomes because of COVID-19 (4). In addition, providing accurate and timely information about COVID-19 vaccination to health care providers, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age can improve vaccine confidence and coverage by ensuring optimal shared clinical decision-making.","Razzaghi, Hilda; Meghani, Mehreen; Pingali, Cassandra; Crane, Bradley; Naleway, Allison; Weintraub, Eric; Kenigsberg, Tat039; Yana, A; Lamias, Mark J; Irving, Stephanie A; Kauffman, Tia L; Vesco, Kimberly K; Daley, Matthew F; DeSilva, Malini; Donahue, James; Getahun, Darios; Glenn, Sungching; Hambidge, Simon J; Jackson, Lisa; Lipkind, Heather S; Nelson, Jennifer; Zerbo, Ousseny; Oduyebo, Titilope; Singleton, James A; Patel, Suchita A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,106
237398,A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission in a tertiary hospital and assessment of the effects of different intervention strategies,2020,"Purpose: In response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have transitioned to online instruction. With learning promising to be online, at least in part, for the near future, instructors may be thinking of providing online collaborative learning opportunities to their students who are increasingly isolated from their peers because of social distancing guidelines. This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.","Sankaranarayanan, Sreecharan; Kandimalla, Siddharth Reddy; Cao, Mengxin; Maronna, Ignacio; An, Haokang; Bogart, Chris; Murray, R.

We aimed to determine if the antiplatelet effect of aspirin may mitigate risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and venous thromboembolism in COVID-19. We evaluated 22,072 symptomatic patients tested for COVID-19. Propensity-matched analyses were performed to determine if treatment with aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) affected thrombotic outcomes in COVID-19. Neither aspirin nor NSAIDs affected mortality in COVID-19. Thus, aspirin does not appear to prevent thrombosis and death in COVID-19. The mechanisms of thrombosis in COVID-19, therefore, appear distinct and the role of platelets as direct mediators of SARS-CoV-2-mediated thrombosis warrants further investigation.","Sahai, Aditya; Bhandari, Rohan; Godwin, Matthew; McIntyre, Thomas; Chung, Mina K; Iskandar, Jean-Pierre; Kamran, Hayaan; Hariri, Essa; Aggarwal, Anu; Burton, Robert; Kalra, Ankur; Bartholomew, John R; McCrae, Keith R; Elbadawi, Ayman; Bena, James; Svensson, Lars G; Kapadia, Samir; Cameron, Scott J",Vasc Med,,106
238377,Impact of intervention on the spread of COVID-19 in India: A model based study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Reconstruction of long segmental tracheal defects is difficult because no ideal tracheal substitutes are currently available. Tracheal allotransplantation maintains cartilage and epithelium viability but requires immunosuppression because of epithelial immunogenicity. We aimed to obtain an epithelium-decellularized allograft that maintains cartilage viability and to evaluate long-term outcomes of such allografts implanted on dog backs without immunosuppressants. METHODS: Twenty-five tracheas harvested from mongrel dogs were used to explore the period of epithelium decellularization by combined use of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and an organ preservation solution and to assess the chondrocyte viability and immunogenicity of the tracheas after decellularization. Sixteen epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts and 10 fresh tracheal segments (6 cm long) were implanted in 26 beagles for durations of 10 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were used to evaluate the morphology, viability, and immune rejection of the allografts. Safranin-O staining was used to detect glycosaminoglycans. RESULTS: The epithelium disappeared after 24 hours of decellularization. At 72 hours, almost no nuclei remained in the mucosa, while the mean survival rate of chondrocytes was 88.1%. Histological analysis demonstrated that the allograft retained intact tracheal rings and viable cartilage after heterotopic implantation for 1 year, with no immunological rejection. There were no significant differences in the glycosaminoglycan contents among the implanted epithelium-decellularized allografts. CONCLUSIONS: Epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts with chondrocyte viability can be achieved by combined use of a detergent and organ preservation solution, which showed satisfactory cartilage viability and structural integrity after long-term heterotopic transplantation. Further studies on orthotopic transplantation are needed to assess the feasibility of allografts in reconstructing long segmental tracheal defects.","Cui, Pengcheng; Liu, Pengfei; Li, Shuqin; Ma, Ruina",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,106

238881,Complex Network Modelling of Origin–Destination Commuting Flows for the COVID-19 Epidemic Spread Analysis in Italian Lombardy Region,2021,"The well-being movement in medical education has been underway for over a decade. It seems appropriate to examine and evaluate these efforts to support the mental health needs of learners, faculty, and staff as medicine and medical education evolve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. To date, most interventions intended to promote well-being have focused on individual strategies rather than environmental drivers of distress, and the primary offerings have comprised strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Responses to this programming from medical learners have primarily ranged from ambivalence to resentment, with many feeling that the programming failed to adequately address their particular needs and the challenges they were experiencing. In this commentary, the author challenges the assumption that well-being per se should be the ideal target or goal. Learners and faculty may be better served by considering other goals-those that do not focus directly on well-being but that are instead foundational for well-being in that they directly address the challenges that students, residents, and faculty are facing. In other words, goals and associated interventions would focus on the experience of school and work rather than focusing primarily on encouraging healthy practices outside of school and work. The author proposes using the lens of satisfaction through which to view and assess progress toward well-being, increasing satisfaction within 3 interconnected domains: (1) school and/or work, (2) self, and (3) life in general. Attention to these domains may be more likely to produce improvements in well-being that have been sought for years but that remain elusive.","Slavin, Stuart",Acad Med,,106

Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus. METHOD: This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications. CONCLUSION: Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results. Our study supports the hypothesis that though it seldom actually occurs, in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible.","Ghema, K; Lehlimi, M; Toumi, H; Badre, A; Chemsi, M; Habzi, A; Benomar, S",,,106

241129,Spatial modeling of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh,2021,"Parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly challenging, with parents having to meet various demands simultaneously. An increase in adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has been widely predicted, but empirical evidence is still scarce. This study aimed to (1) generate representative data on pandemic-related stress, parental stress, general stress, parental subjective and mental health, and the occurrence of ACEs; (2) identify risk factors for an increase in ACEs, and (3) provide qualitative data on parents' experiences. A representative survey was conducted in Germany in August 2020 with 1024 parents of underage children (Mage = 41.70, 50.9% female). More than 50% of parents reported being stressed by social distancing and the closure of schools and childcare facilities. Parental stress increased significantly during the pandemic (d = 0.21). Subgroups of parents also reported very high levels of depressive symptoms (12.3%) and anxiety (9.7%). Up to one-third of the sample reported ACEs in the child's lifetime. In this group, 29.1% reported an increase in children witnessing domestic violence during the pandemic, and 42.2% an increase verbal emotional abuse. These families were characterized by higher parental stress, job losses, and younger parent and child age. Positive aspects of the pandemic related primarily to personal or family life (e.g. slower pace of life, increase in family time). While some parents coped well, a particularly negative pattern was observed in a subgroup of families that experienced an increase in ACEs. Parental stress emerged as important target point for interventions addressing the negative sequelae of the pandemic.","Calvano, Claudia; Engelke, Lara; Di Bella, Jessica; Kindermann, Jana; Renneberg, Babette; Winter, Sibylle M",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,106

242818,Need for ethical framework to guide mass testing for asymptomatic covid-19,2020,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their outstanding ability to be used in different sectors and serve in difficult and dangerous areas. Moreover, the advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence have increased the use of UAVs in various applications and solutions, such as forest fires detection and borders monitoring. However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) with UAVs introduces several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which restricts their on-board computation. In this work, we present a strategy aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained UAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions. The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy that gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is general enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as well as for all CNN types organized into the pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or based on residual blocks (e.g., ResNet).","Dhuheir, Marwan; Baccour, Emna; Erbad, Aiman; Sabeeh, Sinan; Hamdi, Mounir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04648v1.pdf,106

244570,The short-term impacts of Coronavirus quarantine in Sao Paulo: the health-economy trade-offs,2021,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 pandemic has been affecting whole world by increasing morbidity and mortality rate day by day. Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with Covid-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus proinflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen Covid-19 patients at high risk of worsening. METHODS: Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score= SOFA], MuLBSTA Score (Multilobular infiltration, Hypo-Lymphocytosis, Bacterial coinfection, Smoking history, hyper-Tension, and Age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). RESULTS: In our study, mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: According to results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors those emphasize the use of Anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors those enhance the use of Anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects or no success to antiviral treatment.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, WHO COVID-19 databases from inception to 15/06/2020 and medRxiv. No language restriction. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and GRADE framework were utilised to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence. PROSPERO CRD42020188421. RESULTS: Seventy-two articles (59 cohort studies with 17,950,989 participants, 13 ecological studies; 54 US-based, 15 UK-based; 41 peer-reviewed) were included for systematic review and 45 for meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low: median NOS 7 of 9 (interquartile range 6-8). Compared to White ethnicity, unadjusted all-cause mortality was similar in Black (RR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.83-1.08]) and Asian (RR: 0.99 [0.85-1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR: 0.69 [0.57-0.84]). Age- and sex-adjusted risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR: 1.38 [1.09-1.75]) and Asian (HR: 1.42 [1.15-1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR: 1.14 [0.93-1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these associations to non-significance: Black (HR: 0.95 [0.72-1.25]); Asian (HR: 1.17 [0.84-1.63]); Hispanic (HR: 0.94 [0.63-1.44]). Subgroup analyses showed a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risk. CONCLUSIONS: This review could not confirm a certain ethnicity as an independent poor prognostic factor for COVID-19.

Yet, previous research reveals that cranberry growers have mixed attitudes about the anthropogenic roots of climate change, with many being skeptical. Building on the researchers' analysis of the personal and ecological conditions that affect climate change attitudes among cranberry growers, this paper examines the effect that key actors in the growers' social networks have on those attitudes. Through statistical analysis of survey data and content analysis of two important cranberry newsletters, the paper finds that cranberry growers' perceived importance of two key cranberry growing institutions, the ""sociopolitically focused"" Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association and the ""technically focused"" University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, as well as connections to other cranberry growers, is associated in nuanced ways with growers' climate change attitudes. Drawing on the sociological theory of ""social capital,"" the paper examines how these social ties to key actors/institutions may result in greater threat perception or worry about climate change. It then considers how ""green ties,"" if harnessed and supported by these important actors in the cranberry grower network, might significantly mitigate climate change in the future.","Gareau, Brian J; Huang, Xioarui; Pisani Gareau, Tara; DiDonato, Sandra",Clim Change,,106

Design/methodology/approach A case study of a charity was conducted. The financial resilience framework (Barbera et al., 2017) was applied to explore how accounting contributes to charities' capacity to cope with crises. Findings The results show how the accounting practices of budgeting, forecasting and performance reporting (financial and nonfinancial), as well as ""accounting talk,"" form part of the anticipatory and coping capacities that provided the charity the financial resilience to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. Practical implications The paper evidences the important role accounting plays in establishing financial resilience to help charities cope with crises, particularly the importance of having accounting practices established prior to a crisis and accounting information forming part of managers' discussions. The study also demonstrates that financial reserves have an important buffering capacity role. Originality/value This is the first paper to examine the role of accounting within a charity during an economic crisis. The authors explore the role of accounting in shaping a charity's financial resilience and demonstrate the applicability of the financial resilience framework to a sudden, unexpected crisis such as COVID-19.

250971,Nanotechnology-Based Approach to Combat Pandemic COVID 19: A Review,2021,"COVID-19 has killed more than 500,000 people worldwide and more than 60,000 in Brazil. Since there are no specific drugs or vaccines, the available tools against COVID-19 are preventive, such as the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, lockdowns, and mass testing. Such measures are hindered in Brazil due to a restrict budget, low educational level of the population, and misleading attitudes from the federal authorities. Predictions for COVID-19 are of pivotal importance to subsidize and mobilize health authorities' efforts in applying the necessary preventive strategies. The Weibull distribution was used to model the forecast prediction of COVID-19, in four scenarios, based on the curve of daily new deaths as a function of time. The date in which the number of daily new deaths will fall below the rate of 3 deaths per million - the average level in which some countries start to relax the stay-at-home measures - was estimated. If the daily new deaths curve was bending today (i.e., about 1250 deaths per day), the predicted date would be on July 5. Forecast predictions allowed the estimation of overall death toll at the end of the outbreak. Our results suggest that each additional day that lasts to bend the daily new deaths curve may correspond to additional 1685 deaths at the end of COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil (R2 = 0.9890). Predictions of the outbreak can be used to guide Brazilian health authorities in the decision-making to properly fight COVID-19 pandemic.","Moreau, Vitor Hugo",Braz J Microbiol,,106

This study was conducted over four months between 10 March 2020 and 15 July 2020 at the University of Health Sciences department at the Abdulhamid Han Training and Research Hospital Dental Services in Turkey.Sample selection A total of 137 patients were included in this study taken from a cohort of 1,516 patients with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test. In order to meet the inclusion criteria, patients must have been referred to the dental outpatient department and have a dental panoramic tomogram available for examination.Data analysis A new radiographic staging tool was developed by the authors, informed by previous tools. Following radiographic analysis, participants were allocated to a DD Stg (0-3). Multiple statistical analyses were conducted on the data including Pearson correlation analysis, Spearman correlation analysis and a multiple regression analysis.Results Those participants in DD Stg 3 were significantly older than the other groups; those in DD Stg 2 and 3 had significantly higher presence of chronic disease and evidence of more carious teeth. Those in DD Stg 2 and 3 had a statistically higher number of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 when compared to those in DD Stg 0 and 1, with DD Stg 3 having the highest number overall as well as having a significantly higher mortality rate. Furthermore, those in DD Stg 0 had fewer symptoms associated with COVID-19 compared to the other groups.Conclusions The results show there may be a remarkable association between severity of COVID-19 symptoms and oral health; however, care must be taken when interpreting these results as age is clearly a serious confounding factor and no clinical examination was undertaken.","Kalsi, Hasneet K; Carr, Andrew",Evid Based Dent,,106
252006,Is it time for dermatologists to review our professional consumer-brand relationships?,2020,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has attracted much attention to study its possible presence and airborne transmission. The possibility of COVID-19 airborne transmission in indoor environments is debatable. The present study examined the concentration of viral RNA-containing particles produced directly or indirectly by breathing or coughing of confirmed COVID-19 patients or by carriers without symptoms. Some studies do not accept this method of transmission (COVID-19 airborne transmission). The present study aimed to measure the possible exposure of health care personnel to SARS-CoV-2 particles that may have been suspended in the air to respond to the hypothesis of COVID-19 airborne transmission. Airborne particle sampling was performed using impingement method based on NIOSH (chapter BA) and ASHRAE. Selection of sampling sections was in line with the WHO guidelines. The samples were analyzed using RT-PCR technique. Based on the given results, airborne particles of COVID-19 may present in the air and affect the health of hospital personnel. In fact, the analysis of gene expression in ambient conditions and thereby aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through air is possible and may lead to occupational exposure of health care personnel. Furthermore, it was found that airborne emission of COVID-19 through the breathing zone of patients, particularly in ICU wards with confirmed cases of COVID-19, may be higher than in other ICU wards. Also, the demonstrated results showed that there is a possibility of reaerosolization (reintroduction) of previously airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles into the atmosphere due to health care personnel frequently walking between different wards and stations of ICU.","Yarahmadi, R; Bokharaei-Salim, F; Soleimani-Alyar, S; Moridi, P; Moradi-Moghaddam, O; Niakan-Lahiji, M; Darvishi, M-M; Golmahammadi, S; Mousavi, S A J; Ebrahimi, H; Ashtarinezad, A; Farshad, A-A; Jonidi-Jafari, A; Kiani, S J; Garshasbi, S; Mehrzadi, S",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),,106

Cholera has affected many populations in history and still remains a significant burden in developing countries. The main transmission route was thought to be predominantly through contaminated drinking water. However, revisiting the historical data collected during the Copenhagen 1853 cholera outbreak allowed us to re-evaluate the role of drinking-water transmission in a city-wide outbreak and reconsider some critical transmission routes, which have been neglected since the time of John Snow.

As such, developing rapid and accurate immunodiagnostic methods for the identification of infected persons is needed. Here, we proposed a simple but sensitive on-site testing method based on spike protein-conjugated quantum dot (QD) nanotag-integrated lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) to simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG in human serum. Advanced silica-core@dual QD-shell nanocomposites (SiO2@DQD) with superior luminescence and stability were prepared to serve as fluorescent nanotags in the LFA strip and guarantee high sensitivity and reliability of the assay. The performance of the SiO2@DQD-strip was fully optimized and confirmed by using 10 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 10 negative samples from patients with other respiratory diseases. The practical clinical value of the assay was further evaluated by testing 316 serum samples (114 positive and 202 negative samples). The overall detection sensitivity and specificity reached 97.37% (111/114) and 95.54% (193/202), respectively, indicating the huge potential of our proposed method for the rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons and asymptomatic carriers.","Wang, Chongwen; Shi, Dawei; Wan, Nan; Yang, Xingsheng; Liu, Haifeng; Gao, Huixia; Zhang, Minli; Bai, Zikun; Li, Dingchen; Dai, Erhei; Rong, Zhen; Wang, Shengqi",Analyst,,106

253684,Transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak and effectiveness of government interventions: A data-driven analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated mandatory e-learning in medical and nursing education. How far are developing countries like India (with wide socioeconomic and cultural diversity) geared up for this challenge remains unexplored. At this critical juncture, we aim to evaluate if online teaching methods are as feasible, acceptable, and effective as in-class teaching for medical/nursing students. OBJECTIVES: The questionnaire captured: (1) practicability/feasibility of online classes, (2) health issues from online classes, (3) current methods for e-teaching, and (4) student attitudes and preferences. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTINGS: Population-based study in India. PARTICIPANTS: Nursing and medical undergraduate students (I-IV year). METHODOLOGY: The online questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical and nursing colleges across India. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p < 0.0001), Wi-Fi (p < 0.0001), dedicated room (p < 0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p < 0.0001). Class duration >4 h/day (p < 0.0001), each class >40 min (p < 0.009) and pre-existing health issues (p < 0.0001) predicted the occurrence headache, eyestrain, anxiety, neck/back pain, and sleep disturbance. Power-point presentation was the most widely (80%) used method of teaching. Only 30% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3-6 classes/day, each class <40 min, 10-20 min break between classes and interactive sessions. CONCLUSION: There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/medical students in India. There should be guidelines (number of classes/day, length of each class, break between classes, curriculum, etc) to improve the retention capacity in students and reduce health issues. Continuous feedback from teachers and students will be required to make e-learning effective.","Singh, Hemant Kumar; Joshi, Arvind; Malepati, Raghavi N; Najeeb, Shaista; Balakrishna, Pavithra; Pannerselvam, Naresh Kumar; Singh, Yashwant Kumar; Ganne, Pratyusha",Nurse Educ Today,,106

Thus, a panel-based analysis comparing high wage (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Saskatchewan) and low wage provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfound land/Lab, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec) is employed for the Canadian case within the study period from 1981 to 2019. We analyze the long-term and short-term effects of MW on household consumption using the Dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag techniques of the Pooled Mean Group, Dynamic Fixed Effects, and Mean Group estimators. Results show that the long-term impact of MW on household consumption is positive in both the low- and high-wage provinces. The short-term effect is negative in both wage groups, but not significant for the low-wage group. This offers significant debate on the relevance of the MW towards economic stabilization and consumption-led growth.","Sabokkhiz, Leila Fatma Guven Lisaniler Nwaka Ikechukwu D.",Sustainability,,106

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) programmes require unique coordinated processes that are currently experiencing multiple disruptions and are guided by rapidly evolving protocols. We present a series of recommendations for TAVI programmes to adapt to the new demands, based on recent evidence and the international expertise of nurse leaders and collaborators in this field. Although recommended in most guidelines, the uptake of the role of the TAVI programme nurse is uneven across international regions. COVID-19 is further highlighting why a nurse-led central point of coordination and communication is a vital asset for patients and programmes. We propose an alternative streamlined evaluation pathway to minimize patients' pre-procedure exposure to the hospital environment while ensuring appropriate treatment decision and shared decision-making. The competing demands created by COVID-19 require vigilant wait list management, with risk stratification, telephone surveillance and optimized triage and prioritization. A minimalist approach with close scrutiny of all parts of the procedure has become an imperative to avoid any complications and ensure patients' accelerated recovery. Lastly, we outline a nurse-led protocol of rapid mobilization and reconditioning as an effective strategy to facilitate safe next-day discharge home. As the pandemic abates, TAVI programmes must facilitate access to care without compromising patient safety, enable hospitals to manage the competing demands created by COVID-19 and establish new processes to support patients living with valvular heart disease.","Lauck, Sandra; Forman, Jacqueline; Borregaard, Britt; Sathananthan, Janarthanan; Achtem, Leslie; McCalmont, Gemma; Muir, Douglas; Hawkey, Marian C; Smith, Amanda; Højberg Kirk, Bettina; Wood, David A; Webb, John G",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,,106

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide guidance on this process through the development of the Health utility Application Tool (HAT). METHODS: We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews with Canadian stakeholders from reimbursement bodies, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry to identify current practices and perspectives of the application of the health utility literature to CUAs. An online survey with international members of the general health economics and outcomes research community was also conducted to gather opinions on key concepts. RESULTS: Based on the themes emerging from the interviews and online questionnaire, the HAT includes questions prompting investigators to consider the following constructs: similarity of the clinical condition in the health utility study and the CUA; similarity of health utility study participant demographics and the demographics of the CUA's target population; similarity of the health state descriptions in the health utility study and the CUA; and the method of assigning utility weights. Considerations of transparency prompted additional items, including: means by which the health utility study was identified; type of respondents; study design; and measure used to collect health utility estimates. CONCLUSION: The HAT is intended to guide the evaluation of the applicability of published health utilities for a CUA, thus promoting transparency and accountability in the selection of model inputs.","Zoratti, Michael J; Chan, Kelvin K W; Husereau, Don; Krahn, Murray; Levine, Mitchell; Thabane, Lehana; Xie, Feng",Pharmacoeconomics,,106

However, conventional learning (CL) has cost, time, and space constraints. This study aimed to evaluate whether laypersons who completed instructor-led distance learning (DL) acquired a level of CPR skill comparable to that achieved via CL training. METHODS: This randomized controlled study recruited students from 28 Korean high schools who were randomized to complete instructor-led DL or CL training. The CL training involved classroom-based face-to-face training, whereas the instructor-led DL training was provided online using a videoconferencing system. RESULTS: The study enrolled 62 students who were randomized to the CL group (31 participants) or the DL group (31 participants). Relative to the CL group, the DL group achieved remarkably similar results in terms of most CPR variables. In addition, the DL group had a significant improvement in the mean compression depth (before: 46 mm [interquartile range: 37-52 mm] vs. after: 49 mm [interquartile range: 46-54 mm], p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Instructor-led DL can be a suitable alternative to CL for providing CPR training to laypersons. In settings like the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face CL is not practical, DL may be a useful tool for delivering CPR training.","Han, Sangsoo; Park, Hye Ji; Nah, Sangun; Lee, Eun Hae; Lee, Hyun Ji; Park, Ju Ok; Lee, Choung Ah",PLoS One,,106

We describe CD64, CD18, and CD11a leukocytes expression in three children with SARSCoV2 infection and compare it with three cases of Kawasaki Disease. METHODS: Three children were studied after informed consent obtained from their parents or legal guardians. Their blood samples were collected in sterile EDTA at room temperature or refrigerated at 4°C and analyzed within 24 hours. Expressions were measured in monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. At least 10 000 events were recorded for each sample. The intensity of CD64, CD18, and CD11a surface expression were measured as mean fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units (MFI). They were compared with three previous cases of KD. RESULTS: The median CD64, CD18 and CD11a MFI expression in PIMS-TS versus KD cases are described in Figure 1. The CD64 and the CD11a expression on neutrophils and monocytes are higher. The CD11a in CD8 Lymphocytes is higher too.

Accelerated screening was used; data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second. Data was organized into themes based on perioperative phase of care. Principal FindingsThirty unique sets of recommendations were identified. None reported methods for systematically searching or selecting evidence to be included. Four were updated following initial publication. For induction and airway management, most recommended minimizing personnel and having the most experienced anesthesiologist perform tracheal intubation. Significant congruence was observed amongst recommendations that discussed personal protective equipment. Of those that discussed tracheal intubation methods, most (96%) recommended video laryngoscopy, while discordance existed regarding use of flexible bronchoscopy. Intraoperatively, 23% suggested specific anesthesia techniques and most (63%) recommended a specific operating room for patients with COVID-19. Postoperatively, a minority discussed extubation procedures (33%), or care in the recovery room (40%). Non-technical considerations were discussed in 27% and psychological support for healthcare providers in 10%. ConclusionRecommendations for perioperative airway management of patients with COVID-19 overlap to a large extent. However, we also identified significant differences. This may reflect the absence of a coordinated response towards studying and establishing best-practices in perioperative patients with COVID-19.

260018,A fractal kinetics SI model can explain the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A low-vision assessment (LVA) is critical in developing a vision rehabilitation plan. A remotely delivered LVA that replicates a standard in-clinic assessment may bridge the gap for patients not accessing care due to the limited quantity and distribution of low-vision providers. Within an LVA, an accurate and consistent assessment of refraction error is an essential component. No system has currently been validated for the purposes of a remote LVA. The purpose of this study was to validate a commercially available portable refraction approach in a low-vision population. METHODS: Low-vision patients (n = 26) or normally sighted patients (n = 25) underwent a refraction assessment using the Adaptica® 2WIN autorefractor, adaptor scope (Kaleidos) and VisionFit phoropter portable refraction devices, as well as a standard autorefractor (Huvitz) and phoropter (Haag-Streit). Refraction data between systems and populations were compared using intraclass correlations. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the differences between devices. RESULTS: Spherical equivalent values were found to be reproducible between standard and experimental autorefraction devices (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.8) in both low-vision and normally sighted groups. Similarly, manifest refraction was highly consistent (ICC > 0.8) between devices in all groups. The Bland-Altman plots showed clinically acceptable mean differences of 0.701 between autorefraction methods and -0.116 between manifest refraction methods. DISCUSSION: The 2WIN/VisionFit system can reliably generate refraction values across a spectrum of errors in normally sighted and visually impaired people, and would be feasible to deliver remotely.","Curtis, Rachel; Hazari, Hassan; Eden, Karen; Hopman, Wilma M; Irrcher, Isabella; Bona, Mark D",J Telemed Telecare,,106
260038,Sixty seconds on . . . covid-19 sniffer dogs,2020,"Surveillance of tuberculosis is one of the oldest disease surveillance systems in the world. This article briefly reviews its history, describes its methods and main results, with a specific focus on low- and middle-income countries, and underlines its main challenges and future prospects. Surveillance of tuberculosis started more than two centuries ago with the recording of tuberculosis mortality in England and Wales. After Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus, repeated tuberculin surveys were implemented to monitor infection, and case notification of active disease was progressively established during the 20th century. Because treatment of tuberculosis disease is the key intervention to stop transmission, monitoring of treatment outcome and more recently of drug resistance became integral parts of tuberculosis surveillance. At global level, the World Health Organization (WHO) is publishing a global TB report annually since 1997. Reports present data notified by each country as well as global estimates. Estimates of tuberculosis incidence are based on case notification adjusted by various correction factors, or on derivation from results of tuberculosis prevalence surveys, e.g. in India. In 2018, 10.1 million cases of tuberculosis are estimated to have occurred, among which about 0.5 million were resistant to rifampicin, and an estimated 1.5 million patients died. While global estimates are useful to raise public awareness and attract public and private funding, their uncertainty make them less useful to guide national policies. The backbone of tuberculosis surveillance at national and subnational level is the case notification. Newly diagnosed cases of active disease, whether new or recurrent, are reported with their key characteristics (age, sex, case category, HIV co-infection, drug resistance), and treatment outcomes are reported after scheduled treatment termination. All countries follow internationally standardized definitions. Incidence rates are compared by time to observe trends, by place to compare geographical areas, and by patient's characteristics to identify high-risk groups. The laboratory plays an essential role, since the surveillance of bacteriologically confirmed cases allows the most reliable comparisons, and because of the importance of the identification of drug resistance. The number of patients examined for tuberculosis diagnosis is also a key indicator to monitor case-finding activities. Tuberculosis surveillance is today among the most performant surveillance systems for infectious diseases. The two major changes currently observed are the move from paper-based registers to individual computerized surveillance databases and the multiplication of indicators for documenting progress towards tuberculosis elimination. There is a risk that implementation of these changes be followed by a loss in data quality. All efforts should be made to accompany these changes with adequate quality control. This will only be possible if health care workers are actively involved in the process of data production and analysis.","Schwoebel, Valérie",Indian J Tuberc,,106

260230,Covid-19 chemoprophylaxis: Ethics of prevention based on anecdotal evidence,2020,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from COVID-19 outbreak shows that individuals with specific chronic diseases are at higher risk of severe prognosis after infection. Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16-64, 65-79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.","Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Decarli, Adriano; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia",Vaccine,,106

In this paper, we apply the proposed model to a dataset consisting of letters to test whether the activity of writing a letter can be distinguished from the alternative activity of reading a letter based on the location of the fingermarks on the letters. An experiment was conducted in which participants were asked to read a letter and write a letter as separate activities on A4- and A5-sized papers. The fingermarks on the letters were visualized, and the resulting images were transformed into grid representations. A binary classification model was used to classify the letters into the activities of reading and writing based on the location of the fingermarks in the grid representations. Furthermore, the limitations of the model were studied by testing the influence of the length of the letter, the right- or left-handedness of the donor and the size of the paper with an additional activity of folding the paper. The results show that the model can predict the activities of reading or writing a letter based on the fingermark locations on A4-sized letters of right-handed donors with 98 % accuracy. Additionally, the length of the written letter and the handedness of the donor did not influence the performance of the classification model. Changing the size of the letters and adding an activity of folding the paper after writing on it decreased the model's accuracy. Expanding the training set with part of this new set had a positive influence on the model's accuracy. The results demonstrate that the model proposed by de Ronde, van Aken, de Puit and de Poot (2019) can indeed be applied to other two-dimensional items on which the disputed activities would be expected to lead to different fingermark locations. Moreover, we show that the location of fingermarks on letters provides valuable information about the activity that is carried out.","de Ronde, Anouk; van Aken, Marja; de Poot, Christianne J; de Puit, Marcel",Forensic Sci Int,,106

BCG vaccine induces expressions of the gene that are involved in the antiviral innate immune response against viral infections with long-term maintenance of BCG vaccine-induced cellular immunity. COVID-19 cases are reported very much less in the countries with universal BCG vaccination policies such as India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Israel, Japan, etc. as compared to without BCG implemented countries such as the USA, Italy, Spain, Canada, UK, etc. BCG vaccine provides protection for 50-60 years of immunization, so the elderly population needs to be revaccinated with BCG. Several countries started clinical trials of the BCG vaccine for health care workers and elderly people.

261851,Handwashing Behavior of Chinese Population during the COVID-19 Epidemic,2020,"AIM: The COVID-19 quarantine closed many mental health services. Emerging adults with pre-existing mood or anxiety disorders were of concern for worsening symptoms. We sought to demonstrate a method for monitoring mental health status of a group of patients with reduced access to their usual mental health services during quarantine. METHODS: A total of 326 patients enrolled in the First-Episode Mood and Anxiety Program in London, Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in online questionnaires regularly. Patients were flagged for high level of risk based on depression scores, suicidal ideation and worsening in anxiety, depression or quality of health. All patients were also asked if they wanted contact with a clinician. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen (35%) patients completed at least one questionnaire. Thirty were flagged based on scores; 37 (32.5%) participating patients requested help. Participants who were flagged for concerning scores were younger, more likely to be on the wait list for treatment, to have been laid off from work and have more functional impairment. Participants requesting support had higher symptom scores for depression and lower scores on quality of health. CONCLUSIONS: The process utilized here identified patients at risk and in need of clinical support in the context of pandemic quarantine. It provided an accessible avenue for invited patients to communicate both symptom status and need for contact. Such a process can provide valuable monitoring during times when the usual communications between patients and health care providers is compromised and clinician time is limited. It is easily implemented.","Osuch, Elizabeth; Demy, Jazzmin; Wammes, Michael; Tremblay, Paul; Vingilis, Evelyn; Carter, Chlöe",Early intervention in psychiatry (Online),,106

263805,651 Moisturizer prevents skin barrier damage induced by prolonged face mask usage,2021,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are causing a number of human and animal diseases because of their zoonotic nature such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses can infect respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous systems of human, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many wild animals. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerging respiratory virus and is causing CoVID-19 with high morbidity and considerable mortality. All CoVs belong to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, characterised by club-like spikes on their surfaces and large RNA genome with a distinctive replication strategy. Coronavirus have the largest RNA genomes (~26-32 kilobases) and their expansion was likely enabled by acquiring enzyme functions that counter the commonly high error frequency of viral RNA polymerases. Non-structural proteins (nsp) 7-16 are cleaved from two large replicase polyproteins and guide the replication and processing of coronavirus RNA. Coronavirus replicase has more or less universal activities, such as RNA polymerase (nsp 12) and helicase (nsp 13), as well as a variety of unusual or even special mRNA capping (nsp 14, nsp 16) and fidelity regulation (nsp 14) domains. Besides that, several smaller subunits (nsp 7- nsp 10) serve as essential cofactors for these enzymes and contribute to the emerging ""nsp interactome."" In spite of the significant progress in studying coronaviruses structural and functional properties, there is an urgent need to understand the coronaviruses evolutionary success that will be helpful to develop enhanced control strategies. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure, function, and interactions of coronaviruses RNA synthesizing machinery and their replication strategies.","Rohaim, Mohammed A; El Naggar, Rania F; Clayton, Emily; Munir, Muhammad",Microb Pathog,,106
264682,The Percussive Effects of Pandemics and Disaster,2020,"Unchecked inflammation can result in severe diseases with high mortality, such as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). MAS and associated cytokine storms have been observed in COVID-19 patients exhibiting systemic hyper-inflammation. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family, is elevated in both MAS and COVID-19 patients, and its level is known to correlate with the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. IL-18 binds its specific receptor IL-1 Receptor 5 (IL-1R5, also known as IL-18 Receptor alpha chain), leading to the recruitment of the co-receptor, IL-1 Receptor 7 (IL-1R7, also known as IL-18 Receptor beta chain). This heterotrimeric complex then initiates downstream signaling, resulting in systemic and local inflammation. Here, we developed a novel humanized monoclonal anti-IL-1R7 antibody to specifically block the activity of IL-18 and its inflammatory signaling. We characterized the function of this antibody in human cell lines, in freshly obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and in human whole blood cultures. We found that the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly suppressed IL-18-mediated NF&#954;B activation, reduced IL-18-stimulated IFNÎ³ and IL-6 production in human cell lines, and reduced IL-18-induced IFNÎ³, IL-6 and TNF&#945; production in PBMCs. Moreover, the anti-IL-1R7 antibody significantly inhibited LPS- and Candida albicans-induced IFNÎ³ production in PBMCs, as well as LPS-induced IFNÎ³ production in whole blood cultures. Our data suggest that blocking IL-1R7 could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to specifically modulate IL-18 signaling, and may warrant further investigation into its clinical potential for treating IL-18-mediated diseases, including MAS and COVID-19.","Li, Suzhao; Jiang, Liqiong; Beckmann, Karsten; Højen, Jesper Falkesgaard; Pessara, Ulrich; Powers, Nicholas E; de Graaf, Dennis M; Azam, Tania; Lindenberger, Jared; Eisenmesser, Elan Z; Fischer, Stephan; Dinarello, Charles A",J Biol Chem,,106

In the setting of virtual interviews for residency in 2020, the online availability of program information is of heightened importance. We sought to assess how academic versus community-based general surgery residency programs compared with respect to certain details on their websites. METHODS: A total of nâ¯=â¯268 surgery residency programs were investigated. Our database of website characteristics included: direct link to residency website from the American Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) program page, resident research requirement, listing of residents' publications, availability of residents' demographic information, program alumni information, board pass rates, attrition rate, detail of educational/academic activities, residents' evaluation methods, diversity, and mentorship. Inter-group analyses between academic and community-based programs were performed using Pearson's Chi-squared test. RESULTS: Academic and community-based general surgery residency program websites were compared based on twelve (12) different parameters. Statistically significant differences were observed for eight of these comparisons: direct website access from ACGME (pâ¯=â¯0.007), research highlighted (p < 0.001), resident research requirement (pâ¯=â¯0.002), resident demographic information available (p=0.004), alumni information (pâ¯=â¯0.005), resident evaluation methods (pâ¯=â¯0.016), diversity (p < 0.001), and mentorship (pâ¯=â¯0.012). Across these domains, academic programs had more information available on their websites than the community programs did. The program websites did not differ significantly based on the frequency of mentioning resident publications, board pass rate, attrition rate, or resident education. CONCLUSION: Many general surgery programs are lacking detailed information on their websites. The amount of website information available on general surgery residency programs differs when comparing academic and community-based programs.","Chinedozi, Ifeanyi; Martin, Olivia; Hays, Nicole; Kubicki, Natalia S; Kidd-Romero, Sarah; Kavic, Stephen M",J. surg. educ,,106

METHODS: A retrospective descriptive case-series study conducted at a large University-hospital in northern Italy, an area severely hit by the epidemic. RESULTS: Between 23 February and 14 May 2020, 4160 (52%) COVID-19 and 3778 (48%) non-COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. COVID-19 admissions peaked in the second half of March, a period characterized by an extremely high mortality rate (27.4%). The number of admissions in 2020 was similar to 2019, but COVID-19 patients gradually occupied all available beds. Comparison between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 admissions in 2020 revealed significant differences concerning all age classes and gender. Specifically, COVID-19 patients were older, predominantly male, and exhibited more comorbidities. Overall, admissions for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in 2020 vs. 2019 dropped by approximately one third. Statistically significant reductions were observed for acute myocardial infarction (-78, -33.9%), cerebrovascular disease (-235, -41.5%), and cancer (-368, -31.9%). While the first two appeared equally distributed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, chronic NCDs were statistically significantly more frequent in the former, except cancer, which was less frequent in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of collateral damage to patients with other diseases should be an integral part of epidemic response plans.

Nurses are inexorably faced with this situation as part of the frontline hospital workers, likewise student nurses on clinical practice while on training. Objective: To assess readiness on resumption for clinical practice amidst coronavirus pandemic among Nursing students in South-West Nigeria. Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study that utilized a multistage sampling technique to select the respondents. Three-hundred respondents were recruited for the study. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0, descriptive statistics were presented in tables and charts while the hypotheses were tested with Chi-square at a significant level of p = 0.05. Results: The findings revealed that the mean and standard deviation of the respondents was 22.16± 3.11 years; 61.7% were ready for clinical practice, 92(30.7%) were ready to nurse coronavirus patients. There is a significant difference between nursing institutions and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.000. There is no significant difference between years of clinical exposure and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.594. Conclusion: This study revealed that though the students had a high level of readiness, only few are ready to practice in coronavirus wards, this could pose a challenge to future nurses.

This has led to an increase in the interest of studying relevant cardiovascular variables, in order to establish their association with clinical outcomes in this population. Objective: To describe the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers in disease caused by COVID-19. Methods: A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out in data bases that included PubMed, Google Scholar, Clinical Key, SciELO, using the key words, plain terms, and MeSH terms. Results: A total of 22 articles were chosen. They consisted of review articles on the subject, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, observational studies, and original articles published up until 13 May 2020. The majority of them described the changes in cardiac biomarkers and their relationship with the clinical outcome of patients COVID-19. Discussion: It was found that Troponin and Natriuretic Peptide behaved as independent risk factors for severe clinical compromise, requiring ventilatory or haemodynamic support, admission to ICU, and an increase in mortality. Conclusions: It is reasonable to recommend the use of these biomarkers in the risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 and an established cardiovascular disease.","Ocampo-Salgado, Carolina; Palacio-Uribe, Jorge; Duque-Ramírez, Mauricio; Orrego-Garay, María José",Rev.

268901,Advances in Technology to Address COVID-19,2020,"The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 is defined as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, fatigue, cough, breathing difficulty that may lead to respiratory distress; a small population of patients may have diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. The highest infection rate occurs in adults; however, neonates, children, and adolescents can also be infected. As the outbreak continues to spread worldwide, attention has switched toward determinants of clinical manifes- tations and disease severity. The situation surrounding the outbreak is rapidly evolving and the information and recommendations are changing as new information becomes available. This paper summarises the cur- rent findings (April 3,2020) from a systematic literature review on the current knowledge of COVID-19 in adolescents (10-19 years according to the WHO definition) and reports the preliminary epidemiological data stated by the Italian National Institute of Health.","De Sanctis, Vincenzo; Ruggiero, Leopoldo; Soliman, Ashraf T; Daar, Shahina; Di Maio, Salvatore; Kattamis, Christos",Acta Biomed,,106
269254,A quest for the origin of the uneven spread of Covid-19 cases,2021,"The rapid detection of ongoing outbreak - and the identification of causative pathogen - is pivotal for the early recognition of public health threats. The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases are linked to several determinants, both human factors - such as population density, travel, and trade - and ecological factors - like climate change and agricultural practices. Several technologies are available for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens [e.g. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)], and together with on line monitoring tools of infectious disease activity and behaviour, they contribute to the surveillance system for infectious diseases. Web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelling and epidemic intelligence methods represent crucial components for timely outbreak detection and rapid risk assessment. The study aims to integrate the current prevention and control system with a prediction tool for infectious diseases, based on regression analysis, to support decision makers, health care workers, and first responders to quickly and properly recognise an outbreak. This study has the intention to develop an infectious disease regressive prediction tool working with an off-line database built with specific epidemiological parameters of a set of infectious diseases of high consequences. The tool has been developed as a first prototype of a software solution called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS) and it had been established in two main steps, the database building stage and the software implementation stage (MATLAB® environment). The IDS has been tested with the epidemiological data of three outbreaks occurred recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in China (2002-2003), plague outbreak in Madagascar (2017) and the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2018). The outcomes are promising and they reveal that the software has been able to recognize and characterize these outbreaks. The future perspective about this software regards the developing of that tool as a useful and user-friendly predictive tool appropriate for first responders, health care workers, and public health decision makers to help them in predicting, assessing and contrasting outbreaks.","Baldassi, F; Cenciarelli, O; Malizia, A; Gaudio, P",J Epidemiol Glob Health,,106

Our key assumption was that the disease will change the active odour signature of the individuals just like other diseases (TBC, malaria, tumours, etc.). The pilot study was conducted in two places, based on the same protocolar methods, and it included four specially trained detection dogs in total. For the first phase of the project, we obtained 156 positive and 72 negative odour samples primarily from a hospital. Each detection dog involved in the study was imprinted with the smell samples of Covid-positive people. The first experiment only involved two dogs. With the other two dogs, the phase of imprinting a specific smell was longer, possibly because these dogs were burdened with previous training. During a presentation of 100 randomised positive samples, the experimental dogs showed a 95% reliability rate. Data from this pilot study show that specially trained dogs are able to detect and identify the odour samples of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.","Vlachova, Lenka; Hotovy, Gustav; Slechta, Jiri; Vana, Roman; Vokralova, Milena; Zeman, Jiri",,,106
269692,Dynamics of COVID-19 transmission with comorbidity: a data driven modelling based approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 started to spread globally since December 2019 from Wuhan, China. Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1st December 2019 and 3rd April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (&#8805;18 years) and paediatric (<18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran's Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05-81.80, I2 = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24-56.48, I2 = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59-18.32, I2 = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69-3.22, p<0.00001, I2 = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21-3.51, p<0.00001, I2 = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94-1.44, p = 0.16, I2 = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature. Prevalence and risk of low and medium-grade fevers were higher compared to high-grade fever.","Islam, Md Asiful; Kundu, Shoumik; Alam, Sayeda Sadia; Hossan, Tareq; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Hassan, Rosline",PLoS One,,106

As we learn more about the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the recognition that olfactory dysfunction is a key symptom of this disease process, there is a greater need than ever for evidence-based management of postinfectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide an evidence-based practical guide to the management of PIOD (including post-coronavirus 2019 cases) for both primary care practitioners and hospital specialists. METHODS: A systematic review of the treatment options available for the management of PIOD was performed. The written systematic review was then circulated among the members of the Clinical Olfactory Working Group for their perusal before roundtable expert discussion of the treatment options. The group also undertook a survey to determine their current clinical practice with regard to treatment of PIOD. RESULTS: The search resulted in 467 citations, of which 107 articles were fully reviewed and analyzed for eligibility; 40 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 11 of which were randomized controlled trials. In total, 15 of the articles specifically looked at PIOD whereas the other 25 included other etiologies for olfactory dysfunction.

271548,NewsCAP: Promoting menstrual period equity,2020,"Surface area and porosity are important physical properties of biochar, playing a crucial role in many biochar applications, such as wastewater treatment and soil remediation. The production of engineered biochar with highly porous structure and large surface area has received extensive attention. This paper comprehensively reviewed the effects of biomass and pyrolysis parameters on the surface area and porosity of biochar. The composition of biomass feedstock and pyrolysis temperature are the major influencing factors. It is suggested that the lignocellulosic biomass is an outstanding candidate, wood and woody biomass in particular. Besides, moderate temperatures (400-700 °C) are suitable for the development of the pore structure. Further improvement can be implemented by additional treatments. Activation is the most widely used and effective way to promote biochar surface area and porosity, especially the chemical activation. Enhancement can also be achieved by using other treatment methods, such as carbonaceous materials coating, ball milling, and templating. Future research should focus on upgrading or developing treatment technology to achieve enhanced functionality and porous structure of biochar simultaneously.","Leng, Lijian; Xiong, Qin; Yang, Lihong; Li, Hui; Zhou, Yaoyu; Zhang, Weijin; Jiang, Shaojian; Li, Hailong; Huang, Huajun",Sci Total Environ,,106

We evaluated whether adults aged 50 and older with caregiving roles are more likely to report reduced illness self-efficacy since the pandemic, and whether this link is exacerbated by a higher number of conditions. METHODS: Participants (105 caregivers and 590 noncaregivers) residing in Michigan (82.6%) and 33 other U.S. states completed one online survey between May 14 and July 9, 2020. RESULTS: Controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics, stressors related to COVID-19, and behavioral and psychosocial changes since the pandemic, caregivers were more likely than noncaregivers to report reduced illness self-efficacy when they had a higher number of chronic conditions. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of maintaining caregivers' self-care during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future public health crises.","Polenick, Courtney A; Lei, Lianlian; Zhou, Annie N; Birditt, Kira S; Maust, Donovan T",Aging Ment Health,,106

However, choosing a suitable travel destination during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging because the factors critical to the selection process are very different from those usually considered. Furthermore, without sufficient literature or data for reference, existing methods based on psychological analyses or mining past experiences may not be applicable. Consequently, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method—the calibrated piecewise-linear fuzzy geometric mean (FGM) approach—is proposed in this study for travel destination recommendation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, the critical factors that affect the selection of a suitable travel destination during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. Second, the accuracy and efficiency using existing fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) methods have been enhanced. The calibrated piecewise-linear FGM approach has been successfully applied to recommend suitable travel destinations to fifteen travelers for regional trips in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Toly Wang Yu-Cheng",Applied Soft Computing,,106

This study aims to present the production of three industrial lots under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) of the active antigen used to produce the pandemic influenza vaccine candidate against A(H7N9). These batches were characterized and evaluated for quality standards and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The average yield was 173.50 ± 7.88 µg/mL of hemagglutinin and all the preparations met all the required specifications. The formulated H7N9 vaccine is poorly immunogenic and needs to be adjuvanted with an oil in water emulsion adjuvant (IB160) to achieve a best immune response, in a prime and in a boost scheme.

275006,With hope in our hearts,2020,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has rapidly spread in humans, causing the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. Recent studies have shown that, similarly to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilises the Spike glycoprotein on the envelope to recognise and bind the human receptor ACE2. This event initiates the fusion of viral and host cell membranes and then the viral entry into the host cell. Despite several ongoing clinical studies, there are currently no approved vaccines or drugs that specifically target SARS-CoV-2. Until an effective vaccine is available, repurposing FDA approved drugs could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study we attempted to overcome the limitation of in silico virtual screening by applying a robust in silico drug repurposing strategy. We combined and integrated docking simulations, with molecular dynamics (MD), Supervised MD (SuMD) and Steered MD (SMD) simulations to identify a Spike protein - ACE2 interaction inhibitor. Our data showed that Simeprevir and Lumacaftor bind the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein with high affinity and prevent ACE2 interaction.","Trezza, Alfonso; Iovinelli, Daniele; Santucci, Annalisa; Prischi, Filippo; Spiga, Ottavia",Sci Rep,,106

276492,Covid Musings,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the initial few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, two distinct strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified (L and S strain) based on a tightly linked SNP between two widely separated nucleotides at location 8782 (ORF1ab T8517C) and position 28,144 (ORF8: C251T, codon S84L). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Type Specific Primer based one step RT-PCR (TSP-PCR) test to distinguish the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for viral genome sequencing, was developed. The study also analyzed 18,221 whole genome sequences (WGS) available up to April 2020 to know the prevalence of L and S type of strains. Phylogenetic and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome with nearest animal and human coronaviruses were analyzed using MEGA X and SimPlot version 3.5.1 software respectively. RESULTS: The rapid TSP-PCR distinguished the L and S type strains of SARS-CoV-2 by amplifying a specific 326 bp and 256 bp fragment of the L and S type strain respectively. The test was used to analyzed 120 random SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Assam, India among which 118 were found to be of L-type strains only. On analysis of 18,221 WGS, it was found that L type was the predominant strain with an overall prevalence â¼90%. However, pockets of high prevalence of S-type strains (>35%) were still in circulation in Washington region in April 2020. The study did not detect any significant recombination events between closely related coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: TSP-based PCR for identification of circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, will add in rapid identification of strains of COVID-19 pandemic to understand the spread of the virus, its transmissibility and adaptation into human population. Though, the S-type strains have decreased drastically across the globe since April 2020, the role of TSP-PCR in geographical niches where such strains are still prevalent may help in rapidly distinguishing the strains and study its evolution.","Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Bali, Nargis K",Indian J Med Microbiol,,106

In the area of labor markets, the paper argues that Covid will compel most East Asian states to find new ways of utilizing their older workers and to increase the flexibility of their labor markets. In the area of mass migration, the paper examines possible scenarios having to do with North Korean state collapse and urban-rural migration trends in China.

281379,Virtual Pathology Elective Provides Uninterrupted Medical Education and Impactful Pathology Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Infiltrative rain gardens can add retention capacity to sewersheds, yet factors contributing to their capacity for detention and redistribution of stormwater runoff are dynamic and often unverified. Over a four-year period, we tracked whole-system water fluxes in a two-tier rain garden network and assessed near-surface hydrology and soil development across construction and operational phases. The monitoring data provided a quantitative basis for determining effectiveness of this stormwater control measure. Based on 233 monitored warm-season rainfall events, nearly half of total inflow volume was detained, with 90 percent of all events producing no flow to the combined sewer. For the events that did result in flow to the combined sewer system, the rain garden delayed flows for an average of 5.5 h. Multivariate analysis of hydrologic fluxes indicated that total event rainfall depth was a predominant hydrologic driver for network outflow during both phases, with average event intensity and daily evapotranspiration as additional, independent factors in regulating retention in the operational phase. Despite sediment loads that can clog the rooting zone, and overall lower-than-design infiltration rates, tradeoffs among soil profile development and hydrology apparently maintained relatively high overall retention effectiveness. Overall, our study identified factors relevant to regulation of retention capacity of a rain garden network. These factors may be generalizable, and guide improvement of new or existing rain garden designs.","Shuster, William D; Darner, Robert A; Schifman, Laura A; Herrmann, Dustin L",,,106

However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and their institutions should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","Da, Ben L; Im, Gene Y; Schiano, Thomas D",Hepatology (Baltim.),,106
286443,Lifting mobility restrictions and the effect of superspreading events on the short-term dynamics of COVID-19,2020,"The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pathological pulmonary symptoms. Most efforts to develop vaccines and drugs against this virus target the spike glycoprotein, particularly its S1 subunit, which is recognised by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Here we use the in-house developed tool CaverDock to perform virtual screening against spike glycoprotein using a cryogenic electron microscopy structure (PDB-ID: 6VXX) and the representative structures of five most populated clusters from a previously published molecular dynamics simulation. The dataset of ligands was obtained from the ZINC database and consists of drugs approved for clinical use worldwide. Trajectories for the passage of individual drugs through the tunnel of the spike glycoprotein homotrimer, their binding energies within the tunnel, and the duration of their contacts with the trimer’s three subunits were computed for the full dataset. Multivariate statistical methods were then used to establish structure-activity relationships and select top candidate for movement inhibition. This new protocol for the rapid screening of globally approved drugs (4359 ligands) in a multi-state protein structure (6 states) showed high robustness in the rate of finished calculations. The protocol is universal and can be applied to any target protein with an experimental tertiary structure containing protein tunnels or channels. The protocol will be implemented in the next version of CaverWeb (https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/caverweb/) to make it accessible to the wider scientific community.","Pinto, Gaspar P.; Vavra, Ondrej Marques Sergio M.; Filipovic, Jiri Bednar David Damborsky Jiri",Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,,106

The commentary presented here sets out initial thoughts and explorations that have the potential to impact societies on a global scale and provides recommendations for a roadmap to consider new ways to think about the impact of health and wellbeing of older adults and their families. Additionally, this paper highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses of the aforementioned checklists and frameworks by examining the literature including the WHO age-friendly framework, the smart age-friendly ecosystem (SAfE) framework and the Blue Zones® checklists. We argue that gaps exist in the current literature and take a critical approach as a way to be inclusive of technology and the environments in which older adults live. This commentary contributes to the fields of gerontology, gerontechnology, anthropology, and geography, because we are proposing a roadmap which sets out the need for future work which requires multi- and interdisciplinary research to be conducted for the respective checklists to evolve.","Marston, Hannah R; Niles-Yokum, Kelly; Silva, Paula Alexandra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,106
288275,"Holy Death in the Time of Coronavirus: Santa Muerte, the Salubrious Saint",2020,"Objective: : A resilient health system plays a crucial role in pandemic preparedness and response. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has required all states parties to strengthen core capacities to respond to public health emergencies under the International Health Regulations (2005), the actions of most countries to combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has showed that they are not well-prepared. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the health system resilience of selected countries and analyze their strategies and measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : This study selected five countries including the Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea), the U.K., and the U.S., based on the severity of the national epidemic, the geographical location, and the development level. Cumulative number of death cases derived from WHO COVID-19 dashboard was used to measure the severity of the impact of the pandemic in each country; WHO State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Reporting (SPAR) Scores and Global Health Security (GHS) Index were applied to measure the national health system resilience; and research articles and press materials were summarized to identify the strategies and measures adopted by countries during response to COVID-19. This study applied the resilient health systems framework to analyze health system resilience in the selected countries from five dimensions, including awareness, diversity, self-regulation, integration and adaptation. Results: : The SPAR Scores and GHS Index of the four developed countries, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the U.S. were above the global and regional averages; the SPAR Scores of Iran were above the global average while the GHI Index lain below the global average. In terms of response strategies, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. invested more health resources in the treatment of severe patients, while South Korea and Iran had adopted a strategy of extensive testing and identification of suspected patients. In terms of specific measures, all the five countries adopted measures such as restrictions on entry and international travel, closure of schools and industries, lockdown and quarantine. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of implementing these measures varied across countries, based on the response strategies. Conclusion: : Although SPAR Scores and GHS Index have evaluated the national core capacities for preparedness and response, the actions to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the fact that most countries still do not build resilient health systems in response to public health emergencies. Health system strengthening and health security efforts should be pursued in tandem, as part of the same mutually reinforcing approach to developing resilient health systems.","Wang, Zhebin; Duan, Yuqi; Jin, Yinzi; Zheng, Zhi-Jie",,,106

289360,Impending dog behaviour crisis following Covid-19 lockdown,2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2[SARS-CoV-2]) outbreak is now a pandemic, thousands of people now self-quarantined because of possible infection with the coronavirus, this situation makes telemedicine necessary as it can overcome geographical barriers, enlarge the size of the population served, and provide clinical support for patients online, however the outcomes of telemedicine have not yet evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological features and clinical symptoms of patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment at the online outpatient clinic of our hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, and to analyze the outcomes and advantages of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment and consultation services over COVID-19 concerns at the online outpatient clinic of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 24 to February 17, 2020, were collected. A retrospective analysis was performed on their epidemiological features, clinical symptoms, and preliminary outcomes. RESULTS: Online inquiry, consultation, and suggestions were provided over COVID-19 concerns for the patients. Meanwhile, the hospital offered offline non-contact drug delivery services following online ordering and payment. A total of 4,589 patients receiving remote diagnosis and treatment were recruited. The daily number of online outpatient visits first increased and then decreased, reaching the peak on January 28 when the daily number of online outpatient visits was 612. There were 1,940 males and 2,649 females (26.5%). The youngest was aged 78 days, and the eldest 85 years old. Most of the patients were aged 20 to 39 years old, and there were 3,714 patients in this age group, accounting for 80.9%. According to the statistics, most of the patients receiving online outpatient consultation over COVID-19 concerns came from Henan Province, and the number of such patients was 3,898, accounting for 84.9%. The number of patients from other provinces was 691, accounting for 15.1%. Based on the symptoms presented in the online outpatient consultation (one patient might be combined with more than one symptom), there were 2,383 patients with fever, 1,740 patients with cough, 796 patients with nasal obstruction, 503 patients with fatigue, and 276 patients with diarrhea. A total of 873 orders of non-contact drug delivery following online payment were completed. The daily number of such orders gradually stabilized after the initial steady increase. The median number of offline drug delivery orders was 36, and the interquartile range was 58. An online satisfaction survey was performed, and 985 responses were received. 966 respondents were satisfied, accounting for 98.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Remote diagnosis and treatment offered via the online outpatient consultation effectively reduce the burden on hospitals, prevent overcrowding, reduce the risk of cross-infection and relieve patients' anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak, which play an essential role in the pandemic management.","Liu, Luwen; Gu, Jianqin; Shao, Fengmin; Liang, Xinliang; Yue, Lixia; Cheng, Qiaomei; Zhang, Lianzhong",,,106

This investigation focused on defining the nature and frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a representative, cross-sectional sample of communities in Louisiana, USA. METHODS: A sample of 4778 adults from New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana were given a survey of symptoms and co-morbidities, nasopharyngeal swab to test for active infection (PCR), and blood draw to test for past infection (IgG). Odds ratios, cluster analysis, quantification of virus and antibody, and linear modelling were used to understand whether certain symptoms were associated with a positive test, how symptoms grouped together, whether virus or antibody varied by symptom status, and whether being symptomatic was different across the age span. RESULTS: Reported anosmia/ageusia was strongly associated with a positive test; 40.6% (93/229) tested positive versus 4.8% (218/4549) positivity in those who did not report anosmia/ageusia (OR 13.6, 95% CI 10.1-18.3). Of the people who tested positive, 47.3% (147/311) were completely asymptomatic. Symptom presentation clustered into three groups; low/no symptoms (0.4 ± 0.9, mean ± SD), highly symptomatic (7.5 ± 1.9) or moderately symptomatic (4.0 ± 1.5). Quantity of virus was lower in the asymptomatic versus symptomatic group (cycle number 23.3 ± 8.3 versus 17.3 ± 9.0; p < 0.001). Modelling the probability of symptoms showed changes with age; the highest probability of reporting symptoms was 64.6% (95% CI 50.4-76.5) at age 29 years, which decreased to a probability of 49.3% (95% CI 36.6-62.0) at age 60 years and only 25.1% (95% CI 5.0-68.1) at age 80 years. CONCLUSION: Anosmia/ageusia can be used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection from other illnesses, and, given the high ratio of asymptomatic individuals, contact tracing should include those without symptoms. Regular testing in congregant settings of those over age 60 years may help mitigate asymptomatic spread.","Feehan, Amy K; Fort, Daniel; Velasco, Cruz; Burton, Jeffrey H; Garcia-Diaz, Julia; Price-Haywood, Eboni G; Sapp, Eric; Pevey, Dawn; Seoane, Leonardo",Clin. microbiol. infect,,106

STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) Survey of PWID. METHODS: People who had ever injected psychoactive drugs were recruited to the UAM Survey by specialist drug/alcohol services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From June 2020, in addition to providing a dried blood spot sample and completing the UAM behavioural questionnaire, participants were asked to complete an enhanced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) questionnaire. Preliminary data are presented to the end of October and were compared with data from the 2019 UAM Survey, where possible. RESULTS: Between June and October, 288 PWID were recruited from England and Northern Ireland. One in nine (11%; 29/260) PWID reported testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Fifteen percent (26/169) reported injecting more frequently in 2020 than in 2019; cocaine injection in the preceding four weeks increased from 17% (242/1456) to 25% (33/130). One in five PWID (19%; 35/188) reported difficulties in accessing HIV and hepatitis testing, and one in four (26%; 47/179) reported difficulties in accessing equipment for safer injecting. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that PWID have experienced negative impacts on health, behaviours and access to essential harm reduction, testing and treatment services owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued monitoring through surveillance and research is needed to understand the subsequent impact of COVID-19 on blood-borne virus transmission in this population and on health inequalities.","Croxford, S; Emanuel, E; Ibitoye, A; Njoroge, J; Edmundson, C; Bardsley, M; Heinsbroek, E; Hope, V; Phipps, E",Public Health,,106
290704,"Agriculture, biology, and environment: Twenty first century challenges and opportunities",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised children and young people in the UK during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To describe patient/parent anxiety regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: 46 centres across the UK between 16 March and 4 July 2020. A weekly online questionnaire based on the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium-WHO Case Report Form was used to collect participant reported data on symptoms, test results, National Health Service attendance, hospital admission and impact on daily life. PARTICIPANTS: 1490 immunocompromised children, defined as those requiring an annual influenza vaccination due to their underlying condition or medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of SARS-CoV-2-like symptoms and patient/parent anxiety score. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks during the first wave of the pandemic, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in this large immunocompromised paediatric cohort (median age 11 years, 54.4% female). 110 symptomatic participants underwent a test for SARS-CoV-2; all were negative. 922 (67.4%) participants reported at least one symptom consistent with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period. 476 (34.8%) reported three or more symptoms. The most frequently reported symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, headache, nausea and muscle pain. SARS-CoV-2 testing during this period was performed on admitted patients only. 137 participants had their medication suspended or changed during the study period due to assumed COVID-19 disease risk. 62% reported high levels of anxiety (scores of 7-10 out of 10) at the start of the study, with anxiety levels remaining high throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were common, there were no positive tests in this large immunocompromised cohort. Symptom-based screening to facilitate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be helpful in these individuals. Patient/parent anxiety about SARS-CoV-2 infection was high.

Healthcare staff, especially nurses, experience a great deal of psychological distress during care of COVID-19 patients. Detecting factors that disturb nurses' mental health during care of these patients can help to reduce their psychological distress. Therefore, this study aimed to explore nurses' experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The present qualitative research was performed using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from March to May 2020. Participants in this study included the nurses caring for patients with COVID-19, and they were selected based on the purposeful sampling method. The data was collected through 20 phone call interviews and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis revealed 11 categories including death anxiety, anxiety due to the nature of the disease, anxiety caused by corpse burial, fear of infecting the family, distress about time wasting, emotional distress of delivering bad news, fear of being contaminated, the emergence of obsessive thoughts, the bad feeling of wearing personal protective equipment, conflict between fear and conscience, and the public ignorance of preventive measures. CONCLUSION: The data showed that the nurses experienced a variety of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19. Through proper planning by authorities, it is possible to manage the risk factors of mental health distress in nurses and improve their mental health status.","Galehdar, Nasrin; Kamran, Aziz; Toulabi, Tahereh; Heydari, Heshmatolah",BMC Psychiatry,,106

We aimed to independently evaluate the LabTurbo AIO 48 (all-in-one system) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative limit of detection (LOD) was assessed on both the LabTurbo AIO 48 and current standard detection system based on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using SARS-CoV-2 RNA control. Additional 125 primary clinical samples were assessed using both the protocols in parallel. RESULTS: The turnaround time from sample to results for 48 samples analyzed on LabTurbo AIO 48 was approximately 2.5 h, whereas that analyzed using the in-house RT-PCR protocol was 4.8 h. LabTurbo AIO 48 also demonstrated higher sensitivity than our reference RT-PCR assay, with a LOD of 9.4 copies/reaction.

A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as rewards, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.","Cui, Yuchen; Zhang, Qiping; Allievi, Alessandro; Stone, Peter; Niekum, Scott; Knox, W.

The Task Force set out to guide integrative oncology practitioners in providing effective and safe online consultations and treatments for quality-of-life-concerns and symptom management. Online treatments include manual, acupuncture, movement, mind-body, herbal, and expressive art therapies. METHODS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations employed a four-phase consensus process: (1) literature review and discussion among an international panel of SIO members, identifying key elements essential in an integrative oncology visit; (2) development, testing, and refinement of a questionnaire defining challenges and strategies; (3) refinement input from integrative oncology experts from 19 countries; and (4) SIO Executive Committee review identifying the most high-priority challenges and strategies. RESULTS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations address ten challenges, providing practical suggestions for online treatment/consultation. These include overcoming unfamiliarity, addressing resistance among patients and healthcare practitioners to online consultation/treatment, exploring ethical and medical-legal aspects, solving technological issues, preparing the online treatment setting, starting the online treatment session, maintaining effective communication, promoting specific treatment effects, involving the caregiver, concluding the session, and ensuring continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: The SIO Online Practice Recommendations are relevant for ensuring continuity of care beyond the present pandemic. They can be implemented for patients with limited accessibility to integrative oncology treatments due to geographic constraints, financial difficulties, physical disability, or an unsupportive caregiver. These recommendations require further study in practice settings.","Ben-Arye, Eran; Paller, Channing J; Lopez, Ana Maria; White, Shelley; Pendleton, Eva; Kienle, Gunver S; Samuels, Noah; Abbawaajii, Nuria; Balneaves, Lynda G",Support. care cancer,,106

In view of the challenges due to the lack of information and competencies in infection prevention and control at LTCFs, a group of experts, in collaboration with different public institutions, joined efforts with the purpose to update the guidelines in order to allow LTCFs face the pandemic and to contribute to the generation of said National Care System.","Mena-Madrazo, Jorge A; Sosa-Tinoco, Eduardo; Flores-Castro, Miguel; López-Ortega, Mariana; Gutiérrez-Robledo, Luis M",Gac Med Mex,,106

300780,Corona COVID-19 Spread- a Nonlinear Modeling and Simulation,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected most countries in the world. Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to enabling implementation of effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and lineage B/S, containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized 14 independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represented local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described for the country. Within this local transmission cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the Spike protein. This mutation represents a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space and may function as a molecular marker to follow any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results provide a general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts.IMPORTANCE Understanding the introduction, spread, and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations as well as the evolution of the pandemics is crucial to implement effective control strategies. In this work, we report that the initial virus strains introduced in Mexico came from Europe and the United States and that the virus was circulating locally in the country as early as mid-March. We also found evidence for early local transmission of strains with a H49Y mutation in the Spike protein, which could be further used as a molecular marker to follow viral spread within the country and the region.","Taboada, Blanca; Vazquez-Perez, Joel Armando; Muñoz-Medina, José Esteban; Ramos-Cervantes, Pilar; Escalera-Zamudio, Marina; Boukadida, Celia; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Isa, Pavel; Mendieta-Condado, Edgar; Martínez-Orozco, José A; Becerril-Vargas, Eduardo; Salas-Hernández, Jorge; Grande, Ricardo; González-Torres, Carolina; Gaytán-Cervantes, Francisco Javier; Vazquez, Gloria; Pulido, Francisco; Araiza-Rodríguez, Adnan; Garcés-Ayala, Fabiola; González-Bonilla, Cesar Raúl; Grajales-Muñiz, Concepción; Borja-Aburto, Víctor Hugo; Barrera-Badillo, Gisela; López, Susana; Hernández-Rivas, Lucía; Perez-Padilla, Rogelio; López-Martínez, Irma; Ávila-Ríos, Santiago; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo; Ramírez-González, José Ernesto; Arias, Carlos F",J. virol,,106
301138,Clinical features and laboratory diagnosis tool for emerging corona virus (COVID-19): a review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prognostic models to predict the risk of clinical deterioration in acute COVID-19 cases are urgently required to inform clinical management decisions. METHODS: We developed and validated a multivariable logistic regression model for in-hospital clinical deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or critical care, or death) among consecutively hospitalised adults with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who were prospectively recruited to the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC4C) study across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales. Candidate predictors that were specified a priori were considered for inclusion in the model on the basis of previous prognostic scores and emerging literature describing routinely measured biomarkers associated with COVID-19 prognosis. We used internal-external cross-validation to evaluate discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across eight National Health Service (NHS) regions in the development cohort. We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London). FINDINGS: 74â944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31â924 (43·2%) of 73â948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome. In internal-external cross-validation in the development cohort of 66â705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions. In held-out data from London (n=8239), the model showed a similarly consistent performance (C-statistic 0·77 [95% CI 0·76 to 0·78]; calibration-in-the-large 0·00 [-0·05 to 0·05]); calibration slope 0·96 [0·91 to 1·01]), and greater net benefit than any other reproducible prognostic model. INTERPRETATION: The 4C Deterioration model has strong potential for clinical utility and generalisability to predict clinical deterioration and inform decision making among adults hospitalised with COVID-19.

Methods: Univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed to identify prognosis-related hub ferroptosis-related genes and establish a prognostic model. Results: The authors established a novel clinical predictive model based on seven hub ferroptosis-related genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas training cohort (n = 374) that was verified in the testing cohort (n = 156) and the entire group (n = 530). Functional analysis indicated that several carcinogenic pathways were enriched. Tumor-infiltrating cells and immunosuppressive molecules were significantly different between the two risk groups. Conclusion: Collectively, the authors successfully constructed a novel ferroptosis-related risk signature that was significantly associated with the prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","Canxuan, Li; Dan, Long",Future oncol,,106
302095,Inferring the effectiveness of government interventions against COVID-19,2020,"From the beginning of 2020, an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), much of which is due to dysbalanced immune responses, resonates across the world. COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFNÎ³-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","Parackova, Zuzana; Bloomfield, Marketa; Klocperk, Adam; Sediva, Anna",J Leukoc Biol,,106

The impact of the disease on prevalent general surgical practice is uncertain and continues to evolve. The study aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 on general surgical practice in India and the future implications of the pandemic. A survey questionnaire was designed and electronically circulated 1 month after India entered a national lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic, amongst members of Indian Association of Gastro-intestinal Endo-surgeons (IAGES), a surgical association with nearly eight thousand members from across the country. Survey questions pertaining to pre-COVID era surgical practices, impact on current practice, and financial implications were asked. Responses were collected and statistically analyzed. One hundred fifty-three surgeons completed the survey, of which only 9.2% were women. Majority (41%) were into practice for more than 20 years; 36.6% were into private practice at multiple hospitals (free-lancers). Amongst the respondents, 41.8% had mainly laparoscopic practice with mean outpatient consultation of 26 patients/day and elective surgeries of 43 cases/month prior to lockdown. Post-lockdown, daily outpatient consults reduced to 4 patients per day, and 77% had not performed a single elective procedure. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) chemoprophylaxis was reported by 52% surgeons. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was used by 52% for all cases, while 71.5% stated there are insufficient guidelines for future surgical practice in terms of safety. A drop of more than 75% of their monthly income was experienced by 52% surgeons, while 22% faced 50-75% reduction. One third (33%) of respondents own a hospital and are expecting a monthly financial liability of 2.25 million rupees (nearly 30,000 US dollars). COVID-19 has led to a drastic reduction in outpatient and elective surgical practices. There is a definite need for guidelines regarding safety for future surgical practices and solutions to overcome the financial liabilities in the near future.","Nasta, Amrit Manik; Goel, Ramen; Kanagavel, Manickavasagam; Easwaramoorthy, Sundaram",Indian J Surg,,106

The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations and the NCD Roadmap created at the request of the Pacific Finance and Economic Ministers identify prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases as core priorities. Among the various risk factors responsible for the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), overweight and obesity are particularly of concern with the potential to negate many of the health benefits that have contributed to increased life expectancy. With the increase in childhood obesity across the region, it has become apparent that surveillance data remains a challenge; however, it is essential to inform the development of effective policies and strategies to tackle the challenge of childhood obesity in the Pacific region. RECENT FINDINGS: The paper highlights the paucity of childhood obesity surveillance data available in the Pacific region and how the absence of a standardised tool to collect this data makes it difficult to do comparative analysis between countries. Drawing on a global protocol and identifying the gaps that currently exist in the region, the paper aims to highlight opportunities via which childhood obesity surveillance data can be improved to monitor better childhood obesity across the Pacific region.","Ravuvu, Amerita; Waqa, Gade",Curr. obes. rep,,106

Factors that influence the heat exchange include the temperature and humidity of the air and the temperature of surfaces in contact with and around the infant. Neonatal thermoregulation has a different pattern as they have an immature thermoregulatory system. For this purpose, mathematical models can provide detailed insights for the heat transfer processes and its applications for clinical purposes. A new multi-compartment mathematical model of the neonatal thermoregulatory system is presented. The formulation of the model is based on the Pennes' bio-heat equation with suitable boundary and initial conditions. The variational finite element method has been employed to determine heat transfer and exchange in the biological tissues of premature infants. The results obtained in this paper have shown that premature infants are unable to maintain a constant core temperature and resemble the empirically obtained results, proving the validity and feasibility of our model.

Practicability was defined as the correct use of the self-test and the correct interpretation of the result. The correct use of self-test was conditioned by the presence of the control band after 15-min of migration. The correct interpretation of the tests was defined by the percent agreement between the tests results read and interpret by the participants compared to the expected results coded by the numbers and verified by trained observers. A total of 167 participants (52.7% female; median age, 35.8 years; 82% with post-graduate level) were enrolled, including 83 and 84 for usability and test results interpretation substudies, respectively. All participants (100%; 95% CI: 95.6-100) correctly used the self-test. However, 12 (14.5%; 95% CI: 8.5-23.6) asked for verbal help.

308819,Performance Improvement With Implementation of a Surgical Skills Curriculum,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus is the causative agent of COVID-19 disease and was first identified in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 spread globally with >28 million cases and 911,000 deaths recorded worldwide as of September 12, 2020. The Philippines reported the first case of community transmission on March 5, 2020, and despite the government imposing one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in Southeast Asia, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases still surged with >250,000 cases and 4,000 deaths reported as of September 12, 2020. It is important to estimate the burden and impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the military population since this can affect the military readiness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR testing was performed on the samples. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using sequences from 23 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from this study and sequences retrieved from GenBank and GISAID databases. RESULTS: From April 14 to August 15, 2020, a total of 12,432 specimens were tested with 763 (6%) unique individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. In the military population, majority of the patients who were tested (80%) and those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (86%) were male. Military and civilian status was available for 7,672 patients with 515/5,042 (10%) positive among military patients and 248/2,630 (9%) positive among civilian patients. Both military and civilian populations had the highest case counts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases in the 21- to 30- and 31- to 40-year-old age groups, while the 71- to 80-year-old age group had the highest proportion (18%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Sequencing analysis showed 19 different variants in the 23 genomes. Twenty of the 23 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1, 2 genomes were classified under clade GR/B1.1.28, and 1 genome was classified under Clade O/B.6. Twenty-two of the 23 sequences collected after June 25, 2020, contained the D614G mutation. CONCLUSION: We describe here the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing for military and civilian patients and personnel. The 21- to 30- and 31- to 40-year-old age groups had the highest case counts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases. Sequencing results showed the presence of the D614G mutation in the spike protein in a majority of specimens collected from the end of June to July 2020.","Velasco, John Mark; Navarro, Fatima Claire; Diones, Paula Corazon; Villa, Vicente; Valderama, Maria Theresa; Tabinas, Henry; Chua, Domingo; Rosa, Romulo Dela; Turao-Agoncillo, Melissa Monica; Timbol, John Carlo; Leonardia, Susie; Timbol, Maria Leanor; Klungthong, Chonticha; Chinnawirotpisan, Piyawan; Joonlasak, Khajohn; Manasatienkij, Wudtichai; Huang, Angkana; Jones, Anthony; Fernandez, Stefan",Mil. med,,106

310151,Evolution of COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2020,"With the recent approval of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines, functional and lasting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is currently under investigation as antibody levels in plasma were shown to decline during convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory, we evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in convalescent individuals. Here we report a longitudinal assessment of humoral immune responses on 32 donors up to 8 months post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity also declines rapidly when compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+ B cells which remain stable. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections and vaccine efficacy.","Anand, Sai Priya; Prévost, Jérémie; Nayrac, Manon; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gasser, Romain; Brassard, Nathalie; Laumaea, Annemarie; Gong, Shang Yu; Bourassa, Catherine; Brunet-Ratnasingham, Elsa; Medjahed, Halima; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Goyette, Guillaume; Gokool, Laurie; Morrisseau, Chantal; Bégin, Philippe; Martel-Laferrière, Valérie; Tremblay, Cécile; Richard, Jonathan; Bazin, Renée; Duerr, Ralf; Kaufmann, Daniel E; Finzi, Andrés",Cell Rep Med,,106

312590,Folgen von COVID-19 - das sieht der Kliniker,2021,"At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many medical students were removed from clinical duties and had their education put on hold. Some found novel ways to join efforts to respond to the pandemic. Georgetown University School of Medicine medical students created Medical Supply Drive (MSD or MedSupplyDrive), a 501(c)(3), on March 17, 2020, in response to the national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This article reviews the formation of a national response to the pandemic, the methods employed to distribute PPE, and the results of MSD's work from March 17, 2020, through June 20, 2020. A focus was placed on equitable distribution, both within local regions and on the national scale by distinguishing COVID-19 hotspots, including Native American reservations. As of June 20, over half a million items were donated, with 1,001 deliveries made to 423 hospitals, 182 clinics, 175 long-term care facilities, 25 homeless shelters, 32 public health departments, and 164 other facilities. From 46 states and the District of Columbia, 1,514 individuals volunteered, and 202 signed up as regional coordinators. MSD formed 2 international organizations, MedSupplyDrive UK and MedSupplyDrive Scotland, and established U.S.-based partnerships with 19 different PPE and aid organizations. MSD gained local, national, and international media attention with over 45 interviews conducted about the organization. While the pandemic temporarily disrupted formal medical education, MSD empowered medical students to actively learn about the needs of their communities and organize ways to address them, while incorporating these values into their professional identities. The 3-step framework this organization employed also provides a potential model for future disaster relief efforts in times of crisis. MSD hopes to motivate budding physicians to collaborate and play an active role in tackling public health inequities outside hospitals and within the communities students will one day serve.","Baker, Melissa L; Peesay, Tejasvi; Rooney, Allison; Sayyed, Adaah; Syed, Zuby",Acad. med,,106

Society must mitigate this impact by recognizing that COVID-19 can trigger people's fears of exacerbating an existing mental illness. A survey about COVID-19 for people with mental illness was developed. METHODS: Two hundred fourteen people responded to the survey, of whom 193 self-identified as living with a mental illness. RESULTS: Almost all participants living with a mental illness (98%) said they had at least one major concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62% said they had at least three major concerns. CONCLUSIONS: People living with a mental illness are very concerned about disruption of services, running out of medication, and social isolation during this pandemic. Providers and mental health services could address these fears by connecting with people living with mental illness through text messaging and social media.","Costa, Mark; Pavlo, Anthony; Reis, Graziela; Ponte, Katherine; Davidson, Larry",Psychiatr Serv,,106

Data on patients of European origin affected by COVID-19 are limited. METHODS: All consecutive patients aged &#8805;18 years, coming from North-East of Milan's province and admitted at San Raffaele Hospital with COVID-19, between February 25th and March 24th, were reported, all patients were followed for at least one month. Clinical and radiological features at admission and predictors of clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 500 patients admitted to the Emergency Unit, 410 patients were hospitalized and analyzed: median age was 65 (IQR 56-75) years, and the majority of patients were males (72.9%). Median (IQR) days from COVID-19 symptoms onset was 8 (5-11) days. At hospital admission, fever (&#8805; 37.5 °C) was present in 67.5% of patients. Median oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93% (range 60-99), with median PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 267 (IQR 184-314). Median Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score was 9 (IQR 4-16). More than half of the patients (56.3%) had comorbidities, with hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and chronic kidney failure being the most common. The probability of overall survival at day 28 was 66%. Multivariable analysis showed older age, coronary artery disease, cancer, low lymphocyte count and high RALE score as factors independently associated with an increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of COVID-19 patients of European origin, main risk factors for mortality were older age, comorbidities, low lymphocyte count and high RALE.","Ciceri, Fabio; Castagna, Antonella; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; De Cobelli, Francesco; Ruggeri, Annalisa; Galli, Laura; Conte, Caterina; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Poli, Andrea; Ambrosio, Alberto; Signorelli, Carlo; Bossi, Eleonora; Fazio, Maria; Tresoldi, Cristina; Colombo, Sergio; Monti, Giacomo; Fominskiy, Efgeny; Franchini, Stefano; Spessot, Marzia; Martinenghi, Carlo; Carlucci, Michele; Beretta, Luigi; Scandroglio, Anna Maria; Clementi, Massimo; Locatelli, Massimo; Tresoldi, Moreno; Scarpellini, Paolo; Martino, Gianvito; Bosi, Emanuele; Dagna, Lorenzo; Lazzarin, Adriano; Landoni, Giovanni; Zangrillo, Alberto",Clin Immunol,,106

The emergence and disappearance of this pathogen have brought questions regarding its source and evolution. Within the genome sequences of 281 SARS-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs), a ~430 bp genomic region (from 27 701 bp to 28 131 bp in AY390556.1) with regular variations was investigated. This ~430 bp region overlaps with the ORF8 gene and is prone to deletions and nucleotide substitutions. Its complexity suggested the need for a new genotyping method for coronaviruses related to SARS-similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARSr-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Bat SARSr-CoV presented 3 genotypes, of which type 0 is only seen in bat SARSr-CoV, type I is present in SARS in the early phase, and type II is found in all SARS-CoV-2. This genotyping also shows potential usage in distinguishing the SARS-similar coronaviruses from different hosts and geographic areas. This genomic region has important implications for predicting the epidemic trend and studying the evolution of coronavirus.","Chen, Shuaiyin; Zheng, Xin; Zhu, Jingyuan; Ding, Ronghua; Jin, Yuefei; Zhang, Weiguo; Yang, HaiYan; Zheng, Yingjuan; Li, Xin; Duan, Guangcai",J Infect Dis,,106

From April 2020 to December 2020 on the basis of the University Clinical Hospital No. 4 of the First Moscow State Medical University named I.M. Sechenov (Sechenov University) of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation 245 patients between the ages of 27 and 89 with SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia were treated. The mean age of the patients was 56.7 +/- 4.2 years. All patients participating in the study were divided by simple randomization into two groups. The volume of lesion of the lung parenchyma was assessed according to the data of computed tomography. All patients were treated for SARS-CoV-2 in a comprehensive manner in accordance with the temporary guidelines of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation with the mandatory prescription of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Assessment and correction of the hemostasis system in 177 patients (47.7%) of group 1 was carried out daily using local coagulation tests (LCT), including APTT, PT, TT, PTI, INR, Fibrinogen and D-dimer level. The second group included 128 patients (52.3%), who, in addition to local coagulation tests, used the integral coagulation test - the thrombodynamics test- to assess and correct the state of the hemostatic system. Assessment and correction of hemostasis were performed at the control points (1, 7, 14 days) of the study. Compared to LCT, the thrombodynamics test reliably more often revealed the state of hypercoagulability, which was promptly corrected by increased doses of LMWH in group 2. Positive dynamics of clinical symptoms were detected in patients of group 2 1.8 times more often than in group 1 (p&lt;0.05): fever and shortness of breath in group 2 decreased faster, the SpO2 index recovered more rapidly, especially in patients with severe hypoxia (with SpO2&lt;90), the number of patients with moderate and severe severity by the third point of the study in group 2 was 1.8 times less than in group 1 (p&lt;0.05). Severe forms of lung damage (CT-3 and CT-4) were detected in group 2 3.2 times less frequently (p &lt;0.01) compared with group 1, and the number of deaths was 3.3 times less frequent (p&lt;0.01) by the end of the study. The average bed-day in group 2 of patients (15+/-1.6 days) was 1.6 times shorter than in group 1 (24+/-7.2 days). Hemorrhagic complications were not recorded, despite the therapeutic doses of LMWH in patients of group 2. The severity of the condition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the dynamics of their symptoms depend on the state of microcirculation in the lungs and in the periphery and on the volume of thrombotic lesions. Anticoagulant therapy prescribed as early as possible in adequate therapeutic doses in patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated viral pneumonia made it possible to achieve positive treatment results. The use of the global coagulation thrombodynamics test has shown high efficiency for the timely assessment and correction of the state of the hemostasis system.","Krylov, A.; Khorobrykh, T.; Petrovskaya, A.; Khmyrova, S.; Agadzhanov, V.; Khusainova, N.",Georgian Medical News,,106
315913,The impact of COVID-19 on REI fellowship educational experience,2021,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a paradigm shift in global health, casting a previously niche academic discipline into a headline dominating field of research. However, accurate information on the delivery of global health education (GHE) at a university level is lacking. This study aims to assess current GHE practices in U.K. universities, by identifying the availability of dedicated global health qualifications, as well as the breadth of inclusion of GHE topics across university course content. Methods Universities selected were the top 25 recipients of MRC funding in 2015-2016, as well as universities who were included in previous iterations of the “Global Health League Table”. We used the Consortium of Universities for Global Health “GHE Competencies Toolkit” to identify the presence of global health content across university global health and other course offerings. Universities were additionally judged on opportunities available in global health and on the presence of sustainable partnerships. Results Our results showed that 20 universities (74%) offer a post-graduate global health related course, with 9 (33%) offering an undergraduate global health related course. 13 (48%) were identified as centers of global health excellence. Just 12 (44%) universities had registered sustainable partnerships with Tropical Health and Education Trust. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was identified as the top deliverer of GHE, with the Universities of Leicester and Exeter joint bottom. We were unable to standardize quality assessments in this iteration of the project, but the release of student feedback to future assessors would help to improve the reliability of this study methodology. Additionally, much of our data was based on information available online, and thus some aspects of degree courses not published publicly may not have been accounted for in our scoring. Conclusion Those institutions wishing to improve their delivery of GHE should consider the establishment of a postgraduate or undergraduate degree course. Breadth of global health content across curricular was a major discriminating factor between institutions, and we would advise universities to consider including more global health topics across their curricular - especially in light of the intersectional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Adrienne Quinn Matthew",Global Health Journal,,106
315976,A Commons for a Supply Chain in the Post-COVID-19 Era: The Case for a Reformed Strategic National Stockpile,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now brought major challenges to public health and economy globally since December 2019, which requires effective treatment and prevention strategies to adapt for the impact of the pandemic. We therefore explored the prognostic factors for patients with COVID-19 and the contribution of immunomodulatory therapy on COVID-19 outcome. Methods: From 1 Feb to 16 March 2020, consecutive cases with COVID-19 were analyzed in the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital, a tertiary care center that is designated to care for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. The observation was based on follow-up until in-hospital death or discharge. Logistic regressions were performed for prognostic factors associated with in-hospital death. Furthermore, a propensity score-matched analysis was done using a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze the contributions of multiple treatments on COVID-19 death. Results: Three hundred and seventeen patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, of whom 269 were discharged and 48 died in hospital. After propensity score-matching based on age, gender, symptoms and comorbidities, multivariable logistic regression was performed with the adjustment of other variables that were significant risk factors in the univariate regression. Treatments with glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin, thymosin, and ammonium glycyrrhizinate were significantly associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 death. Conclusions: For in-hospital patients with COVID-19 of all severity levels, high risk for fatal outcome was observed in those treated with glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin, thymosin, and ammonium glycyrrhizinate. The results of this study do not support immunomodulatory therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Further prospective studies are essential to clarify our findings, especially for non-critically ill patients.","Wang, Yu; Yan, Xin; Huang, Chenglong; Sun, Yan; Yao, Chunlin; Lin, Yun; Xiao, Weimin",Curr Med Res Opin,,106

However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice. METHODS: The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%. CONCLUSION: In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases.","Kovacs, S Krisztian; Palmer, Jill; Chen, Derrick J; Rehrauer, William; Yang, David T",WMJ,,106
319048,Change point detection for COVID-19 excess deaths in Belgium,2020-11-16,"The fear of Chinese food in the United States has risen with the advent of COVID-19, amidst widespread news reports pinpointing a wildlife wet market in Wuhan, China as the origin site of the novel coronavirus. Although scientific evidence for the exact pathway of zoonotic transmission is not yet conclusive, racist, anti-Chinese memes were quick to circulate, including a T-shirt design posted on social media by an art director at Lululemon, which featured an image of “bat fried rice” with the words “No Thank You” in chopstick font on the sleeves. It is important to address the facts of wildlife trade and consumption in China, but it is equally crucial to fight back against racist characterizations of Chinese food as “bat fried rice” with a different kind of Instagrammable image. I have taught an undergraduate seminar on the cultural history of Chinese food at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for the past eight years, and this year, one of my students shared a photograph of a Chinese family celebrating the New Year in one of her assignments. This image distilled everything I associate with Chinese food— the joy of gathering with family—and stands as a powerful rebuke to the narrative of fear and disgust, replacing it instead with a vision of Chinese food as familiar source of comfort.","King, Michelle T.",Food Foodways,,106

DESIGN: Longitudinal quantitative analysis of influent wastewater data for alcohol concentration. SETTING: Adelaide, South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Wastewater catchment area representative of 1.1 million inhabitants. MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four hour composite influent wastewater samples were collected from four wastewater treatment plants in Adelaide, South Australia for 7 consecutive days (Wednesday-Tuesday) every 2 months from April 2016-April 2020. The alcohol metabolite ethyl sulfate was measured in samples using chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data were population-weighted adjusted with consumption expressed as standard drinks/day/1000 people. Weekly consumption and weekend to mid-week consumption ratios were analysed to identify changes in weekday alcohol use pattern. FINDINGS: Estimated weekend alcohol consumption was significantly lower (698 standard drinks/day/1000 people) after self-isolation measures were enforced in April 2020 compared with the preceding sampling period in February 2020 (1047 standard drinks/day/1000 people), P < 0.05. Weekend to midweek consumption ratio was 12% lower than the average ratio compared with all previous sampling periods. April 2020 recorded the lowest alcohol consumption relative to April in previous years, dating back to 2016.

320371,Rapid generation of ACE2 humanized inbred mouse model for COVID-19 with tetraploid complementation,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in panic among the general public, leading many people to seek out information related to COVID-19 through various sources, including social media and traditional media. Identifying public preferences for obtaining such information may help health authorities to effectively plan successful health preventive and educational intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the types of sources used for obtaining COVID-19 information on the attitudes and practices of the general public in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic, and to identify the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with the use of different sources of information. METHODS: This study used data from a cross-sectional online survey conducted on residents of Saudi Arabia from March 20 to 24, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Bivariate analysis of categorical variables was performed to determine the associations between information sources and socioeconomic and demographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to examine whether socioeconomic and demographic variables were associated with the source of information used to obtain information about COVID-19. Moreover, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine how sources of information influence attitudes and practices of adhering to preventive measures. RESULTS: In this analysis of cross-sectional survey data, 3358 participants were included. Most participants reported using social media, followed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as their primary source of information. Seeking information via social media was significantly associated with lower odds of having an optimistic attitude (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.845, 95% CI 0.733-0.974; P=.02) and adhering to preventive measures (aOR 0.725, 95% CI 0.630-0.835; P<.001) compared to other sources of information. Participants who obtained their COVID-19 information via the MOH had greater odds of having an optimistic attitude (aOR 1.437, 95% CI 1.234-1.673; P<.001) and adhering to preventive measures (aOR 1.393, 95% CI 1.201-1.615; P<.001) than those who obtained information via other sources. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that different sources of information influence attitudes and preventive actions differently within a pandemic crisis context. Health authorities in Saudi Arabia should pay attention to the use of appropriate social media channels and sources to allow for more effective dissemination of critical information to the public.","Alshareef, Noor; Yunusa, Ismaeel; Al-Hanawi, Mohammed Khaled",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,106

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses of vaccine containing 5×1010 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the second dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (Covid-19) more than 14 days after the second dose. RESULTS: Between June 24 and November 9, 2020, we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with Covid-19, 39 cases (95.1% of 41 with sequencing data) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, -76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

321116,COVID-19 and the boundaries of open science and innovation: Lessons of traceability from genomic data sharing and biosecurity,2020,"BACKGROUND: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe illness including cytokine storms, but mortality among countries differs largely. In the present study, we investigated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, which plays a major role in susceptibility to viral infections, and the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: data of allele frequencies of HLA-A, -B and -C and COVID-19 mortality were obtained for 74 countries from the Allele Frequency Net Database and worldometer.info. Association between allele frequency of each HLA and mortality was assessed by linear regression followed by multivariable regression. Subsequently, association of HLA-C*05 to its receptor KIR2DS4fl, expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, and differential mortality to historic pandemics were analyzed. RESULTS: HLA-A*01, -B*07, -B*08, -B*44 and -C*05 were significantly associated with the risk of deaths (adjusted p = 0.040, 0.00081, 0.047, 0.0022, 0.00032, respectively), but only HLA-C*05 remained statistically significant (p = 0.000027) after multivariable regression. A 1% increase in the allele frequency of HLA-C*05 was associated with an increase of 44 deaths/million. Countries with different mortality could be categorized by the distribution of HLA-C*05 and its receptor KIR2DS4fl, which in combination cause NK cell-induced hyperactive immune response. Countries with similar ethnic and/or geographic background responded in a similar pattern to each pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: we demonstrated that allele frequency of HLA-C*05 and the distribution pattern with its receptor KIR2DS4fl strongly correlated with COVID-19 mortality. Host genetic variance of innate immunity may contribute to the difference in mortality among various countries and further investigation using patient samples is warranted.","Sakuraba, Atsushi; Haider, Haider; Sato, Toshiro",Viruses,,106

AIMS: This study aimed to assess the correlation between time in therapeutic range and quality of life in children participating in a non-selective International Normalised Ratio self-monitoring and vitamin K antagonist education programme. METHODS: Children aged from 2 to 18 years and receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy were eligible for this prospective multicentre study. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the PedsQL&#8482; 4.0 questionnaire. Correlations between quality of life scores and time in therapeutic range were measured. RESULTS: A total of 121 children were included in the study (mean age 9.6±4.9 years). Cardiac conditions were the predominant indication for vitamin K antagonists. The mean time in therapeutic range was 0.78±0.15 overall, and 0.76±0.24 over the 3-month period before quality of life assessment. The mean total quality of life score was 76.2±18 in self reports, 71.4±22 in mother reports and 73.5±19 in father reports. The time in therapeutic range correlated with the total quality of life scores in self reports (r=0.22; P=0.04), mother reports (r=0.23; P=0.02) and father reports (r=0.28; P=0.02). The time in therapeutic range predominantly correlated with school functioning in self reports (r=0.38; P=0.002) and mother reports (r=0.40; P<0.001), and with physical functioning in father reports (r=0.28; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Time in therapeutic range correlated with quality of life in children participating in a non-selective International Normalised Ratio self-monitoring and vitamin K antagonist education programme. Regular assessment of quality of life in patient education programmes contributes towards understanding the concerns and needs of patients.","Abassi, Hamouda; Bajolle, Fanny; Werner, Oscar; Auer, Annie; Marquina, Amandine; Mura, Thibault; Lavastre, Kathleen; Guillaumont, Sophie; Manna, Federico; Auquier, Pascal; Bonnet, Damien; Amedro, Pascal",Arch.

321287,Suspend intellectual property rights for covid-19 vaccines,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.","Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Perrone, Maria Grazia; Borelli, Massimo; Palmisani, Jolanda; Di Gilio, Alessia; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,106
321353,Vitamin D and Coronavirus,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews a method of obtaining the medical history of patients presenting with dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance. By combining elements of the history with examination, the goal is to identify patterns and an effective differential diagnosis for this group of patients to help lead to an accurate diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies over the past dozen years have changed the historical approach to patients with dizziness from one based primarily on how the patient describes the sensation of dizziness. This older approach can lead to misdiagnosis, so a preferred method puts greater emphasis on whether the dizziness is acute or chronic, episodic or continuous, or evoked by or brought on by an event or circumstance so that a pattern may be derived that better narrows the differential diagnosis and focused examination can further narrow to a cause or causes. SUMMARY: Dizziness is a common symptom of many possible causes. This article will help clinicians navigate gathering the history and examination to formulate a working diagnosis in patients affected by dizziness.","Fife, Terry D",Continuum (Minneap Minn),,106
321485,Covid-19: Photograph collection records historic vaccine rollout,2021,"An outbreak of a new coronavirus originating from Wuhan (China), responsible for a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), called SARS-CoV-2, is causing a pandemic disease called CoViD-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), although strict containment measures and restrictions on individual travel have been taken everywhere to hinder the spread of the virus. The clinical spectrum of this infection includes, in order of lesser to greater severity, asymptomatic viremia, paucisymptomatic forms, clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure that needs mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, systemic manifestations of infection, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent CoViD-19, but the international scientific community is intensely focused on finding a vaccine that will prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In the meanwhile, to prevent hospitals from risking collapse, it is crucial to stratify patients at high risk of poor lung progression, to find effective monitoring strategies, even at home, for the positive patients and/or those highly at risk of positivity of CoViD-19. Starting from the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of this infection up to the clinical characteristics of the infected patients, in this review we tried to focus on the crucial points of the infection in combination with the appropriateness of the medical intervention. We aim to offer indications of therapeutic intervention that are timely and, as far as possible, effective, targeted to the individual patient in relation to age, clinical condition and comorbidities. An early diagnosis associated with an appropriate therapeutic action in the initial stages of the disease can reduce the progression of CoViD-19 towards interstitial pneumonia, thus interfering with the number of transfers to intensive care and lethality of the pandemic in progress.","Basta, Giuseppina; Del Turco, Serena; Caselli, Chiara; Melani, Luca; Vianello, Annamaria",Recenti Prog Med,,106

322606,Covid-19: UK offers under 40s alternative to AstraZeneca vaccine to boost confidence,2021,"Background: In the light of the economic slowdown and significant strategic uncertainty resulting from the currently prevailing SARS-Cov-2 epidemic crisis, it is reasonable to undertake research to identify key competences that are relevant to the continuity of the supply chain functioning. The logistics processes in their current shape will undergo a significant change. Therefore, based on a widespread discussion that has been recently taking place in the environment of scientists, politicians, local government officials and management practitioners, the question once again arises about the level of preparation of enterprises for functioning in this specific environment. Aiming to fill the existing gap in knowledge, a series of studies was conducted, the main purpose of which was to recognize key competences from the point of view of existence in the conditions triggered by the COVID-19 crisis. Considering the empirical evidence confirming the existence of a strong relationship between company stability and an effective supply chain, the following research direction aggregates logistic microfoundations to the attribute of a ""mature"" enterprise. Methods: Referring to the outlined objective, using the method of reconstruction and interpretation of the literature on the subject, it was recommended to nominate questions assessing the level of maturity of logistics subsystems (theoretical layer) as a necessary action. At the conceptual (design) level, it was crucial to compile the research tool being the resultant of the related literature exploration (theoretical model) and discussion among deliberately selected experts (""virtual"" brainstorming). At the empirical level, this enabled the recognition of competences that determine the survival of enterprises in crisis conditions, and thus allowed the development of recommendations for managers of manufacturing enterprises. Results: The paper proposes a procedure and a tool to identify key capabilities that determine the survival of enterprises in COVID-19 crisis conditions. The brainstorming research model reflects the areas of digital technology that the manufacturers, in the context of the current pandemic, should absorb (coincidence). Moreover, it was established that the process of economic recovery will take place in cooperation with enterprises absorbing the logistic management model based on digital technologies. To sum up, it should be noted that the maturity of such an enterprise is manifested in the use of descriptions defined in the research, not only in terms of production, but also in the entire supply chain. All these activities need to be harmonized, creating a crisis-proof enterprise. The organization of such an enterprise is characterized by delegating as many tasks as possible to competent employees who, using the knowledge and available digital technologies, add value throughout the entire chain. Conclusions: The results of the research confirmed the author's belief that on the one hand digital technologies imply the possibility of surviving in the face of the crisis caused by COVID-19 (continuity of the supply chain, remote work without participation, or with limited human participation, etc.), on the other, implemented by enterprises, can be a kind of ""protective shield"" against the negative effects of a pandemic;from the perspective of the issue taken in the research work, they determine the maturity of the company's logistics subsystems. It seems that relatively small scientific recognition and complexity of problems occurring in business practice justify treating the COVID-19 issue as the subject of research, which is reflected in this publication.Alternate abstract: Streszczenie: Wstęp: W obliczu spowolnienia gospodarczego i znaczącej niepewności strategicznej będącej wynikiem panującego obecnie kryzysu epidemicznego SARS-Cov-2, zasadne jest podjęcie badań rozpoznających kompetencje kluczowe, istotne z punktu widzenia ciągłości funkcjonowania łańcucha dostaw. Procesy logistyczne w dotychczasowym kształcie ulegną bowiem istotnej zmianie. Dlatego też, na fali szerokiej dyskusji jaka się ostatnio toczy w środowisku naukowców, polityków, samorządowców czy praktyków zarządzania, po raz kolejny pojawia się pytanie o poziom przygotowania przedsiębiorstw do funkcjonowania w tym specyficznym otoczeniu. Dążąc do uzupełnienia istniejącej luki w wiedzy przeprowadzono cykl badań, których zasadniczym celem ustanowiono rozpoznanie kompetencji kluczowych z punktu widzenia egzystowania w warunkach kryzysu wywołanego COVID-19. Zważywszy na empiryczne dowody potwierdzające istnienie silnego związku pomiędzy stabilnością firmy a skutecznym łańcuchem dostaw, poniższy kierunek badań agreguje mikrofundamenty logistyczne do miana atrybutu „dojrzałego” przedsiębiorstwa. Metody: W nawiązaniu do nakreślonego celu, wykorzystując metodę rekonstrukcji i interpretacji literatury przedmiotu, jako działanie niezbędne zarekomendowano nominowanie pytań opiniujących poziom dojrzałości podsystemów logistycznych (warstwa teoretyczna). Na płaszczyźnie koncepcyjnej (projektowej) kluczowe było skompilowanie narzędzia badawczego będącego wypadkową eksploracji piśmiennictwa (model teoretyczny) oraz dyskusji wśród celowo dobranych ekspertów („wirtualna” burza mózgów). Na płaszczyźnie empirycznej umożliwiło to rozpoznanie kompetencji przesądzających o przetrwaniu przedsiębiorstw w warunkach kryzysu i tym samym pozwoliło na opracowanie rekomendacji dla zarządzających przedsiębiorstwami wytwórczymi. Wyniki: W pracy zaproponowano procedurę i narzędzie umożliwiające identyfikację kluczowych zdolności przesądzających o przetrwaniu przedsiębiorstw w warunkach kryzysu COVID-19. Model badawczy powstały w wyniku burzy mózgów odzwierciedla obszary technologii cyfrowej, które w kontekście obecnej pandemii powinni absorbować wytwórcy (koincyndencja). Ponadto ustalono, iż proces odbudowy gospodarki będzie odbywał się przy współudziale przedsiębiorstw absorbujących model zarządzania logistycznego oparty na technologiach cyfrowych. Reasumując trzeba nadmienić, że dojrzałość takiego przedsiębiorstwa przejawia się zastosowaniem - zdefiniowanych w badaniach deskryptów – nie tylko w zakresie wytwarzania, ale także w zakresie całego łańcucha dostaw. Wszystkie te działania wymagają zharmonizowania, tworząc przedsiębiorstwo „odporne” na kryzys. Organizacja takiego przedsiębiorstwa charakteryzuje się przekazaniem możliwie największej liczby zadań kompetentnym pracownikom, którzy przy wykorzystaniu wiedzy i dostępnych technologii cyfrowych dodają wartość w całym łańcuchu. Wnioski: Wyniki badań utwierdziły autora w przekonaniu, że technologie cyfrowe z jednej strony implikujące możliwość przetrwana w obliczu kryzysu wywołanego COVID-19 (ciągłość łańcucha dostaw, praca zdalna bez udziału, lub przy ograniczonym udziale człowieka, itp.), z drugiej zaś implementowane przez przedsiębiorstwa, mogą stanowić swego rodzaju „tarczę ochronną” przed negatywnymi skutkami pandemii;z perspektywy podjętego w pracy zagadnienia stanowią o dojrzałości podsystemów logistycznych przedsiębiorstwa. Wydaje się, że stosunkowo małe naukowe rozpoznanie i złożoność problemów występujących w praktyce biznesowej uzasadniają traktowanie kwestii COVID-19 jako przedmiotu badań, czego wyraz stanowi niniejsza publikacja.","Niewiadomski, Przemysław",LogForum,,106

Restriction of free sugar intake has a measurable effect on disease-predicting physiological parameters in as little as 9 days. The rapid reduction in inflammation following fructose restriction is key in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as COVID-19 exacerbates the same inflammatory pathways as those driven by the metabolic syndrome. Healthcare providers have a duty to implement international recommendations of reduced free sugar intake. By doing so, they could reduce the chronic inflammatory burden contributing to COVID-19 patients' demise. Further, it would set a precedent for reducing the risk of severe disease in the uninfected, by maximizing their potential metabolic health in the context of an infection predicated on its disruption.","Vazirani, A.

Methods: According to ""The Prevention and Control Protocol for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Third Edition)"" issued by the National Health Commission, a field epidemiological survey was conducted for the 5 cases in January 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from them for the detection of 2019-nCoV by real time RT-PCR. Multi prevention and control measures were taken, such as tracking and screening close contacts, medical isolation observation, investigating the epidemiological link, analyzing transmission chain. Results: Case 1, who had common environmental exposure with other COVIDâ19 cases, got sick on 20 January, 2020 and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 2 became symptomatic on 22 January and was confirmed on 27 January. Case 3 got sick on 25 January and was confirmed on 30 January. Case 4 had illness onset on 20 January and was confirmed on 1 February. Case 5 got sick on 23 January and was confirmed on 31 January. Among the 5 cases, case 2 died and the illness of other cases were effectively controlled. After exclusion of other common exposure factors, case 1 had a 6-hour meeting with case 2 and case 3 on 19 January. Case 2 and case 3 might be infected by case 1 during the incubation period. It is the key point for epidemiological investigation. Conclusion: The epidemiological investigation indicates that the transmission might occur in the incubation period of COVID-19 case, close attention should be paid to it in future COVID-19 prevention and control.","Xiao, W J; Gao, Q; Jin, K; Gong, X H; Han, R B; Jiang, C Y; Jiang, X J; Jin, B H; Fang, Q W; Pan, H; Wu, H Y; Sun, X D",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,106

325581,Evidence-based strategies to promote vaccine acceptance,2021,"Abstract Concerns over the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to trade restrictions by major rice exporters, contributing to an average 25% increase in Thai and Vietnamese rice export prices between December 2019 and March?September 2020. This article assesses the consequences of these rice price increases in Papua New Guinea (PNG), where 99% of rice is imported. Utilizing data from a PNG 2018 rural household survey along with earlier national household survey data, we examine rice consumption patterns in PNG and estimate demand parameters for urban and rural households. Model simulations indicate that a 25% rise in the world price of rice would reduce total rice consumption in PNG by 14% and reduce rice consumption of the poor (bottom 40% of total household expenditure distribution) by 15%. Including the effects of a possible 12% decrease in household incomes because of the COVID-19 related economic slowdown, rice consumption of the urban and rural poor fall by 20% and 17%, respectively. Maintaining functioning domestic supply chains of key staple goods is critical to mitigating the effects of global rice price increases, allowing urban households to increase their consumption of locally produced staples.","Schmidt, Emily Dorosh Paul Gilbert Rachel",Agricultural Economics,,106

327306,Vaccine hesitancy: Root causes and possible solutions,2021,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has thus far affected over 15 million individuals, resulting in over 600,000 deaths worldwide, and the number continues to rise. In a large systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature including 2,567 pregnant women, 7% required intensive care admission, with a maternal mortality ~1% and perinatal mortality below 1%. There has been a rapid increase in publications on COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and VTE, in the non-pregnant population, but very few reports of COVID-19 coagulopathy during pregnancy; leaving us with no guidance for care of this specific population. METHODS: This is a collaborative effort conducted by a group of experts which was reviewed, critiqued and approved by the ISTH Subcommittee for Women's Health Issues in Thrombosis and Hemostasis. A structured literature search was conducted, and the quality of current and emerging evidence was evaluated. Based on the published studies in the non-pregnant and pregnant population with a moderate to high risk of bias as assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale and acknowledging the absence of data from randomized clinical trials for management of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, a consensus in support of a guidance document for COVID-19 coagulopathy in pregnancy was identified. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Specific haemostatic issues during pregnancy were highlighted, preliminary recommendations to assist in the care of COVID-19-affected pregnant women with coagulopathy or thrombotic complications were developed. An international registry to gather data to support the management of COVID-19 and associated coagulopathy in pregnancy was established.","Kadir, Rezan Abdul; Kobayashi, Takao; Iba, Toshiaki; Erez, Offer; Thachil, Jecko; Kazi, Sajida; Malinowski, Ann Kinga; Othman, Maha",J. thromb. haemost,,106

This has resulted in an immense drag on the revenues and cash flows that may lead to a significant increase in corporate bankruptcies. In this paper, we investigate the impact of Covid-19 on the solvency profile of the firms in the EU member states. We introduce multiple stress scenarios on the non-financial listed firms and report a progressive increase in the probability of default, an increase of debt payback, and declining coverages. Our results indicate that the solvency profile of all firms deteriorates. The manufacturing, mining, and retail sector are most vulnerable to a decline in market capitalization and a reduction in sales revenues. The paper also examines the possible policy interventions to sustain solvency at a pre Covid-19 level. Our findings suggest that for a moderate deterioration in economic conditions, a tax deferral is sufficient. However, in the event of exacerbating business shocks, there should be hybrid support through debt and equity to avoid a meltdown. This study has important implications for policymakers, corporate managers, and creditors.","Mirza, Nawazish; Rahat, Birjees; Naqvi, Bushra; Rizvi, Syed Kumail Abbas",,,106

Due to global rapid surge in the (Coronavirus Disease) COVID patients, the services of Teledental are best suited in the newer post-COVID era. A devised perceptron has been intelligently embedded with de-multiplexing ability to transmit data to the dentists has been proposed. Exact session key has been developed through learning rules applied on the perceptrons by both the patient and dentist. For simplicity, gingivitis data is highly recommended to transmit in a highly secured manner with patients' data integrity. Gingivitis is an important dental disease which is primarily caused by the bacterial colonization. It shows gum bleeding and inflammations in the gingiva. Encrypted transmission is required to the Dentist for early diagnosis and treatment in Teledental system in this pandemic context. Gingivitis data are then broken into parts by the demultiplexer followed by individual proposed header generation. It is predominantly done to confuse the intruders about the originality of the intraoral data. Chi-square, Avalanche, Strict Avalanche, etc. were carried on the proposed partial shares to generate good outcomes when compared to classical algorithms. To confuse the intruders, character frequency, floating frequency, and autocorrelation were tested extensively. It is a newer approach to avail the secured Teledental features in post-COVID time.","Dey, Joydeep; Sarkar, Arindam; Karforma, Sunil",Int J Inf Technol,,106

During this period of crisis, researchers over the world have ramped their efforts to constrain the disease in all possible ways, whether it is vaccination, therapy or diagnosis. Because the spread of the disease has not yet elapsed, sharing the ongoing research findings could be the key to disease control and management. An early and efficient diagnosis could leverage the outcome until a successful vaccine is developed. Both in-house and commercial kits are the preferred molecular tests being used worldwide in the COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the limitation of high prices and lengthy procedures impede their use for mass testing. Keeping the constant rise of infection in mind, the search for an alternative test that is cost-effective, simple and suitable for large-scale testing and surveillance is the need of the hour. One such alternative could be immunological tests. In the last few months, a deluge of immunological rapid tests have been developed and validated across the globe. The objective of this review is to share the diagnostic performance of various immunological assays reported so far in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 case detection. We consolidate the studies (published and preprints) related to serological tests such as chemiluminescence, enzyme-linked and lateral flow-based point-of-care tests in COVID-19 diagnosis and update the current scenario.

The pandemic has a clear and strong effect on world economic development. The assessments so far show that the COVID-19 could slash global economic growth by 2.0% for each month when existing challenges persist. World commerce might also slash by 13% to 32%, subject to the penetration and level of a world economic depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on Malaysian Takaful business and future effect of COVID-19 in Malaysia at 2020. By this time, it is obvious that the pandemic has intense detrimental effect on both the Malaysian macroeconomic and economic welfare of the people. Bank Negara Malaysia in 2020 has forecast that GDP growth will fall between 3.5% and 5.5%. Currently, unemployment is expected to rise to 5%. Islamic economy is also being affected by the virus incidence. The Malaysian Takaful industry is not excluded from the anticipated impact of the economic slowdown in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from considerably hampered growth in 2020, Takaful operators will also have to cope with the increased volatility and rising credit risks of their investments in 2021 and may be 2022.

We also established the profiles of 280 persons collected before the coronavirus pandemic started. PCA analyses discriminated both cohorts, highlighting the impact that the infection has in overall metabolism. The lipidomic analysis unraveled a pathogenic redistribution of the lipoprotein particle size and composition to increase the atherosclerotic risk. In turn, metabolomic analysis reveals abnormally high levels of ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone) and 2-hydroxybutyric acid, a readout of hepatic glutathione synthesis and marker of oxidative stress.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a single-centre cross-sectional observational study, we included 355 patients with AMI containing ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), admitted for emergency cardiac catheterization between January and April 2020 and the equivalent time in 2019. During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic (e-COV) in Berlin (March and April 2020), admissions for AMI halved compared with those in the pre-Covid-19 time (January and February 2020; pre-COV) and with those in the corresponding months in 2019. However, mortality for AMI increased substantially from 5.2% pre-COV to 17.7% (P < 0.05) during e-COV. Severity of presentation for AMI was more pronounced during e-COV [increased levels of cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an increase in the need of inotropic support by 25% (P < 0.01)], while patients' demographic and angiographic characteristics did not differ between pre-COV and e-COV. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was prolonged in all AMI during e-COV (presentation > 72 h +21% in STEMI, p = 0.04 and presentation > 72 h in NSTEMI +22%, p = 0.02). Door to balloon time was similar in STEMI patients, while time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed in NSTEMI patients (p = 0.02). Major cardiac complications after AMI occurred significantly more often, and cardiac recovery was worse in e-COV than in pre-COV, demonstrated by a significantly lower LVEF (39 ± 16 vs. 46 ± 16, p < 0.05) at hospital discharge and substantially higher NTproBNP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 outbreak affects hospital admissions for acute coronary syndromes. During the first phase of the pandemia, significantly less patients with AMI were admitted, but those admitted presented with a more severe phenotype and had a higher mortality, more complications, and a worse short-term outcome. Therefore, our data indicate that Covid-19 had relevant impact on non-infectious disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes.","Primessnig, Uwe; Pieske, Burkert M; Sherif, Mohammad",ESC Heart Fail,,106

337506,A Chance to Create a Better World?,2020,"To explore the clinical application value of chest CT quantitative pulmonary inflammation index (PII) in the evaluation of the course and treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. One hundred and eighteen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by RT-PCR were analyzed retrospectively. The correlation between chest CT PII, clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations during the entire hospitalization period was compared. The average age of the patients was 46.0 ± 15 (range: 1-74) years. Of the 118 patients, 62 are male (52.5%) and 56 are female (47.5%). Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9-41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies' chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0-5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0-20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the most likely areas to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%); common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0-5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0-20). The residual lesions mainly presented as ground glass opacities (61.0%), and the main accompanying sign was linear opacities (59.3%). Based on chest CT, the median maximum PII of lungs was 30.0% (range: 0-97.5%), and the median PII after discharge in the patients excluding the two deaths was 12.5% (range: 0-53.0%). PII was significantly negatively correlated with the LYM count and significantly positively correlated with body temperature, LDH, CRP, and ESR. There was no significant correlation between the PII and the white blood cell count, but the grade of PII correlated well with the clinical classification. PII can be used to monitor the severity and the treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia, provide help for clinical classification, assist in treatment plan adjustments and aid assessments for discharge.","Peng, Song; Chen, Jinqing; Zhang, Wendy; Zhang, Bangjun; Liu, Zhifeng; Liu, Lang; Wu, Zhaofeng; Fu, Rui; Li, Xiuhua; Lv, Fajin",Sci Rep,,106

On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak, a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. RESULTS: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options. Physicians should be cautious not to overlook other neurological diagnoses that can mimic COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Ghannam, Malik; Alshaer, Qasem; Al-Chalabi, Mustafa; Zakarna, Lara; Robertson, Jetter; Manousakis, Georgios",J. neurol,,106
339890,Radiologische Manifestationen von Lungenerkrankungen bei COVID-19,2020,"An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. Patients with COVID-19 are at risk of cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reduced blood oxygenation, mechanical ventilation, and a high death rate. Although recent studies have shown remdesivir & dexamethasone as treatment options, there is an urgent need to find a treatment to inhibit virus replication and to control the progression of the disease. Essential biometal zinc has generated a lot of excitement as one of the promising candidates to reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. Several published observations outlined in the review are the reasons why there is a global enthusiasm that zinc therapy could be a possible therapeutic option. However, the biggest challenge in realising the therapeutic value of zinc is lack of optimal treatment modalities such as dose, duration of zinc supplementation and the mode of delivery. In this review, we discuss the regulatory mechanism that hinges upon the bioavailability of zinc. Finally, we propose that intravenous zinc could circumvent the confounding factors affecting the bioavailability of zinc and allow zinc to achieve its therapeutic potential. If successful, due to advantages such as lack of toxicity, low cost and ease of availability, intravenous zinc could be rapidly implemented clinically.","Chinni, Vidyasagar; El-Khoury, Hanna; Perera, Marlon; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Jones, Daryl; Bolton, Damien; Ischia, Joseph; Patel, Oneel",,,106

340256,Successful find-test-trace-isolate-support systems: how to win at snakes and ladders,2020,"BACKGROUND: APOL1 is found in human kidney podocytes and endothelia. Variants G1 and G2 of the APOL1 gene account for the high frequency of nondiabetic CKD among African Americans. Proposed mechanisms of kidney podocyte cytotoxicity resulting from APOL1 variant overexpression implicate different subcellular compartments. It is unclear where endogenous podocyte APOL1 resides, because previous immunolocalization studies utilized overexpressed protein or commercially available antibodies that crossreact with APOL2. This study describes and distinguishes the locations of both APOLs. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, confocal and immunoelectron microscopy, and podocyte fractionation localized endogenous and transfected APOL1 using a large panel of novel APOL1-specific mouse and rabbit monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Both endogenous podocyte and transfected APOL1 isoforms vA and vB1 (and a little of isoform vC) localize to the luminal face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to the cell surface, but not to mitochondria, endosomes, or lipid droplets. In contrast, APOL2, isoform vB3, and most vC of APOL1 localize to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and are consequently absent from the cell surface. APOL1 knockout podocytes do not stain for APOL1, attesting to the APOL1-specificity of the antibodies. Stable re-transfection of knockout podocytes with inducible APOL1-G0, -G1, and -G2 showed no differences in localization among variants. CONCLUSIONS: APOL1 is found in the ER and plasma membrane, consistent with either the ER stress or surface cation channel models of APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity. The surface localization of APOL1 variants potentially opens new therapeutic targeting avenues.","Scales, Suzie J; Gupta, Nidhi; De Mazière, Ann M; Posthuma, George; Chiu, Cecilia P; Pierce, Andrew A; Hötzel, Kathy; Tao, Jianhua; Foreman, Oded; Koukos, Georgios; Oltrabella, Francesca; Klumperman, Judith; Lin, WeiYu; Peterson, Andrew S",J.

340801,Nigeria and Italy Divergences in Coronavirus Experience: Impact of Population Density,2020,"Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic a year ago, our understanding of its effects on the vascular system has slowly evolved. At the cellular level, SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - accesses the vascular endothelium through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and induces proinflammatory and prothrombotic responses. At the clinical level, these pathways lead to thromboembolic events that affect the pulmonary, extracranial, mesenteric, and lower extremity vessels. At the population level, the presence of vascular risk factors predisposes individuals to more severe forms of COVID-19, whereas the absence of vascular risk factors does not spare patients with COVID-19 from unprecedented rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism and acute limb ischemia. Finally, at the community and global level, the fear of COVID-19, measures taken to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reallocation of limited hospital resources have led to delayed presentations of severe forms of ischemia, surgery cancellations and missed opportunities for limb salvage. The purpose of this narrative review is to present some of the data on COVID-19, from cellular mechanisms to clinical manifestations, and discuss its impact on the local and global surgical communities from a vascular perspective.","Strauss, Shira A; Seo, Chanhee; Carrier, Marc; Jetty, Prasad",Can J Surg,,106

The potential cause, clinical characteristics and infectiousness of the recurrent positive RT-PCR patients need to be answered. METHODS: A single-centered, retrospective study of 51 discharged COVID-19 patients was carried out at a designated hospital for COVID-19. The demographic data, clinical records and laboratory findings of 25 patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR from hospitalization to follow-up were collected and compared to 26 patients with negative RT-PCR discharged regularly during the same period. Discharged patients' family members and close contacts were also interviewed by telephone to evaluate patients' potential infectiousness. RESULTS: The titer of both IgG and IgM antibodies was significantly lower (p = 0.027, p = 0.011) in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR. Median duration of viral shedding significantly prolonged in patients with recurrent positive RT-PCR (36.0 days vs 9.0 days, p = 0.000). There was no significant difference in demographic features, clinical features, lymphocyte subsets count and inflammatory cytokines levels between the two groups of patients. No fatal case was noted in two groups. As of the last day of follow-up, none of the discharged patients' family members or close contact developed any symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low levels of IgG and IgM are more likely to have recurrent positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results and lead to a prolonged viral shedding. The recurrent positive of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR may not indicate the recurrence or aggravation of COVID-19. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR in the patients recovered from COVID-19 is not necessarily correlated with the ability of transmission.","Ao, Zhi; Li, Yan; Wei, Jiawei; Jiang, Jinyue; Wang, Xiaohui; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Yuxin; Yu, Haiyan; Zhu, Linxiao; Wang, Xue; Hu, Qianfang; Duan, Jun; Hu, Wenhui; Zhang, Xianxiang; Wu, Guicheng; Guo, Shuliang",Clin. exp. med,,106

METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical records was conducted in patients who received tamoxifen for the treatment of ovarian cancer between 2002 and 2016. We reviewed the clinical setting that it was given, duration of use, patients' tolerability, clinical benefit and progression-free survival. We also attempted to identify predictive markers for response. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients received tamoxifen during this 15-year period. The patients received a median of 2.5 lines of chemotherapy before switching to tamoxifen, and they remained on tamoxifen for a median of 5.6 months (range 0-85 months), with 24 patients receiving it for more than 12 months. Seventy-six patients continued on tamoxifen for more than 2 months. In this group, 75 patients had an evaluable response, either by CA 125 or clinically and clinical benefit rate (defined as complete, partial response and static disease) was seen in 42 patients (56%), with majority of patients having static disease. The median progression-free survival was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval, 2.6-8.1). Tamoxifen was well tolerated. Hormone receptor status was not demonstrated to predict response. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed previous lines of chemotherapy may achieve static disease with tamoxifen with minimal side effects.

345091,Covid-19: Testing times for the government-but not for NHS staff,2020,"Due to the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies on inflammation and cardiovascular involvement, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with COVID-19 still remains uncertain. It was demonstrated that there is a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin T and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. Cardiac injury and inflammation is a relatively common association among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and it is related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In our literature search, we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor binding affinity to the virus Spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks. Of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. Strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in COVID-19 are steadily needed. The high morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel SARS-CoV2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. Emerging as an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. Therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of COVID-19 or other coronaviruses.","Centurión, Osmar Antonio; Scavenius, Karina E; García, Laura B; Torales, Judith M; Miño, Luís M",Crit. pathw. cardiol,,106

346282,Optimal Control to Limit the Spread of COVID-19 in Italy,2021-07-26,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated cytokine activation can lead to a rapid progression into respiratory failure, shock and multiorgan failure. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that likely contributes to the pathogenesis of cytokine release syndrome. It is hypothesized that modulating IL-6 levels or its effects with tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, may alter the course of disease. METHODS: We examined the association between tocilizumab use and intubation or death at a community hospital in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In this single-centre retrospective cohort study involving 1225 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the probability to respiratory failure, which was measured as intubation or death, was less frequent in patients who received tocilizumab. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab and other IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibodies may evolve as a viable option in treating patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.","Chilimuri, Sridhar; Sun, Haozhe; Alemam, Ahmed; Kang, Kyoung-Sil; Lao, Peter; Mantri, Nikhitha; Schiller, Lawrence; Sharabun, Myroslava; Shehi, Elona; Tejada, Jairo; Yugay, Alla; Nayudu, Suresh Kumar",J. clin. pharm. ther,,106
347501,President's message: Application of lessons learned,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with established anxiety disorders during a period of stringent mandated social restrictions. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to determine the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and mood symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: Twelve (40.0%) participants described COVID-19 restrictions as having a deleterious impact on their anxiety symptoms. Likert scale measurements noted that the greatest impact of COVID-19 related to social functioning (mean = 4.5, SD = 2.9), with a modest deleterious effect on anxiety symptoms noted (mean = 3.8, SD = 2.9). Clinician rated data noted that 8 (26.7%) participants had disimproved and 14 (46.7%) participants had improved since their previous clinical review, prior to commencement of COVID-19 restrictions. Conditions associated with no 'trigger', such as generalised anxiety disorder, demonstrated a non-significant increase in anxiety symptoms compared to conditions with a 'trigger', such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Psychiatric or physical comorbidity did not substantially impact on symptomatology secondary to COVID-19 mandated restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological and social impact of COVID-19 restrictions on individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders has been modest with only minimal increases in symptomatology or social impairment noted.","Plunkett, R; Costello, S; McGovern, M; McDonald, C; Hallahan, B",Ir J Psychol Med,,106

We conducted this study to help pediatricians understand the conditions of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: We retrospectively summarized the characteristics, treatment and outcomes of pediatric cases in Wuhan Children's Hospital which was the only designated hospital for children with COVID-19 in Hubei Province. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: As of February 29, 75 children had been discharged, of which only one was has severe pneumonia and one was critical cases. Children younger than 2 years were more susceptible to COVID-19. All patients have received interferon-&#945; nebulization, and eight cases including the severe and critical cases were co-administrated ribavirin. Five patients with mild pneumonia were given arbidol. Twenty-three patients were given traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The average length of stay (LOS) and the time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance were 10.57 and 6.39 days, respectively. None of the factors was associated with LOS or time of SARS-CoV-2 clearance. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 in pediatric cases were milder than adults.

347966,"“If We Want Things to Stay as They Are, Things Will Have to Change.” Covid, Couture and the 1%",2021,"One impact of COVID-19 on teaching has been the utilization of the virtual classroom and, along with that, ?Zoom fatigue?. At Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), one approach to reduce the scheduled screen time has been to pre-record lectures so students can access these at their convenience. Much of the pharmacology content is delivered as lecture with some content reinforcement in small group sessions. Transitioning from synchronous, live lectures to pre-recorded lectures that can be accessed asynchronously presents a number of potential challenges including building rapport with students, maintaining a common experience between the pharmacology faculty and students since the lectures can be recorded weeks or months before being accessible to the students, responding to non-verbal cues during the lecture to expand or quickly move past a concept, opportunities for faculty development in response to those non-verbal cues, and continuous quality improvement of the lecture based on real-time feedback. One solution has been the ?interactive lecture?: a hybrid model in which students prepare for a synchronous session by watching a short (15-20 min) pre-recording that provides relevant physiology and potentially pharmacological strategies. Students join the synchronous session to reinforce and build on concepts from the pre-recording. Because they are coming into the session with some degree of foundational knowledge, there are more opportunities for interaction in the form of polling questions. Similar to reading the non-verbal cues in the classroom, these questions allow the instructor to respond to the students in the room and adjust the teaching focus in real-time. In this way, the session is somewhat directed by the students and their understanding and questions. Additionally, the instructor can revise the session in the future based on a better understanding of what concepts were clear and where students struggled. The IUSM second-year medical students had the experience of one course in which pharmacology was taught asynchronously with only one synchronous small group session and another course in which pharmacology was taught synchronously for all sessions either as interactive lectures or small group sessions. At the end of the second course, students received an evaluation in which they were asked to rank their preference. The overall response rate was 79% (296 of 375 students responding). Of these, 32% of students chose only the pre-recording and 13% of students chose to only access slides without any recording or live session. The remaining 55% of students included a synchronous session in their preference. Clearly, there is a large fraction of students who prefer to learn the pharmacology content independently. Based on other feedback, many of these students are utilizing non-IUSM resources such as Sketchy Pharm, First Aid, and USMLE Step 1 Qbank as their primary resource for pharmacology content. However, the majority of students want some form of synchronous session and interaction in order to help learn, solidify, and apply pharmacology. Of those students, nearly half preferred the interactive lecture format. The interactive lecture is an efficient and effective way to deliver pharmacology content and maintain student-faculty interaction in the virtual classroom.","Richardson, Jennelle",The FASEB Journal,,106

348874,Celebrating our history,2020,"ABSTRACT: Mortality of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was high. Aims to examine whether time from symptoms onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission affects incidence of extra-pulmonary complications and prognosis in order to provide a new insight for reducing the mortality. A single-centered, retrospective, observational study investigated 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU of The Third People's Hospital of Yichang from January 17 to March 29, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to time from symptoms onset to ICU admission (>7 and &#8804;7âdays) and into 2 groups according to prognosis (survivors and non-survivors). Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and treatment data were studied. Compared with patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset &#8804;7âdays (55.6%), patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset >7âdays (44.4%) were more likely to have extra-pulmonary complications (19 [95.0%] vs 16 [64.0%], Pâ=â.034), including acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, acute heart failure, liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hyperamylasemia, and hypernatremia. The incidence rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, and hospital-acquired pneumonia had no difference between the 2 groups. Except activated partial thromboplastin and Na+ concentration, the laboratory findings were worse in group of time from symptoms onset to ICU admission >7âdays. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups. Of the 45 cases in the ICU, 19 (42.2%) were non-survivors, and 16 (35.6%) were with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Among these non-survivors, hospital-acquired pneumonia was up to 12 (63.2%) besides higher incidence of extra-pulmonary complications. However, hospital-acquired pneumonia occurred in only 4 (15.4%) survivors. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who admitted to ICU at once might get benefit from intensive care via lower rate of extra-pulmonary complications.","Wang, Peng; Tan, Xiang; Li, Qian; Qian, Min; Cheng, Aiguo; Ma, Baohua; Wan, Peng; Zhang, Xinli; Guo, Changyun; Sheng, Mengting; Yi, Mengqiu; Yu, Min",Medicine (Baltimore),,106

La literatura mundial describe mayor incidencia de parto prematuro y cesáreas en pacientes infectadas por COVID-19 principalmente de origen iatrogénico, sin embargo, existen escasos datos del pronóstico del embarazo al decidir diferir el parto hasta después del período infeccioso del virus. Este trabajo reporta un grupo de embarazadas diagnosticadas con COVID-19 en tercer trimestre donde se decidió no interrumpir el embarazo y diferir su parto hasta recuperación de la patología. MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional retrospectivo que analiza resultados materno-perinatales en 9 casos de mujeres infectadas por COVID, diagnosticadas posterior a las 33 semanas y cuyo parto se verificó después de recuperadas del COVID. RESULTADOS: Se observó un 77% de pacientes sintomáticas, 77% requirieron hospitalización, 33% por COVID, todas ingresaron a unidad de paciente crítico, sólo una requirió ventilación mecánica no invasiva. Dos cursaron con cetoacidosis normo-glicémica y dos con neumonía por COVID-19. Un 88% resultó en parto de término, sólo una paciente tuvo parto prematuro de causa obstétrica. La vía de parto fue un 67% vaginal y 33% por cesárea, todas por indicación obstétrica. La latencia al parto promedio fue de 17.3 días. Los puntajes de Apgar fueron todos mayor a 7 al minuto y 5 minutos. CONCLUSIÓN: Los resultados de esta serie sugieren que, en casos seleccionados, los partos posteriores al período infeccioso del COVID se asocian a buenos resultados materno-perinatales, sin embargo, resulta importante aumentar la casuística.","Vega Rojas, Denise; Carreño Manríquez, Leonardo; Díaz Echeverría, Claudia",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

Foram coletadas as notificações de violência em indivíduos de 0 a 19 anos, nos meses de março e abril de cada ano, estratificadas por sexo, faixa etária, raça/cor e tipo de violência. Utilizou-se a regressão de Prais-Winsten para a análise de tendência temporal. Das 7.718 notificações analisadas, observou-se uma queda de 54% no ano de 2020 comparado com o mesmo período em 2019. A análise de tendência até 2019 indicou aumento nas taxas de notificações (2,04, IC95%: 1,01; 3,07, p = 0,002), porém, com a inclusão do ano de 2020 à série temporal, o direcionamento na tendência das taxas de notificações inverteu-se para negativo, perdendo a significância estatística (-0,39, IC95%: -1,16; 2,14, p = 0,632).

350141,Support of intelligent emergent materials to combat COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"For millions of children with incarcerated parents worldwide, parent-child visits are suspended because of the worldwide novel coronavirus pandemic. Although child-friendly contact visits with ample opportunities for physical contact are the most meaningful way for young children to connect with their incarcerated parents during times of health, there are other meaningful ways of connecting from a distance. Traditional mediated communication strategies such as phone calls and letters are challenging for very young children because of their limited cognitive, language, and attentional capabilities. New forms of mediated communication, such as in-home video chat, can be accessible and developmentally appropriate for connecting young children with family members who live at a distance, including connecting children with their incarcerated parents. A growing body of international developmental research suggests that video chat may afford children the ability to maintain the benefits of parent-child interactions from a distance, when internet access is available. Thus, in-home video chat between children and their incarcerated parents is a potentially viable option for building relationships during incarceration, especially when opportunities for positive physical contact are limited or non-existent.","Skora, Elizabeth; Poehlmann-Tynan, Julie",J.

We hypothesised that antenatal phthalate exposure may influence subsequent boy's growth and body composition through childhood and adolescence. Among 1399 singleton males from the Raine Study, 410 had maternal serum and at least one height, BMI or DEXA outcome available after birth and up to 20 years of age. Maternal serum collected at 18 and 34 weeks' gestation was pooled, and analyzed for concentrations of 32 metabolites of 15 phthalate diesters. Their serum concentrations were categorized into undetectable/detectable levels or tertiles. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations between maternal serum phthalate levels and longitudinal height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores in boys from birth to 20 years of age (n=250 and n=295 respectively). Linear regression was used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and deviation from mid-parental height (n=177) and DEXA scan outcomes (n=191) at the 20 year follow-up. Weak positive associations of participants height z-score increase were detected with exposure to some phthalate metabolites in particular to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites. Less consistent findings, by mixed model analyses, were detected for BMI and body composition, by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with some positive associations of phthalate metabolites with BMI and some negative associations with DEXA fat tissue measures, although no consistent findings were evident. In conclusion, we derived some associations of childhood growth with prenatal phthalate exposure, particularly with respect to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites.","Berman, Ye039; elah, E; Doherty, Dorota A; Main, Katharina M; Frederiksen, Hanne; Keelan, Jeffrey A; Newnham, John P; Hart, Roger J",Environ Res,,106
352621,Analysis of Caputo fractional-order model for COVID-19 with lockdown,2020,"This paper presents simulations of the potential effect of COVID-19-related school closures on schooling and learning outcomes. It considers four scenarios - varying in both the duration of school closures and the effectiveness of any mitigation strategies being deployed by governments. Using data on 174 countries, the analysis finds that the global level of schooling and learning will fall substantially. School closures could result in a loss of between 0.3 and 1.1 years of schooling adjusted for quality, bringing down the effective years of basic schooling that students achieve during their lifetime from 7.8 years to between 6.7 and 7.5 years. Close to 11 million students from primary up to secondary education could drop out due to the income shock of the pandemic alone. Exclusion and inequality will likely be exacerbated if already marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as girls, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, are more adversely affected by school closures. Students from the current cohort could, on average, face a reduction of $366 to $1,776 in yearly earnings. In present value terms, this amounts to between $6,680 and $32,397 dollars in lost earnings over a typical student's lifetime. Globally, a school shutdown of 5 months could generate learning losses that have a present value of $10 trillion. By this measure, the world could stand to lose as much as 16 percent of the investments that governments make in the basic education of this cohort of students. In the pessimistic and very pessimistic scenarios, cumulative losses could add up to between $16 and $20 trillion in present value terms. Unless drastic remedial action is taken, the world could face a substantial setback in achieving the goal of halving the percentage of learning poor by 2030. © 2021 The Author(s).

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman presented with acute COVID-19 infection and primary adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH). She also had a renal vein thrombosis. Her past medical history revealed primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). Four weeks after discharge she had no signs of COVID-19 infection and her polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 was negative, but she still needed glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. The combination of APLS and COVID-19 was probably responsible of the adrenal event as a ""two-hit"" mechanism.

353533,Spaces of Solidarity and Spaces of Exception at the times of Covid-19,2020,"Despite limited genomic diversity, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown a wide range of clinical manifestations in different patient populations. The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell-specific and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#954;B) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","Lieberman, Nicole A P; Peddu, Vikas; Xie, Hong; Shrestha, Lasata; Huang, Meei-Li; Mears, Megan C; Cajimat, Maria N; Bente, Dennis A; Shi, Pei-Yong; Bovier, Francesca; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Jerome, Keith R; Moscona, Anne; Porotto, Matteo; Greninger, Alexander L",PLoS Biol,,106
354384,Navigating assisted reproduction treatment in the time of COVID-19: concerns and considerations,2020,"The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights -- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.","Massonis, Gemma; Banga, Julio R.; Villaverde, Alejandro F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14295v1.pdf,106

Determination of early assessments for patients with a risk of clinical deterioration would benefit the management of COVID-19 outbreaks. Patients and Methods: A total of 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from January 11th to February 11th 2020. Medical records including laboratory parameters, clinical outcomes and other characteristics of the admitted patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The critical patients experienced a significantly prolonged onset-admission interval and presented with lymphopenia (r=-0.547, p=0.015) and lower albumin level (p<0.001) 6 days after symptom onset. Early admission of critical patients significantly reduced the duration of hormone therapy. Starting from 9 days of hospital stay, the reduced lymphocyte counts exhibited linear growth. Furthermore, on days 9 and 12, significant correlations were demonstrated between immunological manifestations and duration of hormone therapy in critical patients, and length of hospital stay in severe patients. In addition, the virus negative conversion rate was more significantly correlated with increased lymphocytes in critical patients. Conclusion: Early intervention, within 6 days of symptom onset, benefited patients' recovery from critical illness. The 9-12 days of hospital care represented a valuable window during which to evaluate the therapeutic effects on physical recovery and virus clearance.","Yuan, Jing; Kou, Shanglong; Liang, Yanhua; Lan, JianFeng; Li, Xiaohe; Zeng, Lijiao; Zou, Rongrong; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Pan, Yanchao",J Inflamm Res,,106

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations.METHODSWe retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15, 2020, and May 7, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available.RESULTSWe identified 77 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were recipients of cellular therapy (Allo, 35; Auto, 37; CAR T, 5; median time from cellular therapy, 782 days; IQR, 354-1611 days). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of nonrebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25 of 77) included number of comorbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host disease was not identified among Allo recipients. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients.CONCLUSIONIn this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the antiviral response and immune reconstitution.FUNDINGNIH grant P01 CA23766 and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant P30 CA008748.","Shah, Gunjan L; DeWolf, Susan; Lee, Yeon Joo; Tamari, Roni; Dahi, Parastoo B; Lavery, Jessica A; Ruiz, Josel; Devlin, Sean M; Cho, Christina; Peled, Jonathan U; Politikos, Ioannis; Scordo, Michael; Babady, N Esther; Jain, Tania; Vardhana, Santosha; Daniyan, Anthony; Sauter, Craig S; Barker, Juliet N; Giralt, Sergio A; Goss, Cheryl; Maslak, Peter; Hohl, Tobias M; Kamboj, Mini; Ramanathan, Lakshmi; van den Brink, Marcel Rm; Papadopoulos, Esperanza; Papanicolaou, Genovefa; Perales, Miguel-Angel",J Clin Invest,,106

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Opioids are crucial to the relief of pain and dyspnea experienced by patients dying in the hospital setting; however, there are concerns about the association of opioid dosage with hastened death via opioid-induced respiratory depression, and there is little published evidence regarding the association between opioid dose escalation and time to death in the inpatient comfort measures only (CMO) population. METHODS: The medical records of adult patients admitted to 2 hospitals who had an active CMO order at the time of death and received opioid dose escalations after CMO pronouncement were assessed in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were categorized into higher and lower opioid dose escalation groups according to an institutional palliative care symptom guide. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to test the associations between dose escalation group, patient sex, opioid naivety, palliative care consultation, and opioid dosage after CMO pronouncement (independent variables) and time to death (dependent variable). RESULTS: In the 71-patient cohort, 39 patients (54.9%) were male and 32 (45.1%) were female. The mean (SD) age of patients was 67.2 (16.6) years. Higher dose escalation (n = 46, 64.8%) was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in survival time compared to lower dose escalation (n = 25, 35.2%), with a mean difference in time to death of 19.8 hours (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-2.97). Receipt of a palliative care consult (n = 56, 78.9%) during the final hospital visit was associated with increased survival time (mean difference, 20.1 hours; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63). CONCLUSION: Time to death in an inpatient CMO population was not significantly associated with the degree of opioid dose escalation.","Abraham, Dana L; Hernandez, Inmaculada; Ayers, Gina T; Pruskowski, Jennifer A",Am. j. health system pharm,,106

361219,Change and Innovation in Quality Assurance: Accreditation and the Opportunity of COVID-19,2021,"Crowd counting aims to predict the number of people and generate the density map in the image. There are many challenges, including varying head scales, the diversity of crowd distribution across images and cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale context aggregation network (MSCANet) based on single-column encoder-decoder architecture for crowd counting, which consists of an encoder based on a dense context-aware module (DCAM) and a hierarchical attention-guided decoder. To handle the issue of scale variation, we construct the DCAM to aggregate multi-scale contextual information by densely connecting the dilated convolution with varying receptive fields. The proposed DCAM can capture rich contextual information of crowd areas due to its long-range receptive fields and dense scale sampling. Moreover, to suppress the background noise and generate a high-quality density map, we adopt a hierarchical attention-guided mechanism in the decoder. This helps to integrate more useful spatial information from shallow feature maps of the encoder by introducing multiple supervision based on semantic attention module (SAM). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance than other similar state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmark datasets for crowd counting.

362144,COVID-19 cases prediction in multiple areas via shapelet learning,2021,"Early warning indicators based on critical slowing down have been suggested as a model-independent and low-cost tool to anticipate the (re)emergence of infectious diseases. We studied whether such indicators could reliably have anticipated the second COVID-19 wave in European countries. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we found that characteristic early warning indicators generally decreased rather than increased prior to the second wave. A model explains this unexpected finding as a result of transient dynamics and the multiple time scales of relaxation during a non-stationary epidemic. Particularly, if an epidemic that seems initially contained after a first wave does not fully settle to its new quasi-equilibrium prior to changing circumstances or conditions that force a second wave, then indicators will show a decreasing rather than an increasing trend as a result of the persistent transient trajectory of the first wave. Our simulations show that this lack of time scale separation was to be expected during the second European epidemic wave of COVID-19. Overall, our results emphasize that the theory of critical slowing down applies only when the external forcing of the system across a critical point is slow relative to the internal system dynamics.","Dablander, Fabian; Heesterbeek, Hans; Borsboom, Denny; Drake, John M.",,,106

364776,A Bimodal Lognormal Distribution Model for the Prediction of COVID-19 Deaths,2020,"BACKGROUND Between April and September 2020, there were <10 000 reported cases of COVID-19 in the Masovia district, Poland, and <1000 new cases daily in Poland. During this period, all new hospital admissions to a maternity unit of a teaching hospital in Warsaw were screened for the COVID-19 infection. This retrospective study presents the findings from the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study included 838 women admitted for delivery between April 20 and September 20, 2020. All the admitted women were assigned to a low-risk or a high-risk group for COVID-19 and underwent RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab tests (GeneFinder&#8482;-COVID-19-Plus-RealAmpKit. OSANG Healthcare Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-do, Korea) for COVID-19. The testing protocol included repeated testing in case of inconclusive results or negative results in the symptomatic patients. The maternal and neonatal data from these cases were collected and analyzed. RESULTS All of the 838 women tested negative for COVID-19. Two women (0.24%) were classified as high risk for COVID-19. For 4 (0.48%) women, the results were initially inconclusive and negative when repeated. One hundred and eighty-one (21.5%) women presented with comorbidities, and 60 (7.2%) women were &#8805;40 years old. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study show that between April and September 2020, there were no cases of COVID-19 infections at the maternity unit of a teaching hospital in Warsaw, Poland. However, the infection rates for COVID-19 across Europe continue to change. Testing protocols have been developed and established for all hospital admissions and it is anticipated that testing methods will become more rapid and accurate.","Piekarski, Pawel; Sateja, Malgorzata; Maciejewski, Tomasz; Issat, Tadeusz",Med Sci Monit,,106

365373,The age again in the eye of the COVID-19 storm: evidence-based decision making,2021,"INTRODUCTION: National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) recruitment in the UK is competitive. The process must prioritise patient safety while being credible, impartial and fair. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face interviews were cancelled. Selection was based on a controversial isolated self-assessment score with no evidence checking taking place. From 2021, selection will take place entirely online. Although this has cost and time advantages, new challenges emerge. METHODS: We review surgical selection as it transitions to an online format and suggest validated methods that could be adapted from High Reliability Organisations (HRO). FINDINGS: Virtual selection methods include video interviewing, online examinations and aptitude testing. These tools have been used in business for many years, but their predictive value in surgery is largely unknown. In healthcare, the established online Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) examines generic professional capabilities. Its scope, however, is too limited to be used in isolation. Candidates and interviewers alike may have concerns about the technical aspects of virtual recruitment. The significance of human factors must not be overlooked in the online environment. Surgery can learn from HROs, such as aviation. Pilot and air traffic control selection is integral to ensuring safety. These organisations have already established digital selection methods for psychological aptitude, professional capabilities and manual dexterity. CONCLUSION: National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) can learn from HROs, using validated methods to prioritise patient safety while being acceptable to candidates, trainers and health service recruiters.","Hardie, J A; Green, G; Bor, R; Brennan, P A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,106

365650,My first call on Covid duty,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stresses an urgency to accelerate much-needed health service reform. Rapid and courageous changes being made to address the immediate impact of the pandemic are demonstrating that the means and technology to enable new models of health care exist. For example, innovations such as electronic patient portals (ePortal) can facilitate (a) radical reform of outpatient care; (b) cost containment in the economically constrained aftermath of the pandemic; (c) environmental sustainability by reduction of unnecessary journeys/transport. Herein, the development of Providing Individualised Services and Care in Epilepsy (PiSCES), an ePortal to the Irish National Epilepsy Electronic Patient Record, is demonstrated. This project, which pre-dates the COVID-19 crisis, aims to facilitate better patient- and family-centered epilepsy care. METHODS: A combination of ethnographic research, document analysis, and joint application design sessions was used to elicit PiSCES requirements. From these, a specification of desired modules of functionality was established and guided the software development. RESULTS: PiSCES functional features include ""My Epilepsy Care Summary,"" ""My Epilepsy Care Goals,"" ""My Epilepsy Clinic Letters,"" ""Help Us Measure Your Progress,"" ""Prepare For Your Clinic Visit,"" ""Information for Your Healthcare Provider."" The system provides people with epilepsy access to, and engages them as co-authors of, their own medical record. It can promote improved patient-clinician partnerships and facilitate patient self-management. SIGNIFICANCE: In the aftermath of COVID-19, it is highly unlikely that the healthcare sector will return to a ""business as usual"" way of delivering services. The pandemic is expected to accelerate adoption of innovations like PiSCES. It is therefore a catalyst for change that will deliver care that is more responsive to individual patient needs and preferences.","Power, Kevin; McCrea, Zita; White, Maire; Breen, Annette; Dunleavy, Brendan; O039,; Donoghue, Sean; Jacquemard, Tim; Lambert, Veronica; El-Naggar, Hany; Delanty, Norman; Doherty, Colin; Fitzsimons, Mary",Epilepsia,,106
365914,Rethinking the heteronormative foundations of kinship: the reification of the heterosexual nuclear family unit in Singapore’s COVID-19 circuit-breaker restrictions,2021,"Most countries around the world have responded promptly to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) challenge by adopting considered and scientifically guided strategies for its containment. However, the situation is more complex for nations where malaria is endemic, as they now have the additional burden of COVID-19. In such nations, the healthcare systems are either in the preparatory or containment phase of the current pandemic. This enforced, sudden, and sharp public health refocus is likely to result in the disruption of annual malaria control activities such as distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor residual spraying of insecticide, maintenance of malaria surveillance, and mass provision of antimalarial drugs. Nonetheless, we feel that the best facets of COVID-19 public health management can become new guiding principles in malaria-endemic countries to improve malaria control and hasten malaria elimination. Redirection against malaria of the best public health initiatives used in COVID-19 containment could fast-track the global goal of a malaria-free world. Such public health advancement could be one positive outcome from the scourge of COVID-19.","Rahi, Manju; Das, Payal; Sharma, Amit",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,106

365931,A fractional multi-order model to predict the COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco,2021,"INTRODUCTION: EDs are often the first line of contact with individuals infected with COVID-19 and play a key role in triage. However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. RESULTS: Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease or fever had significantly longer hospital stays (median 5.92 days, 3.08-10.95 vs 3.21, 1.10-5.75, p<0.01) with numerically higher but not significantly different rates of intensive care unit admission (27.02% vs 14.30%, p=0.27) and intubation (12.16% vs 7.14%, p=0.71). DISCUSSION: Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence. However, those with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease and fever may in fact be only 'pseudo-safe' and are most at risk for subsequent hospitalisation with more severe illness and longer hospital stays.","Yuan, Neal; Ji, Hongwei; Sun, Nancy; Botting, Patrick; Nguyen, Trevor; Torbati, Sam; Cheng, Susan; Ebinger, Joseph",Emerg. med. j,,106
366203,A cascade network for Detecting COVID-19 using chest x-rays,2020-05-01,"The paper presents the theoretical considerations on the role of endocrine and metabolic alterations accompanying Covid-19 infection. These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the Covid-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for the entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the down-regulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of Covid-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the Covid-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of Covid-19 strongly depends on the age of a patient. The age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially that of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs careful clinical trials.","Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna",Endokrynol. pol,,106

METHODS: A total of 400 orthopedic trauma surgeons from 14 Latin American countries were invited to complete an electronic survey aiming to understand the general situation of COVID-19 in each country and how COVID-19 had impacted life's participant financially and psychosocially. The relationship between the occurrence of the disease and the existence of legal regulations on the medical activity in the respondent's country, protocols for tracking the disease among patients hospitalized in an emergency basis due to skeletal trauma, and personal protective equipment to deal with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who need orthopedic trauma surgery was investigated, as well as the financial and psychosocial impact caused by the disease. Data was statistically analyzed with significance p < 0.05. RESULTS: 220 respondents completed the survey. 21 respondents were diagnosed with COVID-19. Local regulation was decisive in terms of increasing the risk for COVID-19 disease (p = 0.001). 91.8% of the respondents reported being concerned about their financial health and 57.7% described a state of feeling emotionally overextended. 75.0% believe that pandemic can change their professional activity. CONCLUSION: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America has negatively impacted the professional, financial, and psychosocial health of orthopedic trauma surgeons. It seems reasonable to state that the combination of psychosocial distress and deprivation together with financial uncertainty and decreased revenue can be straightly related to development of burnout symptoms among doctors.","Giordano, Vincenzo; Belangero, William; Godoy-Santos, Alexandre Leme; Pires, Robinson Esteves; Xicará, José Arturo; Labronici, Pedro",Injury,,106

371129,Predicting COVID-19 spread in the face of control measures in West Africa,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 across the world has posed unprecedented and global challenges on multiple fronts. Most of the vaccine and drug development has focused on the spike proteins and viral RNA-polymerases and main protease for viral replication. Using the bioinformatics and structural modelling approach, we modelled the structure of the envelope (E)-protein of novel SARS-CoV-2. The E-protein of this virus shares sequence similarity with that of SARS- CoV-1, and is highly conserved in the N-terminus regions. Incidentally, compared to spike proteins, E proteins demonstrate lower disparity and mutability among the isolated sequences. Using homology modelling, we found that the most favorable structure could function as a gated ion channel conducting H+ ions. Combining pocket estimation and docking with water, we determined that GLU 8 and ASN 15 in the N-terminal region were in close proximity to form H-bonds which was further validated by insertion of the E protein in an ERGIC-mimic membrane. Additionally, two distinct ""core"" structures were visible, the hydrophobic core and the central core, which may regulate the opening/closing of the channel. We propose this as a mechanism of viral ion channeling activity which plays a critical role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In addition, it provides a structural basis and additional avenues for vaccine development and generating therapeutic interventions against the virus.","Sarkar, Manish; Saha, Soham",PLoS One,,106

Over 42 Million people are infected, and 1.14 Million deaths are reported worldwide as on Oct 23, 2020. A deeper understanding of the epidemic suggests that a person's negligence can cause widespread harm that would be difficult to negate. Since no vaccine is yet developed, social distancing must be practiced to detain COVID-19 spread. Therefore, we aim to develop a framework that tracks humans for monitoring the social distancing being practiced. To accomplish this objective of social distance monitoring, an algorithm is developed using object detection method. Here, CNN based object detector is explored to detect human presence. The object detector's output is used for calculating distances between each pair of humans detected. This approach of social distancing algorithm will red mark the persons who are getting closer than a permissible limit. Experimental results prove that CNN based object detectors with our proposed social distancing algorithm exhibit promising outcomes for monitoring social distancing in public areas.","Ansari, Mohd Aquib; Singh, Dushyant Kumar",Int J Inf Technol,,106

We provide a review of a range of epidemic models and explain the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the art of coupling epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. More specifically, fundamental questions in human decision-making amid epidemics such as what interventions are taken to combat the disease, who are decision-makers, when interventions are taken, and how interventions are modeled. Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become increasingly crucial in modeling human responses/behavior amid epidemics in the last decade. In this review, we motivate the game-theoretic approach to human decision-making amid epidemics. This review provides an overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which categorizes existing works based on multiple dimensions, including 1) types of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games; 2) types of interventions, such as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, taking antidotes, etc.; 3) the types of decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid epidemics. From a vast body of works, we showcase three representative works with unique ways of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models. The uniqueness of each of these three works distinguishes themselves from each other regarding their models, analytical approaches, and results. In the end, we identify several main open problems and research gaps left to be addressed and filled.","Huang, Yunhan; Zhu, Quanyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00214v2.pdf,106

A set of recommendations have been prepared based on National and International published scientific literature and recent updates on COVID 19. These has been implemented in our tertiary care centre. Due to the evolving nature of COVID 19 and existing knowledge gaps, these recommendations may have to be revised periodically. The incidence of COVID 19 is very low (1-5%) in the pediatric age group with relatively good prognosis. Pediatric airway surgeries should be restricted to emergency cases only. The decision of postponement of the surgical cases should be taken by the team of senior pediatric airway surgeons. Flexible laryngoscopy should be avoided. Foreign body cases should undergo a computed tomography scan to avoid diagnostic bronchoscopies. All the measures should be taken to prevent direct contact of aerosol so powered instruments should not be used unless mandatory. Protective draping method should be adopted to prevent aerosol exposure. As paediatric airway surgeries are aerosol generating procedure where the risk of contracting COVID 19 by the surgeons and support staff is very high, we suggest recommendations to prevent the contact with infected aerosol.

However, the comparison of such models has not been discussed before. This is the first-ever research wherein the two leading models, susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and logistic are compared. The purpose of this study is to observe their utility, at both the National and Municipal Corporation level in India. Design/methodology/approach: The modified SIR and the logistic were deployed for analysis of the COVID-19 patients’ database of India and three Municipal Corporations, namely, Akola, Kalyan-Dombivli and Mira-Bhayander. The data for the study was collected from the official notifications for COVID-19 released by respective government websites. Findings: This study provides evidence to show the superiority of the modified SIR over the logistic model. The models give accurate predictions for a period up to 14 days. The prediction accuracy of the models is limited due to change in government policies. This can be observed by the drastic increase in the COVID-19 cases after Unlock 1.0 in India. The models have proven that they can effectively predict for both National and Municipal Corporation level database. Practical implications: The modified SIR model can be used to signify the practicality and effectiveness of the decisions taken by the authorities to contain the spread of coronavirus. Originality/value: This study modifies the SIR model and also identifies and fulfills the need to find a more accurate prediction algorithm to help curb the pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bajaj, N.

374595,Animal Welfare and Livestock Supply Chain Sustainability Under the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview,2020,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Computed Tomography (CT) departments have established additional acute capacity whilst maintaining essential services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments. RESULTS: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE. This study has demonstrated that despite variance in practice, radiographers play a key role in identifying and triaging high-risk patients.","Harris, Martine A; Adamson, Helen K; Foster, Beverley",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),,106

The aim of this study is to present how the neurosurgical departments of Emilia-Romagna, a northern Italian region, have re-set their organization to maintain the higher standard of care as possible. METHODS: All OR and out-patients activities performed during the COVID-19 emergency in the neurosurgical department of Emilia-Romagna have been collected and compared to the means of the same timeframe in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: In 2020, 205 surgical procedures and 466 out-patients consultations have been performed, representing respectively 28.8% and 26.4% of the previous biennium. The most of OR procedures had been emergencies/urgencies and oncological patients (respectively 113 and 66 vs 164.5 and 84.5 of the previous biennium), while elective surgeries decrease up to -97.1%, as for spinal nerves and endoscopic skull base procedures. The patients phone contacts and telemedicine evaluations of their examinations have permitted to reduce the hospital access for outpatients of 75.6%, but these modalities have, also, permitted to follow-up a large number of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of COVID-19 has imposed several limits to our current practice, however this should not represent an excuse to reduce the standard of care. In our experience, the net integration of different local centers has permitted for each of them to effectively cope the crisis, managing the local cases requiring a prompt surgery and keeping the care continuity with already discharged patients.","Mazzatenta, Diego; Zoli, Matteo; Cavallo, Michele A; Ferro, Salvatore; Giombelli, Ermanno; Pavesi, Giacomo; Sturiale, Carmelo; Tosatto, Luigino; Zucchelli, Mino",J. neurosurg. sci,,106

Candidates for these natural therapies against COVID-19 should show certain effects, such as restoring mitochondrial function and cellular redox balance. This would allow reducing the susceptibility of risk groups and the cascade of events after SARS-CoV-2 infection, responsible for the clinical picture, triggered by the imbalance towards oxidation, inflammation, and cytokine storm. Possible strategies to follow through the use of substances of food origin would include: a) the promotion of mitophagy to remove dysfunctional mitochondria originating from free radicals, proton imbalance and virus evasion of the immune system; b) the administration of transition metals whose redox activity would lead to their own oxidation and the consequent generation of a reduced environment, which would normalize the oxidative state and the intracellular pH; c) the administration of molecules with demonstrated antioxidant capacity; d) the administration of compounds with anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory activity; e) the administration of immunomodulatory compounds.","Quiles, José L; Rivas-García, Lorenzo; Varela-López, Alfonso; Llopis, Juan; Battino, Maurizio; Sánchez-González, Cristina",Environ Res,,106

378808,What the Regions Can Do to Overcome Stagnation and Rekindle Significant Socioeconomic Growth,2020,"3D Cell culture is an alternative to animal use in many drug development and toxicity studies. The 3D cell culture can mimic and reproduce the original tissue microenvironment, morphology, and mechanical and physiological characteristics, to provide a more realistic and reliable response as compared to two-dimensional cultures. 3D cell culture encapsulated in alginate beads is a very simple and relatively inexpensive tool that is easy to handle and to maintain. The alginate beads function as a scaffold that imprisons cells and allows 3D cell growth, to generate spheroids that can have greater genic expression and cell-cell communication as a nano or microtissue. The HepG2 cell line is a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell derivative. HepG2 cells preserve several of the characteristics of hepatocytes and are therefore often used in toxicity studies. Here, we describe HepG2 cell encapsulation in alginate beads and analyze the resulting spheroids formed within the alginate beads by immunocytochemistry, by staining a certain structure with a specific antibody coupled with a fluorophore. This method preserves the beads and enables cell analysis by confocal microscopy.","Miranda, Raul Ghiraldelli; Ferraz, Elisa Raquel Anastácio; Pereira, Lilian Cristina; Dorta, Daniel Junqueira",Methods Mol Biol,,106

379973,Covid-19: UK officials try to trace unidentified case of Brazil variant,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recently, the availability and usefulness of mobile self-help mental health applications have increased, but few applications deal with COVID-19-related psychological problems. This study explored the intervention efficacy of a mobile application on addressing psychological problems related to COVID-19. METHODS: A longitudinal control trial involving 129 Chinese participants with depression symptoms was conducted through the mobile application ""Care for Your Mental Health and Sleep during COVID-19"" (CMSC) based on WeChat. Participants were divided into two groups: mobile internet cognitive behavioral therapy (MiCBT) and wait-list. The primary outcome was improvement in depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes included improvement in anxiety and insomnia. The MiCBT group received three self-help CBT intervention sessions in one week via CMSC. RESULTS: The MiCBT group showed significant improvement in depression and insomnia (allP < 0.05) compared with the wait-list group. Although both groups showed significant improvement in anxiety at the intervention's end, compared with the wait-list group, the MiCBT group had no significant advantage. Correlation analysis showed that improvement in depression and anxiety had a significant positive association with education level. Changes in insomnia were significantly negatively correlated with anxiety of COVID-19 at the baseline. CMSC was considered helpful (n=68, 81.9 %) and enjoyable (n=54, 65.9 %) in relieving depression and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CMSC is verified to be effective and convenient for improving COVID-19-related depression and insomnia symptoms. A large study with sufficient evidence is required to determine its continuous effect on reducing mental health problems during the pandemic.","Song, Jiaqi; Jiang, Ronghuan; Chen, Nan; Qu, Wei; Liu, Dan; Zhang, Meng; Fan, Hongzhen; Zhao, Yanli; Tan, Shuping",Asian J Psychiatr,,106

In this narrative review, we illustrate how telemedicine technologies are increasingly integrated into pediatric infectious disease programs with the aim of facilitating access to specialist care and reducing costs. There is widespread use of telemedicine for the management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, particularly in countries in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas, far from third-level hospital centers located in large urban centers. Obviously, telemedicine is also used in developed countries, and its importance has been further increased recently given the COVID-19 pandemic. It has many advantages for patients, such as saving time, money and working hours, and reducing cancelled appointments and delays, while there are also many advantages for doctors, allowing collaborations with specialists and continuous updating. Among the disadvantages are the limitation in carrying out an objective examination, which is particularly important for children under 2 years of age, and the need for cutting-edge technology and reliable connectivity. Telemedicine increasingly represents the future and the beginning of a new healthcare system that also will redefine medical care for the treatment of infectious diseases, both acute and chronic. However, the majority of the experience has involved adults, and its validation in pediatric care, as well as its application in real-life practices, are urgently needed.","Pappalardo, Marco; Fanelli, Umberto; Chiné, Vincenzo; Neglia, Cosimo; Gramegna, Andrea; Argentiero, Alberto; Esposito, Susanna",,,106

382061,Five ways to tackle PhD research anxieties triggered by COVID-19 lockdowns,2020,"BACKGROUND: Home food procurement (HFP) (i.e. gardening, fishing, foraging, hunting, backyard livestock and canning) have historically been important ways that people obtain food. Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries. METHODS: We examine HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n = 600) of residents of Vermont, United States. RESULTS: We find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and higher prevalence of food insecurity among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Nearly 35% of respondents engaged in HFP activities since the COVID-19 pandemic began; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic or for the first time. Food insecure households were more likely to pursue HFP more intensely, including more gardening, fishing, foraging, and hunting. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP during the COVID-19 pandemic. HFP was significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables; however, this effect was only significant for food secure households. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households. However, HFP for food insecure households does not translate into the same higher fruit and vegetable intake as found among food secure HFP households, suggesting this population may be trying to maintain intake, or that they may have potential important resource or technical assistance needs. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.","Niles, Meredith T; Wirkkala, Kristen Brassard; Belarmino, Emily H; Bertmann, Farryl",BMC Public Health,,106
382097,The Role of Media During COVID-19 Global Outbreak: A Conservation Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Normal background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) is a dynamic parameter affected by multiple factors. PURPOSE: To determine whether contrast agent injection rate affects the degree of BPE in women undergoing breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 85 patients included in our prospective study randomly received 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol at a rate of 3 mL/s (group A; n = 46) or 2 mL/s (group B; n = 39). Breast MRI was performed at 3T using a standard protocol including postcontrast axial 3D GRE T1-weighted sequences. Two expert breast radiologists, blinded to clinical and radiological information, independently quantified BPE on early postcontrast subtracted images, assigning a score of 1-4. Mean comparison and regression analysis were performed to assess the influence of injection rate on BPE. RESULTS: Groups were homogeneous in terms of age and final BI-RADS score. The mean BPE score was significantly lower among patients in group A (mean of two readers: 1.36 vs. 1.90; P < 0.01) with 70%-72% of patients assigned a BPE score of 1, compared with 36%-38% of patients in group B. Lower BPE scores were noted with the higher flow rate in subgroup analyses of both pre- and postmenopausal women, although the effect was more evident in premenopausal women. Regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood of a BPE 1 score was significantly increased with a higher flow rate (P < 0.01). The inter-reader agreement was excellent (0.83). CONCLUSION: A higher contrast agent injection flow rate (3 mL/s) during breast MRI significantly reduces the degree of BPE, potentially allowing improved diagnostic accuracy by reducing false-positive and false-negative findings.","Marzocca, Flaminia; Moffa, Giuliana; Landi, Valerio Nispi; Panzironi, Giovanna; Kirchin, Miles A; Pediconi, Federica; Galati, Francesca",Acta Radiol,,106
382098,The Role of Media During COVID-19 Global Outbreak: A Conservation Perspective,2021,INTRODUCTION: Efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be an invaluable tool for pandemic control. Current instructions specify that the collection swab should be transported within its collection media to the laboratory. Developing a process whereby this swab is removed before transport to the lab would allow for improved automation and decreased manual manipulation of samples. METHODS: A proof of principle approach was taken by eluting viral particles from flocked swabs into collection buffer with and without a mucus background. Paired swab-free and swab-containing samples were transported to the laboratory and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 28) or RNaseP (n = 6). SARS-CoV-2 amplification was performed using the Hologic Panther Fusion Aptima and RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all proof of principle samples with Ct values indicative of dilution. The rare exception was for a few samples where the dilution pushed the viral load below the LOD. Paired samples were 100% concordant for SARS-CoV-2 and RNaseP detection. CONCLUSION: Discarding the swab after inoculating the transport buffer is an appropriate preanalytical modification. Adopting this approach can save up to 1 minute per sample. For labs processing more than 500 samples per day this equates to 1 full time equivalent shift per day.,"Greene, D. N.; Matthys, T.; Lockwood, C. M.",The Journal of Applied Laboratory Medicine,,106

382493,The return-to-work conundrum,2020,"One of the unprecedented measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic was to close borders across the world. In Europe, the closing of national borders was perceived as particularly controversial because of the emphasis on the free movement of labor and citizens across borders within the European Union. Here, we examine the level of support for border closings among citizens from eight Western democracies, how support developed over time, and how particular COVID-19-related concerns and considerations predict individual differences in support. Specifically, we collected data on support for tightened border security from 9 April 2020 until 19 December 2020 in quota-sampled online surveys in Denmark, Sweden, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Hungary. Eight Western democracies that differ in their response to and the impact of COVID-19 (N = 67,679). Overall, the data show moderate to high levels of support for tightened border security across all observed countries, with substantial within-country variation. Furthermore, the analyses show that support for border security relates to both usual predictors of anti-immigration views and corona-specific considerations, in particular, personal concerns about the adverse effects of COVID-19 and attributions of blame to international actors such as China and WHO.

383534,COVID and the Year of the Nurse and Nurse Midwife,2021,"Background: The immunization of healthcare workers (HCWs) plays a recognized key role in prevention in the COVID-19 pandemic: in Italy, the vaccination campaign began at the end of December 2020. A better knowledge of the on-field immune response in HCWs, of adverse effects and of the main factors involved is fundamental. Methods: We performed a study on workers at a nursing home in Northern Italy, vaccinated in January–February 2021 with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine four weeks apart, instead of the three weeks provided for in the original manufacturer protocol. One month after the second dose, the serological titer of IgG-neutralizing anti-RBD antibodies of the subunit S1 of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was determined. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects and adverse effects of vaccination were collected by questionnaire. Results: In all of the workers, high antibody titer, ranging between 20 and 760 times the minimum protective level were observed. Titers were significantly higher in subjects with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Adverse effects after the vaccine were more frequent after the second dose, but no severe adverse effects were observed. Conclusions: The two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, even if administered four weeks apart, induced high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG in all the operators included in the study.","Modenese, Alberto Paduano Stefania Bargellini Annalisa Bellucci Rossana Marchetti Simona Bruno Fulvio Grazioli Pietro Vivoli Roberto Gobba Fabriziomaria",Vaccines,,106

384820,COVID-19: Something New Under the Sun?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has enabled the rapid, unbiased detection and identification of microbes without pathogen-specific reagents, culturing, or a priori knowledge of the microbial landscape. mNGS data analysis requires a series of computationally intensive processing steps to accurately determine the microbial composition of a sample. Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments. FINDINGS: We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","Kalantar, Katrina L; Carvalho, Tiago; de Bourcy, Charles F A; Dimitrov, Boris; Dingle, Greg; Egger, Rebecca; Han, Julie; Holmes, Olivia B; Juan, Yun-Fang; King, Ryan; Kislyuk, Andrey; Lin, Michael F; Mariano, Maria; Morse, Todd; Reynoso, Lucia V; Cruz, David Rissato; Sheu, Jonathan; Tang, Jennifer; Wang, James; Zhang, Mark A; Zhong, Emily; Ahyong, Vida; Lay, Sreyngim; Chea, Sophana; Bohl, Jennifer A; Manning, Jessica E; Tato, Cristina M; DeRisi, Joseph L",Gigascience,,106

387420,Optimal control techniques based on infection age for the study of the COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"Infection of the alveolar epithelium constitutes a bottleneck in the progression of COVID-19 to SARS presumably due to the paucity of viral entry receptors in alveolar epithelial type 1 and 2 cells. We have found that the male alveolar epithelial cells express twice as many ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry receptors as the female ones. Intriguingly, IFN and TNF- signaling are preferentially active in male alveolar cells and induce binding of the cognate transcription factors to the promoters and lung-active enhancers of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Cotreatment with IFN-I and III dramatically increases expression of the receptors and viral entry in alveolar epithelial cells. TNF and IFN-II, typically overproduced during the cytokine storm, similarly collaborate to induce these events. Whereas JAK inhibitors suppress viral entry induced by IFN-I/III, simultaneous inhibition of IKK/NF-{kappa}B is necessary to block viral entry induced by TNF and IFN-II. In addition to explaining the increased incidence of SARS in males, these findings indicate that SARS-Cov-2 hijacks epithelial immune signaling to promote infection of the alveolar epithelium and suggest that JAK inhibitors, singly and in combination with NF-KB inhibitors, may exhibit efficacy in preventing or treating COVID-19 SARS.","Giancotti, Filippo; Wang, Yan; Gurrapu, Sreeharsha; Chen, Hong; Laudato, Sara; Caggiano, Emily; Jiang, Yan; Ling, Hsiang-Hsi",,,106
387421,Optimal control techniques based on infection age for the study of the COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"The impact of physical exercise on emotional well-being is one of the most important factors that drive sustained physical activity engagement. It is also one of the least studied topics on account of the rather elaborated setups required to quantify emotional expression during exercise. The wide adoption of at-home, physical exercise solutions has compounded this problem due to the secluded nature of these activities. We propose here a new methodology that would allow for mass emotional expression and physical activity data gathering using publicly available sources such as at-home exercise videos. We have shown that the methodology is robust enough to extract high resolution, reliable data from home videos posted on popular video share sites. The source-code and instructions for practical use are published online such that researchers can access data pertinent to emotional response during exertion in real world situations with applicability for prospective and retrospective studies.","Khurana, Rohit; Coza, Aurel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05843v1.pdf,106

Enfin, nous avons aussi relevé les facteurs associés à un état psychologique dégradé ou au contraire stable ou une meilleure qualité de vie. Les résultats indiquent que l’état psychologique des enfants et adolescents notamment en population non-clinique est marqué par des taux élevés de symptômes émotionnels, anxieux et dépressifs. Chez les enfants et adolescents ayant un trouble mental connu, les données semblent plus variables. Parmi les facteurs associés, l’isolement social, la perturbation des rythmes physiques et scolaires, le climat relationnel familial sont plus souvent identifiés que les craintes spécifiquement liées à la pandémie. Nos données sont discutées en tenant compte des limites liées aux méthodes utilisées et des populations étudiées.

We included studies from the general population and from young people followed-up in clinical centers or having a previous psychiatric disorder. Whenever possible, we also documented the factors associated with changes in mental health and quality of life. Results show high levels of emotional distress with anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, especially in studies of non-clinical samples. In children with previous mental conditions, results are more variable. Factors often associated with high levels of emotional symptoms are social isolation, disruption of school and physical rhythms, and familial relationships and conflicts. These factors are mentioned more frequently than worries about specific COVID-related issues.

387873,COVID-19 - eine Bewährungsprobe,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a disaster due to not only its psychosocial impact but it also to its direct effects on the brain. The latest evidence suggests it has neuroinvasive mechanisms, in addition to neurological manifestations, and as seen in past pandemics, long-term sequelae are expected. Specific and well-structured interventions are necessary, and that's why it's important to ensure a continuity between primary care, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. Evidence shows that 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) survivors developed persistent psychiatric comorbidities after the infection, in addition to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. A proper stratification of patients according not only to psychosocial factors but also an inflammatory panel and SARS-Cov-2's direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system, may improve outcomes. The complexity of COVID-19's pathology and the impact on the brain requires appropriate screening that has to go beyond the psychosocial impact, taking into account how stress and neuroinflammation affects the brain. This is a call for a clinical multidisciplinary approach to treat and prevent Sars-Cov-2 mental health sequelae.","Pallanti, Stefano; Grassi, Eleonora; Makris, Nikos; Gasic, Gregory P; Hollander, Eric",J Psychiatr Res,,106

Exploring risk and immigration detention,2020,"To describe the delivery of care for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) from the perspective of rheumatologists in the Netherlands during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed methods design was used with quantitative and qualitative data from a cross-sectional survey sent to all members of the Dutch Rheumatology Society in May 2020. The survey contained questions on demographics, the current way of care delivery, and also on usage, acceptance, facilitators and barriers of telemedicine. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. The answers to the open questions were categorized into themes. Seventy-five respondents completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, continuity of care was guaranteed through telephone and video consultations by 99% and 9% of the respondents, respectively. More than 80% of the total number of outpatient visits were performed exclusively via telephone with in-person visits only on indication. One-quarter of the respondents used patient reported outcomes to guide telephone consultations. The top three facilitators for telemedicine were less travel time for patients, ease of use of the system and shorter waiting period for patients. The top three barriers were impossibility to perform physical examination, difficulty estimating how the patient is doing and difficulty in reaching patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, care for patients with RMDs in the Netherlands continued uninterrupted by the aid of telemedicine. On average, respondents were content with current solutions, although some felt insecure mainly because of the inability to perform physical examination and missing nonverbal communication with their patients.","Bos, Wouter H; van Tubergen, Astrid; Vonkeman, Harald E",Rheumatol Int,,106

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, initial CXR of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were investigated. A commercialized deep learning-based CAD system that can identify various abnormalities on CXR was implemented for the interpretation of CXR in daily practice. The diagnostic performance of radiologists with CAD assistance were evaluated based on two different reference standards: 1) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results for COVID-19 and 2) pulmonary abnormality suggesting pneumonia on chest CT. The turnaround times (TATs) of radiology reports for CXR and rRT-PCR results were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 332 patients (male:female, 173:159; mean age, 57 years) with available rRT-PCR results, 16 patients (4.8%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Using CXR, radiologists with CAD assistance identified rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients with sensitivity and specificity of 68.8% and 66.7%, respectively. Among 119 patients (male:female, 75:44; mean age, 69 years) with available chest CTs, radiologists assisted by CAD reported pneumonia on CXR with a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 72.3%. The TATs of CXR reports were significantly shorter than those of rRT-PCR results (median 51 vs. 507 minutes; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Radiologists with CAD assistance could identify patients with rRT-PCR-positive COVID-19 or pneumonia on CXR with a reasonably acceptable performance. In patients suspected with COVID-19, CXR had much faster TATs than rRT-PCRs.","Hwang, Eui Jin; Kim, Hyungjin; Yoon, Soon Ho; Goo, Jin Mo; Park, Chang Min",Korean J Radiol,,106

389778,What it's really like to do science amid COVID-19,2020,"Vaccination is a key protective factor against COVID-19. Some vaccines have already received emergency authorization from Health Agencies, but growing skepticism and vaccine hesitancy will probably affect COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the attempt to shed light on this issue, we conducted an online survey in a population of parents referring to 4 pediatric practices in Naples, Italy in whom we evaluated potential vaccine acceptability in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, perception of personal health and of the impact of COVID-19, and attitudes toward general vaccination practices. Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to safety concerns. Demographic and educational factors were correlated to vaccine acceptability. Health education and communication strategies are needed to achieve large-scale vaccine acceptability and finally herd immunity.","Fedele, Flora; Aria, Massimo; Esposito, Valeria; Micillo, Maria; Cecere, Gaetano; Spano, Maria; De Marco, Giulio",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,106

Therefore, we identified cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in children younger than three years of age and investigated the occurrence of infection before and after the introduction of RV vaccines. An ecological study through prospective surveillance was conducted in four pediatric clinics in Shibata City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, during the 2011 to 2018 RVGE epidemic seasons. We divided the study period into three eras: pre-vaccine introduction era (2011), low-mid coverage transitional era (2012 to 2014, RV vaccine coverage rate: 32.9-56.5%), and high coverage plateau era (2015 to 2018, 67.7-81.7%). In this study, the incidence rate of severe RVGE was significantly lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccine introduction and transitional eras. Furthermore, the hospitalization rate due to RVGE in Shibata City was lower in the plateau era than in the pre-vaccination introduction and transitional eras. The number of hospitalizations due to RVGE in subjects who required or did not require intravenous rehydration at the pediatric clinics significantly decreased with the increase in vaccine coverage rates by more than 70% in the plateau era.","Oishi, Tomohiro; Matsunaga, Masamichi; Nakano, Tokushi; Sudo, Shoji; Kuwajima, Hiroaki; Tokuriki, Shuko; Study, Shibata Rvge",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,106

The crude fatality rate per 1000 person-weeks was 64.8% higher among indigenous than among non-indigenous people (29.97 vs. 18.18, respectively), and it increased more than twice within outpatients (5.99 vs. 2.64, respectively). Cox analysis revealed that indigenous people who received outpatient management had higher fatality rate than non-indigenous outpatients, at the national level (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-1.98), within the subgroup of 13 states (HR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.33-2.07), and in the South Pacific region (HR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.49-3.69). Factors associated with higher fatality rates among non-indigenous and indigenous outpatients were age, sex, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 fatality is higher among indigenous populations, particularly within cases managed as outpatients.","Argoty-Pantoja, A D; Robles-Rivera, K; Rivera-Paredez, B; Salmerón, J",Public Health,,106

395890,Serving the need of people: The case for servant leadership against populism,2021,"Since the discovery of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease caused by the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathology showed different faces. There is an increasing number of cases described as (meningo)encephalitis although evidence often lacks. Anosmia, another atypical form of COVID-19, has been considered as testimony of the potential of neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2, though this hypothesis remains highly speculative. We did a review of the cases reported as brain injury caused by SARS-CoV-2. Over 98 papers found, 21 were analyzed. Only four publications provided evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the central nervous system (CNS). When facing acute neurological abnormalities during an infectious episode it is often difficult to disentangle neurological symptoms induced by the brain infection and those due to the impact of host immune response on the CNS. Cytokines release can disturb neural cells functioning and can have in the most severe cases vascular and cytotoxic effects. An inappropriate immune response can lead to the production of auto-antibodies directed toward CNS components. In the case of proven SARS-CoV-2 brain invasion, the main hypothesis found in the literature focus on a neural pathway, especially the direct route via the nasal cavity, although the virus is likely to reach the CNS using other routes. Our ability to come up with hypotheses about the mechanisms by which the virus might interact with the CNS may help to keep in mind that all neurological symptoms observed during COVID-19 do not always rely on CNS viral invasion.","Pouga, Lydia",J. med. virol,,106
396096,"Burns during the epidemic, what changed?",2021,"Most infectious diseases are zoonotic, ""jumping"" from animals to humans, with COVID-19 no exception. Although many zoonotic transmissions occur on industrial-scale factory farms, public discussions mainly blame wild animal (""wet"") markets or focus on reactionary solutions, posing a psychological obstacle to preventing future pandemics. In two pre-registered studies early in the 2020 pandemic, we examined whether British adults fail to recognize factory farming in causing epidemics, and whether such dismissal represents motivated cognition. Cross-sectional data (Study 1, N = 302) confirmed that people blame factory farms and global meat consumption less than wild animal trade and consumption or lack of government preparedness, especially among meat-committed persons. Experimental exposure (Study 2, N = 194) to information blaming factory farms (vs. wild animal markets) produced lower endorsement of preventive solutions than of reactionary solutions, which was exacerbated among meat-committed persons. These findings suggest that people, especially those highly committed to eating meat, willfully disregard solutions targeting animal agriculture and global meat consumption to prevent future pandemics precisely because such solutions implicate their dietary habits. Better understanding motivated beliefs about the causes of and solutions to pandemics is critical for developing interventions.","Dhont, Kristof; Piazza, Jared; Hodson, Gordon",Appetite,,106

396285,2020 Division: a Bad Year for Humility,2020,"Mechanical impact stress on the vocal fold surface, particularly when excessive, has been postulated to cause the so-called phonotraumatic tissue lesions, such as nodules and polyps. The collision stress between the vocal folds depends on the vocal fold velocity at the time of impact. Hence this vocal fold collision speed is a relevant parameter when considering biomechanical economy of phonation, especially in voice professionals needing a louder voice than normal. Combining a precise photometric measurement of glottal area and simultaneous measurements of translaryngeal impedance (electroglottogram) for identifying the time of the maximum rate of increase of vocal fold contact allows computing the vocal fold collision speed in a wide range of loudnesses. The vocal fold collision speed is - for modal voicing - always smaller than the maximum vocal fold velocity during the closing phase, but it strongly increases with intensity. Moreover, this increase shows a biphasic pattern, with a significant enhancement from a certain value of dB on. Understanding physiological variables that influence vocal fold collision forces provides relevant insight into the pathophysiology and the prevention of voice disorders associated with phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction.","DeJonckere, Philippe Henri; Lebacq, Jean",J. voice,,106

396665,GPNs are fundamental to the safe delivery of immunisations,2021,"Introduction: Reductions in hospital visits for stroke have been seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly reflecting perceived risks of in-hospital care. We recently implemented an evidence-based protocol for outpatient rapid evaluation of transient and minor, non-disabling stroke symptoms for patients seeking care 24 hours after symptom onset. We present our early experience through the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients evaluated in the RESCUE-TIA (Rapid Evaluation of minor Stroke and CerebrovascUlar Events including TIA) clinic from December 2019- August 2020. The clinic sees patients with TIA symptoms or with fixed, non-disabling deficits seeking care &gt; 24 hours after symptom onset. We introduced telemedicine in March 2020. Magnetic resonance brain and vascular imaging is available within 24 hours of visit. We summarized patient characteristics and quality data with standard descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 21 patients were seen in the RESCUE-TIA clinic, including 15 patients during the height of the pandemic in NY;67% were seen by telemedicine. The median age was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR], 61-82), and 71% were women. The median NIH Stroke Score for patients with minor stroke was 0 (IQR, 0-1), and the median ABCD score for TIA patients was 3 (IQR, 2-3). Median time from symptom onset to evaluation was 3 days (IQR, 2.5-17.5). Median time from evaluation to laboratory diagnostics was 8 hours (IQR, 2-21), and to completion of imaging was 1 day (IQR, 0-5). Outpatient telemetry commenced in a median of 5 days (IQR, 1-9), and echocardiography was completed in a median of 8 days (IQR, 0-10). One patient was referred to the emergency room for a carotid occlusion. Final diagnoses were TIA (n=12), ischemic stroke (n=5), transient global amnesia (n=2), migraine (n=1), and non-aneurysmal, distal subarachnoid hemorrhage (n=1). Secondary prevention was initiated or optimized in 94% of TIA and stroke patients. Recurrent TIA occurred in 1 patient after 67 days, and ischemic stroke occurred in 1 patient 55 days after TIA. Conclusion: Timely outpatient evaluation of patients with recent TIA and minor, non-disabling stroke is feasible and may be useful during the pandemic, especially during emergency room crowding.","Wechsler, P.; Navi, B.

Materials and Methods: A review of the literature was carried out to collect data on the strategies used by China, Italy, India, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The global analysis of 65 published literature references allowed observing the effectiveness and efficiency of the strategies used by these countries to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Results: Both mitigation and suppression strategies were adopted by the United Kingdom, India, Italy, China, and Saudi Arabia to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was observed that China has achieved a greater success in flattening the curve compared to the other countries. In China, few new daily cases have occurred since March, and it has been the only country that has managed to keep the COVID-19 pandemic under control. On the other hand, reductions in the number of daily cases (since May 2020) were detected in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Saudi Arabia (since July 2020). Also, during the last 3 months (June, July and August) India has shown the highest growth in the total number of confirmed cases and in the number of new daily cases, compared to the mentioned countries. Conclusion: The review of the strategies adopted by China, India, the United Kingdom, Italy and Saudi Arabia to combat the COVID-19 pandemic can guide countries in the design and development of mitigation and suppression approaches to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Containment strategies such as lockdowns cannot continue in the long term. Therefore, countries must adopt mitigation and prevention strategies to protect people from infection and learn to live with the virus.","Alanezi, Fahad; Aljahdali, Anan; Alyousef, Seham M; Alrashed, Hebah; Mushcab, Hayat; AlThani, Bashair; Alghamedy, Fatemah; Alotaibi, Hessa; Saadah, Amjad; Alanzi, Turki",J Healthc Leadersh,,106

METHODS: One hundred twenty one children and adolescents along with their parents were interviewed regarding their compliance and psychological distress during the quarantine period. A comparable data was also obtained from 131 children and adolescents who were not quarantined. RESULTS: Most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant as compliance with all requirements was low (7.43%), though compliance with community protective measures (17.35%) was better than compliance with household protective measures (10.71%). Quarantined children and adolescents experienced greater psychological distress than non-quarantined children and adolescents (p Ë0.001). Worry (68.59%), helplessness (66.11%) and fear (61.98%) were the most common feelings experienced under quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: The low compliance with quarantine requirements as seen in this study raises a serious concern about the effectiveness of quarantine as a preventive measure of disease transmission.

We estimated the incidence of outpatient illness due to 12 different viruses during November 2018 through April 2019 in a fully enumerated population. METHODS: We conducted active surveillance for ambulatory care visits for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among members of Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA). Enrolled patients provided respiratory swab specimens which were tested for 12 respiratory viruses using RT-PCR. We estimated the cumulative incidence of infection due to each virus overall and by age group. RESULTS: The KPWA population under surveillance included 202,562 individuals, of whom 2,767 (1.4%) were enrolled in the study. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus, with an overall incidence 21 medically attended illnesses per 1,000 population; the next most common viruses were influenza A(H1N1) (18 per 1,000), coronaviruses (13 per 1,000), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 13 per 1,000), and rhinovirus (9 per 1,000). RSV was the most common cause of medically attended ARI among children aged 1-4 years; coronaviruses were the most common among adults aged &#8805;65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other studies focused on single viruses, we found that influenza and RSV were major causes of acute respiratory illness in persons of all ages. In comparison, coronaviruses and rhinovirus were also important pathogens. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses were the second-most common cause of medically attended ARI during the 2018/19 influenza season.","Jackson, Michael L; Starita, Lea; Kiniry, Erika; Phillips, C Hallie; Wellwood, Stacie; Cho, Shari; Kiavand, Anahita; Truong, Melissa; Han, Peter; Richardson, Matthew; Wolf, Caitlin R; Heimonen, Jessica; Nickerson, Deborah A; Chu, Helen Y",Clin. infect. dis,,106
398857,Propagation analysis and prediction of the COVID-19,2020-03-15,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic threatens our current ICU capabilities nationwide. As the number of COVID-19 positive patients across the nation continues to increase, the need for options to address ventilator shortages is inevitable. Multi-patient ventilation (MPV), in which more than one patient can use a single ventilator base unit, has been proposed as a potential solution to this problem. To our knowledge, this option has been discussed but remains untested in live patients with differing severity of lung pathology. METHODS: The objective of this study was to address ventilator shortages and patient stacking limitations by developing and validating a modified breathing circuit for two patients with differing lung compliances using simple, off-the-shelf components. A multi-patient ventilator circuit (MPVC) was simulated with a mathematical model and validated with four animal studies. Each animal study had two human-sized pigs: one healthy and one with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ARDS. LPS was chosen because it lowers lung compliance similar to COVID-19. In a previous study, a control group of four pigs was given ARDS and placed on a single patient ventilation circuit (SPVC). The oxygenation of the MPVC ARDS animals was then compared to the oxygenation of the SPVC animals. RESULTS: Based on the comparisons, similar oxygenation and morbidity rates were observed between the MPVC ARDS animals and the SPVC animals. CONCLUSION: As healthcare systems worldwide deal with inundated ICUs and hospitals from pandemics, they could potentially benefit from this approach by providing more patients with respiratory care.","Wankum, Benjamin P; Reynolds, Riley E; McCain, Andrea R; Zollinger, Nathaniel T; Buesing, Keely L; Sindelar, Russel D; Freihaut, Frank M; Fekadu, Tariku; Terry, Benjamin S",J. anesth,,106

The study seeks to identify the dysfunction pattern in suicide brain for BD-II patients. METHODS: Graph theory was utilized to explore topological properties at whole-brain, module and region levels based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data, which acquired from 38 un-medicated BD-II patients with at least one SA, 60 none SA (NSA) patients and 69 healthy controls (HCs). Finally, the correlation relationship between graph metrics and clinical variables were estimated. RESULTS: Compared with NSA patients and HCs, the functional connectivity strength between limbic/sub-cortical (LIMB/SubC) and frontoparietal network (FPN) were significantly weakened. Nodal strength in left head of caudate nucleus (HCN), raphe nucleus (RN), right nucleus accumbens (NAcc), right subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) and nodal efficiency in right sgACC, right HCN for SA patients were significantly reduced relative to NSA and HCs. In particular, nodal strength in RN and nodal efficiency in right sgACC showed a significant negative correlation with Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scores. LIMITATIONS: This is a single-mode cross-sectional study, the results were not verified by multi-center data. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal disrupted FC between LIMB/SubC and FPN is associated with SA in BD-II patients, which increased the susceptibility of suicide. Especially, the dysfunction in RN and right sgACC predict a higher suicide risk in BD-II patients.The results can help us to understand the suicide mechanism and early judgment of suicidal behaviors for BD-II patients.","Wang, Huan; Zhu, Rongxin; Dai, Zhongpeng; Tian, Shui; Shao, Junneng; Wang, Xinyi; Sun, Yurong; Chen, Zhilu; Li, Xuesong; Yao, Zhijian; Lu, Qing",J Affect Disord,,106

Any disruption to these activities, like the one during the Covid-19 pandemic, can lead to adverse health outcomes, especially among children. Policymakers and other stakeholders must balance the need for continuing the feeding programs while ensuring the health and safety of workers engaged in the operations. This has led to several innovations that leverage advanced technologies like AI and IOT to monitor the health and safety of workers and ensure hygienic operations. However, there are practical challenges in its implementation on a large scale. This paper presents an implementation framework to build resilient public feeding programs using a combination of intelligent technologies. The framework is a result of piloting the technology solution at a facility run as part of a large mid-day meal feeding program in India.

400867,Smittevern og hudutfordringer ved covid-19,2020,"In the present study, I propose a novel fitting method to describe the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China. The fitted data were selected carefully from the non-Hubei part and Hubei Province of China respectively. For the non-Hubei part, the time period of data collection corresponds from the beginning of the policy of isolation to present day. But for Hubei Province, the subjects of Wuhan City and Hubei Province were included from the time of admission to the Huoshenshan Hospital to present day in order to ensure that all or the majority of the confirmed and suspected patients were collected for diagnosis and treatment. The employed basic functions for fitting are the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh ( . ) since in these cases the 2019-nCoV is just an epidemic. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV will initially expand rapidly and tend to disappear. Therefore, the numbers of the accumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and geographical regions will initially increase rapidly and subsequently stabilize to a plateau phase. The selection of the basic functions for fitting is crucial. In the present study, I found that the hyperbolic tangent functions tanh ( . ) could satisfy the aforementioned properties. By this novel method, I can obtain two significant results. They base on the conditions that the rigorous isolation policy is executed continually. Initially, I can predict the numbers very accurately of the cumulative confirmed patients in different cities, provinces and parts in China, notably, in Wuhan City with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.021 % , in Hubei Province with the smallest relative error estimated to 0.012 % and in the non-Hubei part of China with the smallest relative error of - 0.195% in the short-term period of infection. In addition, perhaps I can predict the times when the plateau phases will occur respectively in different regions in the long-term period of infection. Generally for the non-Hubei part of China, the plateau phase of the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV will be expected this March or at the end of this February. In the non-Hubei region of China it is expected that the epidemic will cease on the 30th of March 2020 and following this date no new confirmed patient will be expected. The predictions of the time of Inflection Points and maximum NACP for some important regions may be also obtained. A specific plan for the prevention measures of the 2019-nCoV outbreak must be implemented. This will involve the present returning to work and resuming production in China. Based on the presented results, I suggest that the rigorous isolation policy by the government should be executed regularly during daily life and work duties. Moreover, as many as possible the confirmed and suspected cases should be collected to diagnose or treat.","Pei, Lijun",Cogn Neurodyn,,106

We surveyed at the time of resumption of fertility care the psychological experience and coping strategies of patients pausing their care due to Covid-19 and examined which factors were associated and predictive of resilience, anxiety, stress and hopefulness. METHODS: Cross sectional cohort patient survey using an anonymous, self-reported, single time, web-based, HIPPA compliant platform (REDCap). Survey sampled two Northeast academic fertility practices (Yale Medicine Fertility Center in CT and Montefiore's Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Health in NY). Data from multiple choice and open response questions collected demographic, reproductive history, experience and attitudes about Covid-19, prior infertility treatment, sense of hopefulness and stress, coping strategies for mitigating stress and two validated psychological surveys to assess anxiety (six-item short-form State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAl-6)) and resilience (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, (CD-RISC-10). RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-four patients were sent invitations to participate. Two hundred fourteen of 734 (29.2%) completed the survey. Patients reported their fertility journey had been delayed a mean of 10 weeks while 60% had been actively trying to conceive > 1.5 years. The top 5 ranked coping skills from a choice of 19 were establishing a daily routine, going outside regularly, exercising, maintaining social connection via phone, social media or Zoom and continuing to work. Having a history of anxiety (p < 0.0001) and having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p < 0.0001) were associated with lower resilience. Increased hopefulness about having a child at the time of completing the survey (p < 0.0001) and higher resilience scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with decreased anxiety. Higher reported stress scores (p < 0.0001) were associated with increased anxiety. Multiple multivariate regression showed being non-Hispanic black (p = 0.035) to be predictive of more resilience while variables predictive of less resilience were being a full-time homemaker (p = 0.03), having received oral medication as prior infertility treatment (p = 0.003) and having higher scores on the STAI-6 (< 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Prior to and in anticipation of further pauses in treatment the clinical staff should consider pretreatment screening for psychological distress and provide referral sources. In addition, utilization of a patient centered approach to care should be employed.","Seifer, David B; Petok, William D; Agrawal, Alisha; Glenn, Tanya L; Bayer, Arielle H; Witt, Barry R; Burgin, Blair D; Lieman, Harry J",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,,106

From July-November 2020, an online survey was conducted to investigate the psychosocial well-being of PLWH and changes in HIV care during the second semester of the COVID-19 outbreak. Data were collected on the socio-demographic characteristics of PLWH, their psychosocial well-being, impact of COVID-19 preventive measures on their daily routines and HIV follow-up. Of the 247 responses analyzed (mean age: 44.5 +/- 13.2 years;73.7% male), 67 (27.1%) and 69 (27.9%) respondents screened positive for anxiety (GAD-2 score &gt;= 3) and depression (PHQ-2 score &gt;= 3), respectively. HIV care had returned to pre-COVID-19 state for 48.6% PLWH, and 108 (43.7%) had no HIV follow-up during the past month. Over three quarters (76.1%) of respondents expressed willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Compared to previous findings in April 2020, substance use increased from 58.6% to 67.2% (p &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that the well-being and medical follow-up of PLWH are still affected after almost a year into the COVID-19 outbreak. Remote HIV follow-up (telemedicine) with psychosocial support should be envisaged in the medium to long-term. Given that most PLWH accept COVID-19 vaccination, they may be prioritized for this intervention.","Siewe Fodjo, J.

However, public acceptance of such strategies should be monitored to ensure successful implementation. In an experiment with N=1379 German participants, we investigated whether the public's vaccination allocation preferences matched the prioritisation strategy approved by the German government. Results revealed different allocations. While the government had top-prioritised vulnerable people (being of high age or accommodated in nursing homes for the elderly), participants preferred exclusive allocation of the first available vaccines to medical staff and personnel caring for the elderly. Interestingly, allocation preferences did not change when participants were told how many individuals were included in each group. As differences between allocation policies and public preferences can affect trust in the government and threaten the social contract between generations, we discuss possible strategies to align vaccination prioritisations.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Korn, Lars; Eitze, Sarah; Betsch, Cornelia",J. med. ethics,,106

Changes in the underlying immune mechanisms determine patient prognosis. This study aimed to analyze the role of lymphocyte subsets in the immunopathogenesisof COVID-19 and severe influenza A, and examined the clinical significance of their alterations in the prognosis and recovery duration. METHODS: By retrospectively reviewing of patients in four groups (healthy controls, severe influenza A, non-severe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19) who were admitted to Ditan hospital between 2018 to 2020, we performed flow cytometric analysis and compared the absolute counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and lymphocyte subsets of the patients at different time points (weeks 1-4). RESULTS: We reviewed the patients' data of 94 healthy blood donors, 80 Non-severe-COVID-19, 19 Severe-COVID-19 and 37 severe influenza A. We found total lymphocytes (0.81 × 109/L vs 1.74 × 109/L, P = 0.001; 0.87 × 109/L vs 1.74 × 109/L, P < 0.0001, respectively) and lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets) of severe COVID-19 and severe influenza A patients to be significantly lower than those of healthy donors at early infection stages. Further, significant dynamic variations were observed at different time points (weeks 1-4).

407653,UX Design of Table Talkers in a Restaurant Based on Consumer Needs under COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: An intestinal ostomy is an artificial bowel opening created on the skin. Procedure-related mortality is extremely rare. However, the presence of an ostomy may be associated with significant morbidity. Complications negatively affect the quality of life of ostomates. Preoperative stoma site marking can reduce stoma-related complications and is recommended by several guidelines. However, there is no consensus on the procedure and recommendations are based on low-quality evidence. The objective of the systematic review will be to investigate if preoperative stoma site marking compared to no preoperative marking in patients undergoing intestinal stoma surgery reduces or prevents the rate of stoma-related complications. METHODS: We will include (cluster-) randomised controlled trials and cohort studies that involve patients with intestinal ostomies comparing preoperative stoma site marking to no preoperative marking and report at least one patient-relevant outcome. For study identification, we will systematically search MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINHAL as well as Google Scholar, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. Additionally, we will contact experts in the field. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection and data extraction. Outcomes will be prioritised based on findings from telephone interviews with five ostomates and five ostomy and wound nurses prior to conducting the review. Outcomes may include but are not limited to stoma-related complications (infection, parastomal abscess, hernia, mucocutaneous separation, dermatological complications, stoma necrosis, stenosis, retraction and prolapse) or other patient-relevant postoperative endpoints (quality of life, revision rate, dependence on professional care, mortality, length of stay and readmission). We will use the ROBINS-I or the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. We will perform a meta-analysis and assess the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: With the results of the systematic review, we aim to provide information for future clinical guidelines and influence clinical routine with regard to preoperative stoma site marking in patients undergoing ostomy surgery. When the evidence of our systematic review is low, it would still be a useful basis for future clinical trials by identifying data gaps.

Using the film adhesion method of photocatalytic materials, we assessed its antiviral activity and the effect of visible light irradiation according to methods defined by the International Organization for Standardization. Consequently, photocatalytic material was found to have antiviral activity, reducing the viral loads by 2.7 log TCID50 (tissue culture infective dose 50)/0.1 mL (500 lux), 2.8 log TCID50/0.1 mL (1000 lux), and 2.4 log TCID50/0.1 mL (3000 lux). Hence, this photocatalytic material might be applicable not only to reducing CoVs in the cattle breeding environment but also perhaps in other indoor spaces, such as offices and hospital rooms.

METHODS: We collected data about COVID-19 cases associated with New York City (NYC) public schools from polymerase chain reaction testing performed in each school on a sample of asymptomatic students and staff and from routine reporting. We compared prevalence from testing done in schools to community prevalence estimates from statistical models. We compared cumulative incidence for school-associated cases to all cases reported to the city. School-based contacts were monitored to estimate the secondary attack rate and possible direction of transmission. RESULTS: To assess prevalence, we analyzed data from 234 132 persons tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in 1594 NYC public schools during October 9 to December 18, 2020; 986 (0.4%) tested positive. COVID-19 prevalence in schools was similar to or less than estimates of prevalence in the community for all weeks. To assess cumulative incidence, we analyzed data for 2231 COVID-19 cases that occurred in students and staff compared with the 86 576 persons in NYC diagnosed with COVID-19 during the same period; the overall incidence was lower for persons in public schools compared with the general community. Of 36 423 school-based close contacts, 191 (0.5%) subsequently tested positive for COVID-19; the likely index case was an adult for 78.0% of secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that in-person learning in NYC public schools was not associated with increased prevalence or incidence overall of COVID-19 infection compared with the general community.","Varma, Jay K; Thamkittikasem, Jeff; Whittemore, Katherine; Alexander, Mariana; Stephens, Daniel H; Arslanian, Kayla; Bray, Jackie; Long, Theodore G",Pediatrics,,106

409497,Advances of nanomaterials-based strategies for fighting against COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) occurs in secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic kidney disease. BMD generally increases following parathyroidectomy, however longitudinal changes to other DXA-derived parameters, the trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA), have not been described. Postoperative calcium requirements and positive calcium balance raise concerns for an increased risk of vascular calcification. This case illustrates the dramatic increase in BMD that can follow parathyroidectomy in a patient on dialysis, and for the first time demonstrates improvements to HSA parameters and to the TBS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year old woman on haemodialysis underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a post-operative 'hungry bone syndrome' requiring substantial calcium and calcitriol supplementation. Six months post-parathyroidectomy, BMD increased by 42% at the lumbar spine, 30% at the femoral neck and 25% at the total proximal femur, with increases sustained over the following 18 months. The TBS increased by 8%. HSA showed a 63% increase in femoral neck cortical thickness and 38% reduction in the buckling ratio, consistent with increased femoral neck stability. The abdominal aortic vascular calcification score (0-24) increased from zero 8-years pre-parathyroidectomy to 2/24 at 18-months post-parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSION: BMD losses incurred by secondary hyperparathyroidism recover rapidly after parathyroidectomy, particularly at sites of trabecular bone. Bone architectural parameters, measured as the TBS and by HSA, also improve. Greater BMD gains may be associated with higher post-operative calcium requirements. While bone is the major reservoir for post-parathyroidectomy calcium supplementation, positive calcium balance may contribute to vascular calcification risk.","Lin, Raymond; Vucak-Dzumhur, Mirna; Elder, Grahame J",BMC Nephrol,,106
410015,A discrete stochastic model of the COVID-19 outbreak: Forecast and control,2020,"Since March 2020, Ghana's creative arts communities have tracked the complex facets of the COVID-19 pandemic through various art forms. This paper reports a study that analysed selected 'COVID art forms' through arts and health and critical health psychology frameworks. Art forms produced between March and July 2020, and available in the public sphere - traditional media, social media and public spaces - were collated. The data consisted of comedy, cartoons, songs, murals and textile designs. Three key functions emerged from analysis: health promotion (comedy, cartoons, songs); disease prevention (masks); and improving the aesthetics of the healthcare environment (murals). Textile designs performed broader socio-cultural functions of memorialising and political advocacy. Similar to earlier HIV/AIDS and Ebola arts interventions in other African countries, these Ghanaian COVID art forms translated public health information on COVID-19 in ways that connected emotionally, created social awareness and improved public understanding. However, some art forms had limitations: for example, songs that edutained using fear-based strategies or promoting conspiracy theories on the origins and treatment of COVID-19, and state-sponsored visual art that represented public health messaging decoupled from socio-economic barriers to health protection. These were likely to undermine the public health communication goals of behaviour modification. We outline concrete approaches to incorporate creative arts into COVID-19 public health interventions and post-pandemic health systems strengthening in Ghana.

412424,Monitoring Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) Infections in India by Cluster Analysis,2020,"The third outbreak of coronavirus (CoV) infection (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) caused by a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) of the genus Beta-coronavirus has become a global pandemic. CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speciï¬c molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.","Sheikhi, Abdolkarim; Hojjat-Farsangi, Mohammad",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,106

Immune cell activation via pattern recognition receptors has been implicated as a driver of the hyperinflammatory response seen in COVID-19. However, our understanding of the specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. Mast cells (MCs) and eosinophils are innate immune cells that play pathogenic roles in many inflammatory responses. Here we report MC-derived proteases and eosinophil-associated mediators are elevated in COVID-19 patient sera and lung tissues. Stimulation of viral-sensing toll-like receptors in vitro and administration of synthetic viral RNA in vivo induced features of hyperinflammation, including cytokine elevation, immune cell airway infiltration, and MC-protease production-effects suppressed by an anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody which selectively inhibits MCs and depletes eosinophils. Similarly, anti-Siglec-8 treatment reduced disease severity and airway inflammation in a respiratory viral infection model. These results suggest that MC and eosinophil activation are associated with COVID-19 inflammation and anti-Siglec-8 antibodies are a potential therapeutic approach for attenuating excessive inflammation during viral infections.","Gebremeskel, Simon; Schanin, Julia; Coyle, Krysta M; Butuci, Melina; Luu, Thuy; Brock, Emily C; Xu, Alan; Wong, Alan; Leung, John; Korver, Wouter; Morin, Ryan D; Schleimer, Robert P; Bochner, Bruce S; Youngblood, Bradford A",Front Immunol,,106

Episodic memory is an essential function of the human being related to the ability to store and remember experiences and anticipate possible events in the future. Studying this function in this context is crucial to help understand what effects the pandemic will have on the formation of episodic memories. To study this, the formation of episodic memories was evaluated by free recall, recognition, and episode order tasks for an aversive and neutral content. The results indicated that aversive episodic memory is impaired both in the free recall task and in the recognition task. Even the beneficial effect that emotional memory usually has for the episodic order was undermined as there were no differences between the neutral and aversive condition. The present work adds to the evidence that indicates that the level of activation does not modify memory processes in a linear way, which also depends on the type of evocation that people are asked and the characteristics of the content to be encoded.","Leon, Candela S; Bonilla, Matias; Benitez, Facundo A Urreta; Brusco, Luis I; Wang, Jingyi; Forcato, Cecilia",,,106

414293,IMPROVING OUR CHOICES THROUGH EFFECTIVE GOAL SETTING and PLAN-MAKING,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Proper strategies to minimise the risk of infection in individuals handling the bodies of deceased persons infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are urgently needed. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies. While this review highlights major research gaps, it allows interested entities to build their own guidance.","Yaacoub, Sally; Schünemann, Holger J; Khabsa, Joanne; El-Harakeh, Amena; Khamis, Assem M; Chamseddine, Fatimah; El Khoury, Rayane; Saad, Zahra; Hneiny, Layal; Cuello Garcia, Carlos; Muti-Schünemann, Giovanna Elsa Ute; Bognanni, Antonio; Chen, Chen; Chen, Guang; Zhang, Yuan; Zhao, Hong; Abi Hanna, Pierre; Loeb, Mark; Piggott, Thomas; Reinap, Marge; Rizk, Nesrine; Stalteri, Rosa; Duda, Stephanie; Solo, Karla; Chu, Derek K; Akl, Elie A",,,106

The advanced technology of smart glasses enables health professionals to video stream their operations to remote supporters for collaboration and cooperation. This study monitored the clinical situation by using smart glasses for remote cooperative training via video streaming and clinical decision-making through simulation based on a scenario of emergency nursing care for patients with arrhythmia. Participants and Methods: The clinical operations of bedside trainees, who is Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2(Glass EE2) wearers, were live streamed via their Google Glasses, which were viewed at a remote site by remote supporters via a desktop computer. Data were obtained from 31 nursing students using eight essay questions regarding their experience as desktop-side remote supporters. Results: Most of the participants reported feeling uneasy about identifying clinical situations (84%), patients’ condition (72%), and trainees’ performance (69%). The current system demonstrated sufficient performance with a satisfactory level of image quality and auditory communication, while network and connectivity are areas that require further improvement. The reported barriers to identifying situations on the remote desktop were predominantly a narrow field of view and motion blur in videos captured by Glass EE2s, and using the customized mirror mode. Conclusion: The current commercial Glass EE2 can facilitate enriched communication between remotely located supporters and trainees by sharing live videos and audio during clinical operations.

416008,Role of IoT to avoid spreading of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Web-based analysis of search queries has become a very useful method in various academic fields for understanding timely and regional differences in the public interest in certain terms and concepts. Particularly in health and medical research, Google Trends has been increasingly used over the last decade. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the search activity of pain-related parameters on Google Trends from among the most populated regions worldwide over a 3-year period from before the report of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions (January 2018) until December 2020. METHODS: Search terms from the following regions were used for the analysis: India, China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In total, 24 expressions of pain location were assessed. Search terms were extracted using the local language of the respective country. Python scripts were used for data mining. All statistical calculations were performed through exploratory data analysis and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Although the overall search activity for pain-related terms increased, apart from pain entities such as headache, chest pain, and sore throat, we observed discordant search activity. Among the most populous regions, pain-related search parameters for shoulder, abdominal, and chest pain, headache, and toothache differed significantly before and after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 cases (for all, P<.001). In addition, we observed a heterogenous, marked increase or reduction in pain-related search parameters among the most populated regions. CONCLUSIONS: As internet searches are a surrogate for public interest, we assume that our data are indicative of an increased incidence of pain after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as these increased incidences vary across geographical and anatomical locations, our findings could potentially facilitate the development of specific strategies to support the most affected groups.","Szilagyi, Istvan-Szilard; Ullrich, Torsten; Lang-Illievich, Kordula; Klivinyi, Christoph; Schittek, Gregor Alexander; Simonis, Holger; Bornemann-Cimenti, Helmar",J Med Internet Res,,106

Therefore, it is of crucial importance to revise the available scientific literature regarding the association between common respiratory viruses and asthma, as well as the newly emerging data about the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its possible relation with asthma, to better understand the interrelation between common viruses and asthma and its potential meaning on the current global pandemic of COVID-19.","Novak, Natalija; Cabanillas, Beatriz",Immunology,,106

Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (>150 mm3) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and suggest clustering of infection foci in close proximity.

Considering the possibility of dilution factor in pool testing, an attempt was made to find out possibility of any true positive sample/s in pools with late amplification. METHODS: The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centres in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to RT-PCR testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of 4 units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. RESULT: Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the importance of considering any indication of late amplification in the RT-PCR test to label a pool as positive to avoid missing any true positive sample in the pool.

The effect of temperature on retention and selectivity was also evaluated, and overall thermodynamic parameters associated with the analyte adsorption onto the CSP surface were derived from van't Hoff plots. Interesting cases of enantiomer elution order (EEO) reversal, which are dependent on the nature of polar modifier, analyte structure, column-type, and temperature, were observed. The impact of substitution pattern and electronic properties of analytes and selectors on the separation behaviour was investigated by correlating chromatographic parameters and molecular properties determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both coated and immobilized amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) columns allowed for the baseline enantioseparation (2.0 &#8804; RS &#8804; 4.9) of all 4,4'-bipyridines considered in this study. These results appear particularly useful because both enantiomers of these 4,4'-bipyridine derivatives are currently under investigation as new inhibitors of transthyretin fibrillogenesis, a biochemical phenomenon which is implicated to cause amyloid diseases.","Peluso, Paola; Sechi, Barbara; Lai, Giancarlo; Dessì, Alessandro; Dallocchio, Roberto; Cossu, Sergio; Aubert, Emmanuel; Weiss, Robin; Pale, Patrick; Mamane, Victor; Chankvetadze, Bezhan",J Chromatogr A,,106

METHOD: Simple experiments to assess the levels of absorption by each route separately. RESULTS: Our results strongly suggest that while amounts of alcohol sufficient to cause a DER may be inhaled when hand sanitizers are used in confined spaces, absorption can be avoided by dispersal of the fumes, and absorption from the skin alone does not occur in pharmacologically significant quantities. CONCLUSION: Warnings about absorption of alcohol through the skin from hand sanitizers and products such as perfumes, deodorants and after-shave (whose use is often warned against when disulfiram is prescribed) should be modified accordingly.","Brewer, Colin; Streel, Emmanuel",Alcohol Alcohol,,106

This study longitudinally examines the effect of the perceived impact of COVID-19 on comfort food consumption and whether this effect is mediated by emotional distress. A convenience sample of 1048 students and university staff (academic and non-academic) from two universities completed monthly online surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic across six waves (W; W1 to W6). Participants reported their perceived impact of COVID-19 (economic, interpersonal, and health), comfort food consumption, and emotional distress (DASS-21). Using structural equation models, we found an indirect longitudinal effect of the perceived impact of COVID-19 (W1) on comfort food consumption (W3 to W6) through increased emotional distress (W2). The perceived negative impact of COVID-19 on comfort food consumption was fully mediated by the emotional distress during the first waves (W3 and W4), ending in a partial mediation in the last waves (W5 and W6). These findings contribute to disentangling the mechanisms by which the perceived impact of COVID-19 affects comfort food consumption over time, and highlight the role of emotional distress. Future interventions should address comfort food consumption by focusing on handling emotional distress during a crisis.","Salazar-Fernández, Camila; Palet, Daniela; Haeger, Paola A; Román Mella, Francisca",Nutrients,,106

In patients with this condition, TLR4/STAT3 pathway alterations and the MYD88 L265P mutation may be viable targets for therapeutic intervention. The present study was, therefore, designed to identify clinicopathologic correlates of MYD88 mutations and TLR4/STAT3 pathway alterations in PCNSL. We detected TLR4 and p-STAT3 in 41.5% (22/53) and 43.4% (23/53) of PCNSL patients, respectively, while 60.4% of these patients (32/53) were found to harbor the MYD88 L265P mutation. TLR4 expression was found to be significantly associated with the presence of multiple brain lesions, while p-STAT3 expression was significantly linked to advanced age, the presence of multiple brain lesions, non-GCB histological findings, and non-CR status. The presence of the MYD88 L265P mutation was significantly linked to advanced age, the presence of multiple brain lesions, and DLBCL molecular subtype. Multivariate analyses additionally confirmed that elevated TLR4 and p-STAT3 expression levels are associated with a poorer PCNSL patient prognosis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that signaling through the TLR4/MYD88/STAT3 pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PCNSL.","Tang, Dabei; Su, Wenjia; Wang, Xiaowei; Chu, Zhong; Zhang, Lei; Zhou, Jin; Zhang, Qingyuan",Brain tumor pathol,,106

For example, a given text can have different targets (e.g., neighborhoods) and different aspects (e.g., price or safety), with different sentiment associated with each target-aspect pair. In this paper, we investigate whether adding context to self-attention models improves performance on (T)ABSA. We propose two variants of Context-Guided BERT (CG-BERT) that learn to distribute attention under different contexts. We first adapt a context-aware Transformer to produce a CG-BERT that uses context-guided softmax-attention. Next, we propose an improved Quasi-Attention CG-BERT model that learns a compositional attention that supports subtractive attention. We train both models with pretrained BERT on two (T)ABSA datasets: SentiHood and SemEval-2014 (Task 4). Both models achieve new state-of-the-art results with our QACG-BERT model having the best performance. Furthermore, we provide analyses of the impact of context in the our proposed models. Our work provides more evidence for the utility of adding context-dependencies to pretrained self-attention-based language models for context-based natural language tasks.","Wu, Zhengxuan; Ong, Desmond C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07523v1.pdf,106

430131,Global Systemic Risk and Resilience for Novel Coronavirus and COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in China in December 2019 and has spread around the world. High Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in COVID-19 patients suggest that a cytokine storm may play a major role in the pathophysiology and are considered as a relevant parameter in predicting most severe course of disease. The aim of this study was to assess repeated IL-6 levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to evaluate their relationship with patient's severity and outcome. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 10 (i.e. the date of the first admitted patients) and April 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at admission. On the day of IL-6 blood concentration measurement, we also collected results of D-Dimers, C-Reactive Protein, white blood cells and lymphocytes count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin as well as microbiological samples, whenever present. RESULTS: Of a total of 65 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU we included 41 patients with repeated measure of IL-6. There was a significant difference in IL-6 levels between survivors and non-survivors over time (p = 0.001); moreover, non survivors had a significantly higher IL-6 maximal value when compared to survivors (720 [349-2116] vs. 336 [195-646] pg/mL, p = 0.01). The IL-6 maximal value had a significant predictive value of ICU mortality (AUROC 0.73 [95% CI 0.57-0.89]; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated measurements of IL-6 can help clinicians in identifying critically ill COVID-19 patients with the highest risk of poor prognosis.","Gorham, Julie; Moreau, Anthony; Corazza, Francis; Peluso, Lorenzo; Ponthieux, Fanny; Talamonti, Marta; Izzi, Antonio; Nagant, Carole; Ndieugnou Djangang, Narcisse; Garufi, Alessandra; Creteur, Jacques; Taccone, Fabio Silvio",PLoS One,,106
430168,COVID-19 recovery: science isn't enough to save us,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid testing is a reliable method for diagnosing viral infection in clinical samples. However, when the number of cases is huge and there are individual differences in the virus itself, the probability of false-negative results increases. With the advancement in research on the new coronavirus, new detection technologies that use serum-specific antibodies as detection targets have been developed. These detection technologies have high efficiency and shorter turnaround time, which ultimately shortens the time required for diagnosis. This article summarizes the methods that have been reported to date for the detection of the new coronavirus and discusses their principles and technical characteristics. AIMS: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of various SARS-CoV-2 detection methods and analyze their principles. METHODS: Searched reports on SARS-CoV-2 detection methods published so far, extracted the data and analyzed them. Use the primer blast function of NCBI to analyze the primers used in qRT-PCR detection. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity was the highest when nucleocapsid protein gene was used as the target, reaching 96.6%. The detection efficiency of the remaining targets ranged from 66.7% to 96.0%. Various new detection methods, like Serum specific antibody detection, can speed up the test time. However, due to the complexity of the method and higher testing requirements, it seems that it cannot be used as a complete replacement for qRT-PRC testing. CONCLUSIONS: With the advancement of technology and the improvement of methods, the detection methods of SARSCoV-2 have become more mature. These advances provided great help to the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Wang, Hao-Jia; Xiang, Yang-Hui; Hu, Rui; Ji, Rui; Wang, Yu-Ping",Ir. j. med. sci,,106

431464,Face Masks: Their History and the Values They Communicate,2021,"This paper presents an analysis, informed by socio-technical transitions theory and the socially derived concept of automobility, of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic on automobility in Europe. The paper argues that the concept of a pervasive, sudden, and powerful crisis has not previously be explored in the socio-technical transitions literature. The strong behavioural changes in physical and virtual mobility associated with the pandemic are argued to be particularly significant, representing a 'living lab' in which to explore the possibilities for disintegrating the boundaries of the automobility system, thereby breaking the enduring structures and practices that have enabled automobility to remain largely unchallenged in the policy arena. Change processes previously underway in the automotive industry and in automobility are not impacted equally by the pandemic. We present initial evidence that mobility sharing will reduce, while the acceptance of electric cars will increase. However, it is also concluded that the hegemony of private automobility is not in itself threatened by pandemic outcomes.","Wang, Liqiao; Wells, Peter",Sustainability,,106

Vaccination programs have contributed to the decline in mortality and morbidity of various infectious diseases. This review aims to investigate the impact of sex/gender on the vaccine acceptance, responses, and outcomes. The studies were identified by using PubMed, until 30th June 2020. The search was performed by using the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gender, sex, vaccine, adverse reaction. Clinical trials, retrospective and prospective studies were included. Studies written in languages other than English were excluded. Studies were included if gender differences in response to vaccination trials were reported. All selected studies were qualitatively analyzed. Innate recognition and response to viruses, as well as, adaptive immune responses during viral infections, differ between females and males. Unfortunately, a majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people, with ages between 18 to 65 years, excluding the elderly, pregnant women, post-menopausal female and children. In conclusion, it is apparent that the design of vaccines and vaccine strategies should be sex-specific, to reduce adverse reactions in females and increase immunogenicity in males. It should be mandatory to examine sex-related variables in pre-clinical and clinical vaccine trials, such as their crucial role for successful prevention of pandemic COVID-19.","Ciarambino, Tiziana; Barbagelata, Elena; Corbi, Graziamaria; Ambrosino, Immacolata; Politi, Cecilia; Lavalle, Franco; Ruggieri, Anna; Moretti, Annamaria",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,106
436712,"The Social Determinants of Mental Health: Definitions, Distinctions, and Dimensions for Professional Case Management: Part 1",2021,"Functions of the gut microbiome have a growing number of implications for host metabolic health, with diet being one of the most significant influences on microbiome composition. Compelling links between diet and the gut microbiome suggest key roles for various macronutrients, including lipids, yet how individual classes of dietary lipids interact with the microbiome remains largely unknown. Sphingolipids are bioactive components of most foods and are also produced by prominent gut microbes. This makes sphingolipids intriguing candidates for shaping diet-microbiome interactions. Here, we used a click chemistry-based approach to track the incorporation of bioorthogonal dietary omega-alkynyl sphinganine (sphinganine alkyne [SAA]) into the murine gut microbial community (Bioorthogonal labeling). We identified microbial and SAA-specific metabolic products through fluorescence-based sorting of SAA-containing microbes (Sort), 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the sphingolipid-interacting microbes (Seq), and comparative metabolomics to identify products of SAA assimilation by the microbiome (Spec). Together, this approach, termed Bioorthogonal labeling-Sort-Seq-Spec (BOSSS), revealed that SAA assimilation is nearly exclusively performed by gut Bacteroides, indicating that sphingolipid-producing bacteria play a major role in processing dietary sphinganine. Comparative metabolomics of cecal microbiota from SAA-treated mice revealed conversion of SAA to a suite of dihydroceramides, consistent with metabolic activities of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Additionally, other sphingolipid-interacting microbes were identified with a focus on an uncharacterized ability of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium to metabolize dietary sphingolipids. We conclude that BOSSS provides a platform to study the flux of virtually any alkyne-labeled metabolite in diet-microbiome interactions.","Lee, Min-Ting; Le, Henry H; Johnson, Elizabeth L",J. lipid. res,,106

One method of ensuring standard patient care within these guidelines is through the implementation of telemedicine. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and/or rehabilitation period. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in Medline/PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for prospective randomised controlled trials to compare clinical and symptomatic measures for elective patients managed routinely with remote care compared to those managed with standard in-clinic management. To be included for meta-analysis, parameters must be evaluated in &#8805;3 studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analyses. Both telemedicine and control cohorts were comparable for patient satisfaction (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07; I2 = 0%; p = 0.52) and patient retention analysis (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.06; p = 0.54; I2 = 0%). Similarly, there was no statistical difference appreciated between cohorts for overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score (p = 0.30), Timed Up and Go Test (p = 0.40), and Stair Test (p = 0.18). Significant difference did exist for visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (p = 0.02) in favour of in-clinic management. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine will serve an integral aspect of healthcare delivery throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond in an effort to deliver safe, efficient and time-sensitive care to the orthopaedic patient population. The results of our meta-analyses indicate that virtual consultations are as effective as traditional in-person consultations for the care of elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and rehabilitation period. However, further studies are needed to evaluate for initial consultations and certain sub-specialties of orthopaedics.","McDonnell, J M; Ahern, D P; Ross, T D; Gibbons, D; Synnott, K A; Butler, J S",Surg.

439651,The lockdown tweet that launched a COVID-19 'supertracker',2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to over 100 million infections and over 3 million deaths worldwide. Understanding its pathogenesis is crucial to guide prognostic and therapeutic implications. Viral infections are known to alter the lipid profile and metabolism of their host cells, similar to the case with MERS and SARS-CoV-2002. Since lipids play various metabolic roles, studying lipid profile alterations in COVID-19 is an inevitable step as an attempt to achieve better therapeutic strategies, as well as a potential prognostic factor in the course of this disease. Several studies have reported changes in lipid profile associated with COVID-19. The most frequently reported changes are a decline in serum cholesterol and ApoA1 levels and elevated triglycerides. The hyper-inflammatory state mediated by the Cytokine storm disturbs several fundamental lipid biosynthesis pathways. Virus replication is a process that drastically changes the host cell's lipid metabolism program and overuses cell lipid resources. Lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels are associated with higher severity and mortality rates and with higher levels of inflammatory markers. Studies suggest that arachidonic acid omega-3 derivatives might help modulate hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm resulting from pulmonary involvement. Also, statins have been shown to be beneficial when administered after COVID-19 diagnosis via unclear mechanisms probably associated with anti-inflammatory effects and HDL-C rising effects.","Rezaei, Abbas; Neshat, Sina; Heshmat-Ghahdarijani, Kiyan",Curr Probl Cardiol,,106

MATERIAL AND METHODS: An email was sent to 66 urological hospitals with focus on robotic surgery (RS) including a link to a questionnaire (e.g. bed/staff capacity, surgical caseload, protection measures during RS) that covered three time points: a representative baseline week prior to COVID-19, the week of March 16th-22nd and April 20th-26th 2020. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses. RESULTS: 27 out of 66 questionnaires were analyzed (response rate: 41%). We found a decrease of 11% in hospital beds and 25% in OR capacity with equal reductions for endourological, open and robotic procedures. Primary surgical treatment of urolithiasis and benign prostate syndrome (BPS) but also of testicular and penile cancer dropped by at least 50% while the decrease of surgeries for prostate, renal and urothelial cancer (TUR-B and cystectomies) ranged from 15 to 37%. The use of personal protection equipment (PPE), screening of staff and patients and protection during RS was unevenly distributed in the different centers-however, the number of COVID-19 patients and urologists did not reach double digits. CONCLUSION: The German urological landscape has changed since the outbreak of COVID-19 with a significant shift of high priority surgeries but also continuation of elective surgical treatments. While screening and staff protection is employed heterogeneously, the number of infected German urologists stays low.","Harke, Nina N; Radtke, Jan P; Hadaschik, Boris A; Bach, Christian; Berger, Frank P; Blana, Andreas; Borgmann, Hendrik; Distler, Florian A; Edeling, Sebastian; Egner, Tobias; Engels, Christina L; Farzat, Mahmoud; Haese, Alexander; Hein, Rainer; Kuczyk, Markus A; Manseck, Andreas; Moritz, Rudolf; Musch, Michael; Peters, Inga; Pokupic, Sasa; Rocco, Bernardo; Schneider, Andreas; Schumann, André; Schwentner, Christian; Sighinolfi, Chiara M; Buse, Stephan; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Truß, Michael C; Waldner, Michael; Wülfing, Christian; Zimmermanns, Volker; Witt, Jörn H; Wagner, Christian",PLoS One,,106

440008,A multi-stage SEIR model to predict the potential of a new COVID-19 wave in KSA after lifting all travel restrictions,2021,"There is evidence that adoption of non-pharmaceutical containment measures (NPMs) may have had a major impact on Covid-19 epidemic dynamics, and mitigated its effect on healthcare system. Optimal timing of implementation of these measures however is not known. In Italy, a national lockdown was decided on March 11th 2020 and ended 4th of May. At that time, cumulative incidence (CI) was different in Italian regions which ranged from <5 cases/100,000 to >11 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In this paper, we aim to evaluate how level of incidence in different regions at the time of implementation of NPMs affected CI and had an impact on the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rates. We used regional daily new COVID-19 diagnosed cases as well number of people hospitalized in ICU and number of deaths for period February 24-May 11 from all the 19 Italian regions and two autonomous provinces. For each region we calculated: temporal daily trend of cumulative cases of Covid-19/100,000 inhabitants, daily trend of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rate at the end of period. We found that the epidemic curves show similar trends for all regions and all tend to flatten between 11-32 days. However, after 2 months, regions with lower CI at lockdown remained at substantially lower CI (<265 cases/100,000), had a peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU which did not exceed 79.4% and a mortality<0.27/1,000. On the other hand, in regions with higher incidence at lockdown, CI reached 382-921 cases/100,000, the peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU and mortality rate reached 270%, and 1.5/1,000, respectively. Our data suggests that level of CI at the moment of lockdown is important to control the subsequent spread of infection so NPMs should be adopted very early during the course of Covid-19 epidemic, in order to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and to reduce related mortality.","Timelli, Laura; Girardi, Enrico",PLoS One,,106

Containment policies correlated with the largest declines in mobility in higher income countries. High-income countries also achieved lower COVID-19 case and death growth rates than low-income countries. This study finds better epidemiological outcomes of containment and closure policies for higher income countries than lower income countries.

440525,A simple mathematical model to predict and validate the spread of Covid-19 in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines can offer a route out of the pandemic, yet initial research suggests that many are unwilling to be vaccinated. A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localized and empathetic response to counter misinformation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify COVID-19 priority topics important to Bradford citizens and decision makers.","Lockyer, Bridget; Islam, Shahid; Rahman, Aamnah; Dickerson, Josie; Pickett, Kate; Sheldon, Trevor; Wright, John; McEachan, Rosemary; Sheard, Laura",Health expect,,106

METHODS: This study used data collected via Youper, a mental health app, from February through July 2020. Youper users (N = 157,213) in the United States self-reported positive and negative emotions and anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. We examined emotions and symptoms before (pre), during (acute), and after (sustained) COVID-related stay-at-home orders. RESULTS: For changes in frequency of reported acute emotions, from the pre to acute periods, anxiety increased while tiredness, calmness, happiness, and optimism decreased. From the acute to sustained periods, sadness, depression, and gratitude increased. Anxiety, stress, and tiredness decreased. Between the pre and sustained periods, sadness and depression increased, as did happiness and calmness. Anxiety and stress decreased. Among symptom measures, anxiety increased initially, from the pre to the acute periods, but later returned to baseline. LIMITATIONS: The study sample was primarily comprised of young people and women. The app does not collect racial or ethnicity data. These factors may limit generalizability. Sample size was also not consistent for all data collected.

The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be as severe as predicted, although future work is necessary to understand longitudinal effects as the pandemic continues.","Yarrington, Julia S; Lasser, Jana; Garcia, David; Vargas, Jose Hamilton; Couto, Diego Dotta; Marafon, Thiago; Craske, Michelle G; Niles, Andrea N",J Affect Disord,,106

Here, we argue that if our main aim is to understand the effect of mutations on evolutionary outcomes (such as adaptation or speciation), we need to instead consider their population genetic and genomic effects, from altering recombination rate to modifying chromatin. We start by reviewing known population genetic and genomic effects of different mutation types and connect these to the major evolutionary processes of drift and selection. We illustrate how mutation type can thus be linked with evolutionary outcomes and provide suggestions for further exploring and quantifying these relationships. This reframing lays a foundation for determining the evolutionary significance of different mutation types.","Berdan, Emma L.; Blanckaert, Alexandre; Slotte, Tanja; Suh, Alexander; Westram, Anja M.; Fragata, Ines",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13830v1.pdf,106

BACKGROUND: Given the high incidence of coronavirus and shortage of nurses in Iranian hospitals, learning about nurses' intention to care for patients with COVID-19 is important. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, 648 Iranian nurses were surveyed during March 2020. The online questionnaire consisted of two parts. The mediating role was explored for the following: job satisfaction and commitment in the association of workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The results of this study show that job satisfaction and organisational commitment mediated the relationship of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate the importance of job satisfaction and organisational commitment as mechanisms that help to understand the association of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours and pay satisfaction with the intention to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hospital managers need to attend to the role of nurses' job satisfaction and other organisational factors to ensure that they can cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharif Nia, Hamid; Arslan, Gökmen; Naghavi, Navaz; Sivarajan Froelicher, Erika; Kaveh, Omolhoda; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed; Rahmatpour, Pardis",J. clin. nurs,,106

However, there have been few studies related to sleepiness and its associated factors in elementary school children. In Japan, all schools were closed from February to May 2020 to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the subjective sleepiness of pupils during the 1.5-year period and to elucidate factors associated with changes in sleepiness. Questionnaire surveys about pupils' sleep habits and the Japanese version of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS-J) were conducted longitudinally at one elementary school in June 2019, January 2020, and June 2020. The average &#8710;PDSS score was 0.94 ± 5.51 (mean ± standard deviation) from June 2019 to January 2020 and -1.65 ± 5.71 (t[498] = 6.13, p < 0.01) from January 2020 to June 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that decreasing social jetlag was associated with decreasing PDSS scores (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96, p = 0.02) during the school closure. A less restrictive school schedule secondary to a COVID-19-related school closure decreased sleepiness in children and was associated with decreasing social jetlag.","Komada, Yoko; Ishibashi, Yoshiki; Hagiwara, Shunta; Kobori, Mariko; Shimura, Akiyoshi",,,106

We extracted the data of patients who had undergone cardiovascular surgery from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database in Japan (2016-2019). Based on the surgery type, we examined the association of intra-operative autologous blood donation with the transfusion rate and amount of blood used in cardiac and aortic surgeries using multilevel propensity score matching. We enrolled 32,433 and 4,267 patients who underwent cardiac and aortic surgeries and received 5.0% and 6.7% intra-operative autologous blood donation with mean volumes of 557.68 mL and 616.96 mL, respectively. The red blood cell transfusion rates of the control and intra-operative autologous blood donation groups were 60.6% and 38.4%, respectively, in the cardiac surgery cohort (p < .001) and 91.4%, and 83.8%, respectively, in the aortic surgery cohort (p = .037). The transfusion amounts for the control and intra-operative autologous blood donation groups were 5.9 and 3.5 units of red blood cells, respectively, for cardiac surgery patients (p < .001) and 11.9 and 7.9 units, respectively, for aortic surgery patients (p < .001). Intra-operative autologous blood donation could reduce the transfusion rate or amount of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma for patients undergoing index cardiovascular surgery and could be an effective blood transfusion strategy in cardiovascular surgery for Japanese patients.","Okuno, Takuya; Kunisawa, Susumu; Fushimi, Kiyohide; Imanaka, Yuichi",PLoS One,,106

We show that national human mobility restrictions ascribed to the first-level public health emergency response policy effectively reduce both intercity and intracity migration intensities, thus leading to a declining scale of human mobility, which improves the effectiveness in controlling the epidemic. Human mobility restrictions have greater influences on cities with better economic development, denser populations, or larger passenger volumes. Moreover, mobility restriction measures are found to be better implemented in regions with increased public awareness, or with provincial leaders who have healthcare crisis management experience, local administrative experience, or the opportunity to serve a consecutive term.","Zhang, Xiaoming; Luo, Weijie; Zhu, Jingci",J Chin Polit Sci,,106

However, the functions for lncRNAs in COVID-19 have not been unravelled. The present study aimed at identifying the related lncRNAs based on RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as health individuals. Overall, 17 severe, 12 non-severe patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we reported some altered lncRNAs between severe, non-severe COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Next, we developed a 7-lncRNA panel with a good differential ability between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Finally, we observed that COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease among which severe COVID-19 patients have two subtypes with similar risk score and immune score based on lncRNA panel using iCluster algorithm. As the roles of lncRNAs in COVID-19 have not yet been fully identified and understood, our analysis should provide valuable resource and information for the future studies.","Cheng, Jie; Zhou, Xiang; Feng, Weijun; Jia, Min; Zhang, Xinlu; An, Taixue; Luan, Minyuan; Pan, Yi; Zhang, Shu; Zhou, Zhaoming; Wen, Lei; Sun, Yun; Zhou, Cheng",J Cell Mol Med,,106

We report the illustrative case of a 32-year-old patient who presented this trifecta of infections and who did well under treatment with chloroquine and anti-mycobacterial drugs. This patient arrived at the ER with respiratory discomfort that had been evolving over a month with symptoms of flu and deterioration of her general condition.

The course was marked by a spectacular clinical improvement and two negative COVID-19 PCR controls at the end of treatment (at days 9 and 10). Anti-tubercular drugs (especially, rifampin) are powerful enzyme inducers that can reduce the effectiveness of chloroquine in our patient.

Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore ""via simulation"" plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.","Acuña-Zegarra, Manuel Adrian; Díaz-Infante, Saúl; Baca-Carrasco, David; Olmos-Liceaga, Daniel",Math Biosci,,106

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Phase II, open-label, randomised, multicentre, controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of the administration of two doses of sarilumab (200 and 400 mg) plus best available therapy (BAT) in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 presenting cytokine release syndrome. This strategy will be compared with a BAT control group. The efficacy and safety will be monitored up to 28 days postadministration. A total of 120 patients will be recruited (40 patients in each arm). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The clinical trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the coordinating centre and authorised by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Products. If the hypothesis is verified, the dissemination of the results could change clinical practice by increasing early administration of sarilumab in adult patients with COVID-19 presenting cytokine release syndrome, thus reducing intensive care unit admissions.

METHODS: Retrospective case series in the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium of confirmed COVID-19 patients 'after surviving an ICU-stay', 'aged &#8805; 70 years', or 'aged < 70 years with a length of hospitalization > 7 days'. Exclusion criteria were 'unwilling to cooperate', 'medically unstable', or 'palliative care policy'. Following tests were used: 'Five Times Sit To Stand Test', 'hand grip dynamometry', 'Barthel index', 'Swallowing screening', 'Montreal Cognitive Assessment', 'Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale', and 'Nutritional Risk Screening 2002'. RESULTS: One or more tests were obtained in 135/163 patients (83.3%). Physical impairments were present in 43.2-82.8% of the patients. Median BI was 10/20 indicating limited self-dependency. Swallow impairments were present in 3/53 (5.7%) and 24/76 (31.6%) had risk of malnutrition. Impaired memory was seen in 26/43 (60.5%) and 22/47 (46.8%) had elevated anxiety/depression scores. Older adults had more physical, functional, and cognitive impairments. ICU patients had a lower hand grip force. CONCLUSION(S): The high prevalence of physical, cognitive, psychological, and functional impairments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, both ICU and non-ICU patients, indicates that assessment of impairments is imperative. These results imply that rehabilitation and follow-up is essential for these patients. This paper proposes a short, workable assessment composed with known outcome measures to assess different domains of COVID-19 patients.","Heyns, Arne; Dupont, Jolan; Gielen, Evelien; Flamaing, Johan; Peers, Koen; Gosselink, Rik; Vrijsen, Bart; Lorent, Natalie; Everaerts, Stephanie; Janssens, Wim; Hermans, Greet; Caluwé, Kim; Staes, Blanche; Goeleven, Ann; Meulemans, Ann; Waelkens, Hadi; Beyens, Hilde; Tournoy, Jos",,,106

To reduce the level of stress and deal with its accumulated consequences, people enforce different strategies and coping mechanisms. In the vast amount of information available, imposed by the media, and often filled with falsehoods and catastrophizing related topics, it can be very challenging to distinguish the truth from falsehoods. The existence of an adequate level of digital literacy and e-Health literacy can help society to deal with that problem. Digital and e-Health literacy enables society to search for information efficiently, while remaining critical and open-minded, and use the newly adopted knowledge to improve our mental health. The aim of the paper was to present the frequency of news searches and trusting the COVID-19 related information in the group of medical professionals in Croatia. The survey was conducted using an online questionnaire, containing psychological questionnaires and relevant questions about everyday functioning. Based on the results that show a significant correlation between the frequency of information search and the lack of trust in the search results, we discuss the importance of digital and e-Health literacy, primarily within medical professionals.","Bosanac, Dasa; Luic, Ljerka",Stud Health Technol Inform,,106

The aim of this study was to identify latent variables underlying adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and to examine demographic and psychological predictors of adherence. A sample of US adults (N = 1,200) were surveyed in late April to mid-May 2020. The factor structure of adherence was examined using exploratory factor analysis. Machine learning regression models using elastic net regularization were used to examine predictors of adherence. Two factors characterized adherence: avoidance and cleaning. Elastic net models identified differential demographic and psychological predictors of these two forms of adherence. Religious affiliation, denial coping, full-time employment, substance use coping, and being 60 or older predicted lower avoidance adherence. Behavioral and mindfulness emotion regulation skills, agreeableness, and Democrat political affiliation predicted greater avoidance adherence. For cleaning adherence, interpersonal and behavioral emotion regulation skills and conscientiousness emerged as strong predictors of greater cleaning. Efforts to promote compliance with COVID-19 health guidelines may benefit from distinguishing avoidance and cleaning adherence and considering predictors of each of these aspects of adherence.","Bailey, Brooklynn; Whelen, Megan L; Strunk, Daniel R",Applied psychology.

Assessment of coagulation and other markers could be useful to understand their coagulopathy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of inflammatory and coagulation parameters, including prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TATs), fibrin monomers, and D-dimer, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We compared the markers in patients with thrombosis, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and poor outcome. RESULTS: Of the 81 patients, 9 (11%) experienced an acute thrombotic event (4 with pulmonary embolism, 3 with venous thrombosis, and 2 with stroke). PF1.2 was elevated in 32 (39%) patients, TATs in 54 (67%), fibrin monomers in 49 (60%), and D-dimer in 76 (94%). Statistically significant elevation in PF1.2 and TATs was seen in patients admitted to the ICU, while D-dimer and fibrin monomers were significantly elevated in patients with poor outcomes. The presence of multiple abnormal coagulation parameters was associated with ICU admission. Other parameters with statistically significant results included abnormal WBC counts and elevated C-reactive protein, which were associated with ICU admission and poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that abnormalities of biomarkers of hemostasis activation and inflammatory markers are associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Moosavi, Mitchell; Wooten, Melanie; Goodman, Abigail; Nahab, Fadi B; Duncan, Alexander; Maier, Cheryl; Guarner, Jeannette",Am. j. clin. pathol,,106

The current study was conducted to assess the socio-behavioural impact of COVID-19 among the general population across India between the first and the second wave of pandemic. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 15th March -25th March 2021 using a pre-validated validated questionnaire upon the general population using e-survey, telephonic and face-to-face interview. The participants were recruited from the different regions of India by the purposive and snowball sampling technique following the principle of maximum diversity. Appropriate statistical tests were applied to study the association between the various sociodemographic variables and different behaviours. RESULTS: A total of 1079 responses were analysed for the study. Almost half of the participants feared contracting the COVID-19 infection. Overall, female participants, elderly people (more than 60 years of age) and urban dwellers reported a greater fear in the survey. More than half of the participants (53.39%) reported significant difficulties due to home confinement. People have become more inclined to adopt healthy lifestyles. There are mixed responses in the area of following preventive practices. CONCLUSION: People have a significant amount of fear and anxiety related to the pandemic, leading to several social and behavioural changes that might have a considerable impact on their everyday lives.","Klanidhi, Kamal Bandhu; Ranjan, Piyush; Kaur, Tanveer; Khan, Munnoo; Ghosh, Tamoghna; Upadhyay, Ashish Datt; Chopra, Sakshi; Sarkar, Siddharth; Kaloiya, Gauri Shanker; Barre, Vijay Prasad; Singh, Amandeep; Prakash, Bindu",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,106

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients at a single center with COVID-19 infection and shock who were treated with angiotensin II. The hemodynamic response to angiotensin II was estimated by recording the mean arterial pressure, norepinephrine equivalent dose (NED) and urine output. RESULTS: Ten patients with COVID-19 related shock were treated with angiotensin II. Over the initial 6 hours, the average the norepinephrine equivalent dose decreased by 30.4% (from 64.6 mcg/min to 44 mcg/min) without a significant change in the mean arterial pressure (0.7% decrease). Six patients experienced at least a 25% reduction in norepinephrine equivalent dose by 6 hours, and two experienced at least a 50% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the hemodynamic response to angiotensin II in COVID-19 related shock was favorable. Two patients had a marked rapid improvement. Given the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, further evaluation of angiotensin II for the treatment of COVID-19 related shock is warranted.","Ofosu-Barko, Kwadwo; Liu, Yi; Tamimi, Faisal Alkhatib; Al Husami, Wael; Ganatra, Sarju; Resnic, Frederic; Shah, Sachin P",Crit. pathw. cardiol,,106

It remains poorly understood how the host immune system responds to the infection during disease progression. We applied microarray analysis of the whole genome transcriptome to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from severe and mild COVID-19 patients as well as healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with COVID-19 severity indicated that disease progression is featured by overactivation of myeloid cells and deficient T cell function. The upregulation of TLR6 and MMP9, which promote the neutrophils-mediated inflammatory response, and the downregulation of SKAP1 and LAG3, which regulate T cells function, were associated with disease severity. Importantly, the regulation of these four genes was absent in patients with influenza A (H1N1). And compared with stimulation with hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 virus, the regulation pattern of these genes was unique in PBMCs response to Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Our data also suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection largely silenced the response of type I interferons (IFNs) and altered the proportion of immune cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypercytokinemia. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs inflammatory and immune signatures in patients, especially those at severe stage. The potential mechanisms underpinning severe COVID-19 progression include overactive myeloid cells, impaired function of T cells, and inadequate induction of type I IFNs signaling.","Zhang, Qiong; Meng, Yuting; Wang, Kaihang; Zhang, Xujun; Chen, Wenbiao; Sheng, Jifang; Qiu, Yunqing; Diao, Hongyan; Li, Lanjuan",Front Immunol,,106

Cremation law requires collection of clinical information that can improve understanding of deaths in both hospital and community settings. Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities and where infection acquired was recorded for all deaths from COVID-19, between 6 April and 30 May, for whom an application was made for cremation at a South Wales' crematorium. Of 752 cremations, 215 (28.6%) were COVID-19 (115 (53.5%) male and 100 (46.5%) female). Median age was 82 years (youngest patient 47 and the oldest 103 years). Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males' odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.03-3.74, P = 0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities.

As the results shown, 12 publications with 2389 COVID-19 patients (674 severe cases) were included for the analysis of disease severity. The severity rate of COVID-19 in hypertensive patients was much higher than in non-hypertensive cases (37.58% vs 19.73%, pooled OR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.80-2.86). Moreover, the pooled ORs of COVID-19 severity for hypertension vs. non-hypertension was 2.21 (95% CI: 1.58-3.10) and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.70-3.17) in age <50 years and â©¾50 years patients, respectively. Additionally, six studies with 151 deaths of 2116 COVID-19 cases were included for the analysis of disease fatality. The results showed that hypertensive patients carried a nearly 3.48-fold higher risk of dying from COVID-19 (95% CI: 1.72-7.08). Meanwhile, the pooled ORs of COVID-19 fatality for hypertension vs. non-hypertension was 6.43 (95% CI: 3.40-12.17) and 2.66 (95% CI: 1.27-5.57) in age <50 years and â©¾50 years patients, respectively.

Here we assess the dynamics of respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults and determine predisposition for or against specific viral pairings. METHODS: Over five respiratory seasons from 30 November 2013 through 6 June 2018, the mono-infection and co-infection prevalence of 13 viral pathogens was tabulated at The Cleveland Clinic. Employing a model to proportionally distribute viral pairs using individual virus co-infection rate with prevalence patterns of concurrent co-circulating viruses, we compared predicted occurrence with observed occurrence of 132 viral pairing permutations using binomial analysis. RESULTS: Of 30 535 respiratory samples, 9843 (32.2%) were positive for at least one virus and 1018 (10.8%) of these were co-infected. Co-infected samples predominantly originated from children. Co-infection rate in paediatric population was 35.0% (2068/5906), compared with only 5.8% (270/4591) in adults. Adenovirus C (ADVC) had the highest co-infection rate (426/623, 68.3%) while influenza virus B had the lowest (55/546, 10.0%). ADVC-rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA)-HRV and RSVB-HRV pairings occurred at significantly higher frequencies than predicted by the proportional distribution model (p < 0.05). Additionally, several viral pairings had fewer co-infections than predicted by our model: notably metapneumovirus (hMPV)-parainfluenza virus 3, hMPV-RSVA and RSVA-RSVB. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the largest studies on respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults. Co-infections are substantially more common in children, especially under 5 years of age, and the most frequent pairings occurred at a higher frequency than would be expected by random. Specific pairings occur at altered rates compared with those predicted by proportional distribution, suggesting either direct or indirect interactions result between specific viral pathogens.","Mandelia, Y; Procop, G W; Richter, S S; Worley, S; Liu, W; Esper, F",Clin. microbiol. infect,,106

The quest for more resilience in handling the pandemic has reinforced climate-related actions. Is this convergence a happenstance that will disappear as the viral load dwindles? Under the shock of COVID-19, societies might prime the pump for a more lasting shift toward resilience thanks to a convergence between the combat against the circulation of viruses and the fight against the proliferation of CO2. This discussion of how this convergence can be organized in the medium and long terms indicates how finance could make a genuine contribution.","De Perthuis, Christian",Responsabilité &amp; Environnement,,106

LNG Sales and Purchase Agreements (SPAs) are no exception. Courts in several jurisdictions have declared Covid-19 a force majeure event. Governments have issued guidelines on managing Covid-related contract disputes. The stage is set for high-value litigation turning on the validity of force majeure clauses. The purpose of this article is to help make sense of these developments. It will review the theory and application of the law of force majeure and, through comparison of six published LNG SPAs, 'stress test' current force majeure provisions. The article will consider how contractual risk is presently allocated in these model contracts, what drafting modifications might be applied to improve coverage, align with current case law, better reflect the market environment, and ensure contractual stability under Covid-19 conditions.

460524,"When It Matters Most, The Best of Who We Are Shows Up",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Commercially available serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 detect antibodies to either the nucleocapsid or spike protein. Here we compare the performance of the Beckman-Coulter SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay to that of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG and Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid total antibody assays. In addition, we document the trend in nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in sequential samples collected from convalescent plasma donors. METHODS: Plasma or serum samples from 20 individual SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive inpatients (n = 172), 20 individual convalescent donors with a previous RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 20), were deemed positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. RT-PCR-negative inpatients (n = 24), and 109 pre-SARS-CoV-2 samples were determined to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Samples were assayed by the Abbott, Roche, and Beckman assays. RESULTS: All three assays demonstrated 100% specificity. Abbott, Beckman, and Roche platforms had sensitivities of 98%, 93%, and 90% respectively, with the difference in sensitivity attributed primarily to samples from immunocompromised patients. After the exclusion of samples immunocompromised patients, all assays exhibited &#8805; 95% sensitivity. In sequential samples collected from the same individuals, the Roche nucleocapsid antibody assay demonstrated continually increasing signal intensity, with maximal values observed at the last time point examined. In contrast, the Beckman spike IgG antibody signal peaked between 14 and 28 days post positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and steadily declined in subsequent samples. Subsequent collections 51-200 days (median of 139 days) post positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from five inpatients and five convalescent donors revealed that spike and nucleocapsid antibodies remained detectable for several months after confirmed infection. CONCLUSIONS: The three assays are sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Nucleocapsid and spike antibodies were detectable for up to 200 days post-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR but demonstrated markedly different trends in signal intensity.","Poore, Brad; Nerenz, Robert D; Brodis, Dina; Brown, Charles I; Cervinski, Mark A; Hubbard, Jacqueline A",Clin. biochem,,106

This commentary shares 1) findings from our study involving analysis of 17 focus groups of students, faculty, staff, and parents of students to explore effective COVID-19 messages about campus safety, and 2) insights into the process of integrating the expertise of a university health communication center into campus-wide responses to COVID-19. Key focus group takeaways highlight the importance of communicating empathetically, acknowledging those who are made vulnerable through their work on campus, and that promises to return to normal would be perceived as unrealistic. Bringing the evidence base of health communication to the typical work of professional communicators on campus allowed us to create a communication toolkit for consistent messaging, and in turn, learn about the vital role health communication scholars can play in university crisis messaging.","Mackert, M; Table, B; Yang, J; Bouchacourt, L; Woods, J M; Bernhardt, J M; Wagner, J Hughes",Health Commun,,106
460775,Warriors: a poetry tribute to frontline nurses and healthcare workers,2020,"As part of the urgent need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, healthcare providers, and businesses have looked to applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to compensate for the unavailability of human workers. This interest has renewed the debate regarding the use of AI for the automation of work, which has been described as Intelligent Automation (IA). A new dimension to this debate is whether COVID-19 will be the catalyst for higher IA adoption levels. This article reviews arguments in favour of COVID-19 increasing the level of IA adoption and possible counter-arguments. Key arguments in favour of increased IA adoption include consumer preferences changing to favour IA, increasing familiarity of IA technologies, and increased business confidence in IA. Counter-arguments include big data availability and reliability limitations, many tasks still favouring human skills over IA, the narrow capabilities of IA technologies, and a high availability of human workers. The article also discusses the implications of this debate for information management research and practice.","Coombs, Crispin",Int J Inf Manage,,106

460990,"The profession, the pandemic, and a guiding principle",2020,"Comparing median outcomes to gauge treatment effectiveness is widespread practice in clinical and other investigations. While common, such difference-in-median characterizations of effectiveness are but one way to summarize how outcome distributions compare. This paper explores properties of median treatment effects (TEs) as indicators of treatment effectiveness. The paper's main focus is on decisionmaking based on median TEs and it proceeds by considering two paths a decisionmaker might follow. Along one, decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians alongside partially identified median differences; along the other decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians in conjunction with other point-identified parameters. On both paths familiar difference-in-median measures play some role yet in both the traditional standards are augmented with information that will often be relevant in assessing treatments' effectiveness. Implementing either approach is straightforward. In addition to its analytical results the paper considers several policy contexts in which such considerations arise. While the paper is framed by recently reported findings on treatments for COVID-19 and uses several such studies to explore empirically some properties of median-treatment-effect measures of effectiveness, its results should be broadly applicable.","Mullahy, John",Health Econ,,106

Methods: The data were collected with an anonymous online survey composed of validated questionnaires and additional questions to quantify changed circumstances during the pandemic. Data were collected from May 18 to June 17, 2020, while governmental restrictions were imposed in Germany. We exclusively analysed participants working in home office during this time. Results: Participants woke up about 1 hour later during the COVID-19 restriction phase, while going to bed at almost the same time as before. During the week, participants slept about an hour longer, while sleep at weekends did not differ significantly. Social jetlag decreased from 1:39â¯± 1:00 to 0:49â¯± 0:42â¯min in our sample. The number of children in the household was a significant factor predicting sleep timing. Participants with children living in the same household slept longer and sleep onset was later. Conclusion: In terms of sleep behaviour and, consequently, sleep health, participants benefited from the transition to home office. They were able to adapt their waking and working hours better to their biological rhythm, which reduced social jetlag.","Staller, Naomi; Randler, Christoph",Somnologie (Berl),,106

462422,Considerations for Continuing Simulation Training During Infectious Outbreaks,2020,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is causing a global pandemic of life-threatening multiorgan disease, called COVID-19. Accumulating evidence indicates that patients with COVID-19 are at significant risk of thromboembolic complications, mainly affecting the venous, but also the arterial vascular system. While the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) appears to be higher in patients requiring intensive care unit support compared to those admitted to general wards, recent autopsy findings and data on the timing of VTE diagnosis relative to hospitalization clearly suggest that thromboembolic events also contribute to morbidity and mortality in the ambulatory setting. In addition to a severe hypercoagulable state caused by systemic inflammation and viral endotheliitis, some patients with advanced COVID-19 may develop a coagulopathy, which meets established laboratory criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation, but is not typically associated with relevant bleeding. Similar to other medical societies, the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research has issued empirical recommendations on initiation, dosing, and duration of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.","Langer, Florian; Kluge, Stefan; Klamroth, Robert; Oldenburg, Johannes",Hamostaseologie,,106

It is more commonly seen in children after cardiac surgery for congenital heart diseases, but has been reported in adults and is associated with &lt;20 systemic/pulmonary illnesses like tuberculosis (TB), cystic fibrosis (CF) and lymphatic anomalies (LA). Here, we report a case of PB due to a thoracic duct (TD) malformation. Case Description: A 24-year-old woman with Graves' disease presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 1-month history of unremitting cough with expectoration of thick white casts. She reported associated malaise but denied fevers, chest pain, or hemoptysis. She was a former smoker and denied any history of congenital heart disease or cardiac surgeries. In the ED, she was afebrile (36.8°C ), normotensive (134/74 mmHg), and saturating 100% on room air. Initial labs were significant for low TSH (&lt;0.01 uIU/ml) and high free thyroxine (1.9 ng/dl). COVID-19 PCR and respiratory viral panel was negative. Computed tomography chest showed pan-lobar centrilobular ground glass (left greater than right), enlarged thyroid and thymus. Autoimmune workup(ANA, c-ANCA, p-ANCA, Anti-GBM Ab, SSA), Aspergillus fumigates antibodies, sweat chloride test, and quantitative immunoglobulins were unrevealing. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 3 showed a left upper lobe cast (Figure 1). Cytology revealed a significant number of lymphocytes and macrophages in a background of mucin. BAL acid fast bacilli, bacterial, and fungal cultures were negative. Patient was discharged on day 3 for outpatient workup. Magnetic resonance lymphangiogram showed abnormal lymphatic flow from the TD into the mediastinum consistent with lymphatic PB. Subsequent lymphangiography demonstrated prominent left greater than right lymphatic malformation arising from the mid TD extending into the lung parenchyma which was successfully embolized. The patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms post-procedure. Discussion: PB is a rare disease which presents as expectoration of bronchial casts. It has been associated with various pulmonary/systemic illnesses with LA being one of them. The mechanism of cast formation in LA involves engorgement of the bronchial submucosa with slow seepage of lymph into the bronchial lumen which eventually desiccates and form casts. It can remain silent for years and manifest in adulthood after any physiologic stressor. In our patient, the likely physiologic stressor is her Graves' disease. Percutaneous lymphangiogram followed by TD embolization is a less invasive intervention shown to provide a successful resolution of symptoms in patients with lymphatic PB.","Rawal, H.; Ali, M.; Paik, M.

METHODS: Six sedated male sheep (weighing 42-54 kg) underwent a controlled hemorrhage until the systolic blood pressure (BP) dropped to <90 mmHg, and were placed into a low capacity Eurocopter AS-350 (France). During the 30-minutes normal flight, every animal underwent blind (left side) and ultrasound-guided (US) (right side) vascular access (VA) to the femoral artery followed by REBOA: the first catheter (Rescue balloon, Japan) - into Zone I, the second one (MIT, Russia) - Zone III. In case of blind VA failure, an alternate US-puncture was attempted. Six experienced flight anesthetists were enrolled into the study. Vascular access and REBOA catheter placement (confirmed by X-Ray later) success rate and timing were recorded. RESULTS: Among six blind punctures one was successful, 2/6 - were into the vein, 3/6 - completely failed and switched to US-punctures (making total number of US-punctures nine). Eight out of nine US-punctures were successful. However, correct wire insertion and sheath placement was performed in 1/6 animal in the 'blind' group and only in 6/9 animals in the 'US' group. It took a median of 65 seconds (range 5-260) for US-puncture and a median of 4 minutes to get the sheath in. Among the 9 VAs, there were 2 REBOA failures (1 ruptured balloon [MIT] and 1 mistaken vena cava placement primarily recognized by a sudden drop of BP and later confirmed by X-Ray). Five out of seven balloons were placed in a desired intra-aortic position: 4/5 in Zone I and 1/2 - in Zone III. A median time for a successful REBOA procedure was 5.0 (range 2.5-10.0) minutes (1 min after sheath placement). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the potential feasibility of the en-route REBOA which can be performed within 5 minutes. Ultrasound-guidance is critically important to achieve en-route VA.","Reva, Viktor A; Perevedentcev, Andrey V; Pochtarnik, Alexander A; Khupov, Murat T; Kalinina, Angelina A; Samokhvalov, Igor M; Khan, Mansoor A",Injury,,106

464723,A multi-task pipeline with specialized streams for classification and segmentation of infection manifestations in COVID-19 scans,2020,"After the onset of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies reported on possible changes in electricity consumption trends. The overall theme of these reports was that ``electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but the power grid is still reliable''---mostly due to reduced economic activity. In this paper we analyze electricity data upto end of May 2020, examining both electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid, such as peak demand and demand ramp-rate. We limit this study to three states in the USA: New York, California, and Florida. The results indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction from comparable time frames, and there are noticeable differences among regions. The variables that can indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages: some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is correcting for weather. We provide a weather-correction method, apply it to a small city-wide area, and discuss the implications of the estimated changes in demand. The weather correction exercise underscored that weather-correction is as challenging as it is important.","Agdas, Duzgun; Barooah, Prabir",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16504v1.pdf,106

The review highlights the improved treatment coverage where there are women CDDs, the benefits and lessons from the work of CDDs, their long-term engagement, and the challenges they face in healthcare delivery. It underscores the value of utilising the CDD model for strong community engagement and recommends the model, with some review, to hasten the achievement of the NTD 2030 goal and assist the health system cope with evolving epidemics and other challenges. We propose that, based on the unprecedented progress made in the control of NTDs directly linked to community engagement and contributions of CDDs ""foot soldiers,"" they deserve regional and global recognition. We also suggest that the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international stakeholders promote policy and guidance for countries to adapt this model for the elimination of NTDs and to strengthen national health services. This will enhance the accomplishment of some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 in sub-Saharan Africa.","Amazigo, Uche V; Leak, Stephen G A; Zoure, Honorat G M; Okoronkwo, Chukwu; Diop Ly, Maimouna; Isiyaku, Sunday; Crump, Andy; Okeibunor, Joseph C; Boatin, Boakye",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,106
464824,Are UK doctors getting sufficient protective equipment against covid-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused state-wide shutdowns of elective surgical activities in March and April of 2020 forcing graduate medical education program directors and their trainees in the United States to quickly adapt to new rules and circumstances. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the current pandemic on pediatric anesthesiology fellow education and wellness nationally in order to guide creation of optimal support systems for fellows during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: In July 2020, an electronically distributed survey was sent to all United States-based pediatric anesthesiology fellowship program directors who were asked to distribute the survey to all current/graduating fellows. RESULTS: A total of 75 out of 184 pediatric anesthesiology fellows (41%) responded to the survey. Major domains identified include reduction of clinical time, financial impact, mental health/wellness effects, and concerns about the overall quality of the fellowship educational experience. Respondents indicated that the pandemic has led to personal quarantine (and/or illness) leave time (21.3%), changes in finances (42.7%) and career opportunities (37.3%), decreased clinical education/experience (28%), and a dissatisfaction with the modified didactic experience (22.7%). In addition, a majority of respondents (97.3%) experienced increased stressors during this pandemic, including worry for family members (80%), stress due to changes in certifying examinations (76%), and fear of contracting COVID-19 from a patient (72%). CONCLUSION: While the results of this survey are only one snapshot in time during an evolving pandemic, these results highlight important domains where program directors and other departmental leaders might focus limited resources to maximize the educational experiences and overall wellness for pediatric anesthesiology fellows.","Shih, Grace; Deer, Jeremy D; Lau, Jennifer; Loveland Baptist, Lindsey; Lim, Doyle J; Lockman, Justin L",Paediatr. anaesth,,106
464826,Are UK doctors getting sufficient protective equipment against covid-19?,2020,"As the airways of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients contain a high viral load, bronchoscopy is associated with increased risk of patient to health care worker transmission due to aerosolised viral particles and contamination of surfaces during bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is not appropriate for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and, as an aerosol generating procedure involving a significant risk of transmission, has a very limited role in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients including children. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic rigid bronchoscopy should be avoided due to the increased risk of droplet spread. Flexible bronchoscopy should be performed first in SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals or in unknown cases, to determine if rigid bronchoscopy is indicated. When available single-use flexible bronchoscopes may be considered for use; devices are available with a range of diameters, and improved image quality and degrees of angulation. When rigid bronchoscopy is necessary, jet ventilation must be avoided and conventional ventilation be used to reduce the risk of aerosolisation. Adequate personal protection equipment is key, as is training of health care workers in correct donning and doffing. Modified full face masks are a practical and safe alternative to filtering facepieces for use in bronchoscopy. When anaesthetic and infection prevention control protocols are strictly adhered to, bronchoscopy can be performed in SARS-CoV-2 positive children.","Eber, Ernst; Goussard, Pierre",Paediatr Respir Rev,,106

METHODS: All patients hospitalized from 1 February to 15 March 2020 were included in the study (nâ=â35; 16 men; mean age 78 years). The overall population was divided into two groups: group 1 included 10 patients who presented with a clinical picture of COVID-19 infection and were isolated, and group 2 included 25 patients who were COVID-19-negative. In group 1, nine patients were on chronic oral anticoagulant therapy and one patient was on acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel. A chest computed tomography scan revealed interstitial pneumonia in all 10 patients. RESULTS: During hospitalization, COVID-19 patients received azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in addition to their ongoing therapy. Only the patient on ASA with clopidogrel therapy was transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation because of worsening respiratory failure, and subsequently died from cardiorespiratory arrest. All other patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy recovered and were discharged. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that COVID-19 patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy may have a more favorable and less complicated clinical course. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm this preliminary observation.","Inama, Giuseppe; Dodi, Claudio; Provini, Martino; Bossoni, Enzo; Inama, Lorenza; Balzarini, Laura; Mancini, Chiara; Ramponi, Sara; Marvisi, Maurizio",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,106
468099,Music Reference Services Pre-covid-19: a Climate Survey in the Recent before Times,2021,"Older migrants may be one of the most vulnerable populations during the coronavirus pandemic, yet the degree of impact remains largely unknown. This study explores (1) the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for older Chinese migrants in Belgium and the Netherlands in terms of increased loneliness and its risk factors (reduced in-person contact, decreased social participation, feelings of existential threat) and protective factors (increased non-in-person contact, more individual activities), and (2) which risk and protective factors have contributed to the incidence and prevention of higher loneliness levels. Using quantitative data of a survey among 98 Chinese migrants aged 50 years and older in Belgium (n = 84) and the Netherlands (n = 14), the findings first indicate that the coronavirus pandemic has a significant impact on older Chinese migrants' lives. One in five experienced more loneliness. Second, reduced social participation (measured as less frequent participation in outdoor group activities) and financial insecurity (measured as experiencing financial difficulties) lead to higher than pre-pandemic loneliness levels. Problem-focused coping strategies (measured as increased non-in-person contact, via telephone or social media) and emotion-focused coping (measured as finding distraction through increased participation in individual activities) were not found to protect against increased loneliness in the pandemic. Two practical implications for loneliness interventions for older Chinese migrants are put forward. Organizing COVID-19-safe social participation activities and paying more attention to older Chinese migrants' financial situation can be beneficial when addressing higher levels of loneliness due to the coronavirus pandemic.","Pan, Honghui; Fokkema, Tineke; Switsers, Lise; Dury, Sarah; Hoens, Sylvia; De Donder, Liesbeth",Eur J Ageing,,106

The purpose of this study is to explain the reasons for not maintaining health guidelines to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk jobs in Iran. METHODS: The present study was conducted with a qualitative approach among people with high-risk jobs in Tehran during March and April of 2020. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 31 people with high-risk occupations selected by purposeful sampling and snowballing. The data were analyzed using the conventional qualitative content analysis method and MAXQDA-18 software. Guba and Lincoln's criteria were also used to evaluate the quality of the research results. RESULTS: 4 main categories and 13 sub-categories were obtained, including individual factors (personality traits, lack of self-efficacy, little knowledge of the disease and how to observe health norms related to it, misconceptions about health), structural factors (difficulty of access to health supplies, lack of supportive environment, weak laws and supervision, the poor performance of officials and national media), economic factors (economic costs of living, lack of government economic support), Socio-cultural factors (learning, cultural beliefs, social customs, and rituals). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention requires intervention at different levels. At the individual level: increasing people's awareness and understanding about how to prevent COVID-19 and strengthening self-efficacy in observing health norms, at the social level: highlighting positive patterns of observing health issues and training people about the consequences of social interactions during the outbreak of the virus, and at the macro level: strengthening regulatory rules and increasing people's access to hygienic products and support for the vulnerable must be taken into account.","SoleimanvandiAzar, Neda; Irandoost, Seyed Fahim; Ahmadi, Sina; Xosravi, Tareq; Ranjbar, Hadi; Mansourian, Morteza; Yoosefi Lebni, Javad",BMC Public Health,,106

Parents are key decision-makers for whether their children will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. ObjectiveTo estimate parents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19, and to investigate the predictors for their decision. MethodsWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and CINAHL from inception to August 11, 2021. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273125). We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity was very high. We used subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore sources of heterogeneity. ResultsWe found 17 studies including 45,783 parents. The overall proportion of parents that intend to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 was 56.8% (95% confidence interval: 51.8-61.8%). Parents willingness ranged from 29% to 72.7%. Studies quality, sample size, data collection time, and the continent that studies were conducted did not affect the results. The main predictors of parents intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 were male gender, older age of parents and children, higher socio-economic status, white race, positive attitudes toward vaccination, higher levels of knowledge, and higher levels of perceived threat from the COVID-19, worry, fear, and anxiety. ConclusionsParents willingness to vaccinate their children against the COVID-19 is moderate and several factors affect this decision. Understanding parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy does help policy makers to change the stereotypes and establish broad community COVID-19 vaccination. Identification of the factors that affect parents willingness to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 will provide opportunities to enhance parents trust in the COVID-19 vaccines and optimize childrens uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Siskou, Olga; Konstantakopoulou, Olympia; Katsiroumpa, Aglaia; Kaitelidou, Daphne",,,106

ICT-based online education and training can be a useful measure during the pandemic. In the Pakistani educational context, the use of ICT-based online training is generally sporadic and often unavailable, especially for developing English-language instructors' listening comprehension skills. The major factors affecting availability include insufficient IT resources and infrastructure, a lack of proper online training for speech and listening, instructors with inadequate academic backgrounds, and an unfavorable environment for ICT-based training for listening comprehension. This study evaluated the effectiveness of ICT-based training for developing secondary-level English-language instructors' listening comprehension skills. To this end, collaborative online training was undertaken using random sampling. Specifically, 60 private-school instructors in Chakwal District, Pakistan, were randomly selected to receive online-listening training sessions using English dialogs. The experimental group achieved significant scores in the posttest analysis. Specifically, there were substantial improvements in the participants' listening skills via online training. Given the unavailability of face-to-face learning during COVID-19, this study recommends using ICT-based online training to enhance listening comprehension skills.

471294,Spatiotemporal pattern of COVID-19 spread in Brazil,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection that presents a significant annual burden to Canadians and the Canadian healthcare system. Social distancing measures that were implemented to control the 2019-2020 novel coronavirus outbreak were investigated for their ability to lessen the incident cases of seasonal influenza. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study using data from Canada's national influenza surveillance system to investigate whether social distancing measures to control COVID-19 reduced the incident cases of seasonal influenza. Data taken from three separate time frames facilitated analysis of the 2019-2020 influenza season prior to, during, and following the implementation of COVID-19-related measures and enabled comparisons with the same time periods during three preceding flu seasons. The incidence, which referred to the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of specific influenza strains, was of primary focus. Further analysis determined the number of new laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness outbreaks. RESULTS: Our results indicate a premature end to the 2019-2020 influenza season, with significantly fewer cases and outbreaks being recorded following the enactment of many COVID-19 social distancing policies. The incidence of influenza strains A (H3N2), A (unsubtyped), and B were all significantly lower at the tail end of the 2019-2020 influenza season as compared with preceding seasons (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0007, p = 0.0019). CONCLUSION: Specific social distancing measures and behaviours may serve as effective tools to limit the spread of influenza transmission moving forward, as they become more familiar.","Pierce, Andrew; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; Marin, Diana; Rueda, Zulma V; Keynan, Yoav",Can. j. public health,,106

Using a measles virus (rMeV) vaccine strain as the backbone, we developed a series of recombinant attenuated vaccine candidates expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) and evaluated their efficacy in cotton rat, IFNAR-/-mice, IFNAR-/--hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that rMeV expressing stabilized prefusion S protein (rMeV-preS) was more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S), while the rMeVs expressing different lengths of RBD (rMeV-RBD) were the least potent. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS produced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients and a strong Th1-biased T cell response. The rMeV-preS also provided complete protection of hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing replication in lungs and nasal turbinates, body weight loss, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. These data demonstrate that rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate, supporting its further development as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Lu, Mijia; Dravid, Piyush; Zhang, Yuexiu; Trivedi, Sheetal; Li, Anzhong; Harder, Olivia; Kc, Mahesh; Chaiwatpongsakorn, Supranee; Zani, Ashley; Kenney, Adam; Zeng, Cong; Cai, Chuanxi; Ye, Chengjin; Liang, Xueya; Shimamura, Masako; Liu, Shan-Lu; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio; Boyaka, Prosper N; Qiu, Jianming; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Yount, Jacob S; Peeples, Mark E; Kapoor, Amit; Niewiesk, Stefan; Li, Jianrong",Proc.

However, due to inflammatory reactions at high vector doses, adjunctive treatment may be necessary to enhance the therapeutic outcome. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs that have been successfully used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Evidence suggests that at high concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can impact viral infection and replication by increasing endosomal and lysosomal pH. This effect has led to investigations into the potential benefits of these drugs in the treatment of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. However, at lower concentrations, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine appear to exert immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting nucleic acid sensors, including toll-like receptor 9 and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. This dose-dependent effect on their mechanism of action supports observations of increased viral infections associated with lower drug doses. In this review, we explore the immunomodulatory activity of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, their impact on viral infections, and their potential to improve the efficacy and safety of retinal gene therapy by reducing AAV-induced immune responses. The safety and practicalities of delivering hydroxychloroquine into the retina will also be discussed.","Chandler, Laurel C; Yusuf, Imran H; McClements, Michelle E; Barnard, Alun R; MacLaren, Robert E; Xue, Kanmin",,,106

475774,A Rare Case of Tumoral Scleromyxedema,2020,"Online influence maximization (OIM) is a popular problem in social networks to learn influence propagation model parameters and maximize the influence spread at the same time. Most previous studies focus on the independent cascade (IC) model under the edge-level feedback. In this paper, we address OIM in the linear threshold (LT) model. Because node activations in the LT model are due to the aggregated effect of all active neighbors, it is more natural to model OIM with the node-level feedback. And this brings new challenge in online learning since we only observe aggregated effect from groups of nodes and the groups are also random. Based on the linear structure in node activations, we incorporate ideas from linear bandits and design an algorithm LT-LinUCB that is consistent with the observed feedback. By proving group observation modulated (GOM) bounded smoothness property, a novel result of the influence difference in terms of the random observations, we provide a regret of order $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(m)\sqrt{T})$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $T$ is the number of rounds. This is the first theoretical result in such order for OIM under the LT model. In the end, we also provide an algorithm OIM-ETC with regret bound $O(\mathrm{poly}(m)\ T^{2/3})$, which is model-independent, simple and has less requirement on online feedback and offline computation.","Li, Shuai; Kong, Fang; Tang, Kejie; Li, Qizhi; Chen, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06378v1.pdf,106
475776,A Study of Issues Related to the Operation of Evacuation Shelters in a Corona-Endemic Society – Through the Guidelines and Training of Shiga Prefecture in Japan,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious; however, the different routes of transmission are not well understood. Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. RECENT FINDINGS: Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. This includes corneal transplantation, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in conjunctival swabs of infected patients, and the ocular surface may play an important role in viral entry. Several tissue transplantation organizations have guidelines in place regarding the screening of donors and tissue procurement procedures, including clinical and/or PCR screening of donors. The Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) is currently not recommending asymptomatic PCR screening. However, their antiseptic protocols may play an important role in viral inactivation. SUMMARY: Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low. However, tissue screening guidelines need to be re-evaluated regularly as knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves.","Ballouz, Dena; Mian, Shahzad I",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,,106

The increased death from COVID-19 is due to the unavailability of a gold standard therapeutic and, more importantly, the lack of understanding of how the comorbid conditions and COVID-19 interact at the molecular level, so that personalized management strategies can be adopted. Here, using multi-omics data sets and bioinformatics strategy, we identified the pathway crosstalk between COVID-19 and diabetes, hypertension, CVDs, CKDs, and cancers. Further, shared pathways and hub gene-based targets for COVID-19 and its associated specific and combination of comorbid conditions are also predicted towards developing personalized management strategies. The approved drugs for most of these identified targets are also provided towards drug repurposing. Literature supports the involvement of our identified shared pathways in pathogenesis of COVID-19 and development of the specific comorbid condition of interest. Similarly, shared pathways- and hub gene-based targets are also found to have potential implementations in managing COVID-19 patients. However, the identified targets and drugs need further careful evaluation for their repurposing towards personalized treatment of COVID-19 cases having pre-existing specific comorbid conditions we have considered in this analysis. The method applied here may also be helpful in identifying common pathway components and targets in other disease-disease interactions too.","Barh, Debmalya Aljabali Alaa A.; Tambuwala, Murtaza M.; Tiwari, Sandeep Serrano-Aroca Ángel Alzahrani Khalid J.; Silva Andrade, Bruno Azevedo Vasco Ganguly Nirmal Kumar Lundstrom Kenneth",Biomedicines,,106

We tested residual donor plasma minipools (MPs) to determine SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia prevalence in six United States areas. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Blood donations collected from 7 March 2020 to 25 September 2020 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (vRNA) in MP of 6 or 16 donations using the Grifols Procleix SARS-CoV-2 research-use only (RUO) transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay. Reactive results were confirmed using an alternate target region TMA assay. Reactive MPs were tested by TMA after serial dilution to estimate viral load. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and infectivity was performed. RESULTS: A total of 17,995 MPs corresponding to approximately 258,000 donations were tested for vRNA. Three confirmed reactive MP16 were identified. The estimated prevalence of vRNA reactive donations was 1.16/100,000 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42). The vRNA-reactive samples were non-reactive for antibody, and the estimated viral loads of the (presumed single) positive donations within each MP ranged from <1000 to <4000 copies/ml. When tested, no infectivity was observed in inoculated permissive cell cultures. DISCUSSION: Blood donation MP-nucleic acid testing (NAT) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is infrequent and, when detected, the vRNA was at low concentrations. Only one RNA-reactive MP could be tested for infectivity for operational reasons and was not infectious in cell culture. These findings support current recommendations from international and national regulatory agencies to not screen donors by NAT.","Bakkour, Sonia; Saá, Paula; Groves, Jamel A; Montalvo, Leilani; Di Germanio, Clara; Best, Sonja M; Grebe, Eduard; Livezey, Kristin; Linnen, Jeffrey M; Strauss, Donna; Kessler, Debra; Bonn, Mark; Green, Valerie; Williamson, Phillip; Kleinman, Steve; Stramer, Susan L; Stone, Mars; Busch, Michael P",Transfusion,,106

Here, we investigated an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a ""non-COVID-19"" hospital ward unveiled by massive testing, which challenged the reconstruction of transmission chains. The contacts network during the 15-day period before the screening was investigated, and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples were subjected to virus genome sequencing. Of the 245 tested individuals, 48 (21 patients and 27 HCWs) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. HCWs were mostly asymptomatic, but the mortality among patients reached 57.1% (12/21). Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all cases were part of the same transmission chain. By combining contact tracing and genomic data, including analysis of emerging minor variants, we unveiled a scenario of silent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, mostly driven by the close contact within the HCWs group and between HCWs and patients. This investigation triggered enhanced prevention and control measures, leading to more timely detection and containment of novel outbreaks. This study shows the benefit of combining genomic and epidemiological data for disclosing complex nosocomial outbreaks, and provides valuable data to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.","Borges, Vítor; Isidro, Joana; Macedo, Filipe; Neves, José; Silva, Luís; Paiva, Mário; Barata, José; Catarino, Judite; Ciobanu, Liliana; Duarte, Sílvia; Vieira, Luís; Guiomar, Raquel; Gomes, João Paulo",Viruses,,106

The disease led to significant mortality and morbidity in Turkey, since the first case was reported on March 11th, 2020. Studies suggest a positive association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ambient particulate matters (PM), as potential carriers for SARS-CoV-2. Ambient PM samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban and urban-background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities across Turkey between 13th of May and 14th of June 2020 to investigate the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. A total of 203 daily samples (TSP, n = 80; PM2.5, n = 33; PM2.5-10, n = 23; PM10µm, n = 19; and 6 size segregated PM, n = 48) were collected using various samplers.

According to real time (RT)-PCR and three-dimensional (3D) digital (d) PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 (9.8%) samples. Ambient PM-bound SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed quantitatively and the air concentrations of the virus ranged from 0.1 copies/m3 to 23 copies/m3. The highest percentages of virus detection on PM samples were from hospital gardens in Tekirdag, Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles, especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots. However, whether this has an impact on the spread of the virus infection remains to be determined.","Kayalar, Özgecan; Ari, Akif; Babuççu, Gizem; Konyalilar, Nur; Dogan, Özlem; Can, Füsun; Sahin, Ülkü A; Gaga, Eftade O; Levent Kuzu, S; Ari, Pelin Ertürk; Odabasi, Mustafa; Tasdemir, Yücel; Siddik Cindoruk, S; Esen, Fatma; Sakin, Egemen; Çaliskan, Burak; Tecer, Lokman H; Fiçici, Merve; Altin, Ahmet; Onat, Burcu; Ayvaz, Coskun; Uzun, Burcu; Saral, Arslan; Dögeroglu, Tuncay; Malkoç, Semra; Üzmez, Özlem Özden; Kunt, Fatma; Aydin, Senar; Kara, Melik; Yaman, Baris; Dogan, Güray; Olgun, Bihter; Dokumaci, Ebru N; Güllü, Gülen; Uzunpinar, Elif S; Bayram, Hasan",Sci Total Environ,,106

Here, we obtain serum and saliva samples from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b2), infected and uninfected individuals and characterize the antibody response to RBD mutant strains. Vaccinated individuals have a robust humoral response after the second dose and have high IgG antibody titers in the saliva. Antibody responses however show considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants of emerging variants of concern and substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization is observed against a patient-isolated South African variant. Taken together our data reinforce the importance of the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies and high antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant further highlights the importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.","Becker, Matthias; Dulovic, Alex; Junker, Daniel; Ruetalo, Natalia; Kaiser, Philipp D; Pinilla, Yudi T; Heinzel, Constanze; Haering, Julia; Traenkle, Bjoern; Wagner, Teresa R; Layer, Mirjam; Mehrlaender, Martin; Mirakaj, Valbona; Held, Jana; Planatscher, Hannes; Schenke-Layland, Katja; Krause, Gérard; Strengert, Monika; Bakchoul, Tamam; Althaus, Karina; Fendel, Rolf; Kreidenweiss, Andrea; Koeppen, Michael; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Schindler, Michael; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole",Nat Commun,,106

To this end, a questionnaire was administered to Spanish social service professionals working, obtaining a sample of 560 professionals in the sector. The profile obtained in relation to teleworking may be especially useful when considering the progressive incorporation of more non-presential activity in social services, and the results show that, although teleworking has been perceived as an efficient way of overcoming the limitations to face-to-face work arising from the pandemic, both the positive and negative consequences of the implementation of this modality of work should be carefully assessed.","Morilla-Luchena, Aleix; Muñoz-Moreno, Rocío; Chaves-Montero, Alfonso; Vázquez-Aguado, Octavio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,106

The Cryptodira showed conservation in the primary structure at conserved sequence blocks (CSBs), but the Pleurodira displayed limited conservation of primary structural characters, other than the coreTAS, a binding site for the helicase TWINKLE, which was highly conserved in the Central and Right Domains across the order. No secondary structure was associated with a TAS, but an AT-rich fold (secondary structure) near the 3' terminus of the mtD-loop region was detected in all turtle superfamilies. Mapping of character states of structural features of the mtD-loop region revealed that most character states were autapomorphies and inferred a number of homoplasies. The Left Domain of turtles, containing no highly conserved structural elements, likely does not serve a functional role; therefore, the Central Domain in turtles is likely equivalent to the Left Domain of mammals. The AT-rich secondary structural element near the 3' terminus of the mtD-loop region may be conserved across turtles because of a functional role, perhaps containing the Light Strand Promotor, or perhaps interacting with the TWINKLE-coreTAS complex in the Central and Right Domains to regulate mtDNA replication and transcription.","Bernacki, Lucas E; Kilpatrick, C William",J Mol Evol,,106

Reports on the association of frailty with poor outcome have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the independent association between frailty and in-hospital mortality in older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: This was a multi-centre retrospective cohort study in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, including all patients aged &#8805;70 years, who were hospitalised with clinically confirmed COVID-19 between February and May 2020. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidity, disease severity and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,376 patients were included (median age 78 years (IQR 74-84), 60% male). In total, 499 (38%) patients died during hospital admission. Parameters indicating presence of frailty (CFS 6-9) were associated with more co-morbidities, shorter symptom duration upon presentation (median 4 vs. 7 days), lower oxygen demand and lower levels of CRP. In multivariable analyses, the CFS was independently associated with in-hospital mortality: compared to patients with CFS 1-3, patients with CFS 4-5 had a two times higher risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95%CI 1.3-3.0) and patients with CFS 6-9 had a three times higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.8 (95%CI 1.8-4.3)). CONCLUSIONS: The in-hospital mortality of older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands was 38%. Frailty was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality, even though COVID-19 patients with frailty presented earlier to the hospital with less severe symptoms.","Blomaard, Laura C; van der Linden, Carolien M J; van der Bol, Jessica M; Jansen, Steffy W M; Polinder-Bos, Harmke A; Willems, Hanna C; Festen, Jan; Barten, Dennis G; Borgers, Anke J; Bos, Jeannet C; van den Bos, Frederiek; de Brouwer, Esther J M; van Deudekom, Floor J A; van Dijk, Suzanne C; Emmelot-Vonk, Mariëlle H; Geels, Raya E S; van de Glind, Esther M M; de Groot, Bas; Hempenius, Liesbeth; Kamper, Ad M; Kampschreur, Linda M; de Koning, Marre M M; Labots, Geert; Looman, Roy; Lucke, Jacinta A; Maas, Huub A A M; Mattace-Raso, Francesco U S; El Moussaoui, Rachida; van Munster, Barbara C; van Nieuwkoop, Kees; Oosterwijk, Leanne Ble; Regtuijt, Marlies Em; Robben, Sarah H M; Ruiter, Rikje; Salarbaks, Aisha M; Schouten, Henrike J; Smit, Orla M; Smits, Rosalinde A L; Spies, Petra E; Vreeswijk, Ralph; de Vries, Oscar J; Wijngaarden, Marjolein A; Wyers, Caroline E; Mooijaart, Simon P",Age ageing,,106

Specifically, the availability of generated iodine density maps, virtual monoenergetic images, and effective atomic number maps allow for better evaluation of thoracic lesions compared to conventional CT. SDCT has previously been shown to be useful in the differentiation of benign vs malignant pulmonary nodules, pleural lesions, and lymph nodes. We describe 3 cases in which a patient presents with an indeterminate tracheal or bronchial lesion on conventional CT and subsequent SDCT reconstructions provided additional information which helped guide diagnosis or management of the patient. The goal is to help clinicians understand the benefit of SDCT in the detection and workup of airway lesions.","Fu, Tianyuan; Gad, Mohamed M; Gupta, Amit",Clin Imaging,,106

Here, a novel type of adhesive coacervate is reported, driven by hydrogen-bonding interactions, readily formed by mixing silicotungstic acid and nonionic polyethylene glycol in water, providing a new approach for developing coacervates from nonionic systems. The as-prepared coacervate is easily paintable underwater, show strong wet adhesion to diverse substrates, and has been successfully applied as a hemostatic agent to treat organ injuries without displaying hemolytic activity, while with inherent antimicrobial properties thus avoiding inflammations and infections due to microorganism accumulation. This work demonstrates that coacervation can occur in salt-free environments via non-electrostatic interactions, providing a new platform for engineering multifunctional coacervate materials as tissue glues, wound dressings and membrane-free cell systems.","Peng, Qiongyao; Chen, Jingsi; Zeng, Zicheng; Wang, Tao; Xiang, Li; Peng, Xuwen; Liu, Jifang; Zeng, Hongbo",Small,,106
484198,Impact of Covid19 on electricity load in Haryana (India),2020,"BACKGROUND: At the end of February 2020, the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China had drastically slowed and appeared to be under control compared to the peak data in early February of that year. However, the outcomes of COVID-19 control and prevention measures varied between regions (ie, provinces and municipalities) in China; moreover, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, and the spread of the disease has accelerated in countries outside China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish valid models to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention among various regions in China. These models also targeted regions with control and prevention problems by issuing immediate warnings. METHODS: We built a mathematical model, the Epidemic Risk Time Series Model, and used it to analyze two sets of data, including the daily COVID-19 incidence (ie, newly diagnosed cases) as well as the daily immigration population size. RESULTS: Based on the results of the model evaluation, some regions, such as Shanghai and Zhejiang, were successful in COVID-19 control and prevention, whereas other regions, such as Heilongjiang, yielded poor performance. The evaluation result was highly correlated with the basic reproduction number (R0) value, and the result was evaluated in a timely manner at the beginning of the disease outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The Epidemic Risk Time Series Model was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control and prevention in different regions in China based on analysis of immigration population data. Compared to other methods, such as R0, this model enabled more prompt issue of early warnings. This model can be generalized and applied to other countries to evaluate their COVID-19 control and prevention.","Huang, Qiangsheng; Kang, Yu Sunny",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,106

Although it is common to ascertain frailty status utilizing claims-based surrogates (e.g. diagnosis and health service codes) selected according to clinical knowledge, the accuracy of this approach has not yet been examined. We evaluated the accuracy of claims-based surrogates against two clinical definitions of frailty. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Health and Retirement Study subsample of 3097 participants, aged 65 years or older and with at least 12-months of continuous fee-for-service Medicare enrollment. We defined 18 previously utilized claims-based surrogates of frailty from Medicare data and evaluated each against clinical reference standards, ascertained from a direct examination: a deficit accumulation frailty index (FI) (range: 0-1) and frailty phenotype. We also compared the accuracy of the total count of 18 claims-based surrogates with that of a validated claims-based FI model, comprised of 93 claims-based variables. RESULTS: 19% of participants met clinical criteria for the clinical frailty phenotype. The mean clinical FI for our sample was 0.20 (standard deviation 0.13). Hospital Beds and associated supplies was the claims-based surrogate associated with the highest clinical FI (mean FI 0.49). Claims-based surrogates had low sensitivity ranging from 0.01 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) to 0.38 (malaise and fatigue) and high specificity ranging from 0.79 (malaise and fatigue) to 0.99 (cachexia, adult failure to thrive, anorexia) in discriminating the clinical frailty phenotype. Compared with a validated claims-based FI, the total count of claims-based surrogates demonstrated lower Spearman correlation with the clinical FI (0.41 [95% CI 0.38-0.44] versus 0.59 [95% CI, 0.56-0.61]) and poorer discrimination of the frailty phenotype (C-statistics 0.68 [95% CI, 0.66-0.70] versus 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73-0.77]). CONCLUSIONS: Claims-based surrogates, selected according to clinical knowledge, do not accurately capture frailty in Medicare claims data. A simple count of claims-based surrogates improves accuracy but remains inferior to a claims-based FI model.","Festa, Natalia; Shi, Sandra M; Kim, Dae Hyun",BMC Geriatr,,106

Neutralizing antibody titers declined an average of about 4-fold from 1 to 4 months after symptom onset. This decline in neutralizing antibody titers was accompanied by a decline in total antibodies capable of binding the viral spike protein or its receptor-binding domain. Importantly, our data are consistent with the expected early immune response to viral infection, where an initial peak in antibody levels is followed by a decline to a lower plateau. Additional studies of long-lived B cells and antibody titers over longer time frames are necessary to determine the durability of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.","Crawford, Katharine H D; Dingens, Adam S; Eguia, Rachel; Wolf, Caitlin R; Wilcox, Naomi; Logue, Jennifer K; Shuey, Kiel; Casto, Amanda M; Fiala, Brooke; Wrenn, Samuel; Pettie, Deleah; King, Neil P; Greninger, Alexander L; Chu, Helen Y; Bloom, Jesse D",J Infect Dis,,106

Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the compositional diversity and evolutionary patterns of accessory proteins is critical to understanding the host adaptation and epidemic variation of coronaviruses. Here, we developed a standardized genome annotation tool for coronavirus (CoroAnnoter) by combining open reading frame prediction, transcription regulatory sequence recognition and homologous alignment. Using CoroAnnoter, we annotated 39 representative coronavirus strains to form a compositional profile for all of the accessary proteins. Large variations were observed in the number of accessory proteins of 1-10 for different coronaviruses, with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV having the most (9 and 10, respectively). The variation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins could be traced back to related coronaviruses in other hosts. The genomic distribution of accessory proteins had significant intra-genus conservation and inter-genus diversity and could be grouped into 1, 4, 2 and 1 types for alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-coronaviruses, respectively. Evolutionary analysis suggested that accessory proteins are more conservative locating before the N-terminal of proteins E and M (E-M), while they are more diverse after these proteins. Furthermore, comparison of virus-host interaction networks of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV accessory proteins showed that they share multiple antiviral signaling pathways, those involved in the apoptotic process, viral life cycle and response to oxidative stress.

To investigate the relationship between chest CT features of COVID-19 and ACE2 expression patterns in the respiratory system.Methods: Between Feb 20, 2020, and Mar 6, 2020, the clinical data and chest CT images of the patient's laboratory-confirmed as COVID-19 in Hubei Medical Team of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yatsen University were retrospectively analyzed with a time-interval of 2 weeks. Besides, the expressions of ACE2 in the mucosal epithelium of different parts of the respiratory system were detected by immunohistochemical staining.Results: Of 58 patients, the main clinical manifestations were fever and cough, hardly few were sore throat and rhinorrhea. CT findings manifested as rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral groundglass opacities (GGO) that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations in chest CT scan. Spherical or patchy GGO with lung lobules as the core is the initial CT manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia. The proportion of lung consolidation is increasing as the disease progresses, account for 63.2%, 76.3% and 87.5% in group 1 (disease course with 0-2 weeks), group 2 (2-4 weeks), and group 3 (&gt;4 weeks). High density angiogram (69.2%), reticular pattern (63.1%), air bronchogram (55.4%), and pleural effusion (31.0%) were common signs of chest CT of COVID-19. IHC results showed that ACE2-expression in the pulmonary alveoli was significantly higher than that in the nasal mucosa and bronchial mucosa (P=0.001 and P&lt;0.001, respectively).Conclusion: The initial CT features of GGO with lung lobules as the core, and the main clinical manifestation of lower respiratory symptoms in COVID- 19 pneumonia are related to ACE2 expression patterns in respiratory mucosal epitheliums.","Li, W.; Zhou, Y.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,106
490845,Effectiveness of the COVID-19 Contact-Confirming Application (COCOA) based on a Multi Agent Simulation,2020-08-30,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a substantial threat to the lives of the elderly, especially those with neurodegenerative diseases, and vaccination against viral infections is recognized as an effective measure to reduce mortality. However, elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases often suffer from abnormal immune function and take multiple medications, which may complicate the role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. Currently, there is no expert consensus on whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are suitable for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. AREAS COVERED: We searched Pubmed to conduct a systematic review of published studies, case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and expert guidelines on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on neurodegenerative diseases and the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccines. We also summarized the interaction between vaccines and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The compatibility of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with neurodegenerative diseases is discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Vaccines enable the body to produce immunity by activating the body's immune response. The pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is complex, and these diseases often involve abnormal immune function, which can substantially affect the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. In short, this article provides recommendations for the use of vaccine candidates in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.","Shi, Yan; Guo, Minna; Yang, Wenjing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhu, Bin; Yang, Ling; Yang, Chun; Liu, Cunming",Expert Rev Vaccines,,106

METHODS: A cohort study was performed in 60 Spanish hospitals including 778 patients with COVID-19 and clinical and laboratory data indicative of a hyperinflammatory state. Treatment was mainly with tocilizumab, an intermediate-high dose of corticosteroids (IHDC), a pulse dose of corticosteroids (PDC), combination therapy, or no treatment. Primary outcome was intubation or death; follow-up was 21 days. Propensity score-adjusted estimations using Cox regression (logistic regression if needed) were calculated. Propensity scores were used as confounders, matching variables and for the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs). RESULTS: In all, 88, 117, 78 and 151 patients treated with tocilizumab, IHDC, PDC, and combination therapy, respectively, were compared with 344 untreated patients. The primary endpoint occurred in 10 (11.4%), 27 (23.1%), 12 (15.4%), 40 (25.6%) and 69 (21.1%), respectively. The IPTW-based hazard ratios (odds ratio for combination therapy) for the primary endpoint were 0.32 (95%CI 0.22-0.47; p < 0.001) for tocilizumab, 0.82 (0.71-1.30; p 0.82) for IHDC, 0.61 (0.43-0.86; p 0.006) for PDC, and 1.17 (0.86-1.58; p 0.30) for combination therapy. Other applications of the propensity score provided similar results, but were not significant for PDC. Tocilizumab was also associated with lower hazard of death alone in IPTW analysis (0.07; 0.02-0.17; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab might be useful in COVID-19 patients with a hyperinflammatory state and should be prioritized for randomized trials in this situation.","Rodríguez-Baño, Jesús; Pachón, Jerónimo; Carratalà, Jordi; Ryan, Pablo; Jarrín, Inmaculada; Yllescas, María; Arribas, José Ramón; Berenguer, Juan",Clin. microbiol. infect,,106

Here, the hematological characteristics of patients with severe and critical 2019-nCoV pneumonia in intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated, which may provide the necessary basis for its diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: We collected data on patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia in the ICU of Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 25 to April 2, 2020. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of 2019-nCoV, and various hematological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV using nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum after admission, and interstitial pneumonia findings were noted on chest computed tomography. Sex, age and comorbidities were not significantly different between the severe and critical groups. In terms of prognosis, the survival rate of patients in the severe group reached 100%, whereas that of patients in the critical group was only 13.33% after positive treatment. Furthermore, lymphocyte percentage, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, D-dimer, myohemoglobin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 levels were high-risk factors for disease progression in critical patients. Finally, lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels were closely associated with patient prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: 2019-nCoV pneumonia should be considered a systemic disease. Patients with more complications were more likely to develop critical disease. Lymphocyte percentage and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, myohemoglobin, and IL-6 levels can be monitored to prevent progression critical disease.","Du, Yong; Lu, Zhanjun; Jin, Jing; Shi, Tianyun; Ding, Yi; Qian, Ling; He, Wei; Huang, Qihui; Feng, Jingjing; Jiang, Rong; Chen, Xuru; Jiang, Handong; Jie, Zhijun",Int Immunopharmacol,,106

A variety of novel devices have been proposed to reduce COVID-19 cross-contamination. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was (i) to test whether patients and HCWs thought that a novel patient isolation hood was safe and comfortable and (ii) to obtain COVID-19 infection data of hospital HCWs. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 20 patients, entailing HCW/patient questionnaires and safety aspects of prototype isolation hoods. COVID-19 data of HCWs were prospectively collected. Assessment of the hood's safety and practicality and adverse event reporting was carried out. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures are as follows: questionnaire responses, adverse event reporting, rates of infections in HCWs during the study period (20/6/2020 to 21/7/2020), and COVID-19 infections in HCWs reported until the last recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 in HCWs (20/6/2020 to 27/9/2020). RESULTS: Of the 64 eligible individual HCW surveys, 60 surveys were overall favourable (>75% questions answered in favour of the isolation hood). HCWs were unanimous in perceiving the hood as safe (60/60), preferring its use (56/56), and understanding its potential COVID-19 cross-contamination minimisation (60/60). All eight patients who completed the questionnaire thought the isolation hood helped prevent COVID-19 cross infection and was safe and comfortable. There were no reported patient safety adverse events. The COVID-19 attack rate from 20/6/2020 to 27/9/2020 among registered nurses was as follows: intensive care units (ICUs), 2.2% (3/138); geriatric wards, 13.2% (26/197); and COVID-19 wards, 18.3% (32/175). The COVID-19 attack rate among medical staff was as follows: junior staff, 2.1% (24/932); senior staff, 0.7% (4/607); aged care/rehabilitation, 6.7% (2/30); and all ICU medical staff, 8.6% (3/35). CONCLUSIONS: The isolation hood was preferred to standard care by HCWs and well tolerated by patients, and after the study, isolation hoods became part of standard ICU therapy. There was an association between being an ICU nurse and a low COVID-19 infection rate (no causality implied). ICU HCWs feel safer when treating patients with COVID-19 using an isolation hood.","McGain, Forbes; Bates, Samantha; Lee, Jung Hoon; Timms, Patrick; Kainer, Marion A; French, Craig; Monty, Jason",Aust. crit. care,,106

Hospital admissions of IBD patients should be limited to reduce the risks of coronavirus transmission. However, delaying hospitalisation of IBD patients with severe or complicated disease may increase the risk of poor outcomes. Delaying surgery in some cases may increase the risk of disease progression, postoperative morbidity, and disease complications. IBD patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher risk of poor outcomes than the general population, potentially related to concomitant medications, especially corticosteroids. There is no evidence today that IBD patients with COVID-19 have worse outcomes if they receive immunosuppressant medications including thiopurines, biologics, and novel small molecules.

Rooted in a European tradition of social theory, this article aims to articulate the broader social context of this scenario and pinpoint its implications for management and organization theory. One of these implications is that our fields face a significant risk of co-performing rather than studying the looming “great transformation” from an economy-to a health-dominated society, thus merely replacing one reductionism with another. It follows that what is required are management and organization theories that analyze rather than ride the macro social trends that shape organizations and their environments.

495745,EpiCovDA: a mechanistic COVID-19 forecasting model with data assimilation,2021,"Background: In March 2020, it was necessary to impose so-called curfews for several weeks across Germany due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant massive restraints for the population. Objectives: It was to be investigated whether the theory of reasoned action (TORA) is an adequate method for explaining the intention to follow the curfews and to explain whether anticipation of sanctions influences the intention. There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? Methods: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individual’s intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1–7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. Results: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p &lt; 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (∆R 2 = 0.002). Discussion: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews. Key political decision-makers should avoid threatening sanctions during speeches to increase compliance but instead emphasize the meaning and benefit of the measures for society and also for the individual’s own social environment in order to positively influence the intended goals.","Schillings, Johannes; Mohr, Mara; Mohren, Jessica",Pravent.

498360,How the JCVI sets who gets a covid-19 vaccine and when,2021,"The emergency caused by COVID-19 and the transition to distance learning has made teachers face novel decision-making situations. As the teachers' pedagogical decisions have an impact on the students' learning experience, the aim of this study was to describe and explain what influenced the teachers' teaching-related decisions and how these decisions were reflected in the teaching process during distance learning. The study was based on semi-structured interviews with 16 Estonian basic school science teachers. The data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis. The results show that teachers' teaching-related decisions were influenced by factors that were related to the existence of digital tools as well as to the ability to use them purposefully in the home settings of teachers and students. Teachers' teaching decisions were mostly motivated by short-term goals, such as maintaining students' social interaction and supporting student motivation. The desire of teachers to keep students' and teachers' own workload affordable was also considered as a factor influencing teachers' teaching-related decisions. According to the interviews, the switch of focus to workload and well-being and valuing socialization and student motivation over subject matter competences seems to be unique for this new situation.","Lepp, Liina Aaviku Triinu Leijen Äli Pedaste Margus Saks Katrin",Education Sciences,,106

Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in elite futsal players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-Recent world events (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) led to an unparalleled situation in sports. Players were forced to stay at home for a prolonged period and not allowed to use their team's training facilities or even exercise outdoors. The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in futsal players. Ten elite male players performed a 10-m sprint, horizontal and vertical jump, and body composition measurements before and after the quarantine (i.e., 70 days). Pre-post confinement differences in horizontal jump distance, countermovement jump variables, sprinting time, and body composition were analyzed by a paired sample t-test and effect sizes (ESs). A large and significant decline was observed in sprint ability (p = 0.004; ES = 1.31). Small and nonsignificant differences were found in horizontal jump performance (p = 0.243; ES = -0.39). Nonsignificant differences were observed in countermovement jump (CMJ) height (p = 0.076; ES = -0.63) but moderate-to-large significant declines were found in CMJ eccentric deceleration impulse, rate of force development, peak power, velocity, and landing peak force (p &#8804; 0.05; ES = -0.52 - 1.23). Finally, trivial and nonsignificant differences were obtained on body composition parameters. In summary, sprint performance and specific CMJ kinetic variables were significantly affected by long-term reduced training, whereas vertical jump height and horizontal jump distance and body composition were not. Practitioners are advised to implement efficient sprint-oriented and eccentric-oriented training strategies to optimize return to competition after prolonged detraining periods.","Spyrou, Konstantinos; Alcaraz, Pedro E; Marín-Cascales, Elena; Herrero-Carrasco, Rubén; Cohen, Daniel D; Calleja-Gonzalez, Julio; Pereira, Lucas A; Loturco, Irineu; Freitas, Tomás T",J. strength cond. res,,106

500974,COVID-19: a “black swan” and what animal breeding can learn from it,2021,"The gateway for invasion by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into human host cells is via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transmembrane receptor expressed in multiple immune and nonimmune cell types. SARS-CoV-2, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; CoV-19) has the unusual capacity to attack many different types of human host cells simultaneously via novel clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytic pathways, becoming injurious to diverse cells, tissues and organ systems and exploiting any immune weakness in the host. The elicitation of this multipronged attack explains in part the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in CoV-19 patients. To further our understanding of the mechanism and pathways of SARS-CoV-2 infection and susceptibility of specific cell- and tissue-types and organ systems to SARS-CoV-2 attack in this communication we analyzed ACE2 expression in 85 human tissues including 21 different brain regions, 7 fetal tissues and 8 controls. Besides strong ACE2 expression in respiratory, digestive, renal-excretory and reproductive cells, high ACE2 expression was also found in the amygdala, cerebral cortex and brainstem. The highest ACE2 expression level was found in the pons and medulla oblongata in the human brainstem, containing the medullary respiratory centers of the brain, and may in part explain the susceptibility of many CoV-19 patients to severe respiratory distress.","Lukiw, Walter J; Pogue, Aileen; Hill, James M",Cell. mol. neurobiol,,106

In this paper, we have focused on reviewing the results of epidemiological modelling especially the fractional epidemic model and summarized different types of fractional epidemic models including fractional Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR),Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR), Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Asymptomatic-Recovered (SEIAR) models and so on. Furthermore, we propose a general fractional SEIAR model in the case of single-term and multi-term fractional differential equations. A feasible and reliable parameter estimation method based on modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimisation is also presented to fit the real data using fractional SEIAR model. The effective methods to solve the fractional epidemic models we introduced construct a simple and effective analytical technique that can be easily extended and applied to other fractional models, and can help guide the concerned bodies in preventing or controlling, even predicting the infectious disease outbreaks.","Chen, Yuli; Liu, Fawang; Yu, Qiang; Li, Tianzeng",Applied mathematical modelling,,106

Despite of this, no vaccine or approved drug is available to eradicate the virus. In this manuscript, we present an alternative study area that may contribute to development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. We analyzed sixty SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify regions that could work as virus-encoded miRNA seed sponges and potentially bind to human miRNA seed sites and prevent interaction with their native targets thereby relieving native miRNA suppression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionally conserved single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by disrupting translation. MiRNAs are key players in variety of biological processes that regulate differentiation, development and activation of immune cells in both innate and adaptive immunity. We find 34 miRNAs for positive-sense viral RNA and 45 miRNAs for negative-sense that can strongly bind to certain key SARS-CoV-2 genes. The disruption and dysfunction of miRNAs may perturb the immune response and stimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines altering the cellular response to viral infection. Previous studies demonstrate that miRNAs have the potential to be used as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Therefore, its discovery and validation are essential for improving the diagnosis of infection and clinical monitoring in COVID-19.","Guterres, Alexandro; de Azeredo Lima, Carlos Henrique; Miranda, Renan Lyra; Gadelha, Mônica Roberto",Infect Genet Evol,,106

This study aims to analyse and to predict the total ED resource consumption out of the patient and consultation characteristics in order to execute performance analysis and evaluate quality improvements. METHODS: Characteristics of ED visits of a large Swiss university hospital were summarized according to acute patient condition factors (e.g. chief complaint, resuscitation bay use, vital parameter deviations), chronic patient conditions (e.g. age, comorbidities, drug intake), and contextual factors (e.g. night-time admission). Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted with the total ED resource consumption as the dependent variable. RESULTS: In total, 164,729 visits were included in the analysis. Physician resources accounted for the largest proportion (54.8%), followed by radiology (19.2%), and laboratory work-up (16.2%). In the multivariable final model, chief complaint had the highest impact on the total ED resource consumption, followed by resuscitation bay use and admission by ambulance. The impact of age group was small. The multivariable final model was validated (R2 of 0.54) and a scoring system was derived out of the predictors. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the variation in total ED resource consumption can be predicted by our suggested model in the internal validation, but further studies are needed for external validation. The score developed can be used to calculate benchmarks of an ED and provides leaders in emergency care with a tool that allows them to evaluate resource decisions and to estimate effects of organizational changes.","Müller, Martin; Schechter, Clyde B; Hautz, Wolf E; Sauter, Thomas C; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis K; Stock, Stephanie; Birrenbach, Tanja",PLoS One,,106

SOURCE OF DATA: An extensive search of literature was performed in order to identify pediatric cases with extrapulmonary manifestations between January 1, 2020 and June 21, 2020. Generic keywords, such as ""Novel coronavirus"" or ""Novel coronavirus 2019"" or ""2019 nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" were searched on PubMed database, associated either with age filters or generic pediatric terms. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: A total of 28 articles, including 199 patients, were considered suitable to review and data extraction. The main findings were summarized in tables. The main non-pulmonary manifestations in pediatric patients, in decreasing order of frequency, were gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological and lymphatic, cutaneous, hepatic, ocular, olfactory, and gustatory. Multisystem impairment and Kawasaki-like disease were also described. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in immune response of children and variations of tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, the virus receptor, are likely to influence clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological patterns of the disease.","Pousa, Pedro A; Mendonça, Tamires S C; Oliveira, Eduardo A; Simões-E-Silva, Ana Cristina",,,106
503717,Life of PI (Associate),2020,"The ongoing global pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first described in Wuhan, China. A subset of COVID-19 patients has been reported to have acquired secondary infections by microbial pathogens, such as opportunistic fungal pathogens from the genus Aspergillus. To gain insight into COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), we analyzed the genomes and characterized the phenotypic profiles of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from patients treated in the area of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. By examining the mutational spectrum of single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion-deletion polymorphisms, and copy number variants among 206 genes known to modulate A. fumigatus virulence, we found that CAPA isolate genomes do not exhibit significant differences from the genome of the Af293 reference strain. By examining a number of factors, including virulence in an invertebrate moth model, growth in the presence of osmotic, cell wall, and oxidative stressors, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and the MIC of antifungal drugs, we found that CAPA isolates were generally, but not always, similar to A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17. Notably, CAPA isolate D had more putative loss-of-function mutations in genes known to increase virulence when deleted. Moreover, CAPA isolate D was significantly more virulent than the other three CAPA isolates and the A. fumigatus reference strains Af293 and CEA17, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains of A. fumigatus. These findings expand our understanding of the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of isolates that cause CAPA. IMPORTANCE The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has already killed millions of people. COVID-19 patient outcome can be further complicated by secondary infections, such as COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). CAPA is caused by Aspergillus fungal pathogens, but there is little information about the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of CAPA isolates. We conducted genome sequencing and extensive phenotyping of four CAPA isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from Germany. We found that CAPA isolates were often, but not always, similar to other reference strains of A. fumigatus across 206 genetic determinants of infection-relevant phenotypes, including virulence. For example, CAPA isolate D was more virulent than other CAPA isolates and reference strains in an invertebrate model of fungal disease, but similarly virulent to two other clinical strains. These results expand our understanding of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.","Steenwyk, Jacob L; Mead, Matthew E; de Castro, Patrícia Alves; Valero, Clara; Damasio, André; Dos Santos, Renato A C; Labella, Abigail L; Li, Yuanning; Knowles, Sonja L; Raja, Huzefa A; Oberlies, Nicholas H; Zhou, Xiaofan; Cornely, Oliver A; Fuchs, Frieder; Koehler, Philipp; Goldman, Gustavo H; Rokas, Antonis",Microbiol Spectr,,106

505430,Is this the COVID decade?,2021,"BACKGROUND: We verify the prevalence of low zinc levels among critically ill patients infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the intensive care unit (ICU) who required invasive mechanical ventilation, as well as its association with severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 ) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was &#8804;100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 µg/dL. RESULTS: A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly. The median BMI was 30.1 (24.7-32.1) kg/m2 , with 59.9% (161 of 269) of patients having overweight and obesity. The prevalence of low zinc levels was 79.6% (214 of 269) and severe ARDS was 56.5% (152 of 269). There was an association of low zinc levels and severe ARDS (odds ratio [OR], 14.4; 95% CI, 6.2-33.5; P < .001), even after adjusting for baseline variables (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 6.5-36.3; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with severe ARDS have a high prevalence of low serum zinc levels.","Gonçalves, Thiago Jose Martins; Gonçalves, Sandra Elisa Adami Batista; Guarnieri, Andreia; Risegato, Rodrigo Cristovão; Guimarães, Maysa Penteado; de Freitas, Daniella Cabral; Razuk-Filho, Alvaro; Junior, Pedro Batista Benedito; Parrillo, Eduardo Fagundes",Nutr Clin Pract,,106

506930,High-Resolution Agent-Based Modeling of COVID-19 Spreading in a Small Town,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has emerged as a threat to human health. Liver dysfunction has been reported to occur frequently in patients with COVID-19, although its significance has not yet been elucidated. METHODS: The subjects were 35 patients with COVID-19, and clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator were classified as having severe COVID-19. RESULTS: All 35 patients were diagnosed as having mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at admission, but the severity aggravated to severe in 8 patients (22.9%) in hospital. Hepatocellular-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum AST and/or ALT levels to &#8805; 3 times the ULN, was seen in 2 patients (5.7%), and cholestasis-type liver injury, defined as elevation of the serum ALP, Î³-GTP and/or total bilirubin levels to &#8805; twice the ULN, was seen in 4 patients (11.4%). A total of 9 patients (25.7%) fulfilled the criteria for liver injury. The percentage of patients with liver injury was higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in the remaining patients (P = 0.001). Both the hepatic CT attenuation values and the liver-to-spleen attenuation (L/S) ratios at admission were lower in the former patients than in the latter patients (P < 0.001). ROC curve revealed the optimal cut-off value of the L/S ratio of 1.03 for discriminating between patients with severe and non-severe diseases. The hepatic CT attenuation values increased at the remission phase of the disease as compared to the values at admission (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Liver dysfunction associated with reduced hepatic CT attenuation values correlated with the disease severity in patients with COVID-19.","Uchida, Yoshihito; Uemura, Hayato; Yamaba, Shinpei; Hamada, Daisuke; Tarumoto, Norihito; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Mochida, Satoshi",J Gastroenterol,,106
507238,"When residents work less, they feel better: Lessons learned from an unprecedent context of lockdown",2020,"BACKGROUND An integrated nonprofit health care system with 13 North Carolina medical centers conducted a time-pressured quality improvement simulation of its plan to implement the ""North Carolina Protocol for Allocating Scarce Inpatient Critical Care Resources in a Pandemic"" attendant to pandemic scenario planning. Simulation objectives included assessing the plan in terms of a) efficiency and effectiveness; b) comorbidity scoring validity; c) impact by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and payer status; and d) simulation participant impressions of potential impact on clinicians.METHOD The simulation scenario involved scoring 14 patients with the constraint that only 10 could be afforded critical care resources. Also included were independent scoring validation by four clinicians, structured debriefs with simulation participants and observers, and tracking patient outcomes for 30 days.RESULTS Triage scoring was identical among four triage teams. Lack of concordance in clinician comorbidity scoring did not alter patient prioritization for withdrawal of treatment in this small cohort. Protocol scoring was not correlated with resource utilization or near-term mortality.LIMITATIONS The simulation sample was small and selected when COVID-19 census was temporarily waning. No protocol for pediatric patients was tested.CONCLUSIONS The simulation yielded resource allocation concordance using comorbidity scoring by attending physicians, which significantly accelerated triage team decision-making and did not result in notable disparities by race/ethnicity, gender, or advanced age. Qualitative findings surfaced tensions in balancing de-identified data with individualized assessment and in trusting the clinical judgments of other physicians. Additional research is needed to validate the protocol's predictive value related to patient outcomes.","Love, Deborah J; Nycum, Lawrence R; Blackmon, Tanya Stewart; Patefield, A J; Bird, Paula; Stoker, Shelli E; Piersol, R Andrew; Koontz, Adam N; Collard, Amy L",N C Med J,,106
507971,Dual-mode gradient HPLC and TLC densitometry methods for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol and methionine in the presence of paracetamol impurities,2021,"Objectives: To assess the economic burden of COVID-19 that would arise absent behavioral or policy responses under the herd immunity approach in the United States and compare it to total burden that also accounts for estimates of the value of lives lost. Methods: We use the trajectories of age-specific human and physical capital in the production process to calculate output changes based on a human capital-augmented production function. We also calculate the total burden that results when including the value of lives lost as calculated from mortality rates of COVID-19 and estimates for the value of a statistical life in the United States based on studies assessing individual's willingness to avoid risks. Results: Our results indicate that the GDP loss associated with unmitigated COVID-19 would amount to a cumulative US$1.4 trillion by 2030 assuming that 60 percent of the population is infected over three years. This is equivalent to around 7.7 percent of GDP in 2019 (in constant 2010 US$) or an average tax on yearly output of 0.6 percent. After applying the value of a statistical life to account for the value of lives lost, our analyses show that the total burden can mount to between US$17 to 94 trillion over the next decade, which is equivalent to an annual tax burden between 8 and 43 percent. Conclusion: Our results show that the Unite States would incur a sizeable burden if it adopted a non-interventionist herd immunity approach.

509352,COVID-19 outbreaks follow narrow paths: A computational phase portrait approach based on nonlinear physics and synergetics,2021,"BACKGROUND: Brescia Province, northern Italy, was one of the worst epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. The division of infectious diseases of ASST (Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale) Spedali Civili Hospital of Brescia had to face a great number of inpatients with severe COVID-19 infection and to ensure the continuum of care for almost 4000 outpatients with HIV infection actively followed by us. In a recent manuscript we described the impact of the pandemic on continuum of care in our HIV cohort expressed as number of missed visits, number of new HIV diagnosis, drop in ART (antiretroviral therapy) dispensation and number of hospitalized HIV patients due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this short communication, we completed the previous article with data of HIV plasmatic viremia of the same cohort before and during pandemic. METHODS: We considered all HIV-patients in stable ART for at least 6 months and with at least 1 available HIV viremia in the time window March 01-November 30, 2019, and another group of HIV patients with the same two requisites but in different time windows of the COVID-19 period (March 01-May 31, 2020, and June 01-November 30, 2020). For patients with positive viremia (PV) during COVID-19 period, we reported also the values of viral load (VL) just before and after PV. RESULTS: the percentage of patients with PV during COVID-19 period was lower than the previous year (2.8% vs 7%). Only 1% of our outpatients surely suffered from pandemic in term of loss of previous viral suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Our efforts to limit the impact of pandemic on our HIV outpatients were effective to ensure HIV continuum of care.","Izzo, Ilaria; Carriero, Canio; Gardini, Giulia; Fumarola, Benedetta; Chiari, Erika; Castelli, Francesco; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia",AIDS Res Ther,,106

Only remdesivir has received authorization for COVID-19 and has been shown to improve outcomes but not decrease mortality. However, the dose of remdesivir is limited by hepatic and kidney toxicity. ACE2 is the critical cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated additive effect of combination therapy using remdesivir with recombinant soluble ACE2 (high/low dose) on Vero E6 and kidney organoids, targeting two different modalities of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle: cell entry via its receptor ACE2 and intracellular viral RNA replication. This combination treatment markedly improved their therapeutic windows against SARS-CoV-2 in both models. By using single amino-acid resolution screening in haploid ES cells, we report a singular critical pathway required for remdesivir toxicity, namely Adenylate Kinase 2. The data provided here demonstrate that combining two therapeutic modalities with different targets, common strategy in HIV treatment, exhibit strong additive effects at sub-toxic concentrations.

This study aims to highlight the long-term radiological findings observed on CXR after recovery, in patients with COVID-19. This will help identify patients suffering from long-term consequences of COVID-19 and help them provide adequate care. Methods: This study was conducted in the COVID-19 unit of a tertiary care hospital, Pakistan from August 2020 to February 2021. CXR of patients who were being discharged after negative PCR was done. Participants with positive X-ray findings, which included consolidation, reticular thickening, ground-glass opacities (GGO), pulmonary nodules, and pleural effusions, were enrolled in the study after getting informed consent. All findings were recorded in a self-structured questionnaire. Participants were scheduled to come for follow-up on day 30 after their initial CXR, where their CXR was repeated. Result: Our results showed that n=429 (60.2%) participants had positive CXR at the time of discharge. After 30 days, n=371 participants returned for a follow-up X-ray. Out of the 371 participants, after 30 days, 123 participants still had positive CXR. Fatigue (41.4%) was the common symptom after 30 days. The most common finding was consolidation (82.1%), followed by reticular thickening (23.5%) on day 30. Conclusion: In this study, although most of the patients completely recovered serologically from COVID-19, they still had radiological findings in their chest X-rays. Radiological findings are especially important in predicting the clinical course of the disease and may be used to monitor long-term complications.","Gupta, A.; Garg, I.; Iqbal, A.; Talpur, A.

512978,Environmental perspective of COVID-19: Atmospheric and wastewater environment in relation to pandemic,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a universally prevalent infectious disease. The causative virus of COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2. Recent retrospective clinical studies have established a significant association between the incidence of vascular thrombotic events and the severity of COVID-19. The enhancement in serum levels of markers that reflect a hypercoagulable state has been suggested to indicate a poor prognosis. Therefore, at present, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that foster the hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Over-activated inflammatory response, which is manifested as excessive cytokine release in COVID-19 patients, is also associated with COVID-19 severity. This review discusses the immuno-pathological basis of the excessive cytokine release in COVID-19. Besides, this article reviews the role of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines, whose significant elevations in their serum levels have been consistently detected in multiple different clinical studies, in promoting the hypercoagulable state. Since the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is potentially down-regulated in COVID-19, as proposed by a recent bio-informatic analysis, mechanisms through which reduced ACE2 expressions promote vascular thrombosis are summarized. In addition, the reciprocal-enhancing effects of the excessive cytokine release and the downregulated ACE2 expression on their pro-thrombotic activities are further discussed. Here, based on currently available evidence, we review the pathogenic mechanisms of the hypercoagulable state associated with severe cases of COVID-19 to give insights into prevention and treatment of the vascular thrombotic events in COVID-19.","Du, Fenghe; Liu, Bao; Zhang, Shuyang",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,106

Liver injury of COVID-19 patients based on severity grading and abdominal radiological signs have not been reported until now. The aim of our study is to determine clinical profiles of the patients based on severity grading, describe abdominal radiological signs, and investigate the correlations of the severity with clinical profiles and radiological signs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 115 patients with COVID-19 from Jan 2020 to Feb 2020. Medical records of the patients were collected and CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: Common clinical manifestations of patients with COVID-19 were fever (68.70%), cough (56.52%), fatigue (31.30%); some of them had gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, 12.17%; nausea or vomiting 7.83%; inappetence, 7.83%). Abnormal liver function was observed in some of patients with COVID-19. Significant differences in the levels of AST, albumin,CRP were observed among different groups classified by the severity. Common findings of upper abdominal CT scan were liver hypodensity (26.09%) and pericholecystic fat stranding (21.27%); liver hypodensity was more frequently found in critical cases (58.82%). The severity of COVID-19 correlated with semi-quantitative CT score of pulmonary lesions, CT-quantified liver/spleen attenuation ratio in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the patients with COVID-19 displayed liver damage revealed by liver functional tests and upper abdominal CT imaging, and the severity of COVID-19 patients correlated with some of liver functional tests and CT signs; thus, it will allow an earlier identification of high-risk patients for early effective intervention.","Lei, Ping; Zhang, Lan; Han, Ping; Zheng, Chuansheng; Tong, Qiaoxia; Shang, Haitao; Yang, Fan; Hu, Yu; Li, Xin; Song, Yuhu",,,106
513392,Shaping the future of healthcare: building back better,2021,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) are more transmissible and have the potential for increased disease severity and decreased vaccine effectiveness. We sought to estimate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccines against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes (COVID-19 hospitalization or death) caused by the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) VOCs during December 2020 to May 2021. MethodsWe conducted a test-negative design study using linked population-wide vaccination, laboratory testing, and health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. FindingsAgainst symptomatic infection caused by Alpha, vaccine effectiveness with partial vaccination ([≥]14 days after dose 1) was higher for mRNA-1273 (83%) than BNT162b2 (66%) and ChAdOx1 (64%), and full vaccination ([≥]7 days after dose 2) increased vaccine effectiveness for BNT162b2 (89%) and mRNA-1273 (92%). Protection against symptomatic infection caused by Beta/Gamma was also higher with partial vaccination for mRNA-1273 (77%) than BNT162b2 (60%) and ChAdOx1 (48%), and full vaccination increased effectiveness for BNT162b2 (84%). Against Delta, vaccine effectiveness after partial vaccination tended to be lower compared to Alpha for mRNA-1273 (72% vs. 83%) and BNT162b2 (56% vs. 66%), but was similar to Alpha for ChAdOx1 (67% vs. 64%). Full vaccination with BNT162b2 increased protection against Delta (87%) to levels comparable to Alpha (89%) and Beta/Gamma (84%).

They excluded a side effect of the low molecular weight heparin therapy that all patients underwent during the course of the disease or other possible causes. Alterations of the coagulation state or a weakness of the vascular wall due toa presumed endotheliitis SARS-CoV-2 infection induced, are hypothesized by the authors. Investigation and follow-up for possible hemorrhagic problems in patients with COVID-19 is recommended. In particular, clinicians should be vigilant about retroperitoneal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the fact that these patients are being treated with anticoagulants, anemia and abdominal pain are the signs that should lead us to suspect this type of haemorrhage. More studies are needed to understand if COVID-19 can be directly associated with bleeding.

METHODS: We used the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV infected Veterans (ERCHIVES) database to determine the impact of HCV infection upon the rates of acute care hospitalization, ICU admission and all-cause mortality. We identified Veterans with chronic HCV infection and propensity score matched controls without HCV in ERCHIVES. We excluded those with HIV or hepatitis B virus coinfection. RESULTS: We identified 975 HCV+ and 975 propensity score matched HCV- persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean FIB-4 score (±SD) was higher in those with HCV (1.9 ± 2.1 vs 1.2 ± 0.9; P < .0001) and a larger proportion of those with HCV had cirrhosis (8.1% vs 1.4%; P < .0001). A larger proportion of HCV+ were hospitalized compared to HCV- (24.0% vs 18.3%; P = .002); however, those requiring ICU care and mortality were also similar in both groups (6.6% vs 6.5%; P = .9). Among those with FIB-4 score of 1.45-3.25, hospitalization rate/1000-person-years was 41.4 among HCV+ and 20.2 among HCV-, while among those with a FIB-4 > 3.25, the rate- was 9.4 and 0.6 (P < .0001). There was no difference in all-cause mortality by age, gender, FIB-4 score, number of comorbidities or treatment with remdesivir and/or systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: HCV+ persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to be admitted to a hospital. The hospitalization rate also increased with higher FIB-4 score. However, admission to an ICU and mortality are not different between those with and without HCV infection.","Butt, Adeel A; Yan, Peng; Chotani, Rashid A; Shaikh, Obaid S",Liver int,,106

517112,"Ecclesial Belonging in a World of Pure Experience: William James, W. E. B. du Bois, and Religious Rationality in Crisis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HPT) and its complications continue to pose a global threat and contribute to premature mortality worldwide. The adverse interactions between HPT, obesity and COVID-19 are currently being witnessed globally and represent a collision of pandemics. Understanding the burden that this non-communicable disease (NCD) poses in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa (SA), would help in developing improved public healthcare strategies. OBJECTIVES: To describe the burden of HPT in all the districts of KZN over a 6-year period. METHODS: HPT data are routinely collected from all KZN public health facilities (both clinics and hospitals) as part of the District Health Information System (DHIS). In this retrospective study, we accessed HPT records from the DHIS over a period of 6 years (2014 - 2019, inclusive). Data collected included the number of patients screened, diagnosed and initiated on therapy for HPT, together with the number of obese patients. RESULTS: The slopes for HPT screening were positive at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (considerably more at clinics than hospitals, with a difference in elevations of slopes of p&lt;0.001), with a significantly greater percentage of the population having been screened at rural clinics than at hospitals (difference in elevation of slopes p&lt;0.001). A significantly greater number of patients aged &lt;40 years (p&lt;0.001) were being screened for HPT at clinics than at hospitals (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20), while hospitals screened considerably more patients aged &#8805;40 years in 2017 - 2018 (p&lt;0.001). The numbers of new hypertensives diagnosed and having treatment initiated were on an upward slope at both clinics and hospitals, with clinics having a greater elevation of slope than hospitals (p&lt;0.001), irrespective of patient age. A significantly greater number of patients aged &#8805;40 years (p&lt;0.05) were diagnosed with HPT at both clinics and hospitals in KZN (2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20). KZN clinics remained the first port of call for known hypertensives throughout the study period. Obesity was prevalent at both clinic and hospital level, although figures were significantly higher at clinics. Over 80% of the obesity burden was carried by the rural clinics and hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and chronic management of HPT occur mainly at rural clinic level. The SA government needs to heed these findings and redirect resources (staffing and equipment) to this level. The prevalence of obesity was highest at rural healthcare facilities (clinics more than hospitals). More needs to be done to combat the obesity pandemic if we are to win the battle against NCDs (HPT and diabetes mellitus). A significant number of patients aged &lt;40 years are being screened for HPT, which bodes well for the province, as early diagnosis and treatment of HPT are vital to prevent complications.","Pillay, S; Pillay, D; Pillay, R S",S Afr Med J,,106

Systems Physiology at Rutgers University is a junior/senior level course for exercise science majors and a recommended elective for students considering the health professions. In the fall 2020 semester, I wanted to do something beyond teaching physiology. I reached out to my network of friends and colleagues in the professional world of healthcare, science, and education. Between March 2020 and August 2020, I conducted twelve interviews with individuals in different avenues of the science and healthcare world ? one medical student, two physician assistants, one physical therapist, one athletic trainer, two physicians, one dentist, one medical researcher, one pharmacist, one high school chemistry teacher, and one coach. Students were required to watch at least two of the interviews. The assignment worth ten percent of their grade was to write a one-page reflection on the impact of these two interviews along with a self-reflection of where they are in discerning their own career path. Student feedback on the assignment was overwhelmingly positive, with one student commenting that ?this was an assignment I did not even realize I needed.? An unintended outcome of this assignment was that I was able to learn so much more about the backgrounds, motivations, challenges, and aspirations of the students in my course. I intend to assign and improve on this reflection writing in the future and encourage others, in this distracted, fast-paced world, to challenge their students to pause and reflect.","Nelson, Cassandra",The FASEB Journal,,106

520033,COVID-19 bei Kindern mit allergischen Erkrankungen,2020,"Along with emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, a myriad of neurologic symptoms, associated with structural brain changes, were reported. In this paper, we provide evidence to critically discuss the claim that the survived patients could possibly be at increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms. This virus can directly invade the brain through olfactory bulb, retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerve endings, or via hematogenous or lymphatic routes. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in pro-inflammatory cytokine increment, rendering the brain to neurodegenerative changes. Also, occupation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) with the virus may lead to a decline in ACE-2 activity, which acts as a neuroprotective factor. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septicemia induce hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, which are locally exacerbated due to the hypercoagulable state and micro-thrombosis in brain vessels, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Common risk factors for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, such as metabolic risk factors, genetic predispositions, and even gut microbiota dysbiosis, can contribute to higher occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 survivors. However, it should be considered that severity of the infection, the extent of neurologic symptoms, and the persistence of viral infection consequences are major determinants of this association. Importantly, whether this pandemic will increase the overall incidence of neurodegeneration is not clear, as a high percentage of patients with severe form of COVID-19 might probably not survive enough to develop neurodegenerative diseases.","Dolatshahi, Mahsa; Sabahi, Mohammadmahdi; Aarabi, Mohammad Hadi",Mol.

The current study is part of a larger mixed methods project utilizing a repeated cross-sectional design. An online survey was administered to a sample of 1448 mental health providers and included demographic and professional information, experiences with and perceptions of TMH prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as a brief measure of pandemic-related stress. The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in an increased use of TMH in the study sample. During COVID-19, providers reported increased agreement with TMH being necessary, important, and effective for care delivery. Providers who primarily used video, compared with telephone, reported that TMH was more useful, satisfying, and effective. While negative attitude towards TMH was predicted only by prior attitudes and belief in TMH effectiveness, positive attitude towards TMH was also predicted by female sex and current level of pandemic related stress. TMH use during the pandemic was predicted by primary use of video platform and previous TMH use. The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in increased use of TMH and significantly increased positive perceptions about TMH among mental health providers.","Doran, Jennifer M; Lawson, Jessica L",Psychiatr. q,,106

HCT is a curative option for a wide range of hematologic malignancies, and advances in transplantation medicine have resulted in an increase in HCT survivors. It is anticipated that the number of HCT survivors will more than double from 242,000 in 2020 to ~500,000 in 2030. Survivors of HCT are at an increased risk of developing late complications due to exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation in the pre-, peri-, and post-HCT phases and these cumulative exposures have the potential to damage normal tissue. This tissue damage leads to the early onset of chronic health conditions resulting in premature mortality in HCT survivors, who have a 15-year cumulative incidence of severe or life-threatening chronic health conditions exceeding 40%. Due to the significant burden of morbidity in HCT survivors and the delay in the development of long-term complications, this delicate patient population requires life-long monitoring due to the risk for neuropsychological, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, ocular, skeletal, cardiac, endocrine, fertility, and sexual health complications, as well as secondary neoplasms. This review will focus on recent advances in screening, monitoring, and therapeutics for late-occurring or long-term complications in HCT survivors.","Saunders, Ila M; Tan, Marisela; Koura, Divya; Young, Rebecca",Pharmacotherapy,,106

METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. From March 9 to April 10, 2020, all patients referred to our institution for a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms underwent a chest CT for triage. Patients with a/parenchymal lesion characteristics of COVID-19 involving at least 50% of lung parenchyma and b/positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively included. Adrenal glands were reviewed by two independent readers to look for AAI. Additional demographics and potential biological markers of adrenal insufficiency were obtained. Correlations with ICU stay and mortality were sought. RESULTS: Out of the 219 patients with critical (n = 52) and severe lung (n = 167) parenchyma lesions, 51 (23%) had CT scan signs of AAI, which was bilateral in 45 patients (88%). Four patients had an acute biological adrenal gland insufficiency (8%). Univariate analysis in AAI+ patients demonstrated a higher rate of ICU stay (67% vs. 45%, p < 0.05) and a longer stay (more than 15 days for 31% for AAI+ vs. 19%, p < 0.05) compared with AAI- patients.

There are several potential challenges or problems with this strategy, including the limited availability of such tests, consequences of incorrect test results, difficulties with adherence to testing, and the questionable accuracy of such tests for detection of infectious people. Because of these, we think it is premature to strongly advocate for such a testing strategy, as the adverse consequences may outweigh any benefits.

A mechanism was projected for the evolution of SARS virus and a handy association with bats was found. When this virus reaches respective host system, infection starts with spike protein binding to its complementary receptor of the host cell. The coronavirus spike protein&#039;s association with its host cell receptor complement is crucial in deciding the virus infectivity, tissue tropism and species variety.

Everyone has access to basic health care services. The continuous improvement in people's health is an important indicator of the improvement in people's quality of life. This paper selects data from the European Union (EU) on aspects of public health expenditure, medical care resources, and government emergency coordination capacity from the period 2008 to 2017. Principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to measure their public health service capacity scores and conduct a comparative analysis. On this basis, the TOBIT model is adopted to explore the driving factors that lead to the spatial differentiation of public health service capabilities, and to combine it with the data of the COVID-19 epidemic as of 8 August 2020 from the official announcements of the World Health Organization and governments for further thinking. The results indicate that the public health service capacity of countries in the EU is showing a gradual increase. The capacity in Western Europe is, in turn, higher than that of Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. In addition, the overall capacity in Western Europe is relatively high, but it is not balanced and stable, while Northern Europe has remained stable and balanced at a high level. Population density, degree of opening up, education level, economic development level, technological innovation level, and degree of aging have a positive effect on public health service capabilities. The level of urbanization has a negative effect on it. However, in countries with strong public health service capabilities, the epidemic of COVID-19 is more severe. The emergence of this paradox may be related to the detection capabilities of countries, the high probability of spreading thCOVID-19 epidemic, the inefficient implementation of government policy, the integrated system of the EU and the adverse selection of youth. This paper aims to improve the ability of the EU to respond to public health emergencies, improve the utilization of medical and health resources, and better protect people's health from the perspective of public health service capacity.","Ding, Xuhui; Cai, Zhongyao; Zhu, Wei; Fu, Zhu",,,106

Immune correlates of protection are not yet clear. To understand the association between presence and titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) with recovery, we screened 82 COVID-19 patients classified in mild (n = 56) and severe (n = 26) disease groups on different days post onset of disease and 27 viral RNA-positive asymptomatic contacts examined within 1 week of the identification of index cases. Of 26 patients with severe disease, six died and 20 recovered. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAb levels in plasma and serum were measured using a plaque reduction neutralization test with live virus. The proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections was 1:7.8 in males and 1:1 in females, with males predominating the severe disease group (21/26, 80.7%). At the time of presentation, NAb positivity and titers were comparable among groups with asymptomatic and mild infections. Notably, patients with severe disease exhibited higher NAb seropositivity and titers (25 of 26, 96.2%; 866 ± 188) than those in the mild category (39 of 56, 69.6%; 199 ± 50, P < 0.0001) and asymptomatic individuals (21 of 27, 77.8%; 124 ± 28, P = 0.0002). Within first 2 weeks of onset, NAb titers were significantly higher among patients with severe disease than those with mild presentation. Our data suggest that irrespective of fatal outcome, progression to disease severity was associated with induction of early and high levels of NAb. In our patient series, clinical disease, severity and fatality were predominantly seen in males. The role of NAbs in immunopathogenesis or protection needs to be defined.","Shrivastava, Shubham; Palkar, Sonali; Shah, Jignesh; Rane, Prajakta; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya A",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,106

Application to the Covid-19 epidemic,2021-05-27,"RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: One of the sectors challenged by the COVID‐19 pandemic is medical research. COVID‐19 originates from a novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) and the scientific community is faced with the daunting task of creating a novel model for this pandemic or, in other words, creating novel science. This paper is the first part of a series of two papers that explore the intricate relationship between the different challenges that have hindered biomedical research and the generation of scientific knowledge during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: During the early stages of the pandemic, research conducted on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was chaotic and sparked several heated debates with respect to the scientific methods used and the quality of knowledge generated. Research on HCQ is used as a case study in both papers. The authors explored biomedical databases, peer‐reviewed journals, pre‐print servers, and media articles to identify relevant literature on HCQ and COVID‐19, and examined philosophical perspectives on medical research in the context of this pandemic and previous global health challenges. RESULTS: This paper demonstrates that a lack of prioritization among research questions and therapeutics was responsible for the duplication of clinical trials and the dispersion of precious resources. Study designs, aimed at minimising biases and increasing objectivity, were, instead, the subject of fruitless oppositions. The duplication of research works, combined with poor‐quality research, has greatly contributed to slowing down the creation of novel scientific knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic presented challenges in terms of (1) finding and prioritising relevant research questions and (2) choosing study designs that are appropriate for a time of emergency.","Perillat, Lucie; Baigrie, Brian S.",J Eval Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590660/,106

A Narrative Review of Texting as a Case Management Intervention.,2021,"Children show a distinct presentation of COVID‐19, characterized by a lower incidence and mild phenotype, but the reason for this is still unknown. The angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) functions as the primary cell entry receptor for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and is thought to cause distinct clinical features between children and old people. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether differences exist in the level of expression and distribution of ACE2 between neonatal and adult rat lungs. The lung tissues from rats of various ages were used to investigate the expression patterns of ACE2. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to quantify or identify the localization of ACE2 in rat lungs. ACE2 was homogenously expressed in fewer alveolar type II (AT2) cells in the neonatal lung, with no polarization to the alveolar space and additional expression in pulmonary endothelium when compared to adult rat lungs. These findings suggest that the patterns of ACE2 distribution and cellular localization in rat lungs change with age.","Zhao, Depeng; Chen, Xueyu; Han, Dongshan; Zhong, Junyan; Zhang, Su‐E; Yang, Chuanzhong",FEBS Open Bio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137203/; https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13232,106

Several international organizations and non-government organizations have well established systems to respond to food security emergencies. However, the role of food science and technology in humanitarian response is not well understood and is seldom considered in humanitarian circles. SCOPE AND APPROACH: The role of food science and technology in humanitarian response and the importance of addressing the requirements of the local consumers within the local food systems are discussed. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Humanitarian food aid policies focus on immediate and short-term assistance to save lives. The implementation of emergency programs and projects tends to induce dependency on aid, rather than strengthening local food systems and ensuring resilience. Transformative change must embrace innovation across the whole food system with an increased emphasis on food science and technology that addresses local food security, generates employment and contributes to the local economy. There needs to be a move beyond rehabilitating and increasing agricultural production to addressing the whole food system with a view to link humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to sustainable livelihoods and resilience.","Bounie, Dominique; Arcot, Jayashree; Cole, Martin; Egal, Florence; Juliano, Pablo; Mejia, Carla; Rosa, Donna; Sellahewa, Jay",Trends Food Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836824/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224420305070; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.06.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224420305070?v=s5,106

By RNA-FISH, we found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive leukocytes, including CD11c cells, appeared as early as one day after infection and continued through day 10 post infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2-permissive leukocytes contribute to systemic viral dissemination, and RNA-FISH combined with FLSM can be utilized as a sensitive tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in blood specimens.","Geng, Tingting; Keilich, Spencer; Tafas, Triantafyllos; Wang, Penghua",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.450531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230928/,106

In particular, the early death cases occurred primarily in older people with a frailty status, possibly due to a weaker immune system fostering faster progression of the viral infection. Frailty is an age-related multidimensional clinical condition defined as a non-specific state of vulnerability, identifying older people at increased risk of falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, disability, dementia, and death. Among frailty phenotypes, social frailty has been least studied. It considers the role of socioeconomic context as a vulnerability status later in life. COVID-19 does not affect all populations equally, and social inequalities contribute to drive the spread of infections. It was known that the perception of social isolation, e.g., loneliness, affects mental and physical health, but the implicated molecular mechanisms, also related to the immune system, and its associated cognitive and health-related sequelae, are poorly understood. The increasing psychological distress derived by prolonged exposure to stress due to the lockdown scenario, and the reduced sources of support, contributed to making heavy demands on personal resources, i.e., self-efficacy and interpersonal variables. So, perceived loneliness may be a factor associated with psychological distress and an outcome in itself. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, a correct assessment of social frailty may be essential in terms of the prevention of late-life neuropsychiatric disorders.","Lozupone, Madia; La Montagna, Maddalena; Di Gioia, Ilaria; Sardone, Rodolfo; Resta, Emanuela; Daniele, Antonio; Giannelli, Gianluigi; Bellomo, Antonello; Panza, Francesco",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240129/,106

Since 2002, the successive emergence of bat-borne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 have reinforced efforts in uncovering the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms governing coronavirus cell tropism and interspecies transmission. Decades of studies have led to the discovery of a broad set of carbohydrate and protein receptors for many animal and human coronaviruses. As the main determinant of coronavirus entry, the spike protein binds to these receptors and mediates membrane fusion. Prone to mutations and recombination, spike evolution has been studied extensively. The interactions between spike proteins and their receptors are often complex and despite many advances in the field, there remains many unresolved questions concerning coronavirus tropism modification and cross-species transmission, potentially leading to delays in outbreak responses. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to address these outstanding issues in order to better anticipate new outbreaks.

The relation of the disease caused by SARS-Cov-2 to immunosuppressive treatment used in different gastrointestinal disorders is uncertain, resulting in debate with regard to suspending immunosuppressive therapy to improve infection outcome. Said suspension implies the inherent risk for graft rejection or autoimmune disease exacerbation that can potentially worsen the course of the infection.

Increasing social media use among these populations can be leveraged as an alternative method to detect characteristics of suicide-related topics and behavior among substance users. Objective: To detect and characterize suicide and self-harm related conversations co-occurring with SUD posts and comments on the popular social media platform Instagram. Methods: This study used big data and machine learning approaches to collect and classify Instagram posts containing 632 controlled substance-related hashtags. Posts were first classified for online drug diversion topics and then filtered to detect suicide and mental health discussions. Posts and comments were then manually annotated for SUD and mental health co-occurring themes. Associations between these characteristics were tested using the Chi-square test. Results: We detected 719 Instagram posts/comments that included user-generated discussions about suicide, substance use and/or mental health. Posts self-reporting SUD and mental health topics were also more likely to discuss suicide compared to those that did not discuss SUD and mental health topics, respectively (p < 0.001). Major themes observed included concurrent discussions of suicide ideation and attempts and low self-esteem. Conclusions: Our study results provide preliminary evidence of social media discussions about suicide and mental health among those with SUD. This co-occurrence represents a key health risk factor on a platform heavily utilized by young adults. Further studies are required to analyze specific patterns of suicide and self-harm ideations for the purposes of designing future suicide prevention campaigns through digital channels.","Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Mackey, Tim K.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135778/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.551296,106

597274,Making sense of publicly available data on COVID-19 in Ireland,2020-05-19,"Efforts to reduce disparities in obesity prevalence affecting Black Americans are having limited success. One reason for this may be the disproportionate, ethnically targeted marketing of foods and beverages high in fat and sugar (FBHFS) to Black consumers. Such marketing promotes high consumption of FBHFS, leading to excess caloric intake and unintentional weight gain. We convened focus groups with Black men and women (total n = 57) in collaboration with community groups in three localities to elicit their views, as consumers and parents/caregivers, about targeted FBHFS marketing and potential ways to combat it. At each location, trained community members facilitated two sets of focus groups: one for adults aged 18 to 25 years and another for adults aged 26 to 55 years who had a 3-to-17-year-old child at home. Each group met twice to discuss food and beverage marketing practices to Black communities and reviewed a booklet about ethnically targeted marketing tactics in between. A directed content analysis of participant comments identified and explored salient themes apparent from initial summarization of results. Results show how parents are concerned with and critical of pervasive FBHFS marketing. In particular, comments emphasize the involvement of Black celebrities in FBHFS marketing—how and why they engage in such marketing and whether this could be shifted towards healthier foods. These findings suggest a potential role for counter marketing efforts focused on Black celebrity endorsements of FBHFS, possibly with a youth focus. They also underscore the need for additional, qualitative exploration of Black consumer views of ethnically targeted FBHFS marketing more generally.","Eaton, Tiffany M.; Kumanyika, Shiriki; DiSantis, Katherine Isselmann; Yadeta, Kenna; Grier, Sonya",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417762/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01133-1,106

METHODS: An online survey was sent to school nurses (from state school nurse associations and/or state departments of education) between May and July 2011. Overall school pandemic preparedness scores were calculated by assigning 1 point for each item in the school's pandemic plan; the maximum score was 11. Linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher school pandemic preparedness scores. Nurse influenza vaccine uptake was assessed as well. RESULTS: A total of 1,997 nurses from 26 states completed the survey. Almost three-quarters (73.7%; n = 1,472) reported receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2010-11 season. Very few (2.2%; n = 43) reported that their school/district had a mandatory influenza vaccination policy. Pandemic preparedness scores ranged from 0 to 10 points, with an average score of 4.3. Determinants of school pandemic preparedness were as follows: planning to be a point of dispensing during a future pandemic (P < .001), having experienced multiple student or employee hospitalizations and/or deaths related to H1N1 during the pandemic (P = .01 or <.05, respectively), having a lead nurse complete the survey (P < .001), and having the school nurse study participant be a member of the school disaster planning committee (P < .001).

597405,Mathematical Analysis of COVID-19 by Using SIR Model with Convex Incidence Rate,2021-02-19,"Mouse models of human cancer provide an important research tool for elucidating the natural history of neoplastic growth and developing new treatment and prevention approaches. This is particularly true for multiple myeloma (MM), a common and largely incurable neoplasm of post-germinal center, immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes, called plasma cells, that reside in the hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) and cause osteolytic lesions and kidney failure among other forms of end-organ damage. The most widely used mouse models used to aid drug and immunotherapy development rely on in vivo propagation of human myeloma cells in immunodeficient hosts (xenografting) or myeloma-like mouse plasma cells in immunocompetent hosts (autografting). Both strategies have made and continue to make valuable contributions to preclinical myeloma, including immune research, yet are ill-suited for studies on tumor development (oncogenesis). Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), such as the widely known Vκ*MYC, may overcome this shortcoming because plasma cell tumors (PCTs) develop de novo (spontaneously) in a highly predictable fashion and accurately recapitulate many hallmarks of human myeloma. Moreover, PCTs arise in an intact organism able to mount a complete innate and adaptive immune response and tumor development reproduces the natural course of human myelomagenesis, beginning with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), progressing to smoldering myeloma (SMM), and eventually transitioning to frank neoplasia. Here we review the utility of transplantation-based and transgenic mouse models of human MM for research on immunopathology and -therapy of plasma cell malignancies, discuss strengths and weaknesses of different experimental approaches, and outline opportunities for closing knowledge gaps, improving the outcome of patients with myeloma, and working towards a cure.","Pisano, Michael; Cheng, Yan; Sun, Fumou; Dhakal, Binod; D’Souza, Anita; Chhabra, Saurabh; Knight, Jennifer M.; Rao, Sridhar; Zhan, Fenghuang; Hari, Parameswaran; Janz, Siegfried",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34149703/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.667054,106

Impact of diagnostic uncertainty in mass testing on the spread of COVID-19,2020-10-21,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with tocilizumab DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study SETTING: Stony Brook University Hospital, a 600-bed academic tertiary medical center in Suffolk County, New York PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 confirmed by nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) who were admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital between March 10 and April 2 2020 and required mechanical ventilation in any intensive care unit during their hospitalization EXPOSURE: Treatment with tocilizumab while intubated MAIN OUTCOME: Overall mortality 30 days from the date of intubation RESULTS: Forty-five patients received tocilizumab compared to seventy controls. Baseline demographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, treatment with corticosteroids, and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were similar between the two cohorts. Patients who received tocilizumab had significantly lower Charlson co-morbidity index (2.0 vs 3.0,P = 0.01) than controls. There was a trend towards younger mean age in the tocilizumab exposed group (56.2 vs 60.6; P = 0.09). In logistic regression analysis there was no reduction in mortality associated with receipt of tocilizumab (odds ratio (OR) 1.04; 95% CI, 0.27–3.75). There was no observed increased risk of secondary infection in patients given tocilizumab (28.9 vs 25.7; OR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.51–2.71). CONCLUSION: When controlling for age, severity of illness, and co-morbidities, tocilizumab was not associated with reduction in mortality in this retrospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Further studies are needed to determine the role of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19.","Fisher, Matthew J.; Marcos Raymundo, Luis A.; Monteforte, Melinda; Taub, Erin M.; Go, Roderick",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220325443; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220325443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33333252/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.12.021,106

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of completed clinical encounters in an academic ophthalmology center from March 2020, through August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5023 patients comprising 8116 ophthalmic clinical encounters. METHODS: Medical charts were abstracted for demographic information. We identified zip code-level socioeconomic characteristics, which were drawn from the 2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The completion of a synchronous video encounter, the completion of a telephone (audio-only) encounter in the absence of any video encounters, or the completion of in-person encounters only. RESULTS: During the study period, 8116 total clinical encounters were completed for 5023 unique patients. Of these patients, 446 (8.9%) participated in a video encounter, 642 (12.8%) completed a telephone encounter, and 3935 (78.3%) attended clinical appointments in person only. In adjusted analysis, patients who were Black (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.80; P < 0.001) or Hispanic/Latino (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49–0.85; P = 0.002) were significantly less likely to complete a video or telephone appointment. Older patients (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–0.99; P < 0.001), patients whose primary language was not English (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28–0.82; P = 0.01), Black patients (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32–0.62; P < 0.001), and Hispanic/Latino patients (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37–0.83; P = 0.005) were significantly less likely to complete a video encounter. Finally, among patients completing any type of telemedicine encounter, older age, (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.03; P < 0.001), Medicare insurance (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11–2.17; P = 0.01), and Black race (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.33–2.94; P < 0.001) were associated with using only phone visits. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic/racial minorities, older patients, and non–English-speaking individuals were significantly less likely to complete a video telehealth encounter. With the expansion of telemedicine and the need to reduce the disparate impact of COVID-19 on minorities, it will be increasingly important to identify barriers to telehealth use and opportunities to improve access.","Chen, Evan M.; Andoh, Joana E.; Nwanyanwu, Kristen",Ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2021.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245753/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161642021004851; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161642021004851?v=s5,106

Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.","Munster, Vincent J.; Adney, Danielle R.; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Brown, Vienna R.; Miazgowicz, Kerri L.; Milne-Price, Shauna; Bushmaker, Trenton; Rosenke, Rebecca; Scott, Dana; Hawkinson, Ann; de Wit, Emmie; Schountz, Tony; Bowen, Richard A.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899616/,106

Although huge efforts are addressed by scientists to shed light over the several questions raised by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, many aspects need to be clarified, yet. In particular, several studies have pointed out significant variations between countries in per-capita mortality. In this work, we investigated the association between COVID-19 mortality with climate variables and air pollution throughout European countries using the satellite remote sensing images provided by the Sentinel-5p mission. We analyzed data collected for two years of observations and extracted the concentrations of several pollutants; we used these measurements to feed a Random Forest regression. We performed a cross-validation analysis to assess the robustness of the model and compared several regression strategies. Our findings reveal a significant statistical association between air pollution (NO(2)) and COVID-19 mortality and a significant role played by the socio-demographic features, like the number of nurses or the hospital beds and the gross domestic product per capita.","Amoroso, Nicola; Cilli, Roberto; Maggipinto, Tommaso; Monaco, Alfonso; Tangaro, Sabina; Bellotti, Roberto",Environ Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474031/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121012652; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121012652?v=s5,106

We aimed to review and summarize all of the current knowledge on the antivirals for COVID-19. There are 2 main drug groups for SARS-CoV-2: Agents that target proteins or RNA of the virus or interfere with proteins or biological processes in the host that support the virus. The main drug groups include inhibitors of viral entry into the human cell (convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, nanobodies, mini proteins, human soluble ACE-2, camostat, dutasteride, proxalutamide, bromhexin, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir nitazoxanid, niclosamide, lactoferrin), inhibitors of viral proteases (lopinavir/ritonavir, PF-07321332, PF-07304814, GC376), inhibitors of viral RNA (remdesivir, favipiravir, molnupiravir, AT-527, merimepodib, PTC299); inhibitors of host proteins supporting virus (plitidepsin, fluvoxamine, ivermectin) and agents supporting host natural immunity (Interferons). When taking into account the results of all the available laboratory and clinical trials on the subject, monoclonal antibodies are seem to be the most effective treatment for COVID-19 at the moment and high-titer convalescent plasma also could be effective when administered during the early phase of the disease. As lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, merimepodib, and umifenovir were found to be ineffective in RCTs, they should not be used. Additional studies are needed to define the role of remdesivir, favipiravir, interferons, ivermectin, dutasteride, proxulutamide, fluvoxamine, bromhexine, nitazoxanide and niclosamid in the treatment of COVID-19.

603784,Erfreuliches in COVID-19-Zeiten: Allergo Journal im JCR gelistet!,2021-08-13,"Background: Because of the new pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the demand for telemedicine and telemonitoring solutions has been exponentially raised. Because of its special advantage to treat patients in an emergency without physical presence at a hospital via video conferencing, telemedicine has been used to overcome distance barriers and to improve access to special domains like neurology. In these pandemic times, telemedicine has been also employed as a support for the diagnosis and treatment of adult-onset dementia disorders including Alzheimer’s disease. Objective: In this study, we carried out a systematic literature analysis to clarify if the neuropsychological tests traditionally employed in face-to-face (FTF) contexts are reliable via telemedicine. Methods: A systematic literature search for the past 20 years (2001–2020) was carried out through the medical databases PubMed (Medline) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). The quality assessment was conducted by adopting the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) and only studies with a NOS ≥ 7 were included in this review. Results: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) results do not differ when tests are administered in the traditional FTF modality or by videoconference, and only negligible minor changes in the scoring system were noticeable. Other neuropsychological tests used to support the diagnosis of AD and dementia such as the Token Test, the Comprehension of Words and Phrases (ACWP), the Controlled Oral Word Association Test showed high reliability between the two modalities considered. No differences in the reliability concerning the living setting or education of the subjects were reported. Conclusions: The MMSE, which is the main screening test for dementia, can be administered via telemedicine with minor adaptation in the scoring system. Telemedicine use for other neuropsychological tests also resulted in general reliability and enough accuracy. Cognitive assessment by videoconference is accepted and appreciated and therefore can be used for dementia diagnosis in case of difficulties to performing FTF assessments. This approach can be useful given a personalized medicine approach for the treatment of adult-onset dementia disorders.","Carotenuto, Anna; Traini, Enea; Fasanaro, Angiola Maria; Battineni, Gopi; Amenta, Francesco",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11080688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442332/,106
604456,How do we live with covid-19?,2021-07-24,"Abstract Three tests were compared to diagnose herpes virus infection: electron microscopy (EM), viral culture (VC) and cytodiagnosis (Tzanck smear). The study comprised 67 patients with skin or mucous membrane lesions suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The sensitivity of EM increased 25% after virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. Herpes virus infection was confirmed in 55 of the 67 cases by EM or VC or both. EM detected 53 herpes virus-positive lesion samples of which 14 were not detected by VC; only two lesion samples that were herpes virus-positive in VC were not detected by EM. The sensitivities of EM, VC, and Tzanck smear for the group of 55 herpes virus-positive cases were 96%, 75% and 76%, respectively. The specificity of the Tzanck smear was 83% (prevalence 82%). Colloidal gold immuno-EM was used to rapidly type HSV-1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) present in skin and mucous membrane lesions in less than 4 h. Immuno-EM was able to detect antiviral antibodies on viral envelopes and viral cores in lesion samples with negative VC. Antiviral antibodies do not interfere with typing of herpes viruses by immuno-EM. It is suggested that formation of viral immune complexes and inactivation of virus particles by antibodies may have caused a negative VC. Improved EM is discussed for its applicability to special cases that cannot rely on VC and cytodiagnosis or when rapid diagnosis is required.","Folkers, E.; Vreeswijk, Joh.; Oranje, A.

These institutions have a recent history of low research and technological advancement globally. The effects of the COVID-19are wide ranging and endangering students’ learning. The study investigates how public universities are attempting to deliver learning remotely in order to support students as well as exploring challenges and opportunities following the institutions’ efforts to minimize the risks of the pandemic. The result shows that, when compared with universities in other countries, neither the government nor the universities took concerted measures to sustain undergraduate students learning. Undergraduate, graduate and Ph.D. learning in universities was interrupted until May 2020 and many questioned the quality, graduate and PhD students’ learning as continued online. The inequality between undergraduate students will be sustained and widened if this situation continues, universities must develop and apply concerted efforts to better use remote learning. In Ethiopia, the current pandemic challenges higher education institutions’ response to the crisis. Large sections of students have the least technology support, without government and universities support we may create a lost generation in the COVID-19 pandemic period.

But these models are challenging to interpret due to the lack of closed-form solutions. This note provides an intuitive and graphical explanation of optimal quarantine policy. To be optimal, a quarantine requires “the cavalry” (e.g., mass testing, strong therapeutics, or a vaccine) to arrive just in time, not too early or too late. The graphical explanation accommodates numerous extensions, including hospital constraints, sick worker, age differentiation, and learning. The effect of uncertainty about the arrival time of “the cavalry” is also discussed.","Smetters, Kent A.",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,https://doi.org/10.1057/s10713-020-00056-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929319/,106

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme in coronavirus, represents an attractive pharmacological target for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we evaluated whether the anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen, may act as a potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor, using an in silico study. From molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we also evaluated the influence of ionic strength on the affinity and stability of the Ibuprofen–Mpro complexes. The docking analysis shows that R(−)Ibuprofen and S(+)Ibuprofen isomers can interact with multiple key residues of the main protease, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with favourable binding energies (−6.2 and −5.7 kcal/mol, respectively). MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA calculations confirm the affinity of these complexes, in terms of binding energies. It also demonstrates that the ionic strength modifies significantly their binding affinities. Different structural parameters calculated from the MD simulations (120 ns) reveal that these complexes are conformational stable in the different conditions analysed. In this context, the results suggest that the condition 2 (0.25 NaCl) bind more tightly the Ibuprofen to Mpro than the others conditions. From the frustration analysis, we could characterize two important regions (Cys44-Pro52 and Linker loop) of this protein involved in the interaction with Ibuprofen. In conclusion, our findings allow us to propose that racemic mixtures of the Ibuprofen enantiomers might be a potential treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, further research is necessary to determinate their possible medicinal use. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma","Clemente, C. M.; Freiberger, M. I.; Ravetti, S.; Beltramo, D. M.; Garro, A.

Racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among health care workers (HCWs), who face occupational and community exposure to COVID-19, have not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To assess hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccination among HCWs across different racial/ethnic groups and assess factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study was conducted among HCWs from 2 large academic hospitals (ie, a children’s hospital and an adult hospital) over a 3-week period in November and December 2020. Eligible participants were HCWs with and without direct patient contact. A 3-step hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between race/ethnicity and vaccine hesitancy controlling for demographic characteristics, employment characteristics, COVID-19 exposure risk, and being up to date with routine vaccinations. Data were analyzed from February through March 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vaccine hesitancy, defined as not planning on, being unsure about, or planning to delay vaccination, served as the outcome. RESULTS: Among 34 865 HCWs eligible for this study, 12 034 individuals (34.5%) completed the survey and 10 871 individuals (32.2%) completed the survey and reported their race/ethnicity. Among 10 866 of these HCWs with data on sex, 8362 individuals (76.9%) were women, and among 10 833 HCWs with age data, 5923 individuals (54.5%) were younger than age 40 years.

There were 8388 White individuals (77.2%), 882 Black individuals (8.1%), 845 Asian individuals (7.8%), and 449 individuals with other or mixed race/ethnicity (4.1%), and there were 307 Hispanic or Latino individuals (2.8%). Vaccine hesitancy was highest among Black HCWs (732 individuals [83.0%]) and Hispanic or Latino HCWs (195 individuals [63.5%]) (P < .001). Among 5440 HCWs with vaccine hesitancy, reasons given for hesitancy included concerns about side effects (4737 individuals [87.1%]), newness of the vaccine (4306 individuals [79.2%]), and lack of vaccine knowledge (4091 individuals [75.2%]). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for vaccine hesitancy was 4.98 (95% CI, 4.11-6.03) among Black HCWs, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.63-2.70) among Hispanic or Latino HCWs, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.21-1.82) among HCWs with other or mixed race/ethnicity, and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.26-1.71) among Asian HCWs compared with White HCWs (P < .001). The aOR was decreased among Black HCWs when adjusting for employment characteristics and COVID-19 exposure risk (aOR, 4.87; 95% CI, 3.96-6.00; P < .001) and being up to date with prior vaccines (aOR, 4.48; 95% CI, 3.62-5.53; P < .001) but not among HCWs with other racial/ethnic backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that vaccine hesitancy before the authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine was increased among Black, Hispanic or Latino, and Asian HCWs compared with White HCWs. These findings suggest that interventions focused on addressing vaccine hesitancy among HCWs are needed.","Momplaisir, Florence M.; Kuter, Barbara J.; Ghadimi, Fatemeh; Browne, Safa; Nkwihoreze, Hervette; Feemster, Kristen A.; Frank, Ian; Faig, Walter; Shen, Angela K.; Offit, Paul A.; Green-McKenzie, Judith",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.21931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34459907/,106
610698,The Hybrid Forecasting Method SVR-ESAR forCovid-19,2020-05-22,"STUDY QUESTION: How did coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) services in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020)? SUMMARY ANSWER: MAR services, and hence treatments for infertile couples, were stopped in most European countries for a mean of 7 weeks. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: With the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, non-urgent medical care was reduced by local authorities to preserve health resources and maintain social distancing. Furthermore, ESHRE and other societies recommended to postpone ART pregnancies as of 14 March 2020. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A structured questionnaire was distributed in April among the ESHRE Committee of National Representatives, followed by further information collection through email. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The information was collected through the questionnaire and afterwards summarised and aligned with data from the European Centre for Disease Control on the number of COVID-19 cases per country. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: By aligning the data for each country with respective epidemiological data, we show a large variation in the time and the phase in the epidemic in the curve when MAR/ART treatments were suspended and restarted. Similarly, the duration of interruption varied. Fertility preservation treatments and patient supportive care for patients remained available during the pandemic. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data collection was prone to misinterpretation of the questions and replies, and required further follow-up to check the accuracy. Some representatives reported that they, themselves, were not always aware of the situation throughout the country or reported difficulties with providing single generalised replies, for instance when there were regional differences within their country. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The current article provides a basis for further research of the different strategies developed in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Such conclusions will be invaluable for health authorities and healthcare professionals with respect to future similar situations. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): There was no funding for the study, apart from technical support from ESHRE. The authors had no COI to disclose.","Vermeulen, Nathalie; Ata, Baris; Gianaroli, Luca; Lundin, Kersti; Mocanu, Edgar; Rautakallio-Hokkanen, Satu; Tapanainen, Juha S; Veiga, Anna",Hum Reprod Open,https://doi.org/10.1093/hropen/hoaa035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821857/,106
611526,The spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak in Africa,2020-04-25,"Since the new coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak spread from China to other countries, it has been a curiosity for how and how long the number of cases will increase. This study aims to forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). In this study, grey model (GM(1,1)), nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (NGBM(1,1)) and fractional nonlinear grey Bernoulli model (FANGBM(1,1)) are compared for the prediction. Therefore, grey prediction models, especially the fractional accumulated grey model, are used for the first time in this topic and it is believed that this study fills the gap in the literature. This model is applied to predict the data for the period 19/03-22/04/2020 (35 days) and forecast the data for the period 23/04-22/05/2020. The number of cases of COVID-19 in these countries are handled cumulatively. The prediction performance of the models is measured by the calculation of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and R(2) values. It is obtained that FANGBM(1,1) gives the highest prediction performance with having the lowest RMSE and MAPE values and the highest R(2) values for these countries. Results show that the cumulative number of cases for Italy, UK and USA is forecasted to be about 233000, 184000 and 1090000, respectively, on May 22, 2020 which corresponds to the average daily rate is 0.80%, 1.19% and 1.13%, respectively, from 22/04/2020 to 22/05/2020. The FANGBM(1,1) presents that the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 increases at a diminishing rate from 23/04/2020 to 22/05/2020 for these countries.","Utkucan, Şahin; Tezcan, Şahin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834578/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303477?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109948,106

We derive rather general conditions for reaching herd immunity while minimizing the costs incurred by the introduction of societal control measures (such as closing schools, social distancing, lockdowns, etc.), under the constraint that the infected fraction of the population does never exceed a certain maximum corresponding to public health system capacity. Optimality is derived and verified by variational and numerical methods for a number of model cost functions.

612972,A year like no other: introduction to a special issue on COVID-19 and pain,2021-05-10,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes high mortality in neonatal piglets. The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, YxxΦ (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the YxxΦ motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) icΔ10aa (ΔYxxΦEKVHVQ), (ii) icΔ5aa (ΔKVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with icΔ10aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant icΔ10aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, icΔ5aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets. IMPORTANCE Many coronaviruses (CoVs) possess conserved motifs YxxΦ and/or KxHxx/KKxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. The KxHxx/KKxx motif has been identified as the ER retrieval signal, but the function of the YxxΦ motif in the intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins remains controversial. In this study, we showed that the YxxΦ of PEDV S protein is an endocytosis signal. Furthermore, using reverse genetics technology, we evaluated its role in PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional YxxΦ and KVHVQ motifs. Knowledge from this study may aid in the design of efficacious live attenuated vaccines against PEDV, as well as other CoVs bearing the same motif in their S protein.","Hou, Yixuan; Meulia, Tea; Gao, Xiang; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong",Journal of Virology,https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/2/e01758-18.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404797/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01758-18,106

The COVID-19 epidemic has a hefty bill: thousands of deaths - mainly elderly, hospitals overwhelmed, residential assistance structures reaching their limits, sick people left alone and uncared in homes, the disruption in life habits and an altered daily way of living never experienced before; all have contributed into making the ongoing tragedy even more painful. Herewith, we present and discuss the information and reflections from our experiences and postulate the rethinking of the established socio-health policies not only in Italy but also in other western countries which have failed to curtail the epidemic via conventional management approaches.","Caimmi, Philippe Primo; Capponi, Andrea; Leigheb, Fabrizio; Occo, Franca Dall’; Sacco, Roberto; Minola, Mario; Kapetanakis, Emmanouil Ioannis",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969950/; https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.210420.001,106

Specifically, we examined the contribution of personal resources: self‐compassion and perceived social support, as well as a couple of COVID‐19‐related fears of being infected and concern for the foetus, to both the woman's global fear of childbirth (FOC) and her COVID‐19‐related childbirth anxiety. Participants were Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 403) aged 20–47, who completed a set of structured self‐report questionnaires from 18 March to 9 April 2020. Findings indicated that Arab women reported higher level of COVID‐19‐related childbirth anxiety and COVID‐19‐related fears of being infected and concern for the foetus. In addition, poorer health, being an Arab woman, being in the third trimester, lower self‐compassion, and higher COVID‐19‐related fears contributed significantly to greater COVID‐19‐related childbirth anxiety. Furthermore, poorer health, being primiparous, at‐risk pregnancy, lower self‐compassion and higher fear of being infected contributed significantly to greater FOC. Importantly, social support was found to moderate the association between self‐compassion and FOC. The results highlight the need to be attentive to pregnant women in times of crisis, and in particular to especially vulnerable subgroups, such as cultural minorities. They also highlight the importance of personal resources that may be applied in targeted interventions to reduce distress in vulnerable populations.","Taubman – Ben‐Ari, Orit; Chasson, Miriam; Abu‐Sharkia, Salam",Health Soc Care Community,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058395/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13196,106

To meet these goals and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of current vaccine strategies, scientists routinely study human responses toward seasonal influenza vaccines. This research is frequently performed with clinical samples taken throughout an influenza season, often without strict attention to the month of inoculation for each study participant. Here, we ask how the timing of vaccination affects outcomes. Results demonstrate significant influences of inoculation month on the immune response. During the progression from fall to winter months, there are changes in host lifestyles and in the frequencies of clinical/sub-clinical viral infections that can significantly alter vaccine immunogenicity. We now recommend routine assessment of inoculation month during clinical studies to inform data interpretation and expedite the development of successful vaccines. This recommendation is pertinent to numerous vaccine development efforts within and outside the influenza virus field.","Penkert, Rhiannon R.; Patel, Nehali; Webby, Richard J.; Ross, Ted M.; Hurwitz, Julia L.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9020068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498232/,106
614974,Facial expressions can detect Parkinson’s disease: preliminary evidence from videos collected online,2021-09-03,"The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020 (during the time-period before the start of Unlock 1.0 in India on and from June 08, 2020), and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors – Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein – host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R(2) = 0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 – June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.","Banerjee, Rachana; Basak, Kausik; Ghosh, Anamika; Rajachandran, Vyshakh; Sureka, Kamakshi; Ganguly, Debabani; Chattopadhyay, Sujay",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33905891/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821001714; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821001714; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104874,106

We examine epidemiological evidence for this VOC having a transmission advantage from several perspectives. First, whole genome sequence data collected from community-based diagnostic testing provides an indication of changing prevalence of different genetic variants through time. Phylodynamic modelling additionally indicates that genetic diversity of this lineage has changed in a manner consistent with exponential growth. Second, we find that changes in VOC frequency inferred from genetic data correspond closely to changes inferred by S-gene target failures (SGTF) in community-based diagnostic PCR testing. Third, we examine growth trends in SGTF and non-SGTF case numbers at local area level across England, and show that the VOC has higher transmissibility than non-VOC lineages, even if the VOC has a different latent period or generation time. Available SGTF data indicate a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20 year olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases. Fourth, we assess the association of VOC frequency with independent estimates of the overall SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number through time. Finally, we fit a semi-mechanistic model directly to local VOC and non-VOC case incidence to estimate the reproduction numbers over time for each. There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC has a substantial transmission advantage, with the estimated difference in reproduction numbers between VOC and non-VOC ranging between 0.4 and 0.7, and the ratio of reproduction numbers varying between 1.4 and 1.8. We note that these estimates of transmission advantage apply to a period where high levels of social distancing were in place in England; extrapolation to other transmission contexts therefore requires caution.","Volz, Erik; Mishra, Swapnil; Chand, Meera; Barrett, Jeffrey C; Johnson, Robert; Geidelberg, Lily; Hinsley, Wes R; Laydon, Daniel J; Dabrera, Gavin; O039, Ãine; Toole,; Amato, Roberto; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Harrison, Ian; Jackson, Ben; Ariani, Cristina V; Boyd, Olivia; Loman, Nick; McCrone, John T; GonÃ§alves, Sonia; Jorgensen, David; Myers, Richard; Hill, Verity; Jackson, David K; Gaythorpe, Katy; Groves, Natalie; Sillitoe, John; Kwiatkowski, Dominic P; COG-UK, -; Flaxman, Seth; Ratman, Oliver; Bhatt, Samir; Hopkins, Susan; Gandy, Axel; Rambaut, Andrew; Ferguson, Neil M",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.20249034; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.20249034v1?rss=1,106

Children and adolescents seem to be particularly at risk of developing psychiatric disorders during and after the stay-at-home but evidences are lacking. The main objective of this article is to present the methodology of Coronavirus Confinement 2020 (CoCo20) Study, which aims to assess the impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and stay-at-home on the development of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in children and adolescents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a longitudinal and multicentre study in the paediatric population during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic. Inclusions started on 30 March 2020 for 6 months. This study is proposed to all consecutive paediatric outpatients consulting during and after stay-at-home related to COVID-19 pandemic in medical–psychological centres and in a paediatric psychotrauma centre and/or calling the emergency COVID-19 hotline. We perform standardised and internationally validated psychiatric assessments (Diagnosis Infant and Preschool Assessment, Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia—Present and Lifetime Version) together with anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, PTSD, parenting stress and somatic symptoms scales during five visits (baseline, 1 week after baseline, 1 month after baseline, 1 week after the end of the containment and 1 month after the end of the containment) in patients and their families enrolled during the containment and during three visits in case of enrolment after the containment. The inclusion period will end in 30 November 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Cote d’Azur University « CERNI » (number 2020-59). All patients and their legal caregivers provide a written informed consent on enrolment in the study. We will submit the results of the study to relevant journals and offer national and international presentations.

The results of treating and rehabilitating patients with COVID-19 and prevention of the disease using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) are evaluated. METHODS: A literature review is conducted on mechanisms of vascular homeostasis regulation, biomodulating effect of laser light, and LLLT methods for preventing endothelial dysfunction. A total of 106 patients were treated in two COVID-19 healthcare centers in Russia. 22 patients with SARS (+) pneumonia at the stage of resolving the pathological lesion were admitted to rehabilitation using pulsed IR laser. 14 patients with acute forms of COVID-19 were treated using LASMIK device: wavelength 904 nm, pulsed mode, externally and ILBI-525 (intravenous laser blood illumination) + LUVBI (ultraviolet laser blood illumination). 70 persons underwent preventive courses of noninvasive LLLT. RESULTS: It was shown that LLLT is effective in preventing the development of endothelial dysfunction. Clinical experience demonstrated good tolerability of the treatment, improvement in sputum discharge, and an improvement in overall health. The severity of general hypoxia decreased by the 5th procedure. The procedures for prevention of the disease were well tolerated; there were no cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Low-level laser therapy is a justified treatment method that promotes lung tissue regeneration and mitigates the consequences of the disease. The obtained results confirm that LLLT can be used for the effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Moskvin, Sergey; Askhadulin, Evgeniy; Kochetkov, Andrey",Rehabil Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542837/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6626932,106
618270,A Net Benefit Approach for the Optimal Allocation of a COVID-19 Vaccine,2020-12-02,"Driven by the broad diversity of species and physiologies and by reproduction-related bottlenecks in aquaculture, the field of fish reproductive biology has rapidly grown over the last five decades. This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension. Undoubtedly, the next (five) decades will be similarly exciting as we continue to integrate physiology with genomics, basic and translational research, and the small fish models with the aquacultured species.","Zohar, Yonathan",Gen Comp Endocrinol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016648020302975?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2020.113544; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016648020302975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615136/,106

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral activity of crude extracts from B. licheniformis against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a highly contagious enveloped porcine virus that has caused great economic loss in pigs. In vivo, PEDV-infected piglets supplemented with air-dried solid state fermentative cultivate containing B. licheniformis-fermented products (BLFP) showed milder clinical symptoms and decreased viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological lesions and no reduction in average daily gain were noted in pigs supplemented with the BLFP, which suggests that it is safe for use in pigs. In vitro experiments revealed that while B. licheniformis crude extracts exhibited no toxicity in Vero cells, co-cultivation of B. licheniformis crude extracts with PEDV significantly reduced viral infection and replication.

Using daily data on COVID-19 cases and flight on-time performance, and controlling for product, carrier and market characteristics, we find that increases in reported COVID-19 cases are associated with reductions in both departure and arrival delays. Specifically, a standard deviation increase in COVID-19 cases reduces arrival delay by 1 min 42 s and departure delay by 2 min, on average. Our results suggest that despite the economic fallout from the pandemic, a silver lining emerges—flights are departing and arriving with less delay amid the pandemic.","Yimga, Jules",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221000932; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2021.100386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590198221000932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34514372/,106

DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have become hot topics in recent studies which both served as cell adhesion and phagocytic pathogen recognition receptors in mammals. However, there have been almost no studies of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN structure and characters in fish, only DC-SIGN in the zebrafish had been studied. In our study, we identified and characterized the full-length miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) DC-SIGN (mmDC-SIGN) and L-SIGN (mmL-SIGN) genes. The sequence analysis results showed that mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN have the same domains with other vertebrates except primates, and share some conserved motifs in CRD among all the vertebrates which play a crucial role in interacting with Ca(2+) and for recognizing mannose-containing motifs. Gene synteny of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were analyzed for the first time and gene synteny of L-SIGN was conserved among the five fishes. Interestingly, one gene next to L-SIGN from gene synteny had high similarity with L-SIGN gene that was described as L-SIGN-like in fish species. While only one L-SIGN gene existed in other vertebrates, two L-SIGN in fish may be in consequence of the fish-specific genome duplication to adapt the specific environment. The evolutionary analysis showed that the ancestral lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes experienced purifying selection and the current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent positive selection, indicating that the ancestral lineages and current lineages of L-SIGN gene in fishes underwent different evolutionary patterns. Both mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN were expressed in all tested tissues and ubiquitously up-regulated in infected liver, spleen and kidney at different sampling time points, indicating that the mmDC-SIGN and mmL-SIGN participated in the immune response to defense against bacteria infection.","Shu, Chang; Wang, Shanchen; Xu, Tianjun",Dev Comp Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2015.01.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145305X15000051; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145305X15000051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596146/,106

We highlight the known evidence related to COVID-19 infections among people with HIV (PWH) with specific reference to Africa. The knowledge gaps, level of public health preparedness and the potential research priorities are also outlined. Although the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in HIV patients are evolving, existing evidence indicate that the disease outcomes are comparable to that of the general population. However, PWH with low CD4 cell counts may have worse outcomes than individuals with restored immunity, whereas old age and co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension and diabetes can further increase their overall risk. While there may be slight disruption of HIV service delivery in selected African countries, the resilience and resourcefulness of others have helped to sustain HIV service delivery and enhanced the level of public health preparedness and fight against the pandemic. The paucity of data and research studies on HIV-COVID-19 coinfection in Africa, call for concerted efforts to address these limitations.","Essien, Ekere James; Mgbere, Osaro; Iloanusi, Sorochi; Abughosh, Susan M.",Int J MCH AIDS,https://doi.org/10.21106/ijma.461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842057/,106

The pace of pre-clinical development was exceptional and a number of therapeutic clinical trials were conducted in the face of considerable challenges. Given the on-going risk of emerging infectious disease outbreaks in an era of unprecedented population density, international travel and human impact on the environment it is pertinent to focus on improving the research and development landscape for treatments of emerging and epidemic-prone infections. This is especially the case since there are no licensed therapeutics for some of the diseases considered by the World Health Organization as most likely to cause severe outbreaks—including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Marburg virus, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever and Nipah virus. EVD, therefore, provides a timely exemplar to discuss the barriers, enablers and incentives needed to find effective treatments in advance of health emergencies caused by emerging infectious diseases.

The system includes a laser‐induced fluorescence microfluidic chip analyzer, a glass microchip for both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and capillary electrophoresis, a chip thermal cycler based on dual Peltier thermoelectric elements, a reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) SARS diagnostic kit, and a DNA electrophoretic sizing kit. The system allows efficient cDNA amplification of SARS‐CoV followed by electrophoretic sizing and detection on the same chip. To enhance the reliability of RT‐PCR on SARS‐CoV detection, duplex PCR was developed on the microchip. The assay was carried out on a home‐made microfluidic chip system. The positive and the negative control were cDNA fragments of SARS‐CoV and parainfluenza virus, respectively. The test results showed that 17 positive samples were obtained among 18 samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from clinically diagnosed SARS patients. However, 12 positive results from the same 18 samples were obtained by the conventional RT‐PCR with agarose gel electrophoresis detection.

Recently, molecular methods have been used to amplify and identify novel nucleic acid sequences directly from clinical samples, but these methods may be hampered by the quantity of virus present in respiratory secretions at different time points following the onset of infection. Human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, which effectively mimic the human bronchial environment, allow for cultivation of a wide variety of human respiratory viral pathogens. The goal of the experiments described here was to determine if propagation and identification of a human respiratory virus may be achieved through inoculation of HAE cultures followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) and sequence analysis. To establish proof-of-principle human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) was evaluated, and the first visualization of HCoV-NL63 virus by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is reported. Initial propagation of human respiratory secretions onto HAE cultures followed by TEM and WTA of culture supernatant may be a useful approach for visualization and detection of new human respiratory pathogens that have eluded identification by traditional approaches.","Banach, Bridget; Orenstein, Jan M.; Fox, Linda M.; Randell, Scott H.; Rowley, Anne H.; Baker, Susan C.",Journal of Virological Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408003807; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.10.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19027037/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408003807,106
623744,The dynamics of entropy in the COVID-19 outbreaks,2020-09-09,"Cancer “stem cells” (CSCs) sustain the hierarchies of dividing cells that characterize cancer. The main causes of cancer-related mortality are metastatic disease and relapse, both of which originate primarily from CSCs, so their eradication may provide a bona fide curative strategy, though there maybe also the need to kill the bulk cancer cells. While classic anti-cancer chemotherapy is effective against the dividing progeny of CSCs, non-dividing or quiescent CSCs are often spared. Improved anti-cancer therapies therefore require approaches that target non-dividing CSCs, which must be underpinned by a better understanding of factors that permit these cells to maintain a stem cell-like state. During hematopoiesis, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) γ is selectively expressed by stem cells and their immediate progeny. It is overexpressed in, and is an oncogene for, many cancers including colorectal, renal and hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinomas and some cases of acute myeloid leukemia that harbor RARγ fusion proteins. In vitro studies suggest that RARγ-selective and pan-RAR antagonists provoke the death of CSCs by necroptosis and point to antagonism of RARγ as a potential strategy to treat metastatic disease and relapse, and perhaps provide a cure for some cancers.","Brown, Geoffrey; Petrie, Kevin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807298/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073632,106

Live-attenuated cold-adapted HPIV3 vaccines have been evaluated in infants but a suitable interval for administration of a second dose of vaccine has not been defined. METHODS: HPIV3-seronegative children between the ages of 6 and 36 months were randomized 2:1 in a blinded study to receive two doses of 10(5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) of live-attenuated, recombinant cold-passaged human PIV3 vaccine (rHPIV3cp45) or placebo 6 months apart. Serum antibody levels were assessed prior to and approximately 4-6 weeks after each dose. Vaccine virus infectivity, defined as detection of vaccine-HPIV3 in nasal wash and/or a ≥ 4-fold rise in serum antibody titer, and reactogenicity were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following immunization. RESULTS: Forty HPIV3-seronegative children (median age 13 months; range 6-35 months) were enrolled; 27 (68%) received vaccine and 13 (32%) received placebo. Infectivity was detected in 25 (96%) of 26 evaluable vaccinees following dose 1 and 9 of 26 subject (35%) following dose 2. Among those who shed virus, the median duration of viral shedding was 12 days (range, 6-15 days) after dose 1 and 6 days (range 3-8 days) after dose 2, with a mean peak log(10) viral titer of 3.4 PFU/mL (SD: 1.0) after dose 1 compared to1.5 PFU/mL (SD: 0.92) after dose 2. Overall, reactogenicity was mild, with no difference in rates of fever and upper respiratory infection symptoms between vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: rHPIV3cp45 was immunogenic and well-tolerated in seronegative young children. A second dose administered 6 months after the initial dose was restricted in those previously infected with vaccine virus; however, the second dose boosted antibody responses and induced antibody responses in two previously uninfected children.","Englund, Janet A.; Karron, Ruth A.; Cunningham, Coleen K; LaRussa, Philip; Melvin, Ann; Yogev, Ram; Handelsman, Ed; Siberry, George K; Thumar, Bhavanji; Schappell, Elizabeth; Bull, Catherine V.; Chu, Helen Y.; Schaap-Nutt, Anne; Buchholz, Ursula; Collins, Peter L.; Schmidt, Alexander C.",Vaccine,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3889708?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13013005; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.09.046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X13013005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24103895/,106
624448,Fuzzy Cloud Based COVID-19 Diagnosis Assistant for identifying affected cases globally using MCDM,2021-01-29,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The large number of clinical variables associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection makes it challenging for frontline physicians to effectively triage COVID‐19 patients during the pandemic. This study aimed to develop an efficient deep‐learning artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help clinicians triage COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID‐19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21, 2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78 clinical variables. A deep‐learning algorithm and a risk stratification score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing. Prediction performance were compared with those using COVID‐19 severity score, CURB‐65 score and pneumonia severity index (PSI). RESULTS: Of the 181 COVID‐19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five top predictors of mortality were D‐dimer, O(2) Index, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C‐reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 ([95% CI:0.87‐1.0]) and 0.954 ([95% CI:0.80‐0.99]) for the testing dataset. Our models outperformed COVID‐19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB‐65 score (AUC = 0.671), and PSI (AUC = 0.838). The mortality rates for our risk stratification scores (0‐5) were 0, 0, 6.7, 18.2, 67.7, and 83.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Deep‐learning prediction model and the resultant risk stratification score may prove useful in clinical decision‐making under time‐sensitive and resource‐constrained environment.

624688,Mathematical framework to model Covid-19 daily deaths,2020-05-22,"There remain unanswered questions concerning mother‐to‐child‐transmission (MTCT) of SARS‐CoV‐2. Despite reports of neonatal COVID‐19, SARS‐CoV‐2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples thus, definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal‐fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID‐19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. While RT‐PCR of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID‐19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID‐19. The paucity of placental co‐expression of ACE‐2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS‐CoV‐2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection. Viral interactions may utilise membrane receptors other than ACE‐2 thus, tissue susceptibility may be broader than currently known. Further spatial‐temporal studies are needed to determine the true potential for transplacental migration. This article is protected by copyright.

We investigate different structural measures of a network as candidate EWS of infectious disease outbreaks and changes in popular vaccine sentiment. We construct a multiplex disease model coupling infectious disease spread and social contact dynamics. We find that the number and mean size of echo chambers predict transitions in the infection dynamics, as do opinion-based communities. Graph modularity also gives early warnings, though the clustering coefficient shows no significant pre-outbreak changes. Change point tests applied to the EWS show decreasing efficacy as social norms strengthen. Therefore, many measures of social network connectivity can predict approaching critical changes in vaccine uptake and aggregate health, thereby providing valuable tools for improving public health.","Phillips, B.

627848,COVID-19 pandemic planning: considerations for radiation oncology medical physics,2020-04-13,"Execution of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is controlled by the BCL-2 proteins at the level of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). This family of proteins consists of prosurvival (e.g., BCL-2, MCL-1) and proapoptotic (e.g., BIM, BAD, HRK) members, the functional balance of which dictates the activation of BAX and BAK. Once activated, BAX/BAK form pores in the MOM, resulting in cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space, leading to apoptosome formation, caspase activation, and cleavage of intracellular targets. This pathway is induced by cellular stress including DNA damage, cytokine and growth factor withdrawal, and chemotherapy/drug treatment. A well-documented defense of leukemia cells is to shift the balance of the BCL-2 family in favor of the prosurvival proteins to protect against such intra- and extracellular stimuli. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the prosurvival proteins, named ‘BH3 mimetics’, have come to the fore in recent years to treat hematological malignancies, both as single agents and in combination with standard-of-care therapies. The most significant example of these is the BCL-2-specific inhibitor venetoclax, given in combination with standard-of-care therapies with great success in AML in clinical trials. As the number and variety of available BH3 mimetics increases, and investigations into applying these novel inhibitors to treat myeloid leukemias continue apace the need to evaluate where we currently stand in this rapidly expanding field is clear.","Parry, Narissa; Wheadon, Helen; Copland, Mhairi",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03500-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637708/,106

Methods: Purposeful sampling was followed to recruit study participants, a semi-structured interview guide was used to conduct interviews, and the saturation was reached after the 13th interviewer; no new information was obtained after two subsequent interviews. All the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by means of a standard content analysis framework. Results: As per the WHO guidelines, eleven participants were aware of the term “ADR”. All the participants denied receiving any prior education and attending events about ADRs and were unaware of the Saudi FDA-ADR reporting systems. The use of technologies such as SPAs has been widely accepted with a high level of concern for data confidentiality and privacy.

METHOD: This qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted in June-August 2020. Interviews were analyzed via a two-phase Rapid Analysis. The study's primary outcomes (innovations in ED-PC during COVID) are published elsewhere. In this secondary analysis, we examine interviewee responses to broader questions about ED-PC currently and in the future. RESULTS: PC providers perceived as successful in their work in the ED were described as autonomous, competent, flexible, fast, and fluent in ED language and culture. Barriers to ED-PC integration included the ED environment, lack of access to PC providers at all times, the ED perception of PC, and the lack of a supporting financial model. Facilitators to ED-PC integration included proactive identification of patients who would benefit from PC, ED-focused PC education and tools, PC presence in the ED, and data supporting ED-PC. Increased primary PC education for ED staff, increased automation, and innovative ED-PC models were seen as areas for future growth. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Our findings provide useful information for PC programs considering expanding their ED presence, particularly as this is the first study to our knowledge that examines traits of successful PC providers in the ED environment. Our findings also suggest that, despite growth in the arena of ED-PC, barriers and facilitators remain similar to those identified previously. Future research is needed to evaluate the impact that ED-PC initiatives may have on patient and system outcomes, to identify a financial model to maintain ED-PC integration, and to examine whether perceptions of successful providers align with objective measures of the same.","Gips, Alexa; Daubman, Bethany-Rose; Petrillo, Laura A; Bowman, Jason; Ouchi, Kei; Traeger, Lara; Jackson, Vicki; Grudzen, Corita; Ritchie, Christine Seel; Aaronson, Emily Loving",Palliat Support Care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951521001012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233782/,106

This research explores the trend of vaccinations coverage from 1993 to 2014 and determines the significant factors for vaccinations coverage in Bangladesh, considering geospatial, socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics. METHODS: This study uses a secondary dataset extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) from 1992 to 93 to 2014. The association between selected independent variables and vaccination coverage of children was examined through the Chi-square test. In addition, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression approaches were applied to determine the effects of covariates on vaccination status by using the BDHS-2014 dataset. RESULTS: The results reveal that the trend of the vaccination coverage rate has gradually been increased over the study period. The coverage rate of BCG is observed maximum while the lowest for Measles vaccination among all types of vaccinations. The findings revealed that the significantly lower coverage of all vaccination had been observed in the Sylhet region. Children of higher educated mothers (OR 10.21; CI: 4.10–25.37) and father (OR 8.71; CI: 4.03–18.80), born at health facilities (OR 4.53; CI: 2.4–8.55) and whose mother has media exposure (OR 3.20; CI: 2.22–4.60) have more chance of receiving BCG vaccine. For DPT vaccination coverage, there is a significant difference from children whose mothers have primary (OR 1.7; CI: 1.35–2.15), secondary (OR 3.5; CI: 2.75–4.45), and higher (OR 9.6; CI: 5.28–17.42) educational qualification compared to children of illiterate mothers. Findings demonstrated that children born in wealthier households have a higher likelihood of being immunized against DPT, Polio, and Measles vaccination than children born in the poorest households. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal that to enhance and make sustainable the overall country’s vaccination coverage, we should pay more attention to the mother’s education, socioeconomic condition, children’s age, birth order number, having media exposure, place of residence, and religion. The authors think that this finding would be helpful to accelerate the achievement target of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for children’s health in Bangladesh.

Low levels of reporter gene expressed from previous reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 have jeopardized their use to monitor the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro or in vivo. Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed upstream of the viral nucleocapsid gene followed by a 2A cleavage peptide. The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using a non-invasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 retained wild-type virus like pathogenicity in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Ye, Chengjin; Chiem, Kevin; Park, Jun-Gyu; Silvas, Jesus A.; Vasquez, Desarey Morales; Torrelles, Jordi B.; Kobie, James J.; Walter, Mark R.; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.446942,106

Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block entry of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. The use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab early during infection was associated with reduced COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death in patients at high risk for progressing to severe disease, which led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for their administration in non-hypoxemic, non-hospitalized high-risk patients. However, the safety and efficacy of these mAbs has not been evaluated in APECED patients. We enrolled two siblings with APECED on an IRB-approved protocol (NCT01386437) and admitted them prophylactically at the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the safety and clinical effects of early treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. The administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was well tolerated and was associated with amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention of invasive ventilatory support, admission to the intensive care, and death in both patients without affecting the production of antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. If given early in the course of COVID-19 infection, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be beneficial in APECED and other high-risk patients with neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I IFNs.","Ferré, Elise M.

Data from 3,197 persons with CML and 7,256 controls were collected. In multivariate analyses, CML was significantly associated with moderate to severe depression (OR = 1.6; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.4, 1.9; p < 0.001), anxiety (OR = 1.4 [1.1, 1.7]; p = 0.001), distress (OR = 1.3 [1.1, 1.5]; p < 0.001), and hyper-arousal (OR = 1.5 [1.3, 1.6]; p < 0.001).

The cumulative number of new confirmed cases and deaths are still increasing out of China. Independent predicted factors associated with fatal outcomes remain uncertain. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of the current study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated with fatal outcomes from COVID-19 through a multivariate Cox regression analysis and a nomogram model. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 1,590 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 throughout China was established. The prognostic effects of variables, including clinical features and laboratory findings, were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: In this nationwide cohort, nonsurvivors included a higher incidence of elderly people and subjects with coexisting chronic illness, dyspnea, and laboratory abnormalities on admission compared with survivors. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age ≥ 75 years (hazard ratio [HR], 7.86; 95% CI, 2.44-25.35), age between 65 and 74 years (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.24-9.5), coronary heart disease (HR, 4.28; 95% CI, 1.14-16.13), cerebrovascular disease (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.07-8.94), dyspnea (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 1.42-11), procalcitonin level > 0.5 ng/mL (HR, 8.72; 95% CI, 3.42-22.28), and aspartate aminotransferase level > 40 U/L (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-6.73) were independent risk factors associated with fatal outcome.

The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram has sufficient discriminatory power with a C-index of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.97). The calibration plots also showed good consistency between the prediction and the observation.

Latency and the organization of turn-taking in video-mediated interaction,2021-01-11,"OBJECTIVE: To measure COVID‐19 vaccine acceptance and related factors to undercover nurses' concerns and fears. DESIGN: A cross‐sectional study. SAMPLE: The study included 639 nurses; 83% were women and 80% under 50 years. MEASUREMENT: A self‐administered questionnaire was used. It included demographic characteristics, COVID‐19‐related fears and concerns, COVID‐19 vaccine perceived benefits, and intention toward getting the vaccine. RESULTS: Forty percent of the nurses planned to get the vaccine when available, 41% would take it later when adequate protection and safety were presented, and 18% would never take it. Significant factors associated with vaccination intention were as follows: age (adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.02–1.99); lack of knowledge about the vaccine (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.81–3.8); concern about long‐term side effects (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–2.9); fear of injection (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.04–2.13); natural immunity preference (adjusted OR 5.8, 95% CI 4.5–8.3); media misrepresentation (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.4); and getting COVID‐19 from the vaccine (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1).

We aimed to describe the level of knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) among cancer patients, with the purpose to provide an image of the impact of COVID-19 and evaluate the effectiveness of pandemic response measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a cross-sectional multicentric study that targeted adults with active cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak, aiming to describe KAP related to COVID-19 among Romanian oncological patients. A questionnaire investigating 64 items on KAP related to the novel coronavirus was designed and applied in seven Romanian hospitals. The group of participants consisted of 1585 oncological patients who completed the questionnaire during the outbreak (April-May 2020). RESULTS: Only 172 patients (10.8%) had very good knowledge about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection symptoms, treatment options and incubation period. Only 44.3% of patients identified diarrhoea as a sign of COVID-19. About one-third of patients (32.6%) declared that they are ‘very worried’ about getting infected with the novel coronavirus. More than two-thirds of participants (68%) considered that having cancer represents an additional risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, but 27.8% would rather not vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 should a vaccine be available. A small percentage (8.8%) believed that the risk of infection justifies delaying/stopping oncological treatment until after the pandemic. Around half of the participants (55.5%) declared being compliant with all the protective measures against coronavirus infection listed in the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Romanian oncological patients have a less than expected knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, appropriate prevention behaviours, with limited trust in their efficacy, optimistic attitudes towards COVID-19 and low level of trust in information sources. Good COVID-19 knowledge was associated with appropriate practices towards COVID-19 and optimistic attitudes.","Gheorghe, A.S.; Negru, Ş.M.; Nițipir, C.; Mazilu, L.; Marinca, M.; Gafton, B.; Ciuleanu, T.E.; Schenker, M.; Dragomir, R.D.; Gheorghe, A.D.; Stovicek, P.O.; Bandi-Vasilica, M.; Boț, A.C.; Mihăilă, R.I.; Zob, D.L.; Kajanto, A.L.; Stănculeanu, D.L.",ESMO Open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2020.100027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920328921; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920328921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399089/,106

Emerging evidence suggests that the composition of the gut microbiome and modification of microbial ecology via probiotics can affect susceptibility to a wide range of infections, including respiratory tract infections. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) versus placebo on COVID-19 infection status and the gut microbiome in subjects with a household contact who has tested positive for COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we will randomise 1132 subjects having a household contact who has recently (≤7 days) tested positive for COVID-19 to daily oral LGG or placebo for 28 days. We hypothesise that taking LGG as a probiotic will protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the severity of disease in those who become infected (primary endpoint: decreased symptoms), and will be associated with beneficial changes in the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples and nasal swabs will be collected to evaluate the microbiome by 16S rRNA sequencing and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, respectively. We will also conduct multivariate analysis of demographic, behavioural, temporal, and other variables that may predict development of symptoms and other outcomes.

The movement of people might be one influencing factor, this paper aims to report the situation COVID-19 and spreading in Thailand, including influencing factors of spreading and control. SUBJECT AND METHOD: Infected, confirmed COVID-19 data were obtained from the official website of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health. Tourist data was downloaded from Ministry of Tourism and Sports. Researchers analyzed the situation from the first found case in Thailand until 15 April 2020 with the timeline of important influencing factors. Correlation coefficients of tourist data and infected case was calculated by person correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The number of infected cases was significant associated (correlation coefficient > 0.7) with economic factor, namely; number of visitors, generated income from both Thai and foreigner tourist (p value <0.01). The influencing factors of slow increased rate were the enforcement and implementation of both central and local government regulation, the strength of the Thai health care system, the culture and social relation, the partnership among various governmental and private sectors. CONCLUSION: We found that the number of tourist and their activities were significant associated with number of infected, confirmed COVID-19 cases. The public education and social supporting were the key roles for regulation enforcement and implementation.","Tantrakarnapa, Kraichat; Bhopdhornangkul, Bhophkrit; Nakhaapakorn, Kanchana",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837844/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01329-5,106

Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the propagation of droplets containing the virus assumes immense importance. Here, we investigate the evolution of droplets in space and time under varying external conditions of temperature, humidity, and wind flow by using laws of statistical and fluid mechanics. The effects of drag, diffusion, and gravity on droplets of different sizes and ejection velocities have been considered during their motion in air. In still air, we found that bigger droplets traverse a larger distance, but smaller droplets remain suspended in air for a longer time. Therefore, in still air, the horizontal distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is based on the bigger droplets, but the time interval to be maintained is based on the smaller droplets. We show that in places with wind flow, the lighter droplets travel a larger distance and remain suspended in air for a longer time. Therefore, we conclude that both temporal and geometric distance that a healthy individual should maintain from an infected one is based on the smaller droplets under flowing air, which makes the use of a mask mandatory to prevent the virus. Maintenance of only stationary separation between healthy and infected individuals is not substantiated. The quantitative results obtained here will be useful to devise strategies for preventing the spread of other types of droplets containing microorganisms.","Das, Santosh K.; Alam, Jan-e; Plumari, Salvatore; Greco, Vincenzo",Phys Fluids (1994),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982136/; https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0022859,106

In the light of new evidence and data sets about these two elements, epidemic models should be refined to incorporate both the heterogeneity of human contacts and the complexity of mobility patterns. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that allows accommodating these two aspects in the form of a set of Markovian equations. We validate these equations with extensive mechanistic simulations and derive analytically the epidemic threshold. The expression of this critical value allows us to evaluate its dependence on the specific demographic distribution, the structure of mobility flows, and the heterogeneity of contact patterns, thus shedding light on the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the epidemic detriment driven by recurrent mobility patterns reported in the literature.","Cota, Wesley; Soriano-Panos, David; Arenas, Alex; Ferreira, Silvio C.; G'omez-Gardenes, Jes'us",New Journal of Physics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10614v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/ac0c99,106

According to the cognitive model of HA, individuals with HA continued to adopt a series of maladaptive and repetitive behaviors which were associated with obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS; including over-washing, over-checking, obsessing, and metal neutralizing). The priority of the present study was to explore how HA specifically affected OCS and whether difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) and pathological personality traits (PPT) affected the relationship between the HA and OCS. We distributed an online survey from February 1 to February 17 in 2020 (N = 1546, with average age of 25.8, and 32.7% of males) from 219 cities in China. Results showed that only four dimensions (i.e., Nonacceptance, Impulse, Non-clarity and Non-awareness) of the DER scale mediated in the predictive path of HA on OCS, which constituted a multiple mediating model. The other moderated mediation model further showed that, with higher PPT, the more significant the impact of HA was on DER, revealing PPT's moderator role between HA and OCS.","Hong, Danping; Zhu, Yawen; Yu, Meng",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545259/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921006334; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921006334; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111254,106
637497,On the use of growth models to understand epidemic outbreaks with application to COVID-19 data,2020-10-20,"Objectifs La dépendance au tramadol (TR), antalgique morphinomimétique le plus prescrit en France, est une réalité inquiétante : obtention illégale en augmentation (enquête OPPIDUM 2018) et implication la plus fréquente dans les décès, directs ou indirects (par ex. par noyade), par antalgiques : 49/119 décès de l’enquête DTA 2018. Nous rapportons ici un type particulier de décès : celui d’un nourrisson (Mort Inattendue du Nourrisson ou MIN) en lien avec l’addiction au TR d’un parent en période de confinement lié à la pandémie de COVID-19. Méthode Couché la veille au soir par le compagnon de sa mère, après un biberon de jus d’orange et un bain, un enfant de 11 mois est retrouvé décédé dans son lit. L’autopsie révèle une cyanose et une congestion polyviscérale, cohérentes avec l’hypothèse d’un décès par détresse respiratoire aiguë. Résultats Les analyses toxicologiques (CL-SM/SM et CL-SMHR) mettent en évidence, à l’exclusion de tout autre toxique, du TR [sang cardiaque (SC) 6240μg/L (toxicité adulte>800μg/L) ; urine (UR) 291mg/L], de l’O-desméthyl-TR (O-DMT) [SC 902μg/L ; UR 127mg/L] et du N-desméthyl-TR (N-DMT) [SC 993μg/L ; UR 39,8mg/L]. Au-delà de questions d’ontogénie et du génotype CYP2D6 de l’enfant [CYP2D6*1/*17 cohérent avec les ratios métaboliques (RM) SG et UR], ces résultats sont compatibles avec une administration de TR ayant entraîné des effets toxiques majeurs potentiellement létaux (dépression respiratoire sévère, coma, convulsions, troubles cardiaques) chez cet enfant. Dans ce contexte d’empoisonnement, d’une cohérence avec les déclarations de la mère et de son compagnon [addiction maternelle au TR, et à cet usage, bouteille de jus d’orange préparée avec des comprimés de TR, accidentellement utilisée par le compagnon pour préparer le biberon (60 à 90mL pris par l’enfant)] et de la question d’éventuelles administrations préalables de TR à ce nourrisson, une analyse des phanères [cheveux et ongles] de l’enfant, de la mère, du compagnon et de la sœur (6 ans) de l’enfant est réalisée [concentrations en pg/mg ; segments capillaires de 2cm du proximal (S1) au distal (S3) ; nd : non détecté] : enfant [cheveux : TR 1420 (S1), 1622 (S2), 2736 (S3) ; O-DMT 16 à 38 ; N-DMT 34 à 100 (TR en quantité significative dans les bains de décontamination) – ongles : TR 584 ; O-DMT 8 ; N-DMT 15], mère [cheveux : TR 2340 (S1), 2150 (S2), 2500 (S3) ; O-DMT 704 à 1170 ; N-DMT 827 à 1360], compagnon [ongles : TR 72 ; O-DMT nd ; N-DMT nd] et sœur [cheveux : TR 261 (S1), 524 (S2) ; O-DMT 15 (S1), 16 (S2) ; N-DMT 20 (S1), 38 (S2)]. Les profils des concentrations capillaires, les RM dans les cheveux de l’enfant et de sa sœur comparables à ceux relevés chez des employés de l’industrie pharmaceutique fabricant le tramadol [1], les quantités de TR dans les bains de contamination, les concentrations faibles observées dans les ongles de l’enfant et du compagnon [2] : – confirment les prises répétées de TR par la mère ; – indiquent l’existence de contaminations externes (environnementales, sueur de la mère, sueur de l’enfant au moment du décès [3]) pouvant, en sus d’une contribution par l’exposition in utero, expliquer la présence de TR dans les phanères de la victime. Conclusion Ce cas édifiant illustre le risque (probablement favorisé en période de confinement, mais dans une mesure qui n’a pas été évaluée à ce jour) d’intoxication pédiatrique accidentelle liée à une addiction parentale au TR et l’intérêt d’analyser les matrices kératinisées (cheveux et ongles) de l’ensemble de la famille dans une telle situation.","Gaulier, Jean-Michel; Gish, Alexander; Gicquel, Thomas; Richeval, Camille; Wiart, Jean-François; Hennart, Benjamin; Hakim, Florian; Demarly, Christophe; Balgairies, Axelles; Allorge, Delphine",Toxicologie Analytique et Clinique,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352007821000470; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352007821000470,106

The foods rich in polysaccharides with immunomodulation properties are among the most highly rated to be used as immune response modulators. Thus, the use of polysaccharides obtained from food offers an innovative strategy to prevent serious side effects of viral infections. SCOPE AND APPROACH: This review revisits the current studies on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, its characteristics, target cell interactions, and the possibility of using polysaccharides from functional foods as activators of the immune response. Several natural foods are explored for the possibility of being used to obtain polysaccharides with immunomodulatory potential. And finally, we address expectations for the use of polysaccharides in the development of potential therapies and vaccines. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: The negative consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic across the world are unprecedented, thousands of lives lost, increasing inequalities, and incalculable economic losses. On the other hand, great scientific advances have been made regarding the understanding of the disease and forms of treatment. Polysaccharides, due to their characteristics, have the potential to be used as potential drugs with the ability to modulate the immune response. In addition, they can be used safely, as they have no toxic effects, are biocompatible and biodegradable.

Since then, several studies have found COVID-19 patients with recurrent viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity. METHODS: On May 6, 2021, an exhaustive literature search of the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, Embase, Wan Fang Data, VIP database, Sinomed database, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Research Square was conducted to find describing the laboratory indicators of recurrent and non-recurrent viral PCR positivity in patients with COVID-19. The data were statistically analyzed using STATA version 15.0. RESULTS: In total, 22 studies—comprising 5154 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases—were included in the analyses. Patients with less severe COVID-19 illness (i.e. those clinically classified as mild or common-type) seemed to exhibit recurrent PCR positivity more commonly than patients with more severe illness (i.e. those classified as severe or critical). There were also significant differences between the two groups in terms of the rates of headaches and dizziness, in addition to the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, C reactive protein, interleukin-6, and lactate dehydrogenase. Further, there were variations in the ratio of CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cells on admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION: In comparison to COVID-19 patients with non-recurrent viral PCR positivity, patients with recurrent virus PCR positivity seem to experience more severe immune function suppression upon hospital admission.","Ren, Xingxiang; Wang, Xiankun; Ge, Ziruo; Cui, Shuping; Chen, Zhihai",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162269/; https://doi.org/10.1177/20587384211027679,106

Using SARS coronavirus, we now show that coronaviruses uniquely encode a second RdRp residing in nsp8. This protein strongly prefers the internal 5′-(G/U)CC-3′ trinucleotides on RNA templates to initiate the synthesis of complementary oligonucleotides of <6 residues in a reaction whose fidelity is relatively low. Distant structural homology between the C-terminal domain of nsp8 and the catalytic palm subdomain of RdRps of RNA viruses suggests a common origin of the two coronavirus RdRps, which however may have evolved different sets of catalytic residues. A parallel between the nsp8 RdRp and cellular DNA-dependent RNA primases is drawn to propose that the nsp8 RdRp produces primers utilized by the primer-dependent nsp12 RdRp.","Imbert, Isabelle; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Bourhis, Jean-Marie; Bussetta, Cécile; Coutard, Bruno; Egloff, Marie-Pierre; Ferron, François; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Canard, Bruno",The EMBO Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17024178/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1618104?pdf=render,106

646529,Microsimulation based quantitative analysis of COVID-19 management strategies,2021-06-25,"Contamination of contact surfaces with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as a potential route for the transmission of COVID-19. This could be a major issue in developing countries where access to basic sanitation is poor, leading to the sharing of toilet facilities. In this study, we report SARS-CoV-2 contamination of key contact surfaces in shared toilets and the probabilistic risks of COVID-19 infections based on detection and quantification of the nucleic acid on the surfaces. We observed that 54–69% of the contact surfaces were contaminated, with SARS-CoV-2 loads ranging from 28.1 to 132.7 gene copies per cm(2). Toilet seats had the highest contamination, which could be attributed to shedding of the virus in feces and urine. We observed a significant reduction in viral loads on the contaminated surfaces after cleaning, showing the potential of effective cleaning on the reduction of contamination. The pattern of contamination indicates that the most contaminated surfaces are those that are either commonly touched by users of the shared toilets or easily contaminated with feces and urine. These surfaces were the toilet seats, cistern handles and tap handles. The likelihood (probability) of infection with COVID-19 on these surfaces was highest on the toilet seat (1.76 × 10(−4)(1.58 × 10(−6))) for one time use of the toilet. These findings highlight the potential risks for COVID-19 infections in the event that intact infectious viral particles are deposited on these contact surfaces. Therefore, this study shows that shared toilet facilities in densely populated areas could lead to an increase in risks of COVID-19 infections. This calls for the implementation of risk reduction measures, such as regular washing of hands with soap, strict adherence to wearing face masks, and effective and regular cleaning of shared facilities.","Amoah, Isaac Dennis; Pillay, Leanne; Deepnarian, Nashia; Awolusi, Oluyemi; Pillay, Kriveshin; Ramlal, Preshod; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113807; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143846392100122X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265632/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S143846392100122X,106

646584,Monitoring and forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, especially among non-affluent communities. In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. METHODS: Patients younger than 3 years of age admitted to a tertiary hospital in Brazil during the months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses had samples collected from nasopharyngeal aspiration. These samples were tested for 13 different respiratory viruses through real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Patients were followed during hospitalization, and clinical data and population characteristics were collected during that period and at discharge to evaluate severity markers, especially length of hospital stay and oxygen use. Univariate regression analyses identified potential risk factors and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the impact of specific viral detections as well as viral co-detections in relation to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We analyzed 260 episodes of LRTI with a viral detection rate of 85% (n = 222). Co-detection was observed in 65% of all virus-positive episodes. The most prevalent virus was Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (54%), followed by Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) (32%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (21%). In the multivariate models, infants with co-detection of HRV + RSV stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004), when compared to infants without the co-detection. The same trends were observed for the outcome of days of supplemental oxygen use. CONCLUSIONS: Although RSV remains as the main cause of LRTI in infants our study indicates an increase in the length of hospital stay and oxygen use in infants with HRV detected by RT-PCR compared to those without HRV. Moreover, one can speculate that when HRV is detected simultaneously with RSV there is an additive effect that may be reflected in more severe clinical outcome. Also, our study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov), and this is a novel finding for poor communities from developing countries.","da Silva, Emerson Rodrigues; Pitrez, Márcio Condessa Paulo; Arruda, Eurico; Mattiello, Rita; Sarria, Edgar E; de Paula, Flávia Escremim; Proença-Modena, José Luis; Delcaro, Luana Sella; Cintra, Otávio; Jones, Marcus H; Ribeiro, José Dirceu; Stein, Renato T",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-41; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351117/,106
647079,"Chinese Public Attitudes towards, and Knowledge of, Animal Welfare",2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases. To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. METHODS: We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. FINDINGS: In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286–873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4% decrease, 61·5–68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1–392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8–128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2% decrease, 63·5–70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4% decrease, 27·2–37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4% decrease, 0·0–24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3% decrease, 6·1–6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4%, 6·8–9·2). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

647142,Rationale for universal face masks in public against COVID‐19,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Mortality from COVID-19 shows a strong relationship with age and pre-existing medical conditions, as does mortality from other causes. We aimed to investigate how specific factors are differentially associated with COVID-19 mortality as compared to mortality from causes other than COVID-19. METHODS: Working on behalf of NHS England, we carried out a cohort study within the OpenSAFELY platform. Primary care data from England were linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged ≥18 years) in the database on 1(st) February 2020 and with >1 year of continuous prior registration; the cut-off date for deaths was 9(th) November 2020. Associations between individual-level characteristics and COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths, classified according to the presence of a COVID-19 code as the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, were estimated by fitting age- and sex-adjusted logistic models for these two outcomes. FINDINGS: 17,456,515 individuals were included. 17,063 died from COVID-19 and 134,316 from other causes. Most factors associated with COVID-19 death were similarly associated with non-COVID death, but the magnitudes of association differed. Older age was more strongly associated with COVID-19 death than non-COVID death (e.g. ORs 40.7 [95% CI 37.7-43.8] and 29.6 [28.9-30.3] respectively for ≥80 vs 50-59 years), as was male sex, deprivation, obesity, and some comorbidities. Smoking, history of cancer and chronic liver disease had stronger associations with non-COVID than COVID-19 death. All non-white ethnic groups had higher odds than white of COVID-19 death (OR for Black: 2.20 [1.96-2.47], South Asian: 2.33 [2.16-2.52]), but lower odds than white of non-COVID death (Black: 0.88 [0.83-0.94], South Asian: 0.78 [0.75-0.81]). INTERPRETATION: Similar associations of most individual-level factors with COVID-19 and non-COVID death suggest that COVID-19 largely multiplies existing risks faced by patients, with some notable exceptions. Identifying the unique factors contributing to the excess COVID-19 mortality risk among non-white groups is a priority to inform efforts to reduce deaths from COVID-19.

The investigations conducted in this study are of fundamental importance to industrial and biological applications in which heat generation minimization is important, such as in heat exchangers, in lubrication, and in internal medicine. Specifically, the comparative investigations central to this study are conducted on four types of fluids, namely; Newtonian fluids, generalized Newtonian fluids, viscoelastic fluids, and generalized viscoelastic fluids. The Oldroyd-B constitutive model is used for the viscoelastic fluids and a Carreau viscosity constitutive model is used to describe the viscosity shear-rate dependence of the generalized fluids. Efficient semi-implicit finite difference methods are employed to obtain the numerical solutions to the governing systems of equations. The computational methodologies are implemented in the MATLAB software. The sensitivity of the fluid temperature and the polymer stresses to increases in shear-thinning characteristics as well as to increases in polymeric properties is investigated. In general, it is observed that, at comparative parameter values, the viscoelastic fluids give the best resistance to temperature increases, followed by the generalized viscoelastic fluids, followed in turn by the Newtonian fluids, and with the generalized Newtonian fluids recording the highest temperature increases.","Chinyoka, Tiri",Int J Appl Comput Math,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40819-021-01023-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937441/,106

The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. How does this situation affect dreams? Is dreaming during the pandemic related to mental suffering? Does the act of observing dreams help to mitigate mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 210 dream reports (n=67, Pandemic group n=42, plus control group balanced for age, sex and education) either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, following the pandemic announcement by the WHO and quarantine was imposed in Brazil. Post-announcement dreams showed a higher proportion of words related to anger and sadness, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms contamination and cleanness, which tended to increase over time. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). Besides, dream observation was positively self-evaluated and dream similarities to contamination and cleanness revealed different impacts of the dream observation effect. These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.","Mota, N.

Prior studies have not investigated the reliability of different fluorescent tracers for the purpose of studying aerosols and small droplets. Objectives include (1) comparing vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent green dye in terms of particle dispersion pattern, suspension into aerosols and small droplets, and fluorescence in aerosolized form and (2) determining the utility of vitamin B2 as a fluorescent tracer coating the aerodigestive tract mucosa in otolaryngology contamination models. METHODS: Vitamin B2, fluorescein, and a commercial fluorescent dye were aerosolized using a nebulizer and passed through the nasal cavity from the trachea in a retrograde-intubated cadaveric head. In another scenario, vitamin B2 was irrigated to coat the nasal cavity and nasopharyngeal mucosa of a cadaveric head for assessment of aerosol and droplet generation from endonasal drilling. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets ≤14.1 µm based on average aerodynamic diameter, and the collection chambers were visualized under UV light. RESULTS: When vitamin B2 was nebulized, aerosols ≤5.4 µm were generated and the collected particles were fluorescent. When fluorescein and the commercial water tracer dye were nebulized, aerosols ≤8.61 µm and ≤2.08 µm respectively were generated, but the collected aerosols did not appear visibly fluorescent. Endonasal drilling in the nasopharynx coated with vitamin B2 irrigation yielded aerosols ≤3.30 µm that were fluorescent under UV light. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B2’s reliability as a fluorescent tracer when suspended in aerosols and small droplets ≤14.1 µm and known mucosal safety profile make it an ideal compound compared to fluorescein and commercial water-based fluorescent dyes for use as a safe fluorescent tracer in healthcare contamination models especially with human subjects.","Sim, Edward S.; Dharmarajan, Harish; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Goyal, Lindsey; Weinstock, Michael; Whelan, Rachel; Freiser, Monika E.; Corcoran, Timothy E.; Jabbour, Noel; Wang, Eric; Chi, David H.",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795090/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0003489420949588,106

Accurate and timely diagnoses are crucial for the control of influenza disease. We developed a localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence fiber-optic biosensor (LSPCF-FOB) which combines a sandwich immunoassay with the LSP technique using antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of S-OIVs. The detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB for recombinant S-OIV H1 protein detection was estimated at 13.9 pg/mL, which is 10(3)-fold better than that of conventional capture ELISA when using the same capture antibodies. For clinical S-OIV isolates measurement, meanwhile, the detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB platform was calculated to be 8.25 × 10(4) copies/mL, compared with 2.06 × 10(6) copies/mL using conventional capture ELISA. Furthermore, in comparison with the influenza A/B rapid test, the detection limit of the LSPCF-FOB for S-OIV was almost 50-fold in PBS solution and 25-fold lower in mimic solution, which used nasal mucosa from healthy donors as the diluent. The findings of this study therefore indicate that the high detection sensitivity and specificity of the LSPCF-FOB make it a potentially effective diagnostic tool for clinical S-OIV infection and this technique has the potential to be applied to the development of other clinical microbe detection platforms.","Chang, Ying-Feng; Wang, Sheng-Fan; Huang, Jason C.; Su, Li-Chen; Yao, Ling; Li, Ying-Chang; Wu, Suh-Chin; Chen, Yi-Ming A.; Hsieh, Jo-Ping; Chou, Chien",Biosens Bioelectron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2010.08.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20855191/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566310005762; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566310005762,106

Despite an unprecedented focus of scientific investigation, there is a paucity of evidence-based pharmacotherapies against this disease. Because of this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged. Observed hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 has created debate within the critical care community on the therapeutic utility of heparin. We seek to provide an overview of the data supporting the therapeutic use of heparin, both unfractionated and low molecular weight, as an anticoagulant for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we review preclinical evidence establishing biological plausibility for heparin and synthetic heparin-like drugs as therapies for COVID-19 through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we discuss known adverse effects and theoretical off-target effects that may temper enthusiasm for the adoption of heparin as a therapy in COVID-19 without confirmatory prospective randomized controlled trials. Despite previous failures of anticoagulants in critical illness, plausibility of heparin for COVID-19 is sufficiently robust to justify urgent randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of this therapy.","Hippensteel, Joseph A.; LaRiviere, Wells B.; Colbert, James F.; Langouët-Astrié, Christophe J.; Schmidt, Eric P.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32519894/; https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00199.2020,106

We found that the early outbreak in LA, as in other international air travel hubs, was seeded by multiple introductions of strains from Asia and Europe. We identified a US-specific strain, B.1.43, which has been found predominantly in California and Washington State. While samples from LA County carry the ancestral B.1.43 genome, viral genomes from neighbouring counties in California and from counties in Washington State carry additional mutations, suggesting a potential origin of B.1.43 in Southern California. We quantified the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 over time, and found evidence that the public health measures put in place in LA County to control the virus were effective at preventing transmission, but may have been undermined by the many introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the region.

Coagulation plays a pivotal role in the normal response to pathogens (immunothrombosis), thus the evolution toward sepsis-induced coagulopathy could be individuate through coagulation/fibrinolysis-related biomarkers. We focused on the role of D-dimer assessed within 24 h after admission in predicting clinical outcomes in a cohort of 270 patients hospitalized in a 79 months period for meningitis and/or bloodstream infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 162) or Neisseria meningitidis (n = 108). Comparisons were performed with unpaired t-test, Mann-Whitney-test or chi-squared-test with continuity correction, as appropriate, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with Bayesian model averaging. In-hospital mortality was 14.8% for the overall population, significantly higher in S. pneumoniae than in N. meningitidis patients: 19.1 vs. 8.3%, respectively (p = 0.014). At univariable logistic regression analysis the following variables were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality: pneumococcal etiology, female sex, age, ICU admission, SOFA score, septic shock, MODS, and D-dimer levels. At multivariable analysis D-dimer showed an effect only in N. meningitidis subgroup: as 500 ng/mL of D-dimer increased, the probability of unfavorable outcome increased on average by 4%. Median D-dimer was significantly higher in N. meningitidis than in S. pneumoniae patients (1,314 vs. 1,055 ng/mL, p = 0.009). For N. meningitidis in-hospital mortality was 0% for D-dimer <500 ng/mL, very low (3.5%) for D-dimer <7,000 ng/mL, and increased to 26.1% for D-dimer >7,000 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier analysis of in-hospital mortality showed for N. meningitidis infections a statistically significant difference for D-dimer >7,000 ng/mL compared to values <500 ng/mL (p = 0.021) and 500–3,000 ng/mL (p = 0.002).

In conclusion, D-dimer is rapid to be obtained, at low cost and available everywhere, and can help stratify the risk of in-hospital mortality and complications in patients with invasive infections due to N. meningitidis: D-dimer <500 ng/mL excludes any further complications, and a cut-off of 7,000 ng/mL seems able to predict a significantly increased mortality risk from much <10% to over 25%.","Meini, Simone; Sozio, Emanuela; Bertolino, Giacomo; Sbrana, Francesco; Ripoli, Andrea; Pallotto, Carlo; Viaggi, Bruno; Andreini, Roberto; Attanasio, Vittorio; Rescigno, Carolina; Atripaldi, Luigi; Leonardi, Silvia; Bernardo, Mariano; Tascini, Carlo",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937280/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.627830,106

The strict lockdown strategy prompted by the Italian government, to hamper severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) spreading, has reduced the possibility of performing either outdoor or gym physical activity (PA). This study investigated and quantified the reduction of PA in patients with automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for primary prevention of sudden death. METHODS: Daily PA of 24 patients was estimated by processing recorded data from ICD-embedded accelerometric sensors used by the rate-responsive pacing systems. RESULTS: During the forced 40-d in-home confinement, a mean 25% reduction of PA was observed as compared with the 40-d confinement-free period (1.2 ± 0.3 vs 1.6 ± 0.5 hr/d, respectively, P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: This objective quantification of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA determined by an ICD device showed an abrupt and statistically significant reduction of PA in primary prevention ICD patients, during the in-home confinement quarantine. To counteract the deleterious effects of physical inactivity during the COVID-19 outbreak, patients should be encouraged to perform indoor exercise-based personalized rehabilitative programs.","Sassone, Biagio; Mandini, Simona; Grazzi, Giovanni; Mazzoni, Gianni; Myers, Jonathan; Pasanisi, Giovanni",J Cardiopulm Rehabil Prev,https://doi.org/10.1097/hcr.0000000000000539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804796/,106

We exploited the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic-reference population to map genetic modifiers that affect the severity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection. Screening for P. aeruginosa respiratory infection in a cohort of 39 CC lines exhibits distinct disease phenotypes ranging from complete resistance to lethal disease. Based on major changes in the survival times, a quantitative-trait locus (QTL) was mapped on murine chromosome 3 to the genomic interval of Mb 110.4 to 120.5. Within this locus, composed of 31 protein-coding genes, two candidate genes, namely, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (Dpyd) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1pr1), were identified according to the level of genome-wide significance and disease gene prioritization. Functional validation of the S1pr1 gene by pharmacological targeting in C57BL/6NCrl mice confirmed its relevance in P. aeruginosa pathophysiology. However, in a cohort of Canadian patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) disease, regional genetic-association analysis of the syntenic human locus on chromosome 1 (Mb 97.0 to 105.0) identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10875080 and rs11582736) annotated to the Dpyd gene that were significantly associated with age at first P. aeruginosa infection. Thus, there is evidence that both genes might be implicated in this disease. Our results demonstrate that the discovery of murine modifier loci may generate information that is relevant to human disease progression.","Lorè, Nicola Ivan; Sipione, Barbara; He, Gengming; Strug, Lisa J.; Atamni, Hanifa J.; Dorman, Alexandra; Mott, Richard; Iraqi, Fuad A.; Bragonzi, Alessandra",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32127447/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00097-20,106

A more rapid and high-throughput method is essential. METHODS: We analyzed clinical data and nasopharyngeal samples, collected during September 2020, from patients attended at the emergency department of a secondary hospital and in two primary healthcare centers in Madrid. The performance of the Panbio™ COVID-19 AG Rapid Test Device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was compared to RT-qPCR. RESULTS: 255 nasopharyngeal swabs, including 150 from the emergency department and 105 from primary helthcare centers, were tested. 184 patients were symptomatic (72.1 %). Amongst the 60 positive RT-qPCR samples, 40 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 73.3 %. All the samples detected positive with the rapid antigen test were also positive with RT-qPCR. The median cycle threshold was 23.28 (IQR 18.5–30.16). Patients with less than seven days onset of symptoms showed a higher viral load, and sensitivity for rapid antigen test (86.5 %), compared to those with more days (sensitivity of 53.8 %)(p < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The rapid antigen test evaluated in this study showed a high sensitivity and specificity in samples obtained during the first week of symptoms and with high viral loads.

656805,Risks of emergency use authorizations for medical products during outbreak situations: a COVID-19 case study,2020-10-02,"The spatial accessibility of prehospital EMS is particularly important for the elderly population’s physiological functions. Due to the recent expansion of aging populations all over the globe, elderly people’s spatial accessibility to prehospital EMS presents a serious challenge. An efficient strategy to address this issue involves using geographic information systems (GIS)-based tools to evaluate the spatial accessibility in conjunction with the spatial distribution of aging people, available road networks, and prehospital EMS facilities. This study employed gravity model and empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) interpolation analysis to evaluate the elderly’s spatial access to prehospital EMS in Ningbo, China. In our study, we aimed to solve the following specific research questions: In the study area, “what are the characteristics of the prehospital EMS demand of the elderly?” “Do the elderly have equal and convenient spatial access to prehospital EMS?” and “How can we satisfy the prehospital EMS demand of an aging population, improve their spatial access to prehospital EMS, and then ensure their quality of life?” The results showed that 37.44% of patients admitted to prehospital EMS in 2020 were 65 years and older. The rate of utilization of ambulance services by the elderly was 27.39 per 1000 elderly residents. Ambulance use by the elderly was the highest in the winter months and the lowest in the spring months (25.90% vs. 22.38%). As for the disease spectrum, the main disease was found to be trauma and intoxication (23.70%). The mean accessibility score was only 1.43 and nearly 70% of demand points had scored lower than 1. The elderly’s spatial accessibility to prehospital EMS had a central-outward gradient decreasing trend from the central region to the southeast and southwest of the study area. Our proposed methodology and its spatial equilibrium results could be taken as a benchmark of prehospital care capacity and help inform authorities’ efforts to develop efficient, aging-focused spatial accessibility plans.","Zhu, Huanhuan; Pan, Lin; Li, Yiji; Jin, Huiming; Wang, Qian; Liu, Xin; Wang, Cong; Liao, Peng; Jiang, Xinyang; Li, Luo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18199964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639264/,106

Both clinical conditions occur with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review aims to recognize the novel association of IgAN and IgAV with COVID-19 and describe its underlying pathogenesis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search and data extraction from PubMed, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Our search identified 13 cases reporting IgAV and IgAN associated with COVID-19 infection and 4 cases of IgAN following COVID-19 vaccination. The mean, mode, and median ages of patients were 23.8, 4, and 8 years, respectively. Most cases associated with COVID-19 infection were reported in males (77%). Rash and purpura (85%) were the most common clinical features, followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (62%). In symptomatic cases, skin or renal biopsy and immunofluorescence confirmed the diagnosis of IgAN or IgAV. Most patients were treated with steroids and reported recovery or improvement; however, death was reported in two patients. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of scientific evidence on the pathogenesis of the association of IgAN and IgAV with COVID-19, which thus needs further study. Current research suggests the role of IgA-mediated immune response, evidenced by early seroconversion to IgA in COVID-19 patients and the role of IgA in immune hyperactivation as the predominant mediator of the disease process. Clinicians, especially nephrologists and paediatricians, need to recognize this association, as this disease is usually self-limited and can lead to complete recovery if prompt diagnosis and treatment are provided.","Farooq, Hareem; Aemaz Ur Rehman, Muhammad; Asmar, Abyaz; Asif, Salman; Mushtaq, Aliza; Qureshi, Muhammad Ahmad",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602936/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361221001815; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.08.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361221001815,106

The concept of macrophage phenotypic heterogeneity has been investigated since the 1980s, and more recent studies have identified a diverse spectrum of phenotypic subpopulations. Several types of macrophages play a central role in the response to infectious agents and, along with other components of the immune system, determine the clinical outcome of major infectious diseases. Here, we review the functions of various macrophage phenotypic subpopulations, the concept of macrophage polarization, and the influence of these cells on the evolution of infections. In addition, we emphasize their role in the immune response in vivo and in situ, as well as the molecular effectors and signaling mechanisms used by these cells. Furthermore, we highlight the mechanisms of immune evasion triggered by infectious agents to counter the actions of macrophages and their consequences. Our aim here is to provide an overview of the role of macrophages in the pathogenesis of critical transmissible diseases and discuss how elucidation of this relationship could enhance our understanding of the host–pathogen association in organ-specific immune responses.","de Sousa, Jorge Rodrigues; Da Costa Vasconcelos, Pedro Fernando; Quaresma, Juarez Antonio Simões",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s208576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686866/,106

This anti-body-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection is dependent on mouse MAb subclass, and MAb of IgG2a subclass has a strong ADE activity. Furthermore, MAb showing strong neutralizing activity in Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells and Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells shows strong enhancing activity in feline macrophages, indicating that the neutralizing epitope and the enhancing epitope are closely related. In this study, we prepared MAb FK50-4 that showed a strong neutralizing activity in feline macrophages, despite the fact that the MAb belonged to the IgG2a subclass. However, MAb FK50-4 did not exhibit neutralizing activity in CrFK cells or fcwf-4 cells, thus showing a very unusual property. MAb FK50-4 recognized FIPV small integral membrane glycoprotein (M protein). Even when feline macrophages were pretreated with MAb FK50-4 prior to FIPV inoculation, this antibody prevented FIPV infection. This reaction disappeared after treatment of FK50-4 with protein A. The neutralizing activity of FK50-4 was also effective on feline macrophages after the cells were inoculated with FIPV. These findings indicated that the FIPV replication mechanism differs between feline macrophages and CrFK/fcwf-4 cells and that a neutralizing epitope that can prevent FIPV infection of feline macrophages after viral absorption is present on M protein.","Kida, K.; Hohdatsu, T.; Kashimoto-Tokunaga, J.; Koyama, H.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10664402/,106

Still, there is no specific drug to prevent or treat this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease. Thus, the screening for a potential remedy presents a global challenge for scientists. Up to date over a hundred crystallographic structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) have been deposited to Protein Data Bank. With many known proteins, the demand for a reliable target has become higher than ever, so as the choice of an efficient computational methods. Therefore, in this study comparative methods have been used for receptor-based virtual screening, targeting 9 selected structures of viral M(pro). Reliability analyses followed by re-docking of the specific co-crystallized ligand provided the best reproductivity for structures with PDB ID 6LU7, 6Y2G and 6Y2F. The influence of crystallographic water on an outcome of a virtual screening against selected targets was also investigated. Once the most reliable targets were selected, the library of easy purchasable natural compounds were retrieved from the MolPort database (10,305 compounds) and docked against the selected M(pro) proteins. To ensure the efficiency of the selected compounds, binding energies for top-15 hit ligands were calculated using Molecular Mechanics as well as their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties were predicted. Based on predicted binding energies and toxicities, top-5 compounds were selected and subjected to Molecular Dynamics simulation and found to be stable in complex to act as possible inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2.

Further research on the policies associated with outcomes other than mortality rates remains warranted. We aimed to determine associations between government public health policies on the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. This ecological study including countries reporting ≥25 daily COVID-related deaths until end May 2020, utilised public data on policy indicators described by the Blavatnik school of Government. Associations between policy indicators and severity of the pandemic (mean mortality rate, time to peak, peak deaths per 100,000, cumulative deaths after peak per 100,000 and ratio of mean slope of the descending curve to mean slope of the ascending curve) were measured using Spearman rank-order tests.

In non-European countries, school closures were associated with mostly good outcomes (r(s) = −0.757, p = 0.049 for mean mortality rate). In high-income countries, health system policies were generally effective, contrasting to low-income countries. Containment policies may be effective in younger populations or in high-income or European countries. Health system policies have been most effective in high-income countries.","Pasdar, Zahra; Pana, Tiberiu A.; Ewers, Kai D.; Szlachetka, Weronika A.; Perdomo-Lampignano, Jesus A.; Gamble, David T.; Bhattacharya, Sohinee; Carter, Ben; Myint, Phyo K.",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574999/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091221,106

It is an emergency the world has never seen before. MAIN TEXT The attention of health systems is mainly focused on COronaVIrus Disease 19 patients and on the risk that intensive care units might be overwhelmed by the serious pulmonary complications. Different countries are also attempting to establish infection prevention and control strategies which proved effective in China where the outbreak was initially reported. We reflect on important lessons to be learnt from different countries. The effects that infection prevention and control strategies, such as social distancing or isolation, can have on the care of millions of patients with non-communicable diseases, who may be indirectly affected, have not been taken into consideration so much. CONCLUSIONS When dealing with COronaVIrus Disease 19, policy makers and healthcare personnel should consider the indirect effects on the treatment of non-communicable diseases.","Modesti, Pietro A; Wang, Jiguang; Damasceno, Albertino; Agyemang, Charles; Van Bortel, Luc; Persu, Alexandre; Zhao, Dong; Jarraya, Faical; Marzotti, Ilaria; Bamoshmoosh, Mohamed; Parati, Gianfranco; Schutte, Aletta E",BMC medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795303/; https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12916-020-01723-6; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01723-6,106

While some applications have so far only been envisioned, others are regularly performed in real-life scenarios. Many more fall in between and are actively investigated by research and commercial communities alike. This study reviews the maturity levels, or “market-readiness”, of public safety applications for UAS. As individual assessments of all applications suggested in the literature are infeasible due to their sheer number, we propose a novel set of application categories: Remote Sensing, Mapping, Monitoring, Human-drone Interaction, Flying Ad-hoc Networks, Transportation, and Counter UAV Systems. Each category’s maturity is assessed through a literature review of contained applications, using the metric of Application Readiness Levels (ARLs). Relevant aspects such as the environmental complexity and available mission time of addressed scenarios are taken into account. Following the analysis, we infer that improvements in autonomy and software reliability are the most promising research areas for increasing the usefulness and acceptance of UAS in the public safety domain.","Stampa, Merlin; Sutorma, Andreas; Jahn, Uwe; Thiem, Jörg; Wolff, Carsten; Röhrig, Christof",J Intell Robot Syst,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10846-021-01462-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456505/,106

METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of a rapid, multipathogen respiratory panel (RP) test vs usual care (control). Patients were eligible if they were ≥12 months old, had symptoms of upper respiratory infection or influenza-like illness, and were not on antibiotics. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription; secondary outcomes included antiviral prescription, disposition, and length of stay (ClinicalTrials.gov# NCT02957136). RESULTS: Of 191 patients enrolled, 93 (49%) received RP testing; 98 (51%) received usual care. Fifty-three (57%) RP and 7 (7%) control patients had a virus detected and reported during the ED visit (P = .0001). Twenty (22%) RP patients and 33 (34%) usual care patients received antibiotics during the ED visit (–12%; 95% confidence interval, –25% to 0.4%; P = .06/0.08); 9 RP patients received antibiotics despite having a virus detected. The magnitude of antibiotic reduction was greater in children (–19%) vs adults (–9%, post hoc analysis). There was no difference in antiviral use, length of stay, or disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid RP testing was associated with a trend toward decreased antibiotic use, suggesting a potential benefit from more rapid viral tests in the ED. Future studies should determine if specific groups are more likely to benefit from testing and evaluate the relative cost and effectiveness of broad testing, focused testing, and a combined diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship approach.","May, Larissa; Tatro, Grant; Poltavskiy, Eduard; Mooso, Benjamin; Hon, Simson; Bang, Heejung; Polage, Christopher",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32128326/,106
665076,Prediction and prevention of the next pandemic zoonosis,2012-12-01,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) is an emerging virus that poses a major challenge to clinical management. The 3C‐like protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for viral replication and thus represents a potential target for antiviral drug development. Presently, very few data are available on MERS‐CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition by small molecules. We conducted extensive exploration of the pharmacophoric space of a recently identified set of peptidomimetic inhibitors of the bat HKU4‐CoV 3CL(pro). HKU4‐CoV 3CL(pro) shares high sequence identity (81%) with the MERS‐CoV enzyme and thus represents a potential surrogate model for anti‐MERS drug discovery. We used 2 well‐established methods: Quantitative structure‐activity relationship (QSAR)‐guided modeling and docking‐based comparative intermolecular contacts analysis. The established pharmacophore models highlight structural features needed for ligand recognition and revealed important binding‐pocket regions involved in 3CL(pro)‐ligand interactions. The best models were used as 3D queries to screen the National Cancer Institute database for novel nonpeptidomimetic 3CL(pro) inhibitors. The identified hits were tested for HKU4‐CoV and MERS‐CoV 3CL(pro) inhibition. Two hits, which share the phenylsulfonamide fragment, showed moderate inhibitory activity against the MERS‐CoV 3CL(pro) and represent a potential starting point for the development of novel anti‐MERS agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pharmacophore modeling study supported by in vitro validation on the MERS‐CoV 3CL(pro). HIGHLIGHTS: MERS‐CoV is an emerging virus that is closely related to the bat HKU4‐CoV. 3CL(pro) is a potential drug target for coronavirus infection. HKU4‐CoV 3CL(pro) is a useful surrogate model for the identification of MERS‐CoV 3CL(pro) enzyme inhibitors. dbCICA is a very robust modeling method for hit identification. The phenylsulfonamide scaffold represents a potential starting point for MERS coronavirus 3CL(pro) inhibitors development.","Abuhammad, Areej; Al‐Aqtash, Rua'a A.; Anson, Brandon J.; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Taha, Mutasem O.",J Mol Recognit,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmr.2644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28608547/,106

In this study, we assessed the characteristics of markers of the liver in patients with COVID-19 to provide new insights in improving clinical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 279 patients who confirmed COVID-19 and the data of liver biomarkers and complete blood count of patients were defined as the day onset when the patients admitted to the hospital. RESULTS: The average of LDH value was 621.29 U/L in all patients with COVID-19, and CPK was 286.90 U/L. The average AST was 44.03 U/L in all patients, and ALT was 31.14 U/L. The AST/ALT ratio was 1.64 in all patients. The measurement of CRP was increased by 79.93% in all patients. Average ALT and AST values of patients with elevated ALT were significantly increased in comparison to patients with normal ALT (P-value = 0.001), while AST/ALT ratio was significantly decreased compared to patients with normal ALT (P-value= 0.014). In addition, the average LDH of patients with elevated ALT was significantly increased compared to patients with normal ALT (P-value = 0.014).

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) could help to enhance the dissemination of evidence-based treatments and considerably reduce the costs. The current study seeks to assess the efficacy of an online psychological intervention for people suffering from gambling problems in Spain. The proposed study will be a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. A total of 134 participants (problem and pathological gamblers) will be randomly allocated to a waiting list control group (N = 67) or an intervention group (N = 67). The intervention program includes 8 modules, and it is based on motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and extensions and innovations of CBT. It includes several complementary tools that are present throughout the entire intervention. Therapeutic support will be provided once a week through a phone call with a maximum length of 10 min. The primary outcome measure will be gambling severity and gambling-related cognitions, and secondary outcome measures will be readiness to change, and gambling self-efficacy. Other variables that will be considered are depression and anxiety symptoms, positive and negative affect, difficulties in emotion regulation strategies, impulsivity, and quality of life. Individuals will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. During the treatment, participants will also respond to a daily Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) in order to evaluate urges to gamble, self-efficacy to cope with gambling urges, gambling urge frequency, and whether gambling behaviour occurs. The EMI includes immediate automatic feedback depending on the participant's responses. Treatment acceptance and satisfaction will also be assessed. The data will be analysed both per protocol and by Intention-to-treat. As far as we know, this is the first randomized controlled trial of an online psychological intervention for gambling disorder in Spain. It will expand our knowledge about treatments delivered via the Internet and contribute to improving treatment dissemination, reaching people suffering from this problem who otherwise would not receive help.

666982,Social interaction layers in complex networks for the dynamical epidemic modeling of COVID-19 in Brazil,2020-11-12,"Influenza A virus (IAV) neuraminidase (NA) receptor-destroying activity and hemagglutinin (HA) receptor-binding affinity need to be balanced with the host receptor repertoire for optimal viral fitness. NAs of avian, but not human viruses, contain a functional 2(nd) sialic acid (SIA)-binding site (2SBS) adjacent to the catalytic site, which contributes to sialidase activity against multivalent substrates. The receptor-binding specificity and potentially crucial contribution of the 2SBS to the HA-NA balance of virus particles is, however, poorly characterized. Here, we elucidated the receptor-binding specificity of the 2SBS of N2 NA and established an important role for this site in the virion HA-NA-receptor balance. NAs of H2N2/1957 pandemic virus with or without a functional 2SBS and viruses containing this NA were analysed. Avian-like N2, with a restored 2SBS due to an amino acid substitution at position 367, was more active than human N2 on multivalent substrates containing α2,3-linked SIAs, corresponding with the pronounced binding-specificity of avian-like N2 for these receptors. When introduced into human viruses, avian-like N2 gave rise to altered plaque morphology and decreased replication compared to human N2. An opposite replication phenotype was observed when N2 was combined with avian-like HA. Specific bio-layer interferometry assays revealed a clear effect of the 2SBS on the dynamic interaction of virus particles with receptors. The absence or presence of a functional 2SBS affected virion-receptor binding and receptor cleavage required for particle movement on a receptor-coated surface and subsequent NA-dependent self-elution. The contribution of the 2SBS to virus-receptor interactions depended on the receptor-binding properties of HA and the identity of the receptors used. We conclude that the 2SBS is an important and underappreciated determinant of the HA-NA-receptor balance. The rapid loss of a functional 2SBS in pandemic viruses may have served to balance the novel host receptor-repertoire and altered receptor-binding properties of the corresponding HA protein.","Du, Wenjuan; Guo, Hongbo; Nijman, Vera S.; Doedt, Jennifer; van der Vries, Erhard; van der Lee, Joline; Li, Zeshi; Boons, Geert-Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

669244,Predictive Capacity of COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate,2021-04-01,"Background: The Swedish Child Healthcare (CHC) system aims to provide equal and fair health care for all children and families in Sweden. Currently in Sweden, the CHC offers every family two home visits during the child's 1st year of life. During 2019, an extended home visit programme, called Grow Safely, was started in the region of Scania for first-time parents. The aim of the extended home visit programme was to provide support for first-time parents in order to improve the overall health of the child and family and contribute to better conditions for equal health. Instead of two home visits during the 1st year, a subsample of first-time parents would receive six visits during the child's first 15 months. These six visits would be conducted by CHC nurses and social workers, midwives, and dental assistants. In the present paper, we describe a research project related to the regional extended home visit programme; the project aims to illuminate the experiences of the participants and to investigate the perceived benefits of the programme in relation to improved health, social and emotional interaction between parent and child, and attitudes toward authorities and surrounding society. Method/Analysis: In order to evaluate the introduction of the intervention, three qualitative interview studies and one quantitative study with follow-up questionnaires will be conducted. Since the research project also comprises studies focusing on the implementation and expectations of politicians, civil servants, organizational managers, and professionals working within the programme, interviews within these fields will be conducted. Discussion: Sweden has a well-established CHC programme, but improvements are always possible. Previous research has shown that home visits are an effective tool to improve both the child's physical and mental health as well as the parents' well-being. However, this kind of intervention involves a significant investment from all organizations involved in the home visits; hence, it is important that the intervention is evaluated. The research project described in the present paper intends to examine the impact of the intervention, and its findings will aid decisionmakers in determining the future of the home visit programme.","Mangrio, Elisabeth; Hellström, Lisa; Nilsson, Eva-Lotta; Ivert, Anna-Karin",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.537468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634063/,106

RNA viruses are frequently targeted by ISGs through recognition of viral replicative intermediates and molecular features associated with viral genomes, or the lack of molecular features associated with host mRNAs. The ISGs reviewed here primarily inhibit viral replication in an RNA-centric manner, working to sense, degrade, or repress expression of viral RNA. This review focuses on dissecting how these ISGs exhibit multiple antiviral mechanisms, often through use of varied co-factors, highlighting the complexity of the type I IFN response. Specifically, these ISGs can mediate antiviral effects through viral RNA degradation, viral translation inhibition, or both. While the OAS/RNase L pathway globally degrades RNA and arrests translation, ISG20 and ZAP employ targeted RNA degradation and translation inhibition to block viral replication. Meanwhile, SHFL targets translation by inhibiting -1 ribosomal frameshifting, which is required by many RNA viruses. Finally, a number of E3 ligases inhibit viral transcription, an attractive antiviral target during the lifecycle of negative-sense RNA viruses which must transcribe their genome prior to translation. Through this review, we aim to provide an updated perspective on how these ISGs work together to form a complex network of antiviral arsenals targeting viral RNA processes.","Yang, Emily; Li, Melody M.

A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were applied to nurses in Porto, Portugal (n=306), Oviedo, Spain (n=269) and S. Paulo, Brazil (n=477). Data analysis was performed using descriptive, inferential and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: approximately 42% of the nurses showed moderate/high levels of burnout, with no differences found between countries (Portugal and Brazil 42%, Spain 43%). Only depersonalization showed differences between countries, presenting Spain the highest level and Portugal the lowest one. Comparative analysis showed higher burnout levels in young nurses and those working by shifts. Considering job schedules, burnout was associated to shift work in Portugal, while in Spain and Brazil it was associated with fixed schedules.

Inhibition of MHV-induced apoptosis by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK promoted virus production late in infection, indicating that apoptosis could be a host response to limit the production of viral progeny. Activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway was indicated by the activation of caspase-9 and delay of apoptosis by Bcl-2 overexpression. Analyses of the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c, procaspase-9, and Apaf-1 suggested an aberrant apoptosome formation in the vicinity of the mitochondria, which could be a cell type-specific event. An increase in the amount of Fas (APO-1/CD95), caspase-8 activation, caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage, and subsequent translocation of truncated Bid to mitochondria, all of which relate to the Fas-mediated pathway, also occurred in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells, whereas the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, a direct indication of the activation of Fas-mediated pathway, was undetectable. Caspase-8 and Bid activation appeared to be downstream of mitochondria, because Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed both events, suggesting that infected 17Cl-1 cells might have activated a receptor-mediated “type II” signaling pathway, in which primary and low levels of receptor-mediated pathway activation lead to the activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway. All our data indicate that a mitochondria-mediated pathway played a major regulatory role in apoptosis in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells.","Chen, Chun-Jen; Makino, Shinji",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202916260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12441076/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202916260,106

Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 was likely originated from bats, but its intermediate hosts are still largely unknown. In this study, we assembled the complete genome of a coronavirus identified in 3 sick Malayan pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that this pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) is genetically related to the SARS-CoV-2 as well as a group of bat coronaviruses but do not support the SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from the pangolin-CoV-2020. Our study suggests that pangolins are natural hosts of Betacoronaviruses. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. In addition to conservation of wildlife, minimizing the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to reduce the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.","Liu, Ping; Jiang, Jing-Zhe; Wan, Xiu-Feng; Hua, Yan; Li, Linmiao; Zhou, Jiabin; Wang, Xiaohu; Hou, Fanghui; Chen, Jing; Zou, Jiejian; Chen, Jinping",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32407364/,106
673810,A fuzzy fractional model of coronavirus (COVID-19) and its study with Legendre spectral method,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND: Patient blood management (PBM) describes a set of evidence-based practices to optimize medical and surgical patient outcomes by clinically managing and preserving a patient’s own blood. This concepts aims to detect and treat anemia, minimize the risk for blood loss and the need for blood replacement for each patient through a coordinated multidisciplinary care process. In combination with blood loss, anemia is the main driver for transfusion and all three are independent risk factors for adverse outcomes including morbidity and mortality. Evidence demonstrates that PBM significantly improves outcomes and safety while reducing cost by macroeconomic magnitudes. Despite its huge potential to improve healthcare systems, PBM is not yet adopted broadly. The aim of this study is to analyze the collective experiences of a diverse group of PBM implementors across countries reflecting different healthcare contexts and to use these experiences to develop a guidance for initiating and orchestrating PBM implementation for stakeholders from diverse professional backgrounds. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 1–4 PBM implementors from 12 countries in Asia, Latin America, Australia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Responses reflecting the drivers, barriers, measures, and stakeholders regarding the implementation of PBM were summarized per country and underwent qualitative content analysis. Clustering the resulting implementation measures by levels of intervention for PBM implementation informed a PBM implementation framework. RESULTS: A set of PBM implementation measures were extracted from the interviews with the implementors. Most of these measures relate to one of six levels of implementation including government, healthcare providers, funding, research, training/education, and patients/public. Essential cross-level measures are multi-stakeholder communication and collaboration. CONCLUSION: The implementation matrix resulting from this research helps to decompose the complexity of PBM implementation into concrete measures on each implementation level. It provides guidance for diverse stakeholders to design, initiate and develop strategies and plans to make PBM a national standard of care, thus closing current practice gaps and matching this unmet public health need.

Two models were created, one for cases and one for deaths, utilizing a scaled Besag, York, Mollié model with Type I spatial‐temporal interaction. Each model accounts for 16 social vulnerability and 7 environmental variables as fixed effects. The spatial pattern between COVID‐19 cases and deaths is significantly different in many ways. The spatiotemporal trend of the pandemic in the United States illustrates a shift out of many of the major metropolitan areas into the United States Southeast and Southwest during the summer months and into the upper Midwest beginning in autumn. Analysis of the major social vulnerability predictors of COVID‐19 infection and death found that counties with higher percentages of those not having a high school diploma, having non‐White status and being Age 65 and over to be significant. Among the environmental variables, above ground level temperature had the strongest effect on relative risk to both cases and deaths. Hot and cold spots, areas of statistically significant high and low COVID‐19 cases and deaths respectively, derived from the convolutional spatial effect show that areas with a high probability of above average relative risk have significantly higher Social Vulnerability Index composite scores. The same analysis utilizing the spatiotemporal interaction term exemplifies a more complex relationship between social vulnerability, environmental measurements, COVID‐19 cases, and COVID‐19 deaths.","Johnson, Daniel P.; Ravi, Niranjan; Braneon, Christian V.",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377879/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gh000423,106

Several vaccines have been approved in different countries for emergency use. In India, two vaccines have been currently approved- COVISHIELD (Serum Institute of India (SII)) which is a recombinant simian adenovirus-based vaccine and COVAXIN (Bharat Biotech) which is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Our current study provides the first post approval safety data on ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 corona virus vaccine (recombinant) use in healthcare workers in northern India (n=804). Around one half of vaccinees developed adverse events at any time post vaccination with majority of reactions being mild to moderate in severity. AEFIs were seen in 40% participants after first dose and around 16% participants after second dose. This observed reactogenicity is much less compared to 60-88% reactogenicity rate observed with Oxford-AstraZenecas ChAdOx1 vaccine in the UK based population. Individually, fever, injection site pain and headache were the commonly observed AEFIs. Overall, the frequency of systemic events of severity grade 3 was only 0.5% and is much less than the reported rates for other recombinant adenoviral vaccines. The rate of serious AEFIs in our study was only 0.1% (n=1). There was a possibility of this AEFI being an immunization stress related response. No deaths were reported in the vaccinees in our study during the study period. Reactogenicity rate was observed to decrease with age and was higher in females. On the basis of interim findings of this safety study, it may be interpreted that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 corona virus vaccine (recombinant) (COVISHIELD, Serum Institute of India) carries a good safety profile overall.","Kaur, U.; Ojha, B.; Pathak, B.

The double valence of workaholism,2020,"Background Data on the prevalence of cancer in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-infected patients and the severe illness incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients with cancers remains unclear. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, from database inception to July 15, 2020, for studies of patients with COVID-19 infection that had available comorbidity information on cancer. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients and the secondary endpoint was the outcomes of COVID-19-infected cancer patients with incidence of severe illness and death rate. We calculated the pooled prevalence and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using a random-effects model, and performed meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on continent, country, age, sample size and study design. Findings A total of 107 eligible global studies were included in the systematic review. 90 studies with 94,845 COVID-19 patients in which 4,106 patients with cancer morbidity were included in the meta-analysis for prevalence of cancer morbidity among COVID-19 patients. 21 studies with 70,969 COVID-19 patients in which 3,351 patients with cancer morbidity who had severe illness or death during the studies. The overall prevalence of cancer among the COVID-19 patients was 0.07 (95% CI 0.05~0.09). The cancer prevalence in COVID-19 patients of Europe (0.22, 95% CI 0.17~0.28) was higher than that in Asia Pacific (0.04, 95% CI 0.03~0.06) and North America (0.05, 95% CI 0.04~0.06). The prevalence of COVID-19-infected cancer patients over 60 years old was 0.10 (95% CI 0.07~0.14), higher than that of patients equal and less than 60 years old (0.05, 95% CI 0.03~0.06). The pooled prevalence of severe illness among COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.35 (95% CI 0.27~0.43) and the pooled death rate of COVID-19 patients with cancers was 0.18 (95% CI 0.14~0.18). The pooled incidence of severe illness of COVID-19 patients with cancers from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.38(0.24, 0.52), 0.36(0.17, 0.55), and 0.26(0.20, 0.31), respectively; and the pooled death rate from Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America were 0.17(0.10, 0.24), 0.26(0.13, 0.39), and 0.19(0.13, 0.25), respectively. Interpretation To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis assessing the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients, severe illness incidence and mortality rate. The prevalence of cancer varied significantly in geographical continents and ages. The COVID-19 patients with cancer were at-risk for severe illness and a high death rate. The European COVID-19 patients had the highest cancer prevalence among the three continents examined and were also the most likely to progress to severe illness and death. Although the Asia Pacific COVID-19 patients had the lowest cancer prevalence, their severe illness rate was similar to that of European.","Kong, Xiangy; Qi, Yihang; Huang, Junjie; Zhao, Yang; Zhan, Yongle; Qin, Xuzhen; Qi, Zhihong; Atanda, Adejare; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Jing; Fang, Yi; Jia, Peng; Golozar, Asieh; Zhang, Lin; Jiang, Yu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.20.20177311; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.20.20177311v1?rss=1,106

However, timely DR detection remains a problem in medically underserved and under-resourced settings in the United States. Machine learning that identifies patients with latent/undiagnosed DR could help to address this problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 40 631 unique diabetic patients seen at Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare facilities between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017, we compared ten machine learning environments, including five classifier models, for assessing the presence or absence of DR. We also used data from a distinct set of 9300 diabetic patients seen between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018 as an external validation set. RESULTS: Following feature subset selection, the classifier with the best AUC on the external validation set was a deep neural network using majority class undersampling, with an AUC of 0.8, the sensitivity of 72.17%, and specificity of 74.2%. DISCUSSION: A deep neural network produced the best AUCs and sensitivity results on the test set and external validation set. Models are intended to be used to screen guideline noncompliant diabetic patients in an urban safety-net setting.

In addition, various volumes of a solution (0.125 M sucrose plus Amaranth dye) were fed to 3-d-old adult female house flies to quantify the crop contraction rate as affected by crop volume. As crop volume increased, the contraction rate increased until it reached a peak at 2 μl, after which it declined. It is hypothesized that the high contraction rate of the crop, which in house fly is almost twice the rate of three other fly species, is one of the factors that makes house fly an excellent vector.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology when authors worked as medical team members for treating COVID-19. COVID-19 patients with pulse oxygen saturation/fraction of inspiration oxygen (SpO2/FiO2, S/F) ratio < 235, managed by medical teams [using S/F ratio instead of oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) to diagnose ARDS] from February to April 2020 were included. The patients were divided into NIPPV group and HFNC group according to their oxygen therapy modes. Clinical data of patients were collected, including general characteristics, respiratory rate (RR), fraction of FiO2, SpO2, heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), S/F ratio in the first 72 hours, lymphocyte count (LYM), percentage of lymphocyte (LYM%) and white blood cell count (WBC) at admission and discharge or death, the duration of dyspnea before NIPPV and HFNC, and the length from onset to admission. The differences of intubation rate, all-cause mortality, S/F ratio and RR were analyzed, and single factor analysis and generalized estimation equation (GEE) were used to analyze the risk factors affecting S/F ratio. RESULTS: Among the 41 patients, the proportion of males was high (68.3%, 28 cases), the median age was 68 (58-74) years old, 28 cases had complications (68.3%), and 34 cases had multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS, 82.9%). Compared with HFNC group, the proportion of complications in NIPPV group was higher [87.5% (21/24) vs. 41.2% (7/17), P < 0.05], and the value of LYM% was lower [5.3% (3.4%-7.8%) vs. 10.0% (3.9%-19.7%), P < 0.05], the need of blood purification was also significantly lower [0% (0/24) vs. 29.4% (5/17), P < 0.05]. The S/F ratio of NIPPV group gradually increased after 2 hours treatment and RR gradually decreased with over time, S/F ratio decreased and RR increased in HFNC group compared with baseline, but there was no significant difference in S/F ratio between the two groups at each time point. RR in NIPPV group was significantly higher than that in HFNC group after 2 hours treatment [time/min: 30 (27-33) vs. 24 (21-27), P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in rate need intubation and hospital mortality between NIPPV group and HFNC group [66.7% (16/24) vs. 70.6% (12/17), 58.3% (14/24) vs. 52.9% (9/17), both P > 0.05]. Analysis of the factors affecting the S/Fratio in the course of oxygen therapy showed that the oxygen therapy mode and the course of illness at admission were the factors affecting the S/F ratio of patients [ßvalues were -15.827, 1.202, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were -29.102 to -2.552 and 0.247-2.156, P values were 0.019 and 0.014, respectively].

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been implicated in NVRI in hospitalized preterm neonates. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of HCoV-related NVRI in neonates and children hospitalized in a PNICU and the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections in staff. All neonates (age≤28 days) and children (age>28 days) hospitalized between November 1997 and April 1998 were included. Nasal samples were obtained by cytological brush at admission and weekly thereafter. Nasal samples were taken monthly from staff. Virological studies were performed, using indirect immunofluorescence, for HCoV strains 229E and OC43, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, paramyxoviruses types 1, 2 and 3 and adenovirus. A total of 120 patients were enrolled (64 neonates and 56 children). Twenty-two samples from 20 patients were positive (incidence 16.7%). In neonates, seven positive samples, all for HCoV, were detected (incidence 11%). Risk factors for NVRI in neonates were: duration of hospitalization, antibiotic treatment and duration of parenteral nutrition (P<0.01). Monthly prevalence of viral infections in staff was between 0% and 10.5%, mainly with HCoV. In children, 15 samples were positive in 13 children at admission (seven RSV, five influenza and three adenovirus) but no NVRI were observed. In spite of a high rate of community-acquired infection in hospitalized children, the incidence of NVRI with common respiratory viruses appears low in neonates, HCoV being the most important pathogen of NRVI in neonates during this study period. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term impact on pulmonary function.","Gagneur, A.; Sizun, J.; Vallet, S.; Legr, M. C.; Picard, B.; Talbot, P.

679097,Evaluation and discussion of handmade face-masks and commercial diving-equipment as personal protection in pandemic scenarios,2020-08-19,"A hallmark of complex humanitarian emergencies is the collective exposure, often over extended periods of time, to political violence in the forms of war, terrorism, political intimidation, repression, unlawful detention, and forced displacement. Populations in complex humanitarian emergencies have higher risks of multiple co-morbidities: mental disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and chronic non-communicable physical diseases. However, there is wide variation in the health impacts of both across and within humanitarian emergencies. Syndemic theory is an approach to conceptualizing multiple morbidities and social determinants to understand differential patterns of multimorbidity, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and better design interventions. Syndemic theory, if applied to complex humanitarian emergencies, has the potential to uncover origins of localized patterns of multi-morbidity resulting from political violence and historical inequities. In this paper, we present two case studies based on mixed-methods research to illustrate how syndemic models can be applied in complex humanitarian emergencies. First, in a Nepal case study, we explore different patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression co-morbidity among female former child soldiers returning home after war. Despite comparable exposure to war-related traumas, girl soldiers in high-caste Hindu communities had 63% co-morbidity of PTSD and depression, whereas girl soldiers in communities with mixed castes and religions, had 8% PTSD prevalence, but no cases of PTSD and depression co-morbidity. In the second case study, we explore the high rates of type 2 diabetes during a spike in political violence and population displacement. Despite low rates of obesity and other common risk factors, Somalis in Ethiopia experienced rising cases of and poor outcomes from type-2 diabetes. Political violence shapes healthcare resources, diets, and potentially, this epidemiological anomaly. Based on these case studies we propose a humanitarian syndemic research agenda for observational and intervention studies, with the central focus being that public health efforts need to target violence prevention at family, community, national, and global levels.","Brandon A, Kohrt; Lauren, Carruth",Soc Sci Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953620305979; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620305979?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051023/,106

We conducted a case-control study with 211 cases and 839 non-matched controls using all contact tracing records of Thailand's national Surveillance and Rapid Response Team. Cases were asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients identified between 1 and 31 March 2020 who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 April 2020; controls were asymptomatic contacts who were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Participants were queried about practices during contact periods with a case. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for associations between diagnosis of COVID-19 and covariates using multivariable logistic regression models. Wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not wearing masks (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.60), while sometimes wearing masks during contact was not (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41-1.84).

Both virus and host-derived microRNA (miRNA) play essential roles in the pathology of virus infection. This study aims to uncover the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity from the perspective of miRNA. We scanned the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNA genes and miRNA targets and conducted in vivo experiments to validate the virus-encoded miRNAs and their regulatory role on the putative targets. One of such virus-encoded miRNAs, MR147-3p, was overexpressed that resulted in significantly decreased transcript levels of all of the predicted targets in human,i.e., EXOC7, RAD9A, and TFE3 in the virus-infected cells. The analysis showed that the immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Additionally, the genomic mutation of SARS-CoV-2 contributed to the changed miRNA repository and targets, suggesting a possible role of miRNAs in the attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 during its evolution. This study provided a comprehensive view of the miRNA-involved regulatory system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating possible antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 through intervening miRNA regulation.","Liu, Zhi; Wang, Jianwei; Ge, Yiyue; Xu, Yuyu; Guo, Mengchen; Mi, Kai; Xu, Rui; Pei, Yang; Zhang, Qiankun; Luan, Xiaoting; Hu, Zhibin; Chi, Ying; Liu, Xingyin",J Biomed Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963094/; https://doi.org/10.7555/jbr.35.20200154,106

To date, however, the evaluation of PRV virulence has largely depended on the limited numbers of clinical cases owing to the lack of animal models. To develop an in vivo model of PRV infection, an inbred C3H mouse strain was infected intranasally with pathogenic PRV strain Miyazaki-Bali/2007. C3H mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection. Infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration. Following repeated intranasal infection, mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of PRV. The results of these immunological assays will help to develop laboratory protocols for sero-epidemiological studies. Our small rodent model of lethal respiratory infection will further allow investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the high pathogenicity of PRV.","Kanai, Yuta; Kawagishi, Takahiro; Okamoto, Minoru; Sakai, Yusuke; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Kobayashi, Takeshi",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.10.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217303720; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29128757/,106

Whereas virus taxonomy has been a niche subspecialty over many decades, the field has recently gained importance due to the exponentially increasing number of new viruses discovered by next-generation sequencing methods. The expanded known global virome and associated viral genome sequence space gradually morph virus taxonomy from a phenotype-based and inherently subjective process, focussing on shared or distinct, often arbitrarily chosen biophysical characteristics of virions to a significant subspecialty of systematic evolutionary biology.

682982,Dual Attention Multiple Instance Learning with Unsupervised Complementary Loss for COVID-19 Screening,2020-09-18,"Immunization with recombinant glycoprotein-based vaccines is a promising approach to induce protective immunity against viruses. However, the complex biosynthetic maturation requirements of these glycoproteins typically necessitate their production in mammalian cells to support their folding and post-translational modification. Despite these clear advantages, the incumbent costs and infrastructure requirements with this approach can be prohibitive in developing countries, and the production scales and timelines may prove limiting when applying these production systems to the control of pandemic viral outbreaks. Plant molecular farming of viral glycoproteins has been suggested as a cheap and rapidly scalable alternative production system, with the potential to perform post-translational modifications that are comparable to mammalian cells. Consequently, plant-produced glycoprotein vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza have shown promise in clinical trials, and vaccine candidates against the newly emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have entered into late stage preclinical and clinical testing. However, many other viral glycoproteins accumulate poorly in plants, and are not appropriately processed along the secretory pathway due to differences in the host cellular machinery. Furthermore, plant-derived glycoproteins often contain glycoforms that are antigenically distinct from those present on the native virus, and may also be under-glycosylated in some instances. Recent advances in the field have increased the complexity and yields of biologics that can be produced in plants, and have now enabled the expression of many viral glycoproteins which could not previously be produced in plant systems. In contrast to the empirical optimization that predominated during the early years of molecular farming, the next generation of plant-made products are being produced by developing rational, tailor-made approaches to support their production. This has involved the elimination of plant-specific glycoforms and the introduction into plants of elements of the biosynthetic machinery from different expression hosts. These approaches have resulted in the production of mammalian N-linked glycans and the formation of O-glycan moieties in planta. More recently, plant molecular engineering approaches have also been applied to improve the glycan occupancy of proteins which are not appropriately glycosylated, and to support the folding and processing of viral glycoproteins where the cellular machinery differs from the usual expression host of the protein. Here we highlight recent achievements and remaining challenges in glycoengineering and the engineering of glycosylation-directed folding pathways in plants, and discuss how these can be applied to produce recombinant viral glycoproteins vaccines.","Margolin, Emmanuel; Crispin, Max; Meyers, Ann; Chapman, Ros; Rybicki, Edward P.",Front Plant Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.609207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343609/,106

SGMY face unique experiences of discrimination in both online and offline environments, yet simultaneously build community and seek support in innovative ways. SGMY who identify as transgender, trans, or gender nonconforming and have experiences with child welfare, homelessness, or immigration have been particularly understudied. A qualitative exploration that leverages technology may derive new understanding of the negotiations of risk, resilience, and identity intersections that impact the well-being of vulnerable SGMY. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the QueerVIEW study were to (1) enhance understanding of SGMY identities, both online and offline, (2) identify experiences of intersectionality among culturally, regionally, and racially diverse SGMY in Ontario, Canada, (3) explore online and offline sources of resilience for SGMY, and (4) develop and apply a virtual photo elicitation methodological approach. METHODS: This is the first study to pilot a completely virtual approach to a photo elicitation investigation with youth, including data collection, recruitment, interviewing, and analysis. Recruited through social media, SGMY completed a brief screening survey, submitted 10 to 15 digital photos, and then participated in an individual semistructured interview that focused on their photos and related life experiences. Online data collection methods were employed through encrypted online file transfer and secure online interviews. Data is being analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory approach, with six coders participating in structured online meetings that triangulated photo, video, and textual data. RESULTS: Data collection with 30 participants has been completed and analyses are underway. SGMY expressed appreciation for the photo elicitation and online design of the study and many reported experiencing an emotional catharsis from participating in this process. It is anticipated that results will form a model of how participants work toward integrating their online and offline experiences and identities into developing a sense of themselves as resilient. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol presents an innovative, technology-enabled qualitative study that completely digitized a popular arts-based methodology—photo elicitation—that has potential utility for contemporary research with marginalized populations. The research design and triangulated analyses can generate more nuanced conceptualizations of SGMY identities and resilience than more traditional approaches. Considerations for conducting online research may be useful for other qualitative research.

According to it only a proportion of entire population needs to be immune either via natural infection or vaccination. The idea of herd immunity via natural infection rather than vaccination is a bit controversial, as it is not clear how long will the antibodies last, and whether re-infection or re-activation of the virus can occur after the antibodies starts weaning from the body. It has been suggested that coronavirus will likely become similar to a seasonal flu once the herd immunity is attained. Till then, it will continue causing outbreaks year-round and there could be multiple waves of virus transmission before achieving herd immunity.

The output of this amplification technique includes multiple different sizes of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structures which are identified by a banding pattern on gel electrophoresis plots. Although this is a specific amplification technique, the complexity of the primer design and amplification still lead to the issue of obtaining false‐positive results, especially when a positive reading is determined solely by whether there is any banding pattern in the gel electrophoresis plot. Here, we first performed extensive LAMP experiments and evaluated the DNA structures using microchip electrophoresis. We then developed a mathematical model derived from the various components that make up an entire LAMP structure to predict the full LAMP structure size in base pairs. This model can be implemented by users to make predictions for specific, DNA size dependent, banding patterns on their gel electrophoresis plots. Each prediction is specific to the target sequence and primers used and therefore reduces incorrect diagnosis errors through identifying true‐positive and false‐positive results. This model was accurately tested with multiple primer sets in house and was also translatable to different DNA and RNA types in previously published literature. The mathematical model can ultimately be used to reduce false‐positive LAMP diagnosis errors for applications ranging from tuberculosis diagnostics to E. coli to numerous other infectious diseases.","Schneider, Lindsay; Blakely, Hannah; Tripathi, Anubhav",Electrophoresis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31206723/; https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.201900167,106

Therefore, the search for rapid, informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR, serology, etc.) are being continually optimized, yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests, HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless, it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool, owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this, three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation, (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines, and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy, but also facilitate research in epidemiology, genetics and virology.

Optimizing radiation doses to induce cytotoxic effects to only cancer cells and not normal cells is critical in achieving effective radiation therapy; however, the mechanisms of radiation resistance, radiotoxicity, and DNA damage response (DDR) in feline cells have not yet been elucidated. A DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most toxic type of DNA damage induced by X-rays and heavy ion beams used in treating cancers. Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells is one of the most widely used cat cells in life science research. Here, we report that DSB-triggered senescence induced by X-rays is important in inhibiting the proliferation of CRFK cells. We demonstrated through cell proliferation assay that X-rays at doses 2 Gy and 10 Gy are toxic to CRFK cells that irradiating CRFK cells inhibits their proliferation. In X-irradiated CRFK cells, a dose-dependent increase in DSB-triggered senescence was detected according to morphological changes and using senescence-associated β galactosidase staining assay. Moreover, our data indicated that in CRFK cells, the major DDR pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139, was normally activated by ATM kinases. Our findings are useful in the understanding of X-rays-induced cellular senescence and in elucidating biological effects of radiation, e.g., toxicity, in feline cells.

Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.716 for the “Role limitation” subscale to 0.938 for “Ocular discomfort” subscale. 1,214 participants (402 men, 812 women, mean age 36.79±12.50 years) completed the DeMask-20 instrument. Mean DeMask-20 score of all study participants was 3.79±0.71. Significant differences in DeMask-20 score were detected in gender (p = 0.009), spectacle use (p = 0.034), contact lens use (p = 0.049), and binocular distance visual acuity (bDVA) (p = 0.001). Mean compliance of all participants was 4.05±0.96. Men, people <50 years and spectacle wearers showed significantly worse compliance (p<0.05). Moreover, professional workers and professional drivers demonstrated significantly better compliance (p = 0.008 and p = 0.047). Significant correlation was detected between compliance and DeMask-20 score (p<0.001, R(2) = 0.471). Significant correlations were detected with driving, near vision, distance vision, collaboration, role limitation, emotional stress (p<0.05, R(2): 0.386–0.493). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggested that the DeMask-20 instrument demonstrates adequate validity, while Cronbach’s alpha indicated sufficient internal consistency of all subscales. This study provided the necessary methods that could evaluate compliance trends and the efficacy of healthcare interventions against COVID-19. Our outcomes suggest that young males who use spectacles should be targeted by Greek Healthcare authorities in order to improve compliance rates.","Labiris, Georgios; Panagiotopoulou, Eirini-Kanella; Perente, Asli; Chatzimichael, Eleftherios; Fotiadis, Ioannis; Taliantzis, Sergios; Konstantinidis, Aristeidis; Dardabounis, Doukas",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740025/,106
689384,A structured model for COVID-19 spread: modelling age and healthcare inequities,2020-05-21,"Surfactant liquid-membrane type sensors are usually made of a PVC, ionophore and a plasticizer. Plasticizers soften the PVC. Due to their lipophilicity, they influence the ion exchange across the membrane, ionophore solubility, membrane resistance and, consequently, the analytical signal. We used the DMI-TPB as an ionophore, six different plasticizers [2-nitrophenyl-octyl-ether (P1), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (P2), bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate (P3), 2-nitrophenyl phenyl ether (P4), dibutyl phthalate (P5) and dibutyl sebacate (P6)] and a PVC to produce ionic surfactant sensors. Sensor formulation with P1 showed the best potentiometric response to four usually used cationic surfactant, with the lowest LOD, 7 × 10(−7) M; and potentiometric titration curves with well-defined and sharp inflexion points. The sensor with P6 showed the lowest analytical performances. Surfactant sensor with P1 was selected for quantification of cationic surfactant in model solutions and commercial samples of disinfectants and antiseptics. It showed high accuracy and precision in all determinations, with recovery from 98.2 to 99.6, and good agreement with the results obtained with surfactant sensor used as a referent one, and a standard two-phase titration method. RDS values were lower than 0.5% for all determinations.","Sakač, Nikola; Madunić-Čačić, Dubravka; Karnaš, Maja; Đurin, Bojan; Kovač, Ivan; Jozanović, Marija",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069524/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21103535,106

Participants in the United were recruited via social media. They completed a questionnaire that included demographic, health, and obstetric experience questions, and the Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, and nonparametric correlations were performed.Results: Higher birth satisfaction scores were associated with higher income, marriage, white race, vaginal birth, having a birth partner present, and sufficient support during birth. Factors negatively associated with birth satisfaction were separation from infant, unplanned cesarean birth, neonatal intensive care unit admission, hypertension, preeclampsia, hemorrhage, depression, and anxiety.Clinical Implications: Presence of birth partners, sufficient birth support, and minimizing separation of mother and infant improve birth satisfaction. Obstetric complications, including unplanned cesarean birth, negatively affect birth satisfaction. There are racial disparities in birth satisfaction. It is critical to develop further interventions to end racism in maternal health care.","Mollard, Elizabeth; Kupzyk, Kevin",MCN.

Methods: All the workers were invited to an online survey. In total, 657 workers were recruited, including 536 healthcare workers (HCWs) and 121 non-healthcare workers (nHCWs). General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12) was used as a screening tool. Sociodemographic data, working environmental conditions, and health behaviors were also analyzed. Results: inadequate sleep, poor nutritional and social interaction habits, misuse of psychotropics, female gender, COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, and losing a relative by COVID-19 were variables associated with higher probability of GHQ-12 positive screening. Significant differences between “frontline workers” and the rest were not found, nor was higher the probability of psychological distress in healthcare workers compared to non-healthcare workers. After 3 months from the peak of the pandemic, 63.6% of participants screening positive in GHQ-12 reported remaining “the same or worse.” Limitations: Causal inferences cannot be established. Retrieval and selection biases must be considered as the survey was not conducted during the peak of the outbreak. Conclusions: psychological impact of COVID-19 has been broad, heavy, and persistent in our institution. Proper assessment and treatment must be offered to all hospital workers.","Leira-Sanmartín, Mónica; Madoz-Gúrpide, Agustín; Ochoa-Mangado, Enriqueta; Ibáñez, Ángela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807155/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073608,106
689940,Passing the Test: A model-based analysis of safe school-reopening strategies,2021-01-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose mitigation strategies of unprecedented scales, typically involving some form of restrictions on social activities and transportation. The South Korean government has been recommending a collection of guidelines now known as social distancing, leading to reduced human activities. This study analyzes changes in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) during the 30-day periods before and since the start of social distancing on 29 February 2020 using measurement data from air quality monitoring stations at various locations of the seven major cities of South Korea, namely, Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan. All seven cities experienced decreased levels of PM(2.5) concentration by up to 25% and smaller fluctuations during the period of social distancing. Inter-city comparisons show that the PM(2.5) concentration changes are positively correlated with the city-wide PM(2.5) emission fractions for mobile sources and negatively correlated with the city-wide PM(2.5) emission fractions for combustion and industrial process sources. In addition, the meteorological influences favorable for transboundary pollutant transport have weakened during the period under COVID-19 social distancing. Intra-city comparisons show that decreases in the intra-city variability of PM(2.5) concentration were larger in coastal cities than in inland cities. Comparisons between the inter- and intra-city variabilities in the PM(2.5) concentration changes under social distancing highlight the importance of taking into account intra-city variabilities in addition to inter-city variabilities.","Kwak, Kyung-Hwan; Han, Beom-Soon; Park, Kyeongjoo; Moon, Sungju; Jin, Han-Gyul; Park, Seung-Bu; Baik, Jong-Jin",Air Qual Atmos Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-021-01006-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727988/,106
690158,Inefficiency of SIR models in forecasting COVID-19 epidemic: a case study of Isfahan,2021-02-25,"The value of the Tree of Life to human well-being and survival is enormous—our species simply cannot thrive without a biodiverse planet; that is, a healthy Tree of Life. The vast importance of the Tree of Life falls into several general categories. First, the immense overall importance of biodiversity not only involves providing food, medicines, and ecosystem services such as clean air and water, but also a second major theme of this chapter is the importance to human well-being of knowledge of how species are related. Knowledge of how organisms are related has predictive value. We all know from our own family trees that relationships matter. For example, if a close relative has a disease or cancer that is genetically inherited, we realize that there is a chance we may have inherited that trait. Similarly, broad knowledge of relationships is fundamental, providing crucial new information regarding the discovery of medicines, combatting disease, crop improvement, while also providing insight into the study of ecosystem function and services (clean air and water). Knowledge of species relationships and the Tree of Life can help in the discovery of new medicines—closely related organisms produce similar chemicals; similarly, that knowledge of relationships is essential to improve crops by identifying close wild relatives that may have important traits (disease resistance, drought tolerance). Knowledge of the Tree of Life can also aid in the study of ecology and conservation efforts. As closely related species will often respond in similar ways to environmental factors such as temperature and moisture availability, the Tree of Life can also provide critical information in predicting how species may respond to climate change.","Soltis, Douglas E.; Soltis, Pamela S.",The Great Tree of Life,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128125533000059; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128125533000059,106
690610,Will the COVID-19 outbreak be a turning point for China's wildlife protection: New developments and challenges of wildlife conservation in China,2020-12-29,"INTRODUCTION: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous bariatric surgical units globally have halted weight loss surgery. Obesity itself has been shown to be a predictor of poor outcome in people infected with the virus. The aim of this study was to report our experience as a high-volume bariatric institution resuming elective weight loss surgery safely amidst emergency admissions of COVID-19-positive patients. METHODS: A standard operating procedure based on national guidance and altered to accommodate local considerations was initiated across the hospital. Data were collected prospectively for 50 consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery following recommencement of elective surgery after the first national lockdown in the UK. RESULTS: Between 28 June and 5 August 2020, a total of 50 patients underwent bariatric surgery of whom 94% were female. Median age was 41 years and median body mass index was 43.8 (interquartile range 40.0-48.8)kg/m2. Half of the patients (n = 25/50) underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and half underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Of these 50 patients, 9 (18%) had revisional bariatric surgery. Overall median length of hospital stay was 1 day, with 96% of the study population being discharged within 24h of surgery. The overall rate of readmission was 6% and one patient (2%) returned to theatre with an obstruction proximal to jejuno-jejunal anastomosis. None of the patients exhibited symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: With appropriately implemented measures and precautions, resumption of bariatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic appears feasible and safe with no increased risk to patients.","Mamidanna, R; Askari, A; Patel, K; Adil, M T; Jain, V; Jambulingam, P; Whitelaw, D; Rashid, F; Munasinghe, A; Al-Taan, O",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192498/,106
690713,Effects of COVID19 pandemic on the Italian power system and possible countermeasures,2021-12-31,"In this investigation we report on the influence of volumetric flow rate, flow velocity, complementary DNA concentration, height of a microfluidic flow channel and time on DNA hybridization kinetics. A syringe pump was used to drive Cy3-labeled target DNA through a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic flow channel to hybridize with immobilized DNA from the West Nile Virus. We demonstrate that a reduction of channel height, while keeping a fixed volumetric flow rate or a fixed flow velocity, enhances mass transport of target DNA to the capture probes. Compared to a passive hybridization, the DNA hybridization in the microfluidic flow channel generates higher fluorescence intensities for lower concentration of target DNA during the same fixed period of time. Within a fixed 2 min time period the fastest DNA hybridization at a 50 pM concentration of target DNA is achieved with a continuous flow of target DNA at the highest flow rate and the lowest channel height.","Kim, Joshua Hyong-Seok; Marafie, Alia; Jia, Xi-Yu; Zoval, Jim V.; Madou, Marc J.",Sens Actuators B Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925400505002443; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2005.03.034; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400505002443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288235/,106
