Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A were found to inhibit NS3 function. The bridging from peptide inhibitors to heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A has not been considered in the literature and, therefore, we decided to explore this strategy for developing a new class of NS3 inhibitors. In this report, a structure-based design approach was used to convert the bound form of NS4A into 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide derivatives as first generation peptidomimetics. This scaffold mimics the buried amino acid sequence Ile-25` to Arg-28` at the core of NS4A(21`–33`) needed to activate the NS3 protease. Some of the synthesized compounds (Coded MOC) were able to compete with and displace NS4A(21`–33`) for binding to NS3. For instance, N(5)-(4-guanidinobutyl)-N(2)-(n-hexyl)-1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide (MOC-24) inhibited the binding of NS4A(21`–33`) with a competition half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.9 ± 0.12 µM in a fluorescence anisotropy assay and stabilized the denaturation of NS3 by increasing the aggregation temperature (40% compared to NS4A(21`–33`)). MOC-24 also inhibited NS3 protease activity in a fluorometric assay. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to rationalize the differences in structure–activity relationship (SAR) between the active MOC-24 and the inactive MOC-26. Our data show that MOC compounds are possibly the first examples of NS4A peptidomimetics that have demonstrated promising activities against NS3 proteins.","Omar, Abdelsattar M.; Elfaky, Mahmoud A.; Arold, Stefan T.; Soror, Sameh H.; Khayat, Maan T.; Asfour, Hani Z.; Bamane, Faida H.; El-Araby, Moustafa E.",Biomolecules,654,12

An analysis of poultry vaccination policy was used to explore the broader policy of influenza A H5N1 control in the region. The policy of antiviral stockpiling with oseltamivir, a scarce regional resource, was used to explore human pandemic influenza preparedness policy. Several policy analysis theories were applied to analyse the debate on the use of vaccination for poultry and stockpiling of antiviral drugs in each country case study. We conducted a comparative analysis across emergent themes. The study found that whilst Indonesia and Vietnam introduced poultry vaccination programmes, Thailand rejected this policy approach. By contrast, all three countries adopted similar strategic policies for antiviral stockpiling in preparation. In relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza, economic imperatives are of critical importance. Whilst Thailand's poultry industry is large and principally an export economy, Vietnam's and Indonesia's are for domestic consumption. The introduction of a poultry vaccination policy in Thailand would have threatened its potential to trade and had a major impact on its economy. Powerful domestic stakeholders in Vietnam and Indonesia, by contrast, were concerned less about international trade and more about maintaining a healthy domestic poultry population. Evidence on vaccination was drawn upon differently depending upon strategic economic positioning either to support or oppose the policy. With influenza A H5N1 endemic in some countries of the region, these policy differences raise questions around regional coherence of policies and the pursuit of an agreed overarching goal, be that eradication or mitigation. Moreover, whilst economic imperatives have been critically important in guiding policy formulation in the agriculture sector, questions arise regarding whether agriculture sectoral policy is coherent with public health sectoral policy across the region.","Pongcharoensuk, Petcharat; Adisasmito, Wiku; Sat, Le Minh; Silkavute, Pornpit; Muchlisoh, Lilis; Cong Hoat, Pham; Coker, Richard",Health Policy Plan,654,7

Dogs with naturally occurring cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) rupture (OA group) and healthy controls were recruited. Stifles with CrCL deficiency were surgically stabilized. Serum, SF, and synovial biopsy samples were collected from the OA group preoperatively, whereas samples were collected once from control dogs. A blinded veterinary pathologist graded synovial biopsies. Serum and SF analyses were performed using xMAP technology. General linear regression was used for statistical comparisons of serum biomarkers, and mixed linear regression for SF biomarkers and temporal concentration changes. The overall discriminative ability was quantified using area under curve (AUC). Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between synovial histology grades and the biomarkers. Samples from 62 dogs in the OA group and 50 controls were included. The MMP-2 and MMP-3 concentrations between the OA and control groups were not significantly different, and both with an AUC indicating a poor discriminative ability. All three SF biomarker concentrations were significantly different between the OA group and controls (P <0.05). The MCP-1 was the only biomarker showing an acceptable discriminative performance with an AUC of 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.83–0.98). The sum of the inflammatory infiltrate score was significantly correlated with all three SF biomarkers (P <0.01). Summed synovial stroma, and all scores combined were significantly correlated with IL-8 and MCP-1 concentrations (P <0.003), and the summed synoviocyte scores were significantly correlated with MCP-1 concentrations (P <0.001). Correlations between MCP-1 concentrations and synovial histopathologic grading and its discriminative ability suggest its potential as a synovitis biomarker in canine stifle OA associated with CrCL rupture.","Malek, Sarah; Weng, Hsin-Yi; Martinson, Shannon A.; Rochat, Mark C.; Béraud, Romain; Riley, Christopher B.",PLoS One,654,17

Diet modulates the intestinal microbiome and therefore has a therapeutic potential. The aim of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three versions of the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in active Crohn’s Disease. Methods: 18 patients with mild/moderate CD (PCDAI 15–45) aged 7 to 18 years were enrolled. Patients were randomized to either SCD, modified SCD(MSCD) or whole foods (WF) diet. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. PCDAI, inflammatory labs and multi-omics evaluations were assessed. Results: Mean age was 14.3 ± 2.9 years. At week 12, all participants (n = 10) who completed the study achieved clinical remission. The C-reactive protein decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7 at enrollment to 0.9 ± 0.5 at 12 weeks in the SCD group. In the MSCD group, the CRP decreased from 1.6 ± 1.1 at enrollment to 0.7 ± 0.1 at 12 weeks. In the WF group, the CRP decreased from 3.9 ± 4.3 at enrollment to 1.6 ± 1.3 at 12 weeks. In addition, the microbiome composition shifted in all patients across the study period. While the nature of the changes was largely patient specific, the predicted metabolic mode of the organisms increasing and decreasing in activity was consistent across patients. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of diet in CD. Each diet had a positive effect on symptoms and inflammatory burden; the more exclusionary diets were associated with a better resolution of inflammation.","Suskind, David L.; Lee, Dale; Kim, Young-Mo; Wahbeh, Ghassan; Singh, Namita; Braly, Kimberly; Nuding, Mason; Nicora, Carrie D.; Purvine, Samuel O.; Lipton, Mary S.; Jansson, Janet K.; Nelson, William C.",Nutrients,654,1

Patients, carers or the public?",18.295595,4.437963,2021-06-14,"IMPORTANCE: Over the past decade, branded prescription drug manufacturers have substantially increased list prices while offering larger rebate payments to health care insurers. Whereas larger rebates can partially offset increases in list prices for insurers, patient out-of-pocket costs may be directly associated with list prices for individuals without insurance and indirectly associated with list prices for individuals with insurance through deductibles or coinsurance. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between rebates and patient out-of-pocket costs and whether this association differs by coverage type (ie, Medicare, commercial, or uninsured) and before and after 2014. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) combined with pricing data for single-source branded drugs from SSR Health from 2007 through 2018. The study was conducted among a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Included individuals were respondents to MEPS with at least 1 prescription for a single-source branded drug who were covered by Medicare or commercial insurance or were uninsured during an entire year. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 through March 2021. EXPOSURES: Estimated rebate size. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Out-of-pocket costs per prescription were calculated, adjusting for year and drug. RESULTS: Among 38 131 individuals with at least 1 prescription, the mean age was 54 years (95% CI, 54 to 55 years), with 22 044 women (57.8%) and 29 086 White individuals (76.3%). The sample included 444 unique drugs with a survey-weighted total of 4.7 billion prescriptions. Estimated mean (SE) rebates increased from $34 ($1) per prescription in 2007 to $374 ($9) per prescription in 2018. The rebate sizes were associated with statistically significant mean out-of-pocket increases per branded prescription of $4 (95% CI, $4 to $4) from 2007 to 2013 and $11 (95% CI, $10 to $12) from 2014 to 2018. From 2014 to 2018, rebate sizes were associated with statistically significant mean increases in out-of-pocket costs per prescription of $13 (95% CI, $12 to $13) for individuals with Medicare, $6 (95% CI, $6 to $7) for individuals with commercial insurance, and $39 (95% CI, $34 to $44) for individuals without insurance. After adjusting for list prices, there was no association between rebates and out-of-pocket costs, with a change from 2014 to 2018 of −$0.01 (95% CI, −$0.04 to $0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that drug manufacturers may have provided larger rebates to insurers primarily by increasing list prices and that individuals without insurance had greater cost increases. The results emphasize the need for policy solutions that decouple list prices and out-of-pocket costs.","Yeung, Kai; Dusetzina, Stacie B.; Basu, Anirban",JAMA Netw Open,654,1

Despite this moderate target inhibition, TA-C shows exquisite antimycobacterial activity (MIC(50), concentration inhibiting growth by 50% = 10 to 20 nM). Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying this potency disconnect. To confirm that TA-C targets DHFR and investigate its unusual potency pattern, we focused on resistance mechanisms. In Mtb, resistance to DHFR inhibitors is frequently associated with mutations in thymidylate synthase thyA, which sensitizes Mtb to DHFR inhibition, rather than in DHFR itself. We observed thyA mutations, consistent with TA-C interfering with the folate pathway. A second resistance mechanism involved biosynthesis of the redox coenzyme F(420). Thus, we hypothesized that TA-C may be metabolized by Mtb F(420)–dependent oxidoreductases (FDORs). By chemically blocking the putative site of FDOR-mediated reduction in TA-C, we reproduced the F(420)-dependent resistance phenotype, suggesting that F(420)H(2)-dependent reduction is required for TA-C to exert its potent antibacterial activity. Indeed, chemically synthesized TA-C-Acid, the putative product of TA-C reduction, displayed a 100-fold lower IC(50) against DHFR. Screening seven recombinant Mtb FDORs revealed that at least two of these enzymes reduce TA-C. This redundancy in activation explains why no mutations in the activating enzymes were identified in the resistance screen. Analysis of the reaction products confirmed that FDORs reduce TA-C at the predicted site, yielding TA-C-Acid. This work demonstrates that intrabacterial metabolism converts TA-C, a moderately active “prodrug,” into a 100-fold-more-potent DHFR inhibitor, thus explaining the disconnect between enzymatic and whole-cell activity.","Aragaw, Wassihun Wedajo; Lee, Brendon M.; Yang, Xuan; Zimmerman, Matthew D.; Gengenbacher, Martin; Dartois, Véronique; Chui, Wai-Keung; Jackson, Colin J.; Dick, Thomas",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,654,1

There is a need for valid neuropsychological batteries to be administered home-to-home. Since 2006, the neuropsychological battery of Fundació ACE (NBACE) has been administered face-to-face in our clinical settings. Recently, we adapted the NBACE for teleneuropsychology use to be administered home-to-home (NBACEtn). OBJECTIVE: The aims of the present study are: 1) to determine the home-to-home NBACE equivalence compared to its original face-to-face version; and 2) to examine home-to-home NBACE discriminant capacity by differentiating among cognitively healthy, mild cognitive impairment, or mild dementia subjects and comparing it with the face-to-face version. METHODS: Data from 338 individuals assessed home-to-home (NBACEtn) were contrasted with 7,990 participants assessed with its face-to-face version (NBACE). Exploratory and confirmatory factorial structure, and invariance analysis of the two versions of the battery were performed. RESULTS: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis supported the four-factor model (attention, memory, executive, and visuospatial/constructional functions). Configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance was found between home-to-home and face-to-face NBACE versions. Significant differences in most of the neuropsychological variables assessed were observed between the three clinical groups in both versions of administration. No differences were found between the technological devices used by participants (computer or tablet and mobile devices). CONCLUSION: For the first time, invariance analysis findings were addressed by determining a teleneuropsychological battery’s equivalence in comparison with its face-to-face version. This study amplifies the neuropsychological assessment’s applicability using a home-to-home format, maintaining the original measure’s structure, interpretability, and discriminant capacity.","Alegret, Montserrat; Espinosa, Ana; Ortega, Gemma; Pérez-Cordón, Alba; Sanabria, Ángela; Hernández, Isabel; Marquié, Marta; Rosende-Roca, Maitée; Mauleón, Ana; Abdelnour, Carla; Vargas, Liliana; de Antonio, Ester Esteban; López-Cuevas, Rogelio; Tartari, Juan Pablo; Alarcón-Martín, Emilio; Tárraga, Lluís; Ruiz, Agustín; Boada, Mercè; Valero, Sergi",,654,1

Here, we developed a repertoire of robust and high-affinity antihuman serum albumin nanobodies (Nb(HSA)) that can be readily fused to small biologics for half-life extension. We characterized the thermostability, binding kinetics, and cross-species reactivity of Nb(HSA)s, mapped their epitopes, and structurally resolved a tetrameric HSA-Nb complex. We parallelly determined the half-lives of a cohort of selected Nb(HSA)s in an HSA mouse model by quantitative proteomics. Compared to short-lived control nanobodies, the half-lives of Nb(HSA)s were drastically prolonged by 771-fold. Nb(HSA)s have distinct and diverse pharmacokinetics, positively correlating with their albumin binding affinities at the endosomal pH. We then generated stable and highly bioactive Nb(HSA)-cytokine fusion constructs “Duraleukin” and demonstrated Duraleukin's high preclinical efficacy for cancer treatment in a melanoma model.

Inclusion of AI in such systems may, however, pose a risk, since it is, still, infeasible to build AI systems that know how to function well in situations that differ greatly from what the AI has seen before. Therefore, it is crucial that future AI systems have the ability to not only function well in known domains, but also understand and show when they are uncertain when facing something unknown. In this paper, we evaluate four different methods that have been proposed to correctly quantifying uncertainty when the AI model is faced with new samples. We investigate the behaviour of these models when they are applied to samples far from what these models have seen before, and if they correctly attribute those samples with high uncertainty. We also examine if incorrectly classified samples are attributed with an higher uncertainty than correctly classified samples. The major finding from this simple experiment is, surprisingly, that the evaluated methods capture the uncertainty differently and the correlation between the quantified uncertainty of the models is low. This inconsistency is something that needs to be further understood and solved before AI can be used in critical applications in a trustworthy and safe manner.","Ståhl, Niclas; Falkman, Göran; Karlsson, Alexander; Mathiason, Gunnar",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,654,24

We can only access those memories via mediation, by listening to our relatives who were there, whose stories we become witnesses to, and which ultimately become our own collective witnessing. The remembrance of the Spanish Civil War passed on to us in this manner is a contested legacy, a complex combination of affects and mediated memories, coming from offline—as in conversations with our elders—and online—such as archival footage—resources. Experiencing war firsthand left indelible marks in our forebearers’ minds. Now the elderly must face this violent “war” and “postwar” rhetoric with the potential retraumatization it may cause. Not capable to understand why media and government officials alike call for heroes to resist and fight the crisis, a discourse heavily imbued with emotions and battlefront references does little to assuage citizens’ fears. Perpetual news reels on the number of dead per day worsen the psychological strain of a person in lockdown, akin to that of prison inmates, more so if that person endured an actual war and its aftermath. What might be done to lessen such harmful impacts? How can we change the narrative and make it more humane?","Martínez García, Ana Belén",Hu Arenas,654,29

Of all social groups, adolescents are among the most vulnerable to social exclusion, which can interfere with their social development. Consequently, the evaluation of this construct in adolescents is an important matter. The aim of this investigation was to develop the Social Inclusion for Adolescents Scale (SIAS). Firstly, five psychosocial factors were proposed, which potentially contribute to social inclusion: (1) covered needs, (2) self-efficacy, (3) social support, (4) job training, and (5) social integration. From these five factors, a set of items was created and reduced using qualitative evaluations. The final set of items was used in three studies, with a Spanish population (N = 1540) and a foreign population (N = 460), to test the psychometric properties of the scale, its dimensional structure, the measurement invariance between Spanish and foreign people, the reliability of the instrument and the evidence of the validity of its measurements. The results indicate that this scale is psychometrically reliable enough to assess social inclusion in adolescents.

The virus emerged in Wuhan, China in 2019, and later spread across the globe. Its genome has been completely sequenced and based on the genomic information, the virus possessed 3C-Like Main Protease (3CLpro), an essential multifunctional enzyme that plays a vital role in the replication and transcription of the virus by cleaving polyprotein at eleven various sites to produce different non-structural proteins. This makes the protein an important target for drug design and discovery. Herein, we analyzed the interaction between the 3CLpro and potential inhibitory compounds identified from the extracts of Zingiber offinale and Anacardium occidentale using in silico docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with 02J (5-Methylisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid) and PEJ (composite ligand) (PDB Code: 6LU7, 2.16 Å) retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and subject to structure optimization and energy minimization. A total of twenty-nine compounds were obtained from the extracts of Z. offinale and the leaves of A. occidentale. These compounds were screened for physicochemical (Lipinski rule of five, Veber rule, and Egan filter), Pan-Assay Interference Structure, and pharmacokinetic properties to determine the Pharmaceutical Active Ingredients. Of the 29 compounds, only nineteen (19) possessed drug-likeness properties with efficient oral bioavailability and less toxicity. These compounds subjected to molecular docking analysis to determine their binding energies with the 3CLpro. The result of the analysis indicated that the free binding energies of the compounds ranged between − 5.08 and − 10.24 kcal/mol, better than the binding energies of 02j (− 4.10 kcal/mol) and PJE (− 5.07 kcal/mol). Six compounds (CID_99615 = − 10.24 kcal/mol, CID_3981360 = 9.75 kcal/mol, CID_9910474 = − 9.14 kcal/mol, CID_11697907 = − 9.10 kcal/mol, CID_10503282 = − 9.09 kcal/mol and CID_620012 = − 8.53 kcal/mol) with good binding energies further selected and subjected to MD Simulation to determine the stability of the protein–ligand complex. The results of the analysis indicated that all the ligands form stable complexes with the protein, although, CID_9910474 and CID_10503282 had a better stability when compared to other selected phytochemicals (CID_99615, CID_3981360, CID_620012, and CID_11697907).","Isa, Mustafa Alhaji; Mustapha, Adam; Qazi, Sahar; Raza, Khalid; Allamin, Ibrahim Alkali; Ibrahim, Muhammad M.; Mohammed, Mohammed M.",ADV TRADIT MED (ADTM),654,1

In the absence of population registers and other surveillance systems, however, it is often difficult to measure. This is especially the case in historical populations. Compared to measures of fertility, nuptiality and mortality, then, migration processes are rather less studied. Recent studies in the English historical context have challenged long standing theoretical constructs concerning the relationship between migration and modernisation; gender and distance travelled; motivation for movement and the very nature of the movers themselves. Using a set of marriage registers for a large, agricultural county, this study explores intra-county migration among a predominantly young population over the period 1700 to 1836. The proportion of migrants is explored as well as the distance between ‘home’ and ‘marriage’ parishes. For perhaps the first time, chord diagrams are deployed for historical English migration data to visualise inter- and intra- regional/district migration. Although there are numerous limitations concerning the scope of the sample and the study, the evidence presented here broadly accords with recent studies of migration in pre-industrial England; and shows the potential to both use circular visualisation and exploit large scale samples of marriage registers to gain a further insight into a particular type of historical migration.","Gietel-Basten, Stuart",Heliyon,654,24

This capacity is mainly regulated by TNF-α and IFN-γ, and it has been observed that cell-cell contact, mainly mediated by ICAM-1, is important for MSCs to carry out efficient immunoregulation. Therefore, in the present work, we analyzed the effect of TNF-α alone or in combination with IFN-γ on the expression of ICAM-1. Besides, given the importance of cell contact in the immunoregulatory function of MSCs, we analyzed whether these cells release ICAM-1(+) microvesicles (MVs). Our results show for the first time that TNF-α is capable of increasing the early expression of ICAM-1 in human BM-MSCs. Also, we observed that TNF-α and IFN-γ have a synergistic effect on the increase in the expression of ICAM-1. Furthermore, we found that BM-MSCs exposed to an inflammatory environment release MVs enriched in ICAM-1 (MVs-ICAM-1(high)).

METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study that included adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had at least 2 positive nasopharyngeal tests at least 24 hours apart to study the correlation between the change in the genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples, as reflected by the Cycle threshold (Ct) value of the real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay, with change in clinical status. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was used as a surrogate for patients’ clinical status. A linear mixed-effects regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 457 patients who presented to the emergency department between 3/31/2020- 4/10/2020, we identified 42 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The median initial SOFA score was 2 (IQR 2–3). 20 out of 42 patients had a lower SOFA score on their subsequent tests. We identified a statistically significant inverse correlation between the change in SOFA score and change in the Ct value with a decrease in SOFA score by 0.05 (SE 0.02; p < 0.05) for an increase in Ct values by 1. This correlation was independent of the duration of symptoms.

Based on the correlation of the factors and their critical impact towards the concerned countries death toll, the risk index of each factor has been labeled using analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based MCDM, i.e., multiple criteria decision-making technique. The risk index of all the factors has been used to generate the susceptibility of COVID-19 for each of the countries in study, specifically the SAARC Nations.

This paper reviewed related studies conducted in the last 30 years (from 1991 to 2020) in handling uncertainties in medical data using probability theory and machine learning techniques. Medical data is more prone to uncertainty due to the presence of noise in the data. So, it is very important to have clean medical data without any noise to get accurate diagnosis. The sources of noise in the medical data need to be known to address this issue. Based on the medical data obtained by the physician, diagnosis of disease, and treatment plan are prescribed. Hence, the uncertainty is growing in healthcare and there is limited knowledge to address these problems. Our findings indicate that there are few challenges to be addressed in handling the uncertainty in medical raw data and new models.

The introduction of teleworking and staggered hours in many countries at national or workplace level will make possible the conciliation between labour and family life. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most influential explanatory factors in the behaviour of female entrepreneurship in Europe so as to subsequently propose efficient economic policy measures to promote it. The distinction between opportunity and necessity female entrepreneurs have been considered since both motivation and factors are different in each case. 15 econometric models using the panel data method for a sample of 20 previously selected European countries (grouped by their GDP level) during the period 2001 to 2018 have been estimated to determine which explanatory factors affect female entrepreneurship and necessity-based female entrepreneurship. The empirical analysis used demonstrates that more women enter into entrepreneurship due to necessity rather than in pursuit of opportunity for European countries both with higher levels of GDP and for countries with lower levels of GDP. In this context, the following policy measures should be implemented to promote female entrepreneurship in Europe: the optimization of government spending (training courses and mentoring, public procurement, stronger networks, support in reconciling business and family life, etc.), the government incentives for subsidizing high interest rates to support women in accessing financing, and the improvement of entrepreneurship education to increase the confidence of women in themselves in their own entrepreneurial capabilities.","Martínez-Rodríguez, Isabel; Quintana-Rojo, Consolación; Gento, Pedro; Callejas-Albiñana, Fernando-Evaristo",Int Entrep Manag J,654,16

We report our findings from Trauma & Orthopaedic (T&O) surgical mortality through this period and the effectiveness of using a scoring system (The Manchester Equation) to predict likelihood of mortality. METHOD: We reviewed all T&O admissions that underwent surgical intervention during the height of the pandemic. We recorded numerous factors for each patient including mortality and Covid status. From this we created a scoring system which is the product of Covid status, Anaesthetic type, Medical co-morbidities and other medical factors and ASA Score. We then analysed the findings to determine whether the score could be predictive of mortality rate. RESULTS: Of 123 patients undergoing surgery 6 deaths were observed (mean score of 51.3) compared to 117 patients surviving (mean score 31.9), p = 0.001. A score of less than 32 carried a 0% chance of death whereas a score of 32 or more resulted in a 14.6% mortality rate (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The Manchester Equation can be used to help predict the mortality rate of T&O surgery in the presence of Covid-19 and may be useful for clinical decision making and consent purposes.","Waugh, C; Jain, N; Bhutta, A; Havenhand, T; Qureshi, M; Stansfield, J; Lokanathan, S",Br J Surg,654,16

The findings of this study indicate that while the organisations’ outreach and education engagement help to achieve various important educational goals, direct impact on ticket sales is not easily quantifiable and may occur in the long run. This study concludes by offering a proposed conceptual framework for outreach and education when they are positioned in non-profit performing arts organisations. The four layers in the proposed conceptual framework involve cognitive, affective, ethical, and behavioural dimensions. It contributes to reframing the conceptualisation of audience development for the performing arts and sheds new light on the future of outreach and education in arts organisations and policymaking in arts and culture, with far-reaching implications for other non-profit cultural organisations in Hong Kong and globally.","Chung, Fanny Ming Yan",Fudan J,654,24

Recent evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from MSCs retain antimicrobial characteristics that may be enhanced by pretreatment of parent MSCs with the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist poly(I:C). Our aim was to determine whether poly(I:C) priming can modify EV content of miRNAs and/or proteins to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of their enhanced antimicrobial function. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured with or without 1 μg/ml poly(I:C) for 1 h and then conditioned media was collected after 64 h of culture in EV-depleted media. Mass spectrometry and small RNA next-generation sequencing were performed to compare proteomic and miRNA profiles. Poly(I:C) priming resulted in 49 upregulated EV proteins, with 21 known to be important in host defense and innate immunity. In contrast, EV miRNA content was not significantly altered. Functional annotation clustering analysis revealed enrichment in biological processes and pathways including negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, acute phase, complement and coagulation cascades, innate immunity, immune response, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Several antimicrobial peptides identified in EVs remained unaltered by poly(I:C) priming, including dermcidin, lactoferrin, lipocalin 1, lysozyme C, neutrophil defensin 1, S100A7 (psoriasin), S100A8/A9 (calprotectin), and histone H4. Although TLR3 activation of MSCs improves the proteomic profile of EVs, further investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of particular functional EV proteins and their activated signaling pathways following EV interaction with immune cells.","Pierce, Lisa M.; Kurata, Wendy E.",Front Cell Dev Biol,654,17

Voters and Parliament are divided, as are the UK’s major political parties. Such divisions may not be so surprising, however, given that Brexit crosses traditional party lines. Preferences to leave or remain do not fit neatly onto the traditional Left/Right dimension. Instead, the idea that European integration constitutes a new dimension in party competition has been gaining ground. This article creates a typology of Brexit ‘clusters’ through a discourse analysis of Conservative and Labour MPs, building an intricate picture of the archetypal positions of parliamentarians during the cacophonous Brexit period. Six clusters of MPs are found, crossing party lines and indicating that a Europe-related dimension is taking hold in British politics.

Nevertheless, sibling care work is still largely unacknowledged in the mental health sector in low- and middle-income countries. AIM: This article describes and interprets the lived experiences of ‘black’ isiXhosa-speaking individuals having a sibling with a mental illness, to shed light on how mental health professionals might support and sustain the involvement of individuals in the treatment and care of their sibling. SETTING: The study was conducted in a semi-rural town in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. METHODS: The study employed a qualitative research design using interpretative phenomenological analysis as the research method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed. RESULTS: The findings present interview extracts which give voice to participants’ experiences of financial burden, social burden and stigma, and of engaging with psychiatric treatment while providing care for their mentally ill sibling. Findings also highlight the positive aspects of caring for a sibling with a mental illness. CONCLUSION: This study specifically highlights the gendered nature of care work and siblings’ increased understanding of mental illness by virtue of their relationship with their brother or sister, thereby possibly pointing to sibling relationships as valuable relational resources for challenging stigma. The study findings suggest that calls for greater cooperation between healing belief systems should include dialogue with western religious belief systems alongside traditional healing belief systems.","Young, Lisa Saville; Flannigan, Raylene",S Afr J Psychiatr,654,10

Despite the high prevalence and negative effects on quality of life, there is still a lack of research in this area which translates into clinical practice and education. OBJECTIVES: My study discusses how gaps and controversies in current research and evidence on PFD might be addressed by positioning PFD within a contemporary biopsychosocial model of care (BPSM). METHOD: Various databases were searched for relevant studies published between 2010 and 2020 to support hypotheses and statements. RESULTS: My study focuses on the available evidence of PFD in both men and women as related to the themes and sub-themes of the BPSM, and how this available evidence might translate into education and clinical practice. It highlights areas of research, education and clinical practice that need to be explored and how the different components of healthcare may influence one another. CONCLUSION: Biomedical aspects regarding pelvic health are mostly investigated and taught, whilst psychological, cognitive, behavioural, social and occupational factors, individualised care, communication and therapeutic alliances are still under-investigated and not integrated or translated at a sufficient level into research, education and clinical practice. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Incorporating the integration of all factors of the BPSM into research is important for effective knowledge translation and enhancement of a de-compartmentalised approach to management. The interaction between the different components of the BPSM should be investigated especially in a South African population.","Brandt, Corlia",S Afr J Physiother,654,26

OBJECTIVES: To explore structural validity of PMP by identifying possible subcomponents in the attendance scale and examining internal consistency of the total score and each subcomponent. METHOD: A picture-supported interview was conducted with 182 children, 7–18 years, with and without intellectual disability (ID). Frequency of attendance in 20 activities was rated on a four-point Likert scale (never, seldom, sometimes and always). RESULTS: An exploratory principal component analysis extracted four subcomponents: (1) organised activities, (2) social activities and taking care of others, (3) family life activities and 4) personal care and development activities. Internal consistency for the total scale (alpha = 0.85) and the first two subcomponents (alpha = 0.72 and 0.75) was acceptable. The two last subcomponents alpha values were 0.57 and 0.49. CONCLUSION: The four possible subcomponents of PMP can be used to provide information about possible domains in which participation and participation restrictions exist. This study provided further psychometric evidence about PMP as a measure of participation. The stability and the utility of these subcomponents needed further exploration.","Arvidsson, Patrik; Dada, Shakila; Granlund, Mats; Imms, Christine; Shi, Lin Jun; Kang, Lin Ju; Hwang, Ai-Wen; Huus, Karina",Afr J Disabil,654,20

This was an enterprise that has stood the test of time, despite the increasing threats from drought shocks in the last two decades in Southern Africa. Prevalence of weather-related shocks was of concern, which had not galvanised communal farmers to actively engage in disaster risk reduction (DRR) initiatives in order to shield cattle from the negative effects of drought. In light of this development, this article examined the complexities of the involvement of communal farmers in DRR strategies to reduce the risk posed by drought on livestock in rural Umzingwane. This article used Arnstein’s Ladder of Participation to discern and generate insights on ways to promote the involvement of poor or vulnerable farmers or ‘have-nots’ in drought mitigation processes. This study adopted the descriptive survey design with 180 structured questionnaires administered to communal cattle farmers. Besides in-depth interviews, focus group discussions were held to examine the contributions of relevant stakeholders in driving the drought risk reduction agenda involving communal cattle farmers. This study revealed that limited investment options seriously affected farmers’ abilities to participate in drought risk reduction processes. Furthermore, farmers’ low-income levels and lack of well-defined drought risk reduction pathways did not offer the impetus to invest accordingly in drought mitigation. This article accentuated that successful drought risk reduction process were unachievable without the voice of the affected. Hence, development agencies should exceed placation and invest in strategies that propped philosophies of the vulnerable.","Ndlovu, Thabo; Belle, Johannes; Silengo, Mitulo",Jamba,654,17

During biodiesel production, approximately 10% of glycerol is formed in the transesterification process in a biodiesel plant. The ditching of crude glycerol is important as it contains salt, free fatty acids, and methanol that cause contamination of soil and creates environmental challenges for researchers. However, the excessive cost of crude glycerol refining and market capacity encourage the biodiesel industries for developing a new idea for utilising and produced extra sources of income and treat biodiesel waste.

It is hypothesized that patients would have impaired mental health status due to compromised nutritional status METHODS: An epidemiological, cross-sectional study included acute-severely ill COVID-19 patients in Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia. The following parameters were assessed: demographic characteristics, nutritional status (using the Malnutrition Screening Tool), BMI, loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased food intake and mental health status (using the PHQ-9 to determine the severity of depression). Data collectors wore Personal Protective Equipment and spent a maximum of 15 minutes with each patient. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ministry of Health as well as patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26. RESULTS: Patients (n = 515; 82% males) were included. They aged 31–50 years old (60%), married (85%), had low education level (85%), employed in non-governmental sectors (67%), and were non-Saudis (76%). Patients complained of loss of appetite (32%), weight loss (16%), and decreased food intake (19%). A significant number were at risk (13.6%) and 1.6% had high risk of malnutrition. Patients (4%) were underweight and 45% were overweight and/or obese. The mean BMI was 25.4 (SD = 5). They (23.4%) suffered from various degrees of depression. Mild depression was most prevalent (17%) followed by moderate depression (4.3%). Moderately severe and severe depression were common among 2.1%. One way ANOVA indicated that the severity of depression associated with the loss of appetite (P < 0.0005), decreased food intake (P < 0.0005), weight loss (P < 0.0005), and BMI (P < 0.0005). Linear Multiple Regression showed that the loss of appetite (B = 0.037, 95%CI = 0.011–0.352, P = 0.037), weight loss (B = 0.114, 95%CI = 0.000–0.228, P = 0.0049), and BMI (B = 0.031, 95%CI = 0.004–0.057, P = 0.023) affected patients' severity of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Possible factors associated with depression included loss of appetite, decreased food intake, weight change and BMI. Early detection of malnutrition-related factors and depression reduces hospital stay and cost of medication. It speeds up the rate of recovery, improves health outcomes and the quality of life.

This situation may affect snack consumption and food security. Our objective was to determine the associations among snack intake, snack accessibility and availability, household income, and food security status in US overweight college students aged 18–24 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was assessed through online self-reported questionnaires via Qualtrics from June 2020 to January 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the frequency, percentages, and average of socio-demographic data, including household income and food security status and snack intake data. The associations among these variables were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 157 students completed the survey but only 145 completed all questions in the survey. Most students were female (84.8%), Hispanics (37.2%), with a mean age of 21.5 ± 2.0 years. The majority reported a household income of <$50,000 (60.0%) and having a high food security status (66.2%). Average snack consumption was 2.3 ± 1.1 times per day with the highest common reported frequency of snacking 2–3 times per day (61.0%). Most reported that they knew how to choose a healthy snack (85.5%) but most (73.1%) reported that unhealthy snacks (i.e., chips, crackers, cookies, candy, chocolate, etc.) were more accessible and available to them than healthy snacks (i.e., fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grain, low sugary bars/cookies/crackers, etc.). After adjusting for age and gender, those with the highest food security had significantly lower odds of choosing unhealthy snacks (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01, 0.36) as compared to those with the lowest food security. Also, those with lower income (<$50,000) had significantly higher odds of choosing unhealthy snacks as compared to higher income (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.51, 7.41). However, food security and income had no association with knowledge of identifying healthy or unhealthy snacks. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of college students, income and food security status was not related to their ability to know how to choose healthy snacks but low food security and low income were significantly related to the accessibility and availability of unhealthy snacks.

This existential threat, together with their crucial role in the economy, is the reason for the plethora of public financial support schemes being implemented throughout the entire world. However, support schemes for mental health are lacking. We aim to investigate, first, whether burnout levels have increased during the crisis and, second, whether burnout levels during the COVID-19 crisis depend on the threat of becoming ill, having to stay at home due to the lockdown, and/or having to file for bankruptcy due to the economic downturn. We do so using seven data sets of French entrepreneurs with a temporal comparison of averages and two data sets of French entrepreneurs with a cross-sectional analysis of individuals. Our findings show that indeed, the risks of burnout have increased during the pandemic and that the threat of bankruptcy is the dominant threat. As an increasing number of studies in the entrepreneurship literature indicate that entrepreneurs’ mental health influences their activities, as well as the growth and sustainability of their ventures, our study is important and timely in its contribution, as it takes a close look at the perception of burnout in general and more specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The risk of burnout in French entrepreneurs has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which calls for not only financial support but also other forms of support. The COVID-19 pandemic presents many threats for entrepreneurs since their business survival is often directly at stake. These threats are not just financial but also related to health, such as the threat of burnout. The findings of our study show that for French entrepreneurs, the threat of burnout increased after the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding raises the question whether this outcome is due to the threat to health, the effects of the lockdown, or the threat of bankruptcy. It appears that all three factors play important roles, although the financial threat is the dominant threat. These findings call for the extension of entrepreneurial support systems beyond the financial area by also involving an “entrepreneurship care” aspect, which includes telephone support, webinars, and mental help facilities.","Torrès, Olivier; Benzari, Alexandre; Fisch, Christian; Mukerjee, Jinia; Swalhi, Abdelaziz; Thurik, Roy",Small Bus Econ,654,10

Faculty and students encountered many challenges to ensure the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. Going completely online seemed unachievable. There are still many Schools of Medicine worldwide with the traditional curriculum where live lectures are the center of the instruction. In the USA most of the schools of medicine have moved to a more integrated curriculum, some of them have stopped given lectures and others moved to video‐casted lectures. Many courses in the preclinical medical curriculum were easier to transition to Virtual learning in the majority of the universities. Good examples are physiology, histology and pathology. Unfortunately, in the other hand Anatomy presented more difficulties everywhere. Outside the USA most Universities had to stop dissections and prosections. Instructors had to rapidly adapt to the changes. This crisis has highlighted the necessity to have the medical educators trained to use the technology available and the creation of their own multimedia teaching materials. The schools which were already using more technology and having access to a reliable internet connection were much prepared to succeed. Remarkably few universities were able to use prosections and allowed the students to review them taking all the necessary precautions. Nevertheless to achieve this the instructors have to prepare 3 or more times the prosections needed in a normal year. Unfortunately, only during the clerkships especially in the course of surgical rotations we will know the consequences of missing the opportunity to have dissected a body.

Until recently, the global ART industry was marked by so-called ‘reprohubs’—places (such as southern California, Dubai, Anand, and Mumbai) specializing in the provision of reproductive services. While reprohubs continue to exist, in the last few years, many have splayed out, transforming into something more akin to webs that encompass, but go beyond these hubs. These webs show a unique dynamic capability to tighten, entangle, or extend in reaction to local and global changes, a characteristic which became particularly obvious during the global Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we propose conceptualizing this new dynamic capability as ‘reprowebs’—an approach that adds a new dimension to the existing conceptualization of reproductive travel and helps us to better understand current developments in the global ART industry.","König, Anika; Jacobson, Heather",Biosocieties,654,24

The physiological stability and the therapeutic efficiency of [{Co}-CN-{trans-Pt(NH3)2}-{cytarabine}](2+) (2) were studied. Under physiological conditions, 2 is stable for 3 days. Its affinity to the cobalamin transport proteins (haptocorrin, intrinsic factor and transcobalamin) is not substantially affected despite the introduction of a bulky group in the β-axial position. The cleavage of the [trans-CN-Pt(NH3)2-{cytarabine}](+) complex was observed upon chemical reduction of Co(III)→ Co(II) with Zn(0). Cytarabine was subsequently released from the cleaved complex to exhibit its cytotoxicity. 2 displayed a reduced cytotoxicity (IC50 = 230 ± 62 nM) as compared to cytarabine (IC50 = 30 ± 5 nM). However, cytarabine released from 2 showed comparable cytotoxicity (IC50 = 30 ± 11 nM).","Tran, Mai Thanh Quynh; Furger, Evelyne; Alberto, Roger",Organic & biomolecular chemistry,654,27

Our purpose is to analyze the incidence and mortality trends of esophageal cancer in China from 2005 to 2015. METHOD Based on the data in the annual report of the China Cancer Registry, a comprehensive analysis of esophageal cancer cases and deaths from 2005 to 2015 was carried out. The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer are stratified by gender and region (urban or rural). Long-term trend analysis was conducted using Joinpoint regression model. RESULT In China, the age-standardized incidence rates by the world population declined from 13.84/105 in 2005 to 11.64/105 in 2015. Annual percent changes were 3.4% (95% CI: 0.6%, 6.3%) in the period 2005-2011, -7.4% (95% CI: -10.1%, -4.7%) in the period 2011-2015, respectively. The age-standardized mortality rates declined from 10.86/105 in 2005 to 8.57/105 in 2015. And the average annual percent change was -4.1% (95% CI: -6.7%, -1.5%). The incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in men are higher than those in women, and the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in rural areas are much higher than those in urban areas. CONCLUSION In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer first increased and then decreased during 2005-2015, while the mortality rate has been declining.","He, Feifan; Wang, Junyi; Liu, Li; Qin, Xiaoyue; Wan, Zhanyong; Li, Wei; Ping, Zhiguang",Cancer medicine,654,1

We aimed to systematically identify studies describing the association between vision impairment and mortality, and to assess the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, and Global Health database on Feb 1, 2020, for studies published in English between database inception and Feb 1, 2020. We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies that measured the association between vision impairment and all-cause mortality in people aged 40 years or older who were followed up for 1 year or more. In a protocol amendment, we also included randomised controlled trials that met the same criteria as for cohort studies, in which the association between visual impairment and mortality was independent of the study intervention. Studies that did not report age-adjusted mortality data, or that focused only on populations with specific health conditions were excluded. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. We graded the overall certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations framework. We did a random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled maximally adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality for individuals with a visual acuity of <6/12 versus those with ≥6/12; <6/18 versus those with ≥6/18; <6/60 versus those with ≥6/18; and <6/60 versus those with ≥6/60. FINDINGS Our searches identified 3845 articles, of which 28 studies, representing 30 cohorts (446 088 participants) from 12 countries, were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 17 studies, representing 18 cohorts (47 998 participants). There was variability in the methods used to assess and report vision impairment. Pooled HRs for all-cause mortality were 1·29 (95% CI 1·20-1·39) for visual acuity <6/12 versus ≥6/12, with low heterogeneity between studies (n=15; τ2=0·01, I2=31·46%); 1·43 (1·22-1·68) for visual acuity <6/18 versus ≥6/18, with low heterogeneity between studies (n=2; τ2=0·0, I2=0·0%); 1·89 (1·45-2·47) for visual acuity <6/60 versus ≥6/18 (n=1); and 1·02 (0·79-1·32) for visual acuity <6/60 versus ≥6/60 (n=2; τ2=0·02, I2=25·04%). Three studies received an assessment of low risk of bias across all six domains, and six studies had a high risk of bias in one or more domains. Effect sizes were greater for studies that used best-corrected visual acuity compared with those that used presenting visual acuity as the vision assessment method (p=0·0055), but the effect sizes did not vary in terms of risk of bias, study design, or participant-level factors (ie, age). We judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty. INTERPRETATION The hazard for all-cause mortality was higher in people with vision impairment compared with those that had normal vision or mild vision impairment, and the magnitude of this effect increased with more severe vision impairment. These findings have implications for promoting healthy longevity and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

To determine optimal scanning parameters for commonly-used applicators. MATERIALS AND METHODS Applicators were placed in ex-vivo cow livers with implanted mock tumors, surrounded by bolus gel. Various CT scans were performed at 440mA with 5mm thickness changing kVp, scan time, ASiR, scan type, pitch, and reconstruction algorithm. Four radiologists blindly scored the images for image quality and artifact quantitatively. RESULTS A significant relationship between probe, kVp level, ASiR level, and reconstruction algorithm was observed concerning both image artifact and image quality (both p=<0.0001). Specifically, there are certain combinations of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm that yield better images than other combinations. In particular, one probe performed equivalently or better than any competing probe considered here, regardless of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm combination. CONCLUSION The findings illustrate the overall interaction of the effects of kVp, ASiR, and reconstruction algorithm within and between probes, so that radiologists may easily reference optimal imaging performance for a certain combinations of kVp, ASiR, reconstruction algorithm and probes at their disposal. Optimum combinations for each probe are provided.","Eltorai, Adam E M; Baird, Grayson L; Monu, Nicholas; Wolf, Farrah; Seidler, Michael; Collins, Scott; Kim, Jeomsoon; Dupuy, Damian E",European journal of radiology,654,16

Itaconate has a vital role in regulating inflammatory activation in various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of itaconate in the progression of AAA is unknown. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effect of itaconate on AAA formation and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS Quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to determine Irg1 and downstream Nrf2 expression in human and mouse AAA samples. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis was performed to measure the abundance of itaconate. OI treatment and Irg1 knockdown were performed to study the role of OI in AAA formation. Nrf2 intervention in vivo was performed to detect the critical role of Nrf2 in the beneficial effect of OI on AAA. FINDINGS We found that itaconate suppressed the formation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice, while Irg1 deficiency exerted the opposite effect. Mechanistically, itaconate inhibited vascular inflammation by enabling Nrf2 to function as a transcriptional repressor of downstream inflammatory genes via alkylation of Keap1. Moreover, Nrf2 deficiency significantly aggravated inflammatory factor expression and promoted AAA formation. In addition, Keap1 overexpression significantly promoted Ang II-induced AAA formation, which was inhibited by itaconate. INTERPRETATION Itaconate inhibited AAA formation by suppressing vascular inflammation, and therapeutic approaches to increase itaconate are potentially beneficial for preventing AAA formation.

Moreover, in all 42 jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting of CD4 and viral load results,* percentages of MSM linked to care within 1 month (80.8%) and virally suppressed (viral load <200 copies of HIV RNA/mL or interpreted as undetected) within 6 months (68.3%) of diagnosis were below target during 2018 (2). African American/Black (Black), Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), and younger MSM disproportionately experience HIV diagnosis, not being linked to care, and not being virally suppressed. To characterize trends in these outcomes, CDC analyzed National HIV Surveillance System† data from 2014 to 2018. The number of diagnoses of HIV infection among all MSM decreased 2.3% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-2.8). However, diagnoses did not significantly change among either Hispanic MSM or any MSM aged 13-19 years; increased 2.2% (95% CI = 1.0-3.4) and 2.0% (95% CI = 0.6-3.3) per year among Black and Hispanic MSM aged 25-34 years, respectively; and were highest in absolute count among Black MSM.

Although solar radiation intensity has been known to have similar time-of-day variation as body temperature, the relationship between fluctuations in solar radiation associated with diurnal change in the angle of sunlight and thermoregulatory responses in individuals exercising outdoors in a hot environment remains largely unknown. The present study therefore investigated the time-of-day effects of variations in solar radiation associated with changing solar elevation angle on thermoregulatory responses during moderate-intensity outdoor exercise in the heat of summer. Eight healthy, high school baseball players, heat-acclimatised male volunteers completed a 3-h outdoor baseball trainings under the clear sky in the heat. The trainings were commenced at 0900 h in AM trial and at 1600 h in PM trial each on a separate day. Solar radiation and solar elevation angle during exercise continued to increase in AM (672-1107 W/m2 and 44-69°) and decrease in PM (717-0 W/m2 and 34-0°) and were higher on AM than on PM (both P < 0.001). Although ambient temperature (AM 32-36°C, PM 36-30°C) and wet-bulb globe temperature (AM 31-33°C, PM 34-27°C) also continued to increase in AM and decrease in PM, there were no differences between trials in these (both P > 0.05). Tympanic temperature measured by an infrared tympanic thermometer and mean skin temperature were higher in AM than PM at 120 and 180 min (P < 0.05). Skin temperature was higher in AM than PM at the upper arm and thigh at 120 min (P < 0.05) and at the calf at 120 and 180 min (both P < 0.05). Body heat gain from the sun was greater during exercise in AM than PM (P < 0.0001), at 0-60 min in PM than AM (P < 0.0001) and at 120-180 min in AM than PM (P < 0.0001). Dry heat loss during exercise was greater at 0-60 min (P < 0.0001), and lower at 60-120 min (P < 0.05) and 120-180 min (P < 0.0001) in AM than PM. Evaporative heat loss during exercise was greater in PM than AM at 120-180 min (P < 0.0001). Total (dry + evaporation) heat loss at the skin was greater during exercise in PM than AM (P < 0.0001), at 0-60 min in AM than PM (P < 0.0001) and at 60-120 and 120-180 min in PM than AM (P < 0.05 and 0.0001). Heart rate at 120-150 min was also higher in AM than PM (P < 0.05). Neither perceived thermal sensation nor rating of perceived exertion was different between trials (both P > 0.05). The current study demonstrates a greater thermoregulatory strain in the morning than in the afternoon resulting from a higher body temperature and heart rate in relation to an increase in environmental heat stress with rising solar radiation and solar elevation angle during moderate-intensity outdoor exercise in the heat. This response is associated with a lesser net heat loss at the skin and a greater body heat gain from the sun in the morning compared with the afternoon.","Otani, Hidenori; Goto, Takayuki; Goto, Heita; Shirato, Minayuki",Chronobiology international,654,28

It is unknown whether these measurements could be substituted one for the other when interpreting splanchnic oxygenation since they have not been measured simultaneously before. AIMS To evaluate the feasibility and safety of liver and infra-umbilical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring in preterm infants with suspected necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and to assess the correlation and agreement between NIRS measurements performed simultaneously at the two abdominal locations. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS This study was part of a prospective observational cohort study. Preterm infants who were suspected of NEC or who had been diagnosed with NEC were included. OUTCOME MEASURES Liver oxygen saturation and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation were monitored simultaneously and continuously for 48h by NIRS. RESULTS NIRS monitoring was performed in 20 out of 24 infants for the entire 48-hour study period. No adverse effects were observed. Values of liver and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation correlated weakly (Spearman's rho=0.244, P<.001). On the Bland-Altman plot liver oxygen saturation was higher than infra-umbilical oxygen saturation (mean difference 6.6%, SD 22.5%). CONCLUSIONS Using NIRS as method for monitoring oxygen saturation simultaneously in both the liver and infra-umbilical regions is safe and feasible. Additionally, we demonstrated that values of liver and infra-umbilical oxygen saturation cannot be randomly substituted one for the other for the purpose of assessing splanchnic oxygenation.","Schat, Trijntje E; van der Laan, Michelle E; Schurink, Maarten; Hulscher, Jan B F; Hulzebos, Christian V; Bos, Arend F; Kooi, Elisabeth M W",Early human development,654,8

A rapid etiological diagnosis is critical for optimizing the antibiotic use. Owing to the variety of possible pathogens and the time needed for bacterial cultures or usual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, timely and precise diagnosis is a huge challenge.

This review aims to provide an overview of recent evidence on improvements and limitations of new rapid molecular assays for pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS Several rapid multiplex-PCR assays are commercially available for upper or lower respiratory tract samples, allowing detection of a wide range of respiratory viruses, bacteria, and, in some cases, of several antibiotic resistance genes. Clinical evaluations demonstrated their good correlation with gold-standard assays but their lack of exhaustiveness, especially for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Studies that evaluated their potential benefits on antibiotic use suffered from important weaknesses with conflicting and limited results. SUMMARY New molecular assays may enable improvements in patient management and antibiotic use.

Negative body image concerns among breastfeeding mothers may lead to depressive symptoms. There is a paucity of literature on how body image affects the breastfeeding practices of nurses and midwives. Therefore, this study explored the perspectives of breastfeeding nurses and midwives on how their body image affected their breastfeeding practices. METHODS A qualitative design was used in this study. Five focus group discussions were conducted with each group having five members. The study was conducted in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana between November and December of 2020. Participants were recruited into the study using a purposive sampling method. Focus group sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using a content analysis. RESULTS Three main themes emerged from the data analysis: body image concerns and breastfeeding, sociocultural pressures and breastfeeding and coping strategies. Participants had concerns regarding weight gain due to the need to eat adequately while breastfeeding. Body image concerns included increase in abdominal size, sagging breasts and generalized weight gain. These concerns and pressures negatively affected the breastfeeding practices of participants. Body image concerns reflected sociocultural pressures such as negative comments from loved ones and in the social media. The coping strategies adopted by the mothers were self-motivation and the love they had for their children. CONCLUSIONS The perspectives of breastfeeding nurses and midwives on the ways their body image affected their breastfeeding practices identified the need for support in order to successfully breastfeed.","Acheampong, Angela Kwartemaa; Abukari, Alhassan Sibdow",International breastfeeding journal,654,1

The aim of the current study was to learn about the response of Australian SPC services to COVID-19 and its consequences in order to inform pandemic practice and policy. METHODS A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was administered online from May to July 2020. Email invitations were sent to 160 providers delivering 503 SPC services listed in the Australian Palliative Care Services Directory. Survey questions asked about service responses to COVID-19, impacts on care quality, and perceived benefits/disadvantages for palliative care clients post-pandemic. Open-ended responses were thematically coded using an established framework that classifies SPC pandemic responses under: 'stuff', 'staff', 'space', 'systems', 'separation', 'sedation', 'communication' and 'equity'. RESULTS Complete survey responses were received from 28 providers on behalf of 100 SPC services (response rates of 17%/20% respectively): 29 consultative, 25 community home-based, 21 outpatient, 15 inpatient wards/units, eight inpatient hospice and two other services. Responses were reported across all framework categories except 'sedation'. Concerns centred on: inadequate support for self-management, psychosocial needs and bereavement for clients living at home; pressures on staff capacity and wellbeing; and a perceived lack of health system preparedness for a potential future surge. Rapid implementation of telehealth across Australia was perceived to offer potential benefits to palliative care in the longer term, if provided with ongoing support. CONCLUSIONS Meeting COVID-19-related challenges requires SPC to be agile and responsive. Advocacy is required to ensure the needs of people dying and their families are supported as well as people requiring acute care for COVID-19. Expansion of telehealth during the pandemic presents an opportunity for leveraging to benefit palliative care longer term.","Luckett, Tim; Donkor, Andrew; Phillips, Jane; Currow, David C; Parker, Deborah; Lobb, Elizabeth; Agar, Meera R",Annals of palliative medicine,654,10

The effect of l-fucose on the restoration of epithelial barrier function in both the DSS-induced colitis mouse model and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells was investigated, and the impact on fucosylation of epithelial cells was examined. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by l-fucose. Restoration of epithelial barrier function by l-fucose was detected. Direct l-fucose-mediated protection of tight junctions was observed in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, exogenous l-fucose promoted the exogenous metabolic pathway of l-fucose, and fucosylation of epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, knockout of the FUT2 gene restrained fucosylation and the protective effect of l-fucose on barrier function. The severity of colitis was not improved by l-fucose in Fut2 knockout mice.

The differential equations of the steady state motion are integrated and combined together with the boundary conditions into two nonlinear systems of algebraic equations corresponding to the different cases of the belt behavior: presence and absence of a sliding segment. The nonlinearity results from the fact that the boundaries of the contact segments are a priori unknown.

RESULTS The median estimate for the earliest point cases could have received treatment was 2 days (95% CI 2-3 days) and the earliest point contacts of cases could have received prophylaxis was 4 days (95% CI 4-5 days). CONCLUSIONS The logistical difficulties of delivering 'containment' according to the national algorithms meant there were significant time delays involved and that this was likely to have reduced the effectiveness of the strategy. This would be important to consider if a 'containment' strategy was to be employed in any future emergency.","Padfield, S; Kemp, M; Saravanan, A; Wensley, A",Journal of public health,654,1

The objective was to assess COVID-19 mortality rates in patients with cancer versus patients without cancer and uncover possible statistically significant characteristics contributing to mortality. METHODS This retrospective study analyzed patients with cancer and patients without cancer who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 1 through April 30, 2020. This was a multicenter study in the state of Louisiana throughout the Ochsner Health System in both tertiary and nontertiary centers. Patients older than 18 years were eligible. Three hundred twelve patients with cancer were compared with 4833 patients without cancer. RESULTS Mortality was found to be higher in the cancer group. Patients of advanced age with cancer had a significant increase in mortality (odds ratio [OR], 5.96; P < .001). Other significant risk factors for increased mortality were male sex (OR, 2.15), a history of chronic kidney disease (OR, 3.84), and obesity (OR, 1.30). In hospitalized patients with cancer, adverse vital signs on admission, decreased absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, lactic acidosis, and elevated procalcitonin all seemed to increase the risk of death. Among patients with cancer, active or progressive disease (P < .001) and recent therapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.08) were shown to increase mortality. CONCLUSIONS Patients with cancer have increased mortality in the setting of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with patients without cancer. Patients with cancer who are 65 years of age or older and those with certain comorbidities have the greatest risk of death. Recent cancer-directed therapy and disease status also seem to play roles in mortality. LAY SUMMARY This is the largest study of patients with cancer versus patients without cancer to date and is the first multivariate analysis study comparing these 2 patient populations. This study confirms the hypothesis that patients with cancer are at increased risk for mortality and that there are multiple characteristics posing the potential to risk-stratify these patients in the setting of a future outbreak.","Lunski, Michael J; Burton, Jeffrey; Tawagi, Karine; Maslov, Diana; Simenson, Victoria; Barr, Daniel; Yuan, Helen; Johnson, Daniel; Matrana, Marc; Cole, John; Larned, Zoe; Moore, Brian",Cancer,654,1

Objective To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

The success of cancer gene therapy depends on treatments where different types of tumors can be selectively targeted and destroyed without affecting normal cells and tissue. Previously, we described a promoter system (TTS) that we designed that is specifically targeted to lung cancer cells but which does not affect other types of cells including stem cells. In our study, we have enhanced the utility of the TTS system by inserting the pro-apoptotic gene BH3 domain interacting death agonist (Bid) into the TTS promoter system (TTS/Bid) to create a drug regulatable lung cancer-specific gene therapy. A recombinant adenoviral vector was used to introduce TTS/Bid (Ad-TTS/Bid) into lung cancer cells. BID expression and apoptosis occurred in A549 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells but little Bid expression or apoptosis occurred in MCF7 breast cancer cells or in normal human lung fibroblasts. The use of cisplatin enhanced the processing of full length BID to t-BID which significantly increased lung cancer-specific cell death. In in vivo experiments, intraperitonal injection of cisplatin enhanced the antitumor effects of the vector in a lung cancer xeno-graft mouse model. Moreover, dexamethasone effectively suppressed exogenous BID expression and the antitumor effect of Ad-TTS/Bid both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we describe the efficacy of the use of cisplatin and dexamethasone with the anti lung cancer promoter system (Ad-TTS/Bid) for a safe and effective gene therapy against advanced lung cancer.","Fukazawa, Takuya; Maeda, Yutaka; Matsuoka, Junji; Tanaka, Noriaki; Tanaka, Hirotoshi; Durbin, Mary L; Naomoto, Yoshio",International journal of cancer,654,12

However, they have not been at the center of recent initiatives to improve maternal health. This paper contends that the effectiveness of Brazilian maternal and infant health policy is limited by failures to robustly address racial health inequities. Multi-sited ethnographic research on the implementation of the Rede Cegonha program in Bahia, Brazil between 2012 and 2017 reveals how anti-Blackness structures iatrogenic harms for Black women as well as their kin in maternal healthcare. Building on the work of Black Brazilian feminists, the paper shows how Afro-Brazilian women experience anti-Black racism in obstetric care, which the paper argues can be better understood through Dána-Ain Davis' concept of obstetric racism. The paper suggests that such forms of violence reveal the necropolitical facets of reproductive governance and that the framing of obstetric violence broadens the scales and temporalities of iatrogenesis.","Williamson, K Eliza",Anthropology & medicine,654,25

Providing continuous mental health services during the pandemics is a challenge worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper reports on the strategies and activities taken to protect public mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo. This included establishing online and phone psychological first aid services and developing psychoeducational videos and webinars. The paper concludes with several lessons learned during the process of establishing and maintaining these interventions, such as: initial political endorsement is crucial to gain and maintain the momentum of services; continuous training of volunteers is crucial for both addressing the needs/problems, which arise during the process of work and maintain the motivation of volunteers; promotion of the services is crucial; academic curricula training mental health professionals should include digital mental health related courses and manualization on how to establish this kind of services in midst of crisis is crucial in order to ensure quick operationalization when needed again especially in LMIC settings. The interventions developed provide opportunity for further research especially by evaluating the impact of the services and exploring how online and provision of mental health and psychoeducation services online could help to cover services gap in times of isolation, limited movement and situations similar to pandemics in settings with limited mental health services and resources. The situation with pandemics with COVID 19 is still far from ending. Future waves of infections and restriction could again spike the mental health and psychosocial and psychological strain of the general population, therefore being prepared in provisions of psychological first aid and other mental health services online is crucial.","Arenliu, Aliriza; Uka, Fitim; Weine, Stevan",Psychiatria Danubina,654,24

Although often subtle, lamina propria between and around the neoplastic glands (identified by plasma cells, scattered eosinophils, etc.) is frequent in cases with classic morphology, arguing (at least in such cases) in favor of adenoma extending into lymphoglandular complexes rather than true invasive carcinoma. Some have postulated that the tumor arises from M-cells, specialized epithelial cells overlying GALT, and others have suggested it represents a unique pathway to carcinoma, specific to the environmental conditions of epithelium overlying lymphoid tissue. Although both hypotheses are intriguing, definitive phenotypic and genetic support is currently lacking. To address these possibilities, we undertook whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemical characterization of a GALT neoplasm recently identified on our clinical service. We discovered well-known mutations in both APC and KRAS, as well as mutations in several Wnt pathway components (MED12, BCL9L, RFX4, DACT3). No immunohistochemical expression of GP2, a marker of M-cell differentiation, was identified. Expression of CDX2, SATB2, and the DNA mismatch repair proteins was observed, while expression of both CK7 and CK20 was absent. No PD-L1 expression was present on tumor cells, but PD-L1 expression was noted in a subset of tumor-adjacent mononuclear cells. Overall, the findings suggest that GALT neoplasms, although morphologically distinct, may be a precursor or early form of typical sporadic colon carcinoma.","Yaseen, Alae; Ladenheim, Alexander; Olson, Kristin A; Libertini, Stephen J; McPherson, John D; Matsukuma, Karen","Pathology, research and practice",654,27

Historically, serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated. Evidence from the literature points towards the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A) as a primary candidate. Our meta-analysis investigated whether polymorphisms in HTR2A are associated with OCD or its subtypes, based on sex and age of onset. METHODS Studies employing case-control or family-based designs were systematically searched, and those meeting eligibility underwent quality assessment, resulting in 18 studies. A random-effects meta-analysis using standard inverse-variance weighting to compute odds ratio (OR) was conducted. To examine sensitivity, results were also obtained using a more conservative statistical method. RESULTS Three HTR2A variants were identified: T102C, G-1438A, and C516T. T102C and G-1438A were analyzed together due to strong linkage disequilibrium, where the 102T allele co-occurs with -1438A allele. Results reported as OR [95%CI] showed that the T/A allele were significantly associated with OCD, 1.14 [1.01, 1.29]. After stratification, results remained significant for females, 1.20 [1.00, 1.45], and early-onset OCD, 1.27 [1.02, 1.58], but not males, 1.06 [0.91, 1.23]. No associations were found for late-onset OCD, 0.98 [0.70, 1.37], or C516T, 1.22 [0.14, 10.37], but conclusions cannot be drawn from two studies. LIMITATIONS Associations no longer reached significance with the conservative statistical approach. HTR2A alone cannot explain OCD complexity and limited samples reporting genetic data according to subtypes. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest a possible association of HTR2A polymorphisms with OCD, but further investigations considering sex and age of onset with larger samples is needed.","Mattina, Gabriella Francesca; Samaan, Zainab; Hall, Geoffrey B; Steiner, Meir",Journal of affective disorders,654,19

The Guidelines contain recommendations for the treatment of inguinal hernia from diagnosis till aftercare. The guidelines expired January 1, 2012. To keep them updated, a revision of the guidelines was planned including new level 1 evidence. METHODS The original Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine ranking was used. All relevant level 1A and level 1B literature from May 2008 to June 2010 was searched (Medline and Cochrane) by the Working Group members. All chapters were attributed to the two responsible authors in the initial guidelines document. One new chapter on fixation techniques was added. The quality was assessed by the Working Group members during a 2-day meeting and the data were analysed, especially with respect to any change in the level and/or text of any of the conclusions or recommendations of the initial guidelines. In the end, all relevant references published until January 1, 2013 were included. The final text was approved by all Working Group members. RESULTS For the following topics, the conclusions and/or recommendations have been changed: indications for treatment, treatment of inguinal hernia, day surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis, training, postoperative pain control and chronic pain. The addendum contains all current level 1 conclusions, Grade A recommendations and new Grade B recommendations based on new level 1 evidence (with the changes in bold). CONCLUSIONS Despite the fact that the Working Group responsible for it tried to represent most kinds of surgeons treating inguinal hernias, such general guidelines inevitably must be fitted to the daily practice of every individual surgeon treating his/her patients. There is no doubt that the future of guideline implementation will strongly depend on the development of easy to use decision support algorithms tailored to the individual patient and on evaluating the effect of guideline implementation on surgical outcome. At the 35th International Congress of the EHS in Gdansk, Poland (May 12-15, 2013), it was decided that the EHS, IEHS and EAES will collaborate from now on with the final goal to publish new joint guidelines, most likely in 2015.","Miserez, M; Peeters, E; Aufenacker, T; Bouillot, J L; Campanelli, G; Conze, J; Fortelny, R; Heikkinen, T; Jorgensen, L N; Kukleta, J; Morales-Conde, S; Nordin, P; Schumpelick, V; Smedberg, S; Smietanski, M; Weber, G; Simons, M P",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,654,1

Interest in the putative effects of MBPs on cognitive function is also growing. This is the first meta-analysis of objective cognitive outcomes across multiple domains from randomized MBP studies of adults. Seven databases were systematically searched to January 2020. Fifty-six unique studies (n = 2,931) were included, of which 45 (n = 2,238) were synthesized using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses evaluated moderators. Pooling data across cognitive domains, the summary effect size for all studies favored MBPs over comparators and was small in magnitude (g = 0.15; [0.05, 0.24]). Across subgroup analyses of individual cognitive domains/subdomains, MBPs outperformed comparators for executive function (g = 0.15; [0.02, 0.27]) and working memory outcomes (g = 0.23; [0.11, 0.36]) only. Subgroup analyses identified significant effects for studies of non-clinical samples, as well as for adults aged over 60. Across all studies, MBPs outperformed inactive, but not active comparators. Limitations include the primarily unclear within-study risk of bias (only a minority of studies were considered low risk), and that statistical constraints rendered some p-values unreliable. Together, results partially corroborate the hypothesized link between mindfulness practices and cognitive performance.

The rate of HDCl correlated with the C−Cl bond energy, suggesting scission of this bond in the molecularly adsorbed molecule is rate-determining. The measured reaction kinetics of the CH(4−x)Cl(x) compounds support a previously proposed Langmuir−Hinshelwood type reaction mechanism. Kinetic and isotope exchange experiments demonstrated the following: gas phase H2 and HCl are in equilibrium with surface H and Cl; adsorbed Cl is the most abundant surface intermediate; and irreversible scission of the first C−Cl bond is rate-determining. The overall hydrodechlorination reaction rate can be written as kK(R−Cl)[R−Cl]/(1 + K(HCl)[HCl]/K(H2)(1/2)[H2](1/2)). The activation energy of the rate-determining step was related linearly to the dissociation energy of the first C−Cl bond broken in a Brönsted−Evans−Polanyi relationship. This behavior is in agreement with a previous study of CF(3)CF(3−x)Cl(x) compounds. During the reaction of CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, and CHCl3 with deuterium, H−D exchange occurred in only 2%, 6%, and 9% of products, respectively. The increasing H−D exchange with Cl content suggests the steps which determine selectivity in these multipath, parallel reactions. The density functional theory (DFT)-calculated activation energies for the dissociation of the first C−Cl bond in the family of chlorinated methane compounds are in good agreement with the values extracted from kinetic modeling, suggesting that parameters estimated from DFT calculations may be used to estimate the reactivity of a particular chlorinated compound within a family of chlorocarbons.","Chen, Nan; Rioux, Robert M; Barbosa, Luis A M M; Ribeiro, Fabio H",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,654,27

Parents' ability to manage discharge instructions has not been examined before in a systematic review. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review of the literature related to parental management (knowledge and execution) of inpatient and ED discharge instructions. DATA SOURCES We consulted PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane CENTRAL (from database inception to January 1, 2017). STUDY SELECTION We selected experimental or observational studies in the inpatient or ED settings in which parental knowledge or execution of discharge instructions were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION Two authors independently screened potential studies for inclusion and extracted data from eligible articles by using a structured form. RESULTS Sixty-four studies met inclusion criteria; most (n = 48) were ED studies. Medication dosing and adherence errors were common; knowledge of medication side effects was understudied (n = 1). Parents frequently missed follow-up appointments and misunderstood return precaution instructions. Few researchers conducted studies that assessed management of instructions related to diagnosis (n = 3), restrictions (n = 2), or equipment (n = 1). Complex discharge plans (eg, multiple medicines or appointments), limited English proficiency, and public or no insurance were associated with errors. Few researchers conducted studies that evaluated the role of parent health literacy (ED, n = 5; inpatient, n = 0). LIMITATIONS The studies were primarily observational in nature. CONCLUSIONS Parents frequently make errors related to knowledge and execution of inpatient and ED discharge instructions. Researchers in the future should assess parental management of instructions for domains that are less well studied and focus on the design of interventions to improve discharge plan management.","Glick, Alexander F; Farkas, Jonathan S; Nicholson, Joseph; Dreyer, Benard P; Fears, Melissa; Bandera, Christopher; Stolper, Tanya; Gerber, Nicole; Yin, H Shonna",Pediatrics,654,16

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations of maternal hemoglobin concentrations with a range of maternal and infant health outcomes, accounting for timing of measurement (preconception, first, second and third trimesters), etiology of anemia and cut-off category. Methods Our search strategy identified 7,677 articles. Screening and article selection was conducted using Covidence systematic review software to organize search results from PubMed and Cochrane Review. The systematic review included 272 studies and the meta-analysis included 102 studies. Results Low maternal hemoglobin (< 110 g/L) was associated with poor birth outcomes (low birth weight, OR (95%CI): 1.43 (1.31-1.55); preterm birth, 1.35 (1.25-1.46); small-for-gestational age, 1.08 (1.00-1.18); stillbirth, 1.43 (1.05-1.95); perinatal mortality, 1.73 (1.32-2.26); and neonatal mortality, 1.49 (1.19-1.87); and adverse maternal outcomes (post-partum hemorrhage, 2.17 (1.51-3.10); preeclampsia, 1.84 (1.31-2.59); and blood-transfusion, 6.57 (3.59-12.00). High maternal hemoglobin (> 130 g/L) was associated with increased odds of small-for-gestational age, 1.22 (1.08-1.37); stillbirth, 1.88 (1.21-2.91); preeclampsia, 1.48 (1.10-2.01); and gestational diabetes, 2.02 (1.63-2.50). Relationships varied by timing of measurement and cut-off category; limited data were available on anemia etiology. There were insufficient data for other maternal outcomes and long-term child health outcomes. Conclusions Current data are insufficient for determining if revisions to current hemoglobin cut-offs are required. Pooled high-quality individual-level data analyses as well as prospective cohort studies that measure hemoglobin throughout pregnancy would be valuable to inform the re-evaluation of hemoglobin cut-offs.

Our main aim was to determine the most appropriate list of enteric pathogens to be included in the daily diagnostics scheme of AGE, ensuring the lowest possible diagnostic gap. METHODS Two hundred ninety seven children ≤6 years of age, admitted to hospital in Slovenia, October 2011 to October 2012, with AGE, and 88 ≤6 years old healthy children were included in the study. A broad spectrum of enteric pathogens was targeted with molecular methods, including 8 viruses, 6 bacteria and 2 parasites. RESULTS At least one enteric pathogen was detected in 91.2% of cases with AGE and 27.3% of controls. Viruses were the most prevalent (82.5% and 15.9%), followed by bacteria (27.3% and 10.2%) and parasites (3.0% and 1.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. A high proportion (41.8%) of mixed infections was observed in the cases. For cases with undetermined etiology (8.8%), stool samples were analyzed with next generation sequencing, and a potential viral pathogen was detected in 17 additional samples (5.8%). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that tests for rotaviruses, noroviruses genogroup II, adenoviruses 40/41, astroviruses, Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella sp. should be included in the initial diagnostic algorithm, which revealed the etiology in 83.5% of children tested. The use of molecular methods in diagnostics of gastroenteritis is preferable because of their high sensitivity, specificity, fast performance and the possibility of establishing the concentration of the target. The latter may be valuable for assessing the clinical significance of the detected enteric, particularly viral pathogens.","Steyer, Andrej; Jevšnik, Monika; Petrovec, Miroslav; Pokorn, Marko; Grosek, Štefan; Fratnik Steyer, Adela; Šoba, Barbara; Uršič, Tina; Cerar Kišek, Tjaša; Kolenc, Marko; Trkov, Marija; Šparl, Petra; Duraisamy, Raja; Lipkin, W Ian; Terzić, Sara; Kolnik, Mojca; Mrvič, Tatjana; Kapoor, Amit; Strle, Franc",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,654,12

Innovative drug delivery systems (DDS), mainly based on polymer and lipid biocompatible materials, have given a great prompt in this direction in the last years.The intranasal (IN) route of administration is a valid non-invasive alternative. It is highly suitable for self-administration, the drug quickly reaches the bloodstream, largely avoiding the first pass effect, and can also reach directly the brain bypassing BBB.Association of IN route with DDS can thus become a winning strategy for the controlled delivery of drugs, especially when a very quick effect is desired or needed. This review aims at analyzing the scientific literature regarding IN-DDS and their different ways of administration (systemic, topical, pulmonary, nose-to-brain).

OBJECTIVE To compare note quality between two different templates using a novel randomized clinical simulation process. DESIGN A randomized non-blinded controlled trial of a standard note template versus redesigned template. PARTICIPANTS PGY 1-3 IM residents. INTERVENTIONS Residents documented the simulated patient encounter using one of two templates. The standard template was modeled after the usual outpatient progress note. The new template placed the assessment and plan section in the beginning, grouped subjective data into the assessment, and deemphasized less useful elements. MAIN MEASURES Note length; time to note completion; note template evaluation by resident authors; note evaluation by faculty reviewers. KEY RESULTS 36 residents participated, 19 randomized to standard template, 17 to new. New template generated shorter notes (103 vs 285 lines, p < 0.001) that took the same time to complete (19.8 vs 21.6 min, p = 0.654). Using a 5-point Likert scale, residents considered new notes to have increased visual appeal (4 vs 3, p = 0.05) and less redundancy and clutter (4 vs 3, p = 0.006). Overall template satisfaction was not statistically different. Faculty reviewers rated the standard note more up-to-date (4.3 vs 2.7, p = 0.001), accurate (3.9 vs 2.6, p = 0.003), and useful (4 vs 2.8, p = 0.002), but less organized (3.3 vs 4.5, p < 0.001). Total quality was not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS Residents rated the new note template more visually appealing, shorter, and less cluttered. Faculty reviewers rated both note types equivalent in the overall quality but rated new notes inferior in terms of accuracy and usefulness though better organized.

METHODS Eyes from 14 patients who underwent 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures were studied. The 8-0 absorbable sutures were inserted into 27-gauge round needles and used to create sclerotomies at the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions under the scleral flap. The sutures were used to tie knots at the end of each haptic and guide haptic externalization through the sclerotomy. After externalization, a sufficient flange was created at the end of each haptic and fixed under the scleral flaps. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), IOL tilt and decentration, previous surgery history, and complications were determined. RESULTS Fourteen cases were analyzed. The majority of eyes exhibited an improvement in the BCVA after surgery. When comparing the last follow-up to preoperative visual acuity, the mean change in BCVA was + 26.32 letters (p = 0.011). Postoperative complications included postoperative hypotony in 3 eyes, ocular hypertension in 2 eyes. No cases of postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), vitreous hemorrhage (VH), IOL dislocation, or endophthalmitis were observed.

We included clinical trials and observational studies on singleton gestating women evaluating antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or other treatments, compared between each other or to control (placebo or no treatment), and considering the pregnancy outcome FGR (primary outcome of the NetMA). Secondary efficacy outcomes included preterm birth, placental abruption, and fetal or neonatal death. Safety outcomes included bleeding and thrombocytopenia. Network meta-analyses using a frequentist framework were conducted to derive odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 18780 citations, we included 30 studies on 4326 patients. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), alone or associated with low-dose aspirin (LDA), appeared more efficacious than control in preventing FGR [OR 2.00 (1.27 - 3.16) and 2.67 (1.21 - 5.89) for control vs LMWH and LDA+LMWH, respectively]. No difference between active treatments emerged in terms of FGR prevention, but estimates for treatments other than LMWH+/- LDA were imprecise. Only the confidence in the evidence regarding LMWH vs control was judged as moderate, according to the CINeMA framework. No treatment was associated with an increased risk of bleeding, although estimates were precise enough only for LMWH.

We used the prototype arterivirus, equine arteritis virus (EAV), to gain insight into the structure and function of the replication/transcription complex (RTC) of nidoviruses. RTCs were isolated from EAV-infected cells, and their activity was studied using a newly developed in vitro assay for viral RNA synthesis, which reproduced the synthesis of both viral genome and subgenomic mRNAs. A detailed characterization of this system and its reaction products is described. RTCs isolated from cytoplasmic extracts by differential centrifugation were inactive unless supplemented with a cytosolic host protein factor, which, according to subsequent size fractionation analysis, has a molecular mass in the range of 59-70 kDa. This host factor was found to be present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Several EAV replicase subunits cosedimented with newly made viral RNA in a heavy membrane fraction that contained all RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. This fraction contained the characteristic double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that were previously implicated in EAV RNA synthesis and could be immunolabeled for EAV nonstructural proteins (nsps). Replicase subunits directly involved in viral RNA synthesis (nsp9 and nsp10) or DMV formation (nsp2 and nsp3) exclusively cosedimented with the active RTC. Subgenomic mRNAs appeared to be released from the complex, whereas newly made genomic RNA remained more tightly associated. Taken together, our data strongly support a link between DMVs and the RNA-synthesizing machinery of arteriviruses.","van Hemert, Martijn J; de Wilde, Adriaan H; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of biological chemistry,654,1

There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral for MERS, therefore new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections are needed. In this study, we describe, for the first time, to our knowledge, the isolation of a potent MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibody from memory B cells of an infected individual. The antibody, named LCA60, binds to a novel site on the spike protein and potently neutralizes infection of multiple MERS-CoV isolates by interfering with the binding to the cellular receptor CD26. Importantly, using mice transduced with adenovirus expressing human CD26 and infected with MERS-CoV, we show that LCA60 can effectively protect in both prophylactic and postexposure settings. This antibody can be used for prophylaxis, for postexposure prophylaxis of individuals at risk, or for the treatment of human cases of MERS-CoV infection. The fact that it took only 4 mo from the initial screening of B cells derived from a convalescent patient for the development of a stable chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line producing neutralizing antibodies at more than 5 g/L provides an example of a rapid pathway toward the generation of effective antiviral therapies against emerging viruses.","Corti, Davide; Zhao, Jincun; Pedotti, Mattia; Simonelli, Luca; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Fett, Craig; Fernandez-Rodriguez, Blanca; Foglierini, Mathilde; Agatic, Gloria; Vanzetta, Fabrizia; Gopal, Robin; Langrish, Christopher J; Barrett, Nicholas A; Sallusto, Federica; Baric, Ralph S; Varani, Luca; Zambon, Maria; Perlman, Stanley; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,654,1

Here we show RAD27/FEN1, which encodes flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), a structure-specific nuclease with roles in DNA replication and repair, and has the greatest number of synthetic lethal interactions with Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome instability genes, is a druggable target for an inhibitor-based approach to kill cancers with defects in homologous recombination (HR). The vulnerability of cancers with HR defects to FEN1 loss was validated by studies showing that small-molecule FEN1 inhibitors and FEN1 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) selectively killed BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective human cell lines. Furthermore, the differential sensitivity to FEN1 inhibition was recapitulated in mice, where a small-molecule FEN1 inhibitor reduced the growth of tumors established from drug-sensitive but not drug-resistant cancer cell lines. FEN1 inhibition induced a DNA damage response in both sensitive and resistant cell lines; however, sensitive cell lines were unable to recover and replicate DNA even when the inhibitor was removed. Although FEN1 inhibition activated caspase to higher levels in sensitive cells, this apoptotic response occurred in p53-defective cells and cell killing was not blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor. These results suggest that FEN1 inhibitors have the potential for therapeutically targeting HR-defective cancers such as those resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and other genetic defects.","Guo, Elaine; Ishii, Yuki; Mueller, James; Srivatsan, Anjana; Gahman, Timothy; Putnam, Christopher D; Wang, Jean Y J; Kolodner, Richard D",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,654,8

Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.","Block, Per; Hoffman, Marion; Raabe, Isabel J; Dowd, Jennifer Beam; Rahal, Charles; Kashyap, Ridhi; Mills, Melinda C",Nature human behaviour,654,1

METHODS Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 18 patients with severe and critical COVID-19, who were hospitalized in the ICU of Xianghu Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Patients were subdivided into an experimental group (n=6, who had transfused the plasma) and an observation group (n=12, who had no plasma transfusion). Basic clinical data and prognosis indexes of these two groups were compared. Moreover, for the experimental group, the dynamic changes of blood oxygen saturation before and after the transfusion, the changes of lymphocyte absolute value 48 hours after the transfusion, and the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid were analyzed. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age, gender, blood type and other basic clinical data between the two groups (all P>0.05).There were no significant differences in ventilator machine weaning time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) weaning time, body temperature recovery to normal time, and hospitalization days between these two groups (all P>0.05). For the experimental group, before, during and after the convalescent plasma transfusion, the blood oxygen saturation of all 6 patients at all time (1, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) was more than 90%, and there was no significant fluctuation. There were 3 patients whose absolute value of lymphocyte was increased 48 hours after the transfusion, and the remaining was decreased. There were 5 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection turned negative 48 hours after the transfusion, accounting for 83.3%. CONCLUSIONS Transfusion of convalescent plasma will not affect outcomesof COVID-19 patients, which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in patients and reduce the loading capacity of SARS-CoV-2.","Xiao, Kun; Lin, Yang; Fan, Zhifang; Wen, Yuchuan; Huang, Huiqing; Wang, Min; Ren, Dequan; Wu, Chenggao; Liu, Wei; Zhang, Zhanglin; Li, Guoliang; LE, Aiping",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) is essential for the survival of vagal smooth muscle afferents of the small intestine, but not the stomach. Here we took advantage of near-complete labeling of GI vagal mucosal afferents in Nav1.8cre-Rosa26tdTomato transgenic mice to determine whether these afferents depend on NT-4 for survival. We quantified the density and distribution of vagal afferent terminals in the stomach and small intestine mucosa and their central terminals in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) and area postrema in NT-4 knockout (KO) and control mice. NT-4KO mice exhibited a 75% reduction in vagal afferent terminals in proximal duodenal villi and a 55% decrease in the distal ileum, whereas, those in the stomach glands remained intact. Vagal crypt afferents were also reduced in some regions of the small intestine, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, NT-4KO mice exhibited an increase in labeled terminals in the medial NTS. These findings, combined with previous results, suggest NT-4 is essential for survival of a large proportion of all classes of vagal afferents that innervate the small intestine, but not those that supply the stomach. Thus, NT-4KO mice could be valuable for distinguishing gastric and intestinal vagal afferent regulation of GI function and feeding. The apparent plasticity of central vagal afferent terminals - an increase in their density - could have compensated for loss of peripheral terminals by maintaining near-normal levels of satiety signaling.","Serlin, Hannah K; Fox, Edward A",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,654,31

Interventions are focused on developmental or behavioral approaches and are mostly individual or group ones. In the present study, both proposed approaches in the form of structured individual and group parent training sessions among Iranian families are investigated. METHOD This study was a randomized clinical trial which was performed in 2019-2020 in Tehran. Forty four 3-5 year-old children with autism participated in the study and were assigned to experimental (n = 22) and control (n = 22) groups through block randomization method. To evaluate the effectiveness of therapy on autism symptoms, Gilliam Autism Rating and Functional Emotional Assessment Scales were used. Also, Parenting Stress Index and Quality of Life Questionnaire were implemented to investigate the secondary effects of the therapy. After 12 therapy sessions, both groups took the posttest and 3 months later, follow up evaluations were performed. RESULTS The treatment group manifested significant improvement regarding autism symptoms in both the posttest and follow up (ŋ2 = .77, P < .05) as well as Functional Emotional Development (ŋ2 = .62, P < .05). Comparing the means indicates that the experimental group mean score is significantly higher in quality of life and lower in parenting stress than the control group's. CONCLUSION Parent training is effective on autism symptoms and functional emotional development. Regarding the fact that the follow-up phase coincided with Covid-19 pandemic and quarantine, it can be concluded that the therapy has been successful in maintaining the attained capabilities.","Akhani, Afsaneh; Dehghani, Mahmood; Gharraee, Banafsheh; Hakim Shooshtari, Mitra",Asian journal of psychiatry,654,1

Disease management programs are hindered by the lack of infrastructure and resources for clinical sample collection, storage, and transport and a dearth of sensitive diagnostic methods that are inexpensive as well as accurate. Many diagnostic tests and tools have been developed for the parasitic NTDs, but the collection and storage of clinical samples for molecular and immunological diagnosis can be expensive due to storage, transport, and reagent costs, making these procedures untenable in most areas of endemicity. The application of membrane technology, which involves the use of specific membranes for either sample collection and storage or diagnostic procedures, can streamline this process, allowing for long-term sample storage at room temperature. Membrane technology can be used in serology-based diagnostic assays and for nucleic acid purification prior to molecular analysis. This facilitates the development of relatively simple and rapid procedures, although some of these methods, mainly due to costs, lack accessibility in low-socioeconomic regions of endemicity. New immunological procedures and nucleic acid storage, purification, and diagnostics protocols that are simple, rapid, accurate, and cost-effective must be developed as countries progress control efforts toward the elimination of the parasitic NTDs.","Rogers, Madeleine J; McManus, Donald P; Muhi, Stephen; Gordon, Catherine A",Clinical microbiology reviews,654,1

METHOD AND MATERIALS Nine periodontally healthy nonsmoking patients (seven women, 37.5 ± 7.36 years old) with a total of 41 adjacent RT I (n = 23) and RT II (n = 18) gingival recessions exhibiting a minimum depth of 2 mm were treated by means of MCAT+PADM. Recession depth and width, width of attached and keratinized tissue, probing depths, and clinical attachment level were measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 years postsurgically. The primary outcome variable was complete root coverage (ie 100% root coverage), while secondary outcomes were mean root coverage and increase in keratinized tissue and attached gingiva widths. RESULTS At 1 and 4 years, statistically highly significant (P < .001) root coverage was obtained in all nine patients compared to baseline. Mean root coverage decreased in these nine patients from 72.05 ± 30.18% at 1 year to 56.79 ± 27.53% at 4 years. Complete root coverage was obtained in 18 gingival recessions at 1 year (baseline RT: 12 RT I, 6 RT II) and in seven gingival recessions (5 RT I, 2 RT II) at 4 years. Most root coverage occurred in the first year postsurgically, showing a statistically significant decrease between the first and fourth year (P = .003). Mean width of attached gingiva increased statistically significantly (P < .05) from 2.85 ± 1.08 mm to 3.14 ± 1.08 mm at 1 year with a statistically significant decrease at 4 years. At 1 year, 78.05% of gingival recessions showed a root coverage > 50%, and 68.29% still exhibited a root coverage > 50% at 4 years. CONCLUSION The use of MCAT+PADM represents a valuable treatment option for multiple adjacent maxillary and mandibular RT I and II gingival recessions on a long-term basis.","Cosgarea, Raluca; Miron, Rick; Bora, Raluca; Rosu, Alexandra; Buduru, Smaranda; Sculean, Anton",Quintessence international,654,26

However, its effect on survival remains unclear. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to compare mortality after sedation with either isoflurane or propofol/midazolam. DESIGN A retrospective analysis of data in a hospital database for a cohort of consecutive patients. SETTING Sixteen-bed interdisciplinary surgical ICU of a German university hospital. PATIENTS Consecutive cohort of 369 critically ill surgical patients defined within the database of the hospital information system. All patients were continuously ventilated and sedated for more than 96 h between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. After excluding 169 patients (93 >79 years old, 10 <40 years old, 46 mixed sedation, 20 lost to follow-up), 200 patients were studied, 72 after isoflurane and 128 after propofol/midazolam. INTERVENTIONS Sedation with isoflurane using the AnaConDa system compared with intravenous sedation with propofol or midazolam. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hospital mortality (primary) and 365-day mortality (secondary) were compared with the Kaplan-Meier analysis and a log-rank test. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) [with 95% confidence interval (95% CI)] were calculated by logistic regression analyses to determine the risk of death after isoflurane sedation. RESULTS After sedation with isoflurane, the in-hospital mortality and 365-day mortality were significantly lower than after propofol/midazolam sedation: 40 versus 63% (P = 0.005) and 50 versus 70% (P = 0.013), respectively. After adjustment for potential confounders (coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute renal failure, creatinine, age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II), patients after isoflurane were at a lower risk of death during their hospital stay (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.68, P = 0.002) and within the first 365 days (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81, P = 0.010).

However, in certain situations, such as when patients have massive pulmonary secretion or when the fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is not applicable, lung isolation has been performed blindly. PATIENT CONCERN A 52-year-old woman, whose airway was unable to visualize with FOB due to massive pulmonary secretion, was presented for bilateral sequential lung transplantation. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation were applied to the patient for 39 days preoperatively as a bridge for lung transplantation. DIAGNOSIS Patient was diagnosed with an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obesity. INTERVENTION Initially, height-based blind positioning with a conventional double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) failed to ventilate the patient properly, and the confirmation of DLT positioning with FOB was impossible due to massive pulmonary secretion. Therefore, a novel DLT (ANKOR DLT) that has one more cuff, located at a point between the distal opening of the tracheal lumen and the starting point of bronchial cuff, than conventional DLT was used for the lung isolation in the patient. OUTCOMES After the completion of lung graft, FOB finding showed that the ANKOR DLT was optimally positioned at the tracheobronchial tree of the patient, and its depth was 2.5 cm shallower than that of the conventional tube. LESSONS ANKOR DLT would be a feasible choice to achieve successful blind lung isolation when the use of FOB is impossible to achieve the optimal lung isolation.","Seo, Yijun; Kim, Namo; Paik, Hyo Chae; Park, Dahee; Oh, Young Jun",Medicine,654,8

Because of the specific arrangement of Pd atoms deviated from typical hexagonal close-packing, Pd-Te HPs/C displays extraordinary methanol tolerance with high ORR performance compared with commercial Pt/C. DFT calculations reveal that the high performance of Pd-Te HPs can be attributed to the breakthrough of the linear relationship between OOH* and OH* adsorption, which leaves sufficient room to improve the ORR activity but suppresses the methanol oxidation reaction.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between EAT and cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS In 110 patients with systolic heart failure, we evaluated the correlation between echocardiographic EAT thickness and cardiac adrenergic nerve activity assessed by (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG). The predictive value of EAT thickness on cardiac sympathetic denervation ((123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score) was tested in a multivariate analysis. Furthermore, catecholamine levels, catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, and sympathetic nerve fibers were measured in EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies obtained from patients with heart failure who underwent cardiac surgery. EAT thickness correlated with (123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score, but not with left ventricular ejection fraction. Moreover, EAT resulted as an independent predictor of (123)I-MIBG early and late heart:mediastinum ratio and single-photon emission computed tomography total defect score and showed a significant additive predictive value on (123)I-MIBG planar and single-photon emission computed tomography results over demographic and clinical data. Although no differences were found in sympathetic innervation between EAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue, EAT showed an enhanced adrenergic activity demonstrated by the increased catecholamine levels and expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes. CONCLUSIONS This study provides the first evidence of a direct correlation between increased EAT thickness and cardiac sympathetic denervation in heart failure.","Parisi, Valentina; Rengo, Giuseppe; Perrone-Filardi, Pasquale; Pagano, Gennaro; Femminella, Grazia Daniela; Paolillo, Stefania; Petraglia, Laura; Gambino, Giuseppina; Caruso, Aurelio; Grimaldi, Maria Gabriella; Baldascino, Francesco; Nolano, Maria; Elia, Andrea; Cannavo, Alessandro; De Bellis, Antonio; Coscioni, Enrico; Pellegrino, Teresa; Cuocolo, Alberto; Ferrara, Nicola; Leosco, Dario",Circulation research,654,16

METHODS All acutely admitted, adult ICU patients were screened during a 2-week inception period. We followed the patient throughout their ICU stay and assessed 90-day mortality. We assessed patients and their variables in the first 24 and 72 h in ICU and studied their association together with that of ICU characteristics with haloperidol use. RESULTS We included 1260 patients from 99 ICUs in 13 countries. Delirium occurred in 314/1260 patients [25% (95% confidence interval 23-27)] of whom 145 received haloperidol [46% (41-52)]. Other interventions for delirium were benzodiazepines in 36% (31-42), dexmedetomidine in 21% (17-26), quetiapine in 19% (14-23) and olanzapine in 9% (6-12) of the patients with delirium. In the first 24 h in the ICU, all subtypes of delirium [hyperactive, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 29.7 (12.9-74.5); mixed 10.0 (5.0-20.2); hypoactive 3.0 (1.2-6.7)] and circulatory support 2.7 (1.7-4.3) were associated with haloperidol use. At 72 h after ICU admission, circulatory support remained associated with subsequent use of haloperidol, aOR 2.6 (1.1-6.9). Haloperidol use within 0-24 h and within 0-72 h of ICU admission was not associated with 90-day mortality [aOR 1.2 (0.5-2.5); p = 0.66] and [aOR 1.9 (1.0-3.9); p = 0.07], respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our study, haloperidol was the main pharmacological agent used for delirium in adult patients regardless of delirium subtype.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and results of endovascular treatment for these lesions. We retrospectively reviewed our experience and results of endovascular treatments for a series of nine consecutive patients with PcomA aneurysms occurring at the origin of fetal PCAs at the Department of Neurosurgery of Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, China, between June 2011 and June 2014. Depending on the angiographic findings, location and shape of the aneurysms, various therapeutic strategies were used including coiling by single or double microcatheter, balloon remodeling technique, and single or Y-stenting technique. Overall, fetal PCA was preserved patent in all cases, and complete or near complete occlusion was achieved in 8/9 cases. There was no procedure-related morbidity or mortality.

Day-to-day life changed for 15% of the Swedish population. The aim of the study was to explore how adults 70+ experienced and managed changes in everyday life due to the COVID-19 pandemic and how those changes affected wellbeing at the beginning of the virus outbreak. METHODS Eleven women and six men, (mean age 76 years), living in ordinary housing, participated in remote semi-structured interviews in April 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS The theme Suddenly at risk - '…but it could have been worse' included four categories My world closed down; Negotiations, adaptations and prioritizations to manage staying at home; Barriers and facilitators to sustain occupational participation; and Considerations of my own and other's health and wellbeing emerged from the data analysis. CONCLUSION Everyday life changes had implications for health and well-being. The participants questioned previous conceptions of meaning in relation to habitual activities, likely leading to consistent occupational changes. However, these long-term effects remain to be explored, and considered to enable older adult's health during the pandemic and beyond.","Fristedt, Sofi; Carlsson, Gunilla; Kylén, Maya; Jonsson, Oskar; Granbom, Marianne",Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy,654,1

The formulation is a unique quintessential blend of nine herbs cited in Ayurvedic texts for chronic cough and lung infection. Analytical standardization of herbal medicines is the pressing need of the hour to ascertain the quality compliance. This persuaded us to develop a simple, rapid, and selective high-performance thin-layer chromatographic method for Divya-Swasari-Vati quality standardization. The developed method was validated for the quantification of marker components, gallic acid, piperine, eugenol, cinnamic acid, against reference standards in five different batches of Divya-Swasari-Vati. The analytes were identified by visualization at 254 nm, and by matching their retention factor with authentic standards. The developed method was validated as per the guidelines recommended by the International Council for Harmonization for parameters like, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy, and precision. Therefore, the developed novel high-performance thin-layer chromatographic process could be employed for rapid standardization of Divya-Swasari-Vati and other related herbal formulation, which would aid in quality manufacturing and product development.

We investigated their prevalence, severity, co-occurrence and overlap. METHODS We interviewed 124 psychiatric outpatients with MDE using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II Disorders, the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI-IV), and about past (hypo)manic episodes, and stratified them according to the principal diagnosis into subcohorts of major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 50), bipolar disorder (BD, n = 43), and borderline personality disorder (BPD, n = 31). We quantified (hypo)manic symptoms using a novel semi-structured interview (MIXed symptoms during MDE, MIX-MDE) with good psychometric qualities. RESULTS The subcohorts did not differ in MDE severity. They differed significantly in some (hypo)manic symptoms being present on most days in 24% of MDD, 30% of BD, and 42% of BPD subcohort, but only 5% of the BD subcohort fulfilled the DSM-5 mixed features. The mean MIX-MDE scores were 5.7 (SD 4.0), 12.0 (8.2) and 10.5 (7.5), and BPDSI-IV scores 15.6 (7.0), 17.2 (6.2) and 26.9 (8.7), respectively (both p < 0.001). (Hypo)manic days and unspecific symptoms of distractibility and irritability inflated the correlation of observed (hypo)manic symptoms and borderline features. LIMITATIONS Moderate sample size, limited age variation (18-50 years); no previous validation of MIX-MDE. CONCLUSIONS Presence of some mixed and borderline features is common in MDEs, with overlap and diagnosis-specific differences. Unspecific symptoms of irritability and distractibility and the aggravating impact of hypomania on perceived BPD features blur the differential diagnosis.","Socada, J Lumikukka; Söderholm, John J; Rosenström, Tom; Ekelund, Jesper; Isometsä, Erkki",Journal of affective disorders,654,1

Mesh fixation with sutures may be a contributing factor to this pain. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of chronic pain and limitation of activities of daily living following inguinal hernia repair using a sutured mesh to a self-adhesive mesh, 6 months and 1 year following surgery. METHODS All consecutive patients presenting to NHS Fife for open hernia repair between January 2009 and January 2010 were included in our analysis. A prospective survey of postoperative pain and activities of daily living was conducted at 6 months and 1 year following hernia repair. Chronic pain was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. The primary end points for analysis were incidence of chronic pain and limitation of activities of daily living. RESULTS Overall, 132 of 215 patients completed the questionnaire, 69 in the sutured group and 63 in the self-adhesive mesh group. The need for analgesics was similar during the first 24 h after surgery. Wound infections were detected in one patient in the Lichtenstein group and two in the second group. The incidence of chronic pain was 21 and 7.9% at 6 months and 18.8 and 6.3% at 1 year (p < 0.05). Moderate and vigorous activities were found to be limited some to all of the time in nine patients (60%) in the suture fixation group and in one patient in the self-adhesive group (20%, p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Open inguinal hernia repair with a self-adhesive mesh may lead to less chronic pain and less restriction of activities of daily living than a sutured mesh fixation.","Quyn, A J; Weatherhead, K M; Daniel, T",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,654,1

BACKGROUND PEVI has emerged as a powerful tool in the management of acute proximal DVT. Instrumentation of extensive fresh thrombus is potentially associated with iatrogenic pulmonary embolism (PE). The true frequency of this complication has not been studied in a randomized fashion. We evaluated IVC filter implantation during PEVI for DVT. METHODS A total of 141 patients with symptomatic proximal DVT undergoing PEVI for symptomatic DVT were randomized to receive an IVC filter (70 patients) or no filter (71 patients; control group). The anticoagulation and PEVI regimen were similar between the two groups. Patients with development of symptoms suggestive of PE underwent objective testing for PE. RESULTS PE developed in 1 of the 14 symptomatic patients in the filter group and 8 of the 22 patients in the control group (P = 0.048). There was no mortality in any group. Three patients (4.2%) in the control group had transient hemodynamic instability necessitating resuscitory efforts. Predictors of iatrogenic PE were found to be PE at admission; involvement of two or more adjacent venous segments with acute thrombus; inflammatory form of DVT (severe erythema, edema, pain, and induration); and vein diameter of ≥7 mm with preserved architecture. CONCLUSIONS IVC filter implantation during PEVI reduces the risk of iatrogenic PE by eightfold without a mortality benefit. A selective approach may be exercised in filter implantation during PEVI.","Sharifi, Mohsen; Bay, Curt; Skrocki, Laura; Lawson, David; Mazdeh, Shahnaz",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,654,8

OBJECTIVE The objective of the present study was to compare coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms and outcomes in centenarians and other residents living in nursing homes. Design-Setting-Subjects-Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted using data from 15 nursing homes in the Marseille area. Older residents with confirmed COVID-19 between March and June 2020 were enrolled. The clinical and biological characteristics, the treatment measures, and the outcomes in residents living in these nursing homes were collected from the medical records. RESULTS A total of 321 residents were diagnosed with COVID-19 including 12 centenarians. The median age was 101 years in centenarians and 89 years in other residents. The most common symptoms were asthenia and fever. Three centenarians (25%) experienced a worsening of pre-existing depression (vs. 5.5% of younger residents; p = 0.032). Mortality was significantly higher in centenarians than in younger residents (50% vs. 21.3%, respectively; p = 0.031). A quarter of the younger residents and only one centenarian were hospitalized. However, 33.3% of the centenarians received treatment within the context of home hospitalization. CONCLUSION Worsening of pre-existing depression seems to be more frequent in centenarians with COVID-19 in nursing homes. This population had a higher mortality rate but a lower hospitalization rate than younger residents.","Couderc, Anne-Laure; Correard, Florian; Nouguerède, Emilie; Berbis, Julie; Rey, Dominique; Daumas, Aurélie; Villani, Patrick",Aging,654,31

OBJECTIVE To determine the relationship between the peak fourth-generation troponin T (TnT) measurement in the first 3 days after noncardiac surgery and 30-day mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, international cohort study that enrolled patients from August 6, 2007, to January 11, 2011. Eligible patients were aged 45 years and older and required at least an overnight hospital admission after having noncardiac surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients' TnT levels were measured 6 to 12 hours after surgery and on days 1, 2, and 3 after surgery. We undertook Cox regression analysis in which the dependent variable was mortality until 30 days after surgery, and the independent variables included 24 preoperative variables. We repeated this analysis, adding the peak TnT measurement during the first 3 postoperative days as an independent variable and used a minimum P value approach to determine if there were TnT thresholds that independently altered patients' risk of death. RESULTS A total of 15,133 patients were included in this study. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.7%-2.1%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that peak TnT values of at least 0.02 ng/mL, occurring in 11.6% of patients, were associated with higher 30-day mortality compared with the reference group (peak TnT ≤ 0.01 ng/mL): peak TnT of 0.02 ng/mL (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.41; 95% CI, 1.33-3.77); 0.03 to 0.29 ng/mL (aHR, 5.00; 95% CI, 3.72-6.76); and 0.30 ng/mL or greater (aHR, 10.48; 95% CI, 6.25-16.62). Patients with a peak TnT value of 0.01 ng/mL or less, 0.02, 0.03-0.29, and 0.30 or greater had 30-day mortality rates of 1.0%, 4.0%, 9.3%, and 16.9%, respectively. Peak TnT measurement added incremental prognostic value to discriminate those likely to die within 30 days for the model with peak TnT measurement vs without (C index = 0.85 vs 0.81; difference, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5; P < .001 for difference between C index values). The net reclassification improvement with TnT was 25.0% (P < .001). CONCLUSION Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, the peak postoperative TnT measurement during the first 3 days after surgery was significantly associated with 30-day mortality.","Devereaux, P J; Chan, Matthew T V; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Walsh, Michael; Berwanger, Otavio; Villar, Juan Carlos; Wang, C Y; Garutti, R Ignacio; Jacka, Michael J; Sigamani, Alben; Srinathan, Sadeesh; Biccard, Bruce M; Chow, Clara K; Abraham, Valsa; Tiboni, Maria; Pettit, Shirley; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Lurati Buse, Giovanna; Botto, Fernando; Guyatt, Gordon; Heels-Ansdell, Diane; Sessler, Daniel I; Thorlund, Kristian; Garg, Amit X; Mrkobrada, Marko; Thomas, Sabu; Rodseth, Reitze N; Pearse, Rupert M; Thabane, Lehana; McQueen, Matthew J; VanHelder, Tomas; Bhandari, Mohit; Bosch, Jackie; Kurz, Andrea; Polanczyk, Carisi; Malaga, German; Nagele, Peter; Le Manach, Yannick; Leuwer, Martin; Yusuf, Salim",JAMA,654,1

The World Health Organization's 2005 International Health Regulations have highlighted the need for countries to strengthen their capacities in this area to ensure effective responses to public health emergencies. We surveyed laboratories, hospitals, and public health institutions in Germany to detail the current situation regarding risk communication and crisis management and to identify which areas require further development. METHODS A mixed methods approach was adopted. An initial questionnaire was distributed to relevant persons in laboratories and hospitals, and semistructured interviews were conducted with selected participants. Representatives from state public health authorities, federal agencies, and media also were interviewed to add additional contextual information to the questionnaire responses. RESULTS Based on the responses received, the universal sense among key stakeholders was that risk communication and crisis communication measures must be improved. Collaborative working was a consistent theme, with participants suggesting that a partnering strategy could help to improve performance. This approach could be achieved through better coordination between groups, for example, through a knowledge-sharing policy. CONCLUSIONS More research is needed on how such collaboration might be implemented, along with a general conceptual framework for risk communication to underpin the overall strategy.","Dickmann, Petra; Biedenkopf, Nadine; Keeping, Sam; Eickmann, Markus; Becker, Stephan",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,654,5

The aim of this study was to compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with conventional mesh fixation using titanium tacks versus fibrin sealant (FS). METHODS This randomized clinical trial included patients with an umbilical hernia defect ranging from 1·5 to 5 cm at three Danish hernia centres. Participants were assigned randomly to FS or titanium tack fixation. The primary outcome was acute pain, defined as the mean pain score on days 0-2 after surgery, measured on a 0-100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS Forty patients were included, of whom 38 were available for intention-to-treat analysis after 1 month. Patients in the FS group reported less pain than those in the tack group on days 0-2, both at rest (median 19 versus 47 mm; P = 0·025) and during activity (38 versus 60 mm; P = 0·014). The absolute difference in pain score between groups was 19 (95 per cent confidence interval 3 to 34) and 20 (4 to 35) mm at rest and during activity respectively. Patients in the FS group resumed normal daily activity earlier (after median 7 versus 18 days; P = 0·027) and reported significantly less discomfort. No recurrences were observed. CONCLUSION Mesh fixation with FS in LVHR was associated with less acute postoperative pain, discomfort and a shorter convalescence than tack fixation. Long-term follow-up is needed to show whether the effect of FS fixation persists in terms of chronic pain and recurrence.

The consent procedure for cholecystectomy needs to inform patients about the possibility of subtotal cholecystectomy (STC) as an alternative procedure used for ""difficult gallbladders"" as it is associated with increased postoperative morbidity. We sought to determine the quality of informed consent for patients who were scheduled for cholecystectomy but underwent STC, and evaluate whether patient or procedural factors influenced the information discussed in consenting. Materials and Methods: We classified 57 components of information necessary for a patient to give informed consent for cholecystectomy. We retrospectively reviewed the consent forms of patients scheduled for conventional cholecystecomy but instead undergoing STC between 2011 and 2017. Consent quality was measured as the percentage of components completed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, setting (elective/nonelective), operation mode (open/laparoscopic), or the responsible surgeon affected consent quality. Results: Across 174 patients, just 9 (5.2%) had been informed about the possibility of undergoing STC, whereas the overall quality of consent was 37.5%. Patient and setting-specific factors affected the completion of specific consent components. Patients were more likely to receive a patient information leaflet if they were female (relative risk [RR] 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-7.00), <60 years (RR 3.32; 95% CI 1.39-7.90) or undergoing laparoscopic surgery (RR 8.04; 95% CI 2.50-25.88). Conclusion: The suboptimal quality of consent and multiple inconsistencies in the information disclosed to different patient cohorts emphasize the need for a more transparent and consistent consenting process.","Mesri, Mina; Nzenwa, Ikemsinachi C; Lunevicius, Raimundas",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We analyzed factors associated with radiographic pneumonias in febrile infants 60 days or younger evaluated in pediatric emergency departments. STUDY DESIGN We conducted a planned secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study within 26 emergency departments in a pediatric research network from 2008 to 2013. Febrile (≥38°C) infants 60 days or younger who received chest radiographs were included. Chest radiograph reports were categorized as ""no,"" ""possible,"" or ""definite"" pneumonia. We compared demographics, Yale Observation Scale scores (>10 implying ill appearance), laboratory markers, blood cultures, and viral testing among groups. RESULTS Of 4778 infants, 1724 (36.1%) had chest radiographs performed; 2.7% (n = 46) had definite pneumonias, and 3.9% (n = 67) had possible pneumonias. Patients with definite (13/46 [28.3%]) or possible (15/67 [22.7%]) pneumonias more frequently had Yale Observation Scale score >10 compared with those without pneumonias (210/1611 [13.2%], P = 0.002) in univariable and multivariable analyses. Median white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in the definite (WBC, 11.5 [interquartile range, 9.8-15.5]; ANC, 5.0 [3.2-7.6]; PCT, 0.4 [0.2-2.1]) versus no pneumonia (WBC, 10.0 [7.6-13.3]; ANC, 3.4 [2.1-5.4]; PCT, 0.2 [0.2-0.3]; WBC, P = 0.006; ANC, P = 0.002; PCT, P = 0.046) groups, but of unclear clinical significance.

OBJECTIVE Our study aims to assess the impact of only-child status on the mental health of adolescents confined at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. The exposure risk to COVID-19, adverse experience, parent-child relationship, and resilience have also been measured and considered. METHODS From March 20 to 31, 2020, a cross-sectional survey test was conducted on 11,681 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 years in middle schools (Grade 7 to Grade 9) across five provinces in China. The self-reported online questionnarie was used to collected data of demographic information, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the short form of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and the exposure risk to COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 11,180 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 95.7%. 35.2% of only children and 38.8% of non-only children reported depression symptoms, while 20.5% of only children and 24.7% of non-only children reported anxiety symptoms. It was significant that non-only children were more likely to have anxiety and depression symptoms than only children (OR = 1.164, 95%CI: 1.064-1.273, p = 0.001). The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was a risk factor of depression (OR = 2.284, 95%CI: 1.640-3.180, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.959, 95%CI: 1.402-2.737, p < 0.001) in non-only children, but not in only children. For both only children and non-only children, the resilience and parent-child relationship were protective factors of depression and anxiety symptoms, while emotional abuse was a risk factor (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The non-only children are more likely to develop the symptoms of anxiety and depression than only children, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The adolescents with siblings are psychiatrically more vulnerable to exposure risk of COVID-19 and need more attention, especially those with poor parent-child relationship, low resilience and experience of emotional abuse.","Cao, Yujia; Huang, Liyuan; Si, Tong; Wang, Ning Qun; Qu, Miao; Zhang, Xiang Yang",Journal of affective disorders,654,1

The literature has reported that the pandemic affects the hegemonic food system in various ways. In Brazil, the pandemic amplifies existing social, racial, and gender inequalities, further jeopardizing the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRAF) and the attainment of food and nutritional security, especially among more vulnerable groups. In this context, the article aims to analyze the first measures by the Brazilian Federal Government to mitigate the pandemic's effects and that may have repercussions on food and nutritional security, considering the recent institutional changes in policies and programs. A narrative literature review was performed, and the information sources were the bulletins of the Center for Coordination of Operations by the Crisis Committee for Supervising and Monitoring the Impacts of COVID-19 and homepages of various government ministries, from March to May 2020. The actions were systematized according to the guidelines of the National Policy for Food and Nutritional Security. The analysis identified the creation of institutional crisis management arrangements. The proposed actions feature those involving access to income, emergency aid, and food, such as authorization for food distribution outside schools with federal funds from the National School Feeding Program. However, the setbacks and dismantlement in food and nutritional security may undermine the Federal Government's capacity to respond to COVID-19.","Alpino, Tais de Moura Ariza; Santos, Cláudia Roberta Bocca; Barros, Denise Cavalcante de; Freitas, Carlos Machado de",Cadernos de saude publica,654,1

Because of this, the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescence is often unclear and few studies have compared adolescent and adult PCOS phenotype distribution and features. The aim is to compare phenotypes in adolescents and young adults with PCOS. METHODS 109 girls aged from 13 to 19 years were retrospectively studied. All patients had a gynecological age > 2 years. 63 patients were adolescents (3-5 years beyond menarche) while 46 patients were young adults (6-9 years beyond menarche). Diagnosis of different PCOS phenotypes (A, B, C, D) was made according to the Rotterdam criteria. Clinical data (menstrual cycles, BMI, presence of hirsutism), androgen circulating levels (total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) and ovarian morphology by ultrasound were assessed. RESULTS 109 patients presented PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria. Phenotype A was by far the most common phenotype (73.4%) followed by phenotype B (21.1%). Only few patients had phenotype C (4.6%) or phenotype D (0.9%). When patients were divided in two groups (adolescent and young adult patients), no significant difference in prevalence and features of the different phenotypes was observed. CONCLUSION In this cohort of adolescent and young adult women with PCOS, the progression of age does not change the prevalence and the features of main PCOS phenotypes. It suggests that the Rotterdam criteria might be used also in adolescents, at least in those with 2 or more years of gynecological age, for the diagnosis of PCOS.","Fruzzetti, F; Baldari, F; Palla, G; Fidecicchi, T; Carmina, E",Journal of endocrinological investigation,654,6

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a commonly performed cancer procedure, where variation in UPV represents a gap in care for prostate cancer patients. Here, we systematically synthesize the rates, reasons, predictors, and interventions for UPV after RP, to inform evidence-based quality improvement (QI) initiatives. METHODS A systematic review was performed for studies from 2000-2020 using keywords: ""readmission,"" ""emergency room/department,"" ""unplanned visit,"" and ""prostatectomy."" Studies that focused on UPV following RP and that reported rates, reasons, predictors, or interventions, were included. Data was extracted via a standardized form. Meta-analysis was completed. RESULTS Sixty studies, with 406 107 RP patients, were eligible; 16 028 UPV events (~5%) were analyzed from 317 050 RP patients. UPV rates after RP varied between studies (ER visit range 6-24%; re-admissions range 0-56%). The 30-day and 90-day ER visit rates were 12% and 14%, respectively; the 30-day and 90-day re-admission rates were 4% and 9%, respectively. A total of 55% of all re-admissions after RP are directly due to postoperative genitourinary (GU)-related complications such as strictures, obstructions, fistula, bladder-related, incontinence, urine leak, renal problems, and other unspecified urinary complications. The next most common readmission reasons were anastomosis-related, infection-related, cardiovascular/pulmonary events, and wound-related issues. Thirty-four percent of all ER visits after RP are directly due to urine-related issues such as retention, urinoma, obstruction, leak, and catheter problems. The next most common ER visit reasons were abdominal/gastrointestinal issues, infection-related, venous thromboembolic events, and wound-related issues. Predictors for increased re-admission included: open RP, lymph node dissection, Charlson comorbidity index≥2, low surgeon/hospital case volume, and socioeconomic determinants of health. Of the 10 interventions evaluated, a 3.4% average reduction in UPV rate was observed, highlighting an approximate two-fold decrease. Meta-analysis demonstrated a significant benefit of interventions over controls with odds ratio 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.46-0.84). Interventions that used multidisciplinary, nurse-centered, programs, with patient self-care/empowerment were more beneficial than algorithmic patient care pathways and preoperative patient education. CONCLUSIONS Twenty years of international, retrospective, experience suggests UPV after RP are often related to GU complications, infection- or wound-related factors. QI interventions to reduce UPV should target these factors. While many re-admissions after RP appear to be unavoidable, ER visits have more opportunity for volume reduction by QI. The interventions evaluated herein have potential to reduce UPV after RP.","Mukkala, Avinash N; Song, Jasmine B; Lee, Michelle; Boasie, Alexandra; Irish, Jonathan; Finelli, Antonio; Wei, Alice C",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,654,1

Historically, upper and lower respiratory illness has been cared for at home or in the ambulatory primary care setting. It is likely that patients experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms may first contact their primary care provider. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a representative sample of patients from the United States that regularly assesses their use of medical care services. We analyzed 2017 MEPS data to determine the number and proportion of patients who were seen in primary care or family medicine ambulatory settings or hospitalized for upper or lower respiratory illness or pneumonia. In a given year, 19.5 million patients are seen by primary care for an upper respiratory illness, 10.7 million patients for bronchitis, and 9 million for pneumonia. In contrast, 890,000 patients are hospitalized with pneumonia. Given that a primary etiology for respiratory illness in early 2020 was SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19), primary care practices likely were the site of first contact for most patients with COVID-19 illness. Unfortunately, there has been inadequate support for in-person and telehealth visits. Primary care clinicians reported serious shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing capacity. Inadequate reimbursement for telehealth visits coupled with decreased in-person visits put primary care practices at risk of layoffs and closure. Policies related to primary care payment, federal relief efforts, PPE access, testing and follow-up capacity, and telehealth technical support are essential so primary care can provide first contact and continuity for their patients and communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic response and recovery.","Westfall, John M; Jetty, Anuradha; Petterson, Stephen; Jabbarpour, Yalda",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,654,12

RESULTS The procedure was complete, and angiographic occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved 24 hours post treatment, as confirmed by digital subtraction angiography. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The case reported here was not suitable for Y stenting or deployment of the WEB device alone, due to the small caliber of both posterior cerebral arteries and their origin at the neck level. The main advantage of this technique is that both devices have a controlled detachment system and are fully independent. To our knowledge, this technique has not been reported previously and this modality of treatment has never been described in the literature.","Mihalea, Cristian; Caroff, Jildaz; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Pescariu, Sorin; Moret, Jacques; Spelle, Laurent",World neurosurgery,654,29

Synthesizing the evidence from similar patient populations may provide valuable insight. This review summarizes findings on therapeutic interventions for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence (IPV). METHOD We conducted two systematic reviews using the MEDLINE database. We included only randomized controlled trials of therapies with primary outcomes related to health for survivors of sexual assault and IPV. For the sexual assault review, there were 78 abstracts identified, 16 full-text articles reviewed, and 10 studies included. For the IPV review, there were 261 abstracts identified, 24 full-text articles reviewed, and 17 studies included. Analysis compared study size, intervention type, patient population, primary health outcomes, and treatment effect. RESULTS Although our search included physical and mental health outcomes, almost all the studies meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on mental health. The interventions for sexual assault included spiritually focused group therapy, interference control training, image rehearsal therapy, sexual revictimization prevention, educational videos, cognitive behavioral therapy, and exposure therapy. The interventions in the IPV review included group social support therapy, exposure therapy, empowerment sessions, physician counseling, stress management programs, forgiveness therapy, motivational interviewing, and interpersonal psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Insights from these reviews included the importance of culturally specific group therapy, the central role of survivor empowerment, and the overwhelming focus on mental health. These key features provide guidance for the development of interventions to improve the health of human trafficking survivors.","Menon, Blaine; Stoklosa, Hanni; Van Dommelen, Kaylee; Awerbuch, Adam; Caddell, Luke; Roberts, Ken; Potter, Jonell","Trauma, violence & abuse",654,28

Moreover, studies have yet to focus on key mechanisms of air pollution toxicity such as oxidative stress. OBJECTIVES To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). METHODS Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population and sociodemographic data for 140 neighbourhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM2.5. Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM2.5. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A significant positive association was observed between neighbourhood level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.15 per interquartile range ROS). Effect modification by neighbourhood-level measures of racialized group membership and socioeconomic status was also identified. CONCLUSIONS Examination of neighbourhood characteristics associated with COVID-19 incidence can identify inequalities and generate hypotheses for future studies.

Potassium (K) represents up to 10% of the plant's total dry biomass, and its deficiency makes plants highly susceptible to both abiotic and biotic stresses. K shortage results in the inhibition of root and shoots growth, but the underlying mechanism of this response is unclear. Our RNA-Seq and qPCR analysis suggested leading roles for JA pathway genes under K deficiency in rice. Notably, K deficiency and JA application produced similar phenotypic and transcriptional responses. Here, we integrated molecular, physiological and morphological studies to analyze the role of OsJAZ9 in JA homeostasis and K deficiency responses. We raised OsJAZ9 over-expression, knockdown, transcriptional reporter, translational reporter and C-terminal deleted translational reporter lines in rice to establish the role of JA signaling in K ion homeostasis. JA profiling revealed significantly increased JA-Ile levels in OsJAZ9 OE lines under K deficiency. Furthermore, we established that OsJAZ9 overexpression and knockdown result in K deficiency tolerance and sensitivity, respectively, by modulating various K transporters and root system architecture. Our data provide evidence on the crucial roles of OsJAZ9 for improving K deficiency tolerance in rice by altering JA levels and JA responses.","Singh, Ajit Pal; Pandey, Bipin K; Mehra, Poonam; Heitz, Thierry; Giri, Jitender",Plant molecular biology,654,5

Base-pairing to create the pseudoknot-forming stem (P1(pk)) is mutually exclusive with formation of stem P0a at the base of the bulged stem-loop; as a result, the two structures cannot be present simultaneously. Herein, we use thermodynamic methods to evaluate the ability of individual subdomains of the 3' UTR to adopt a pseudoknotted conformation. We find that an RNA capable of forming only the predicted PK (58 nt; 3' nucleotides 241-185) adopts the P2 stem-loop with little evidence for P1(pk) pairing in 0.1 M KCl and the absence of Mg(2+); as Mg(2+) or 1 M KCl is added, a new thermal unfolding transition is induced and assignable to P1(pk) pairing. The P1(pk) helix is only marginally stable, ΔG(25) ≈ 1.2 ± 0.3 kcal/mol (5.0 mM Mg(2+), 100 mM K(+)), and unfolded at 37°C. Similar findings characterize an RNA 5' extended through the P0b helix only (89 nt; 294-185). In contrast, an RNA capable of forming either the P0a helix or the pseudoknot (97 nt; 301-185) forms no P1(pk) helix. Thermal unfolding simulations are fully consistent with these experimental findings. These data reveal that the PK forms weakly and only when the competing double-hairpin structure cannot form; in the UTR RNA, the double hairpin is the predominant conformer under all solution conditions.","Stammler, Suzanne N; Cao, Song; Chen, Shi-Jie; Giedroc, David P",RNA,654,11

However, how these two potential roles come together under physiological settings remain unknown. Since both regulated exocytosis and NF-κB signaling are determinants of mast cell (MC) functions, we generated mice lacking ELKS1 in connective tissue MCs (Elks1f/f Mcpt5-Cre) and found that while ELKS1 is dispensable for NF-κB-mediated cytokine production, it is essential for MC degranulation both in vivo and in vitro. Impaired degranulation was caused by reduced transcription of Syntaxin 4 (STX4) and Syntaxin binding protein 2 (Stxpb2), resulting from a lack of ELKS1-mediated stabilization of lysine-specific demethylase 2B (Kdm2b), which is an essential regulator of STX4 and Stxbp2 transcription. These results suggest a transcriptional role for active-zone proteins like ELKS1 and suggest that they may regulate exocytosis through a novel mechanism involving transcription of key exocytosis proteins.","Lam, Hiu Yan; Arumugam, Surendar; Bae, Han Gyu; Wang, Cheng Chun; Jung, Sangyong; St John, Ashley Lauren; Hong, Wanjin; Han, Weiping; Tergaonkar, Vinay",Science advances,654,2

Achieving effective systemic exposure with oral formulations has been challenging. An intravenous lipid emulsion fenretinide formulation was developed to overcome this barrier. We conducted a study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous lipid emulsion fenretinide in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard treatments received fenretinide as a continuous infusion for five consecutive days in 21-day cycles. Five different dose cohorts were evaluated between doses of 905 mg/m2 and 1414 mg/m2 per day using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. A priming dose of 600 mg/m2 on day 1 was introduced in an attempt to address the asymptomatic serum triglyceride elevations related to the lipid emulsion. RESULTS The treatment-related adverse events occurring in ≥ 20% of patients were anemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fatigue, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase, thrombocytopenia, bilirubin increase, and dry skin. Five evaluable patients had stable disease as best response, and no patients had objective responses. Plasma steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite were significantly higher than with previous capsule formulations. CONCLUSION Fenretinide emulsion intravenous infusion had a manageable safety profile and achieved higher plasma steady-state concentrations of the active metabolite compared to previous capsule formulations.

Yet, cost-effective remediation technologies have been lacking. In this study, we prepared a type of FeSx based on commercial FeSO4.7H2O and CaSx and tested a microwave-assisted technology based on FeSx for reductive immobilization of high concentrations of Cr(VI) in a field contaminated soil. The as-prepared FeSx particles appeared as a honeycomb-like and highly porous structure. The microwave-assisted FeSx reduction process was able to rapidly reduce the TCLP-based reachability of Cr(VI) from 391.8 to 2.6 mg·L-1. The dosage of FeSx, S/Fe molar ratio, initial moisture content, microwave power, and irradiation time can all affect the treatment effectiveness. After 500 days curing under atmospheric conditions, the TCLP-leached concentration of Cr remained below the regulatory limit of 5 mg·L-1, while other treatments failed to meet the goal. Sx2- or S2- served as the primary electron donors, whereas Fe facilitated the microwave absorption and the formation of the stable final product of FeCr2O4. S and Fe are mostly precipitated in soil. The microwave-assisted FeSx reduction was shown to be an effective approach to rapidly reduce the leachability of Cr(VI) in contaminated soil, especially in heavily contaminated soil.","Wang, Jianle; Liu, Xueming; Zhu, Zhihua; Yuan, Le; Zhao, Dongye; Deng, Hong; Lin, Zhang",Journal of hazardous materials,654,29

A multishot trajectory composed of pseudo-random rotations of a single multiecho radial readout was developed. The trajectory is designed to give incoherent aliasing artifacts and a relatively uniform distribution of projections over all time scales. A field map (computed from the same data set) is used to avoid signal dropout in regions of substantial field inhomogeneity. A compressed sensing reconstruction using the GraDeS algorithm was used. Whole brain angiograms were reconstructed at 1-mm isotropic resolution and a 1.1-s frame rate (corresponding to an acceleration factor > 100). The only parameter which must be chosen is the number of iterations of the GraDeS algorithm. A larger number of iterations improves the temporal behavior at cost of decreased image signal-to-noise ratio.

The aim of this study was to analyze the angiographic and clinical outcomes of GVBAs treated by various endovascular procedures. Methods: Between January 2010 and September 2018, 27 patients with 27 GVBAs treated endovascularly were enrolled in this consecutive study. The clinical and angiographic features, treatment modalities, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: The patient cohort comprised 21 men (77.8%) and 6 women (22.2%) of mean age 42.7 ± 18.9 years (range, 6-65 years). The most common presenting symptom was compressive symptoms, present in 15 patients (55.6%). None of the GVBAs was ruptured. Of the 27 GVBAs, 23 aneurysms were dissecting aneurysm with intramural hematoma and 4 aneurysms were saccular. Regarding treatment approach, internal trapping was used in 5 aneurysms, stent-assisted coil embolization in 10, sole stenting in 4, and flow diverters in 8. Overall, 12 patients (44.4%) had an unfavorable angiographic or clinical outcome: 3 patients presented with post-operative complications and subsequent death, and 9 with poor prognosis during follow-up. Conclusions: Patients with GVBAs may not benefit from endovascular treatment.

We performed a prospective study to evaluate if NT-proBNP could be a sensitive marker of overall postoperative outcomes in older patients undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery when combined with myoglobin (MYO). Methods: Two hundred and three adults aged ≥65 years were enrolled in the study. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of patients were I to IV. Blood samples would be taken before and 2 h after the surgery for each patients and NT-proBNP and MYO concentrations (NT-proBNP baseline/ 2 h and MYO baseline/ 2 h) of these samples would be measured immediately. The primary outcome was moderate to severe complications, which were based on the Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) scheme (≥CDC grade 3), and the secondary outcomes were major complications within 30 days after surgery. This study was registered at China Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900026223, http://www.chictr.org.cn/). Results: Overall, moderate to severe complications occurred in 15 patients (7.4%) and major complications occurred in 18 patients (8.9%). Both preoperative and postoperative NT-proBNP values were independent predictors of moderate to severe complications (area under the curve (AUC), 0.820; 95% CI: 0.728, 0.912, P < 0.001; AUC, 0.785; 95% CI: 0.685, 0.885, P < 0.001). When NT-proBNP baseline and MYO-2 h were combined (NT-proBNP baseline × MYO-2 h), the predictive power was improved (AUC 0.841, 95% CI: 0.758, 0.923, P < 0.001). Conclusions: A combination of perioperative NT-proBNP and postoperative MYO concentrations was a good predictor of postoperative complications in elderly patients who underwent major non-cardiac surgery. Using fast and dynamic tests provided by point-to-care-testing, NT-proBNP and MYO concentration measurements provided useful guidance for therapy before or soon after surgery, thus helping to reduce postoperative complications in elderly patients.","Zhao, Yi; Hao, Xuechao; Zhu, Yihao; Chen, Mingkai; Ou, Mengchan; Zhu, Tao",Frontiers in medicine,654,31

With the recent implementation of first-level public health emergency response (FLPHER) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China (a total of 77 041 confirmed cases by February 22, 2020), human activities were extremely decreased nationwide and almost all economic activities were suspended. Here, we show that this scenario represents an unprecedented ""base period"" to probe the short-term emission control effect of air pollution at a city level. We quantify the FLPHER-induced changes of NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in 174 cities in China. A machine learning prediction model for air pollution is established by coupling a generalized additive model, random effects meta-analysis, and weather research and forecasting model with chemistry analysis. The short-term control effect under the current energy structure in each city is estimated by comparing the predicted and observed results during the FLPHER period. We found that the short-term emission control effect ranges within 53.0%-98.3% for all cities, and southern cities show a significantly stronger effect than northern cities (P < 0.01).

Although C2CA provides a high amplification efficiency with a negligible increase of false-positive risk, it contains several step-by-step operation processes. We herein demonstrate a homogeneous and isothermal nucleic acid quantification strategy based on C2CA and optomagnetic analysis of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) assembly. The proposed homogeneous circle-to-circle amplification eliminates the need for additional monomerization and ligation steps after the first round of RCA, and combines two amplification rounds in a one-pot reaction. The second round of RCA produces amplicon coils that anneal to detection probes grafted onto MNPs, resulting in MNP assembly that can be detected in real-time using an optomagnetic sensor. The proposed methodology was applied for the detection of a synthetic complementary DNA of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also known as 2019-nCoV) RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) coding sequence, achieving a detection limit of 0.4 fM with a dynamic detection range of 3 orders of magnitude and a total assay time of ca. 100 min. A mathematical model was set up and validated to predict the assay performance. Moreover, the proposed method was specific to distinguish SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sequences with high similarity.","Tian, Bo; Gao, Fei; Fock, Jeppe; Dufva, Martin; Hansen, Mikkel Fougt",Biosensors & bioelectronics,654,6

There are considerable intercenter variations in treatment delivery. We analyzed the trends of door-to-needle times (DNTs) in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke registry between 2003 and 2011. METHODS We extracted from the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke registry (n=45 079) year of treatment, center code, DNT, sex, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and comorbidity. For each center, the year they joined the registry and the annual volume of patients were determined (<5, 5-24, 25-49, 50-74, 75-99, and ≥100 patients/y). RESULTS DNT was not available for 720 (1.6%) patients. The overall mean (SD) DNT was 73 (37) minutes with a median (interquartile range) of 67 (47-91) minutes. The DNT was 65 (46-90), 68 (50-92), and 72 (51-98) minutes for centers joined early (2003-2005), later (2006-2009), and recently (2009-2011), respectively. Center volume had more robust effect on DNT than year of treatment, and the shortest DNTs were seen in centers with volumes ≥100 patients/y. Earlier enrollment period was also associated with shorter delays. CONCLUSIONS Centers that joined the registry earlier and those with high annual volume achieved shorter DNT than centers that joined later and low-volume centers. However, in most of the centers, DNT did not change much during the registry period. A multicenter project aiming to reduce DNT is warranted.","Strbian, Daniel; Ahmed, Niaz; Wahlgren, Nils; Lees, Kennedy R; Toni, Danilo; Roffe, Christine; Surakka, Ida L; Tatlisumak, Turgut",Stroke,654,32

Method The Hearing Education and Research (HEAR) presentation, which included activities and videos to educate a group of ethnically diverse adolescents (n = 100) on NIHL, was created by 11 doctor of audiology (AuD) students through online collaborations toward course-related eSL requirements. Adolescents responded to a baseline survey to assess hearing health-related behaviors prior to reviewing the presentation. A postprogram survey was administered 1 week after the presentation to assess change in knowledge and attitudes toward NIHL prevention. Online collaborations with schoolteachers helped with project implementation. Postreflection papers written by AuD students regarding the eSL activities were analyzed. Lastly, suggestions from a focus group of educators were included that highlight the role of interprofessional collaborations to enhance school-based hearing conservation opportunities. Results The HEAR presentation resulted in changes in knowledge about NIHL among the adolescents. Postreflection papers by the AuD students indicated that the eSL activity served as a high-impact pedagogical assignment, especially during the academic challenges of the pandemic.

RNAi is a naturally occurring gene regulatory mechanism, which has a number of advantages over other gene/antisense therapies including specificity of inhibition, potency, the small size of the molecules and the diminished risk of toxic effects, e.g., immune responses. Targeted, local delivery of RNAi to the lungs via inhalation offers a unique opportunity to treat a range of previously untreatable or poorly controlled respiratory conditions. In this timely review we look at the potential applications of RNAi in the lungs for the treatment of a range of diseases including inflammatory and immune conditions, cystic fibrosis, infectious disease and cancer. In 2006 Alnylam initiated the first phase 1 clinical study of an inhaled siRNA for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus. If its potential as a therapeutic is to be realized, then safe and efficient means of targeted delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the lungs must be developed.

Such a counter-intuitive approach can be considered when more conventional interventions fail. The development of targeted cancer therapies has enabled the selective inhibition of activated oncogenic signaling pathways. However, in advanced cancers, such therapies, on average, deliver modest benefits due to the development of resistance. Here, we review the perspective of a ""paradoxical intervention"" in cancer therapy: rather than attempting to inhibit oncogenic signaling, the proposed therapy would further activate mitogenic signaling to disrupt the labile homeostasis of cancer cells and overload stress response pathways. Such overactivation can potentially be combined with stress-targeted drugs to kill overstressed cancer cells. Although counter-intuitive, such an approach exploits intrinsic and ubiquitous differences between normal and cancer cells. We discuss the background underlying this unconventional approach and how such intervention might address some current challenges in cancer therapy.","Dias, Matheus Henrique; Bernards, René",Molecular oncology,654,4

Function-preserving and minimally invasive pancreatectomy may be an ideal approach for these tumors. METHODS The authors retrospectively evaluated their initial experiences with five consecutive robotic central pancreatectomies (CPs). They also compared the perioperative outcome for open CPs performed in their institution. RESULTS The five women in the study had a median age of 45 years (range 36-64 years). A solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was found in four patients, and a pancreatic endocrine tumor was found in one patient. The tumor was relatively small (median size, 1.5 cm; range, 1-2 cm). All remnant pancreases were managed using pancreaticogastrostomy. The median operation time was 480 min (range 360-480 min), and the median estimated intraoperative bleeding was 200 ml (range 100-600 ml). No transfusion was given during the perioperative period. The median hospital stay was 12 days (range 9-28 days). Only one patient experienced postoperative pancreatic fistula (grade B), which was managed using the percutaneous drainage procedure. No operative morality was noted. In a comparative analysis with open CP, the robotic CP group demonstrated a smaller asymptomatic (17 out of 10 patients vs none, p = 0.026) tumor (5.9 ± 6.4 vs 1.4 ± 0.4 cm; p = 0.055), a longer operation time (286.5 ± 90.2 vs 432.0 ± 65.7 min, p = 0.013), and less intraoperative bleeding (432.0 ± 65.7 vs 286.5 ± 90.2 ml, p = 0.013). CONCLUSION Central pancreatectomy can be selected carefully as an appropriate surgical option for benign and borderline malignant lesions limited to the pancreatic neck area.

However, the association between preoperative frailty and POD remains difficult to characterize owing to the large number of frailty and POD assessment tools used in the literature, only a few of which are validated. Furthermore, some validated frailty tools fail to provide clear score cutoffs for distinguishing frail and nonfrail patients. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between preoperative frailty and POD. METHODS We searched several major databases for articles that investigated the relationship between preoperative frailty and POD in patients with mean age ≥65 years who were undergoing elective, nonemergent inpatient surgery. Inclusion criteria included articles published in English no earlier than 1999. Both preoperative frailty and POD must have been measured with validated tools using clear cutoff scores for frailty and delirium. Articles were selected and data extracted independently by 2 researchers. Risk of bias (ROBINS-I) and presence of confounders were summarized. Odds ratios (ORs) for POD associated with frailty relative to nonfrailty were computed with adjusted ORs when available. Original estimates were pooled by random effects analysis. Statistical significance was set at 2-sided P < .05. RESULTS Nine studies qualified for meta-analysis. The Fried score or a modified version of it was used in 5 studies. Frailty prevalence ranged from 18.6% to 56%. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) or Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in 7 studies, Delirium Observation Scale in 1 study, and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist in 1 study. The incidence of POD ranged from 7% to 56%. ROBINS-I risk of bias was low in 1 study, moderate in 4 studies, serious in 3 studies, and critical in 1 study. Random effects analysis (n = 794) of the OR for POD in frail versus nonfrail patients based on adjusted OR estimates was significant with an OR of 2.14 and a 95% confidence interval of 1.43-3.19. The I2 value was in the low range at 5.5, suggesting small variability from random effects. Funnel-plot analysis did not definitively support either the presence or absence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis provides evidence for a significant association between preoperative frailty and POD in elective surgical patients age 65 years or older.","Gracie, Thomas J; Caufield-Noll, Christine; Wang, Nae-Yuh; Sieber, Frederick E",Anesthesia and analgesia,654,1

METHODS We retrospectively collected the clinical and imaging data of 96 patients in Yunnan Province, China, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 22 and March 15, 2020. Based on disease severity, the COVID-19 patients were classified into four types: mild (n=15), moderate (n=59), severe (n=19), and critical (n=3). Based on hospital stay and number of computed tomography (CT) scans, the clinical/disease course was divided into four stages, including stage 1 (days 0-4), stage 2 (days 5-9), stage 3 (days 10-14), and stage 4 (days 15-19). The HRCT findings, CT value, and lesion volume were analyzed for each stage and compared among the four stages of COVID-19 patients. RESULTS CT findings were negative over the four stages for all mild COVID-19 patients. More lesions were found in the peripheral lung fields than in peripheral + central fields (P<0.05), and the number of negative patients in stage 4 were more than those in stages 1-3 (P<0.05). The left and right lower lobe were the most frequently affected lobes (P<0.05). In moderate patients, round ground glass opacities (GGOs) decreased from stage 1 to stage 4; partial consolidation peaked in stage 2 and then decreased in stages 3-4; fibrous stripes and subpleural lines increased from stage 1 and peaked in stage 4. Partial consolidation and consolidation were more common in severe patients than in moderate patients over the disease course (P<0.05). Critical patients showed significant partial consolidation and consolidation; The CT value, lesion volume and lesion volume percentage significantly decreased from stages 1-2 to stage 4 (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The dynamic changes in lung HRCT images are clinically related to the disease course of COVID-19.","Huang, Yilong; Li, Zhipeng; Guo, Honglei; Han, Dan; Yuan, Feng; Xie, Ying; Li, Zhi; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Peng; Yang, Yan; Li, Yudan; Ma, Jiyao; Hu, Chunzhang; Wang, Haolei; Zhao, Wei; Yi, Wenfang; Peng, Yan; Jiang, Yuanming; Li, Zhanfeng; Yang, Duiming; Wu, Kaiming; Li, Yuchang; Feng, Zaihui; Liu, Chaohai; Zhu, Guangkun; Han, Yongyun; He, Shaofei; He, Bo; Zhang, Zhenguang; Pi, Jiangyuan",Annals of palliative medicine,654,1

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.

Laparoscopic ileostomy reversal (LIR) with lysis of adhesions has potential benefits over conventional open surgery. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of laparoscopic and open ileostomy reversal. METHODS 133 consecutive patients undergoing ileostomy reversal at our institution between June 2009 and August 2013 were analyzed using a retrospective database. The group comprised 53 laparoscopic cases and 80 open cases, performed by four surgeons at a single center. The data were analyzed for patient demographics, operative characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS The two groups had comparable mean age, gender distribution, ASA scores, and BMI. The laparoscopic group had a significantly longer duration of surgery compared to the open reversal group (109 versus 93 min, p < 0.05). However, this group underwent more lysis of adhesions (60.4 % versus 26.3 %, p < 0.01) as well as concurrent stoma site mesh reinforcement (32.1 % versus 6.3 %, p < 0.01). In the laparoscopy group, 20.7 % of patients underwent intra-corporeal ileo-ileal anastomosis. There were no significant differences between the laparoscopic and open groups with regard to estimated blood loss (31 versus 40 ml, respectively) or mean length of stay (5.3 vs. 5.7 days, respectively). The rates of overall 30-day morbidity (16.9 % for laparoscopic vs. 21.3 % for open) as well as rates of specific complications were equivalent between groups. 30-day mortalities were not noted in either group. CONCLUSION LIR is safe and effective with low perioperative morbidity and mortality. The use of laparoscopy as an option in terms of concomitant hernia repair and lysis of adhesions may be considered in selected patients.","Young, Monica T; Hwang, Grace S; Menon, Gopal; Feldmann, Timothy F; Jafari, Mehraneh D; Jafari, Fariba; Perez, Eden; Pigazzi, Alessio",World journal of surgery,654,16

However, disease behaviour and survival patterns remain uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively assessed the impact of lymph nodes and CRH on outcomes, including survival, in all aNET patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2016. RESULTS 102 patients (52F, 50 M), median age 39.4 (range 16.3-81.1) years, were diagnosed with aNET. Mean tumour size was 12.7 (range 1-60) mm, most sited in appendiceal tip (63%). Index surgery was appendicectomy in 79% of cases while the remainder underwent colectomy. CRH performed in 30 patients at a median 3.2 (range 1.4-9.8) months post-index surgery yielded residual disease in nine: lymph nodes (n = 8) or residual tumour (n = 1). Univariate logistic regression showed residual disease was significantly predicted by tumour size ≥2 cm (p = 0.020). Four patients declined CRH, but did not suffer relapse or reduced survival. One patient developed recurrence after 16.5 years of follow-up and another patient developed a second neuroendocrine tumour after 18.8 years follow-up. There were 5 deaths; one being aNET-related. 5-year and 10-year overall survival were 99% and 92% respectively; 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival were 98% and 92% respectively. Only 5-year relapse-free survival was affected by ENETS stage (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION aNETs are indolent with very high rates of overall and relapse-free survival. Recurrence is rare, and in this series only occurred decades later, making a compelling case for selective surveillance and follow-up. The significance of positive lymph nodes and the necessity for completion right hemicolectomy remain unclear.","Alabraba, Edward; Pritchard, David Mark; Griffin, Rebecca; Diaz-Nieto, Rafael; Banks, Melissa; Cuthbertson, Daniel James; Fenwick, Stephen",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,654,1

METHODS Patients with COVID-19 who needed non-invasive ventilation in one critical care medicine ward of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital during the team support period from the department of critical care medicine of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 23rd to February 15th in 2020 were investigated retrospectively. Ramsay score, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) before sedation and at 1, 12, 24 hours after sedation, sleep time were collected, and the side effects such as excessive sedation, fall of tongue, abdominal distension, aspiration, bradycardia, escalation to invasive mechanical ventilation during 24 hours were also collected. According to different sedative drugs, patients were divided into the control group (without sedative drugs), dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group. The changes of indicators among the three groups were compared. RESULTS Fourteen patients were injected with dexmedetomidine (loading dose of 1 μg/kg for 10 minutes, maintained at 0.2-0.7 μg×kg-1×h-1); 9 patients were injected with midazolam (loading dose of 0.05 mg/kg for 2 minutes, maintained at 0.02-0.10 mg×kg-1×h-1); 12 patients didn't use sedative drugs due to limitations of previous hospital or patients' rejection. In dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group, the Ramsay score was maintained at 2-3 points after sedation, which were higher than those of control group at different time points after sedation, and there was no significant difference between dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group. MAP of dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group decreased gradually after sedation. MAP after 1-hour sedation was significantly lower than that before sedation, and MAP after 24 hours sedation was significantly lower than that in the control group [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 109.7±11.5, 107.1±12.3 vs. 121.1±13.3, both P < 0.05]. HR decreased gradually after sedation treatment, which was significantly lower after 12 hours of sedation than that before sedation, and HR in dexmedetomidine group was significantly lower than that in control group after 12 hours of sedation (bpm: 84.0±13.9 vs. 92.8±15.4 at 12 hours; 81.0±16.7 vs 92.6±12.7 at 24 hours, both P < 0.05). PaO2 increased and RR decreased in all three groups after ventilation. PaO2 in dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group were significantly higher than that in the control group after 12 hours of sedation [cmH2O (1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa): 79.0±6.5, 79.0±8.9 vs. 70.0±7.8, both P < 0.05]; the decreases of RR in dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group were significant than that in control group after 1 hour of sedation (bpm: 34.0±3.9, 33.8±4.6 vs. 39.0±3.6, both P < 0.05). There were no differences of MAP, HR, PaO2 and RR between dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group at different time points. The sleep duration in dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group were significantly longer than that in the control group (hours: 4.9±1.9, 5.8±2.4 vs. 3.0±1.8, both P < 0.05), but there was no difference between dexmedetomidine group and midazolam group (P > 0.05). Adverse events occurred in all three groups. In midazolam group, there were 2 cases of excessive sedation with fall of tongue and abdominal distension, including 1 case of aspiration, 1 case receiving intubation due to refractory hypoxemia and 1 case due to unconsciousness. In dexmedetomidine group, there were 2 cases of bradycardia, 1 case of intubation due to refractory hypoxemia. In control group, 4 cases underwent intubation due to refractory hypoxemia. CONCLUSIONS Non-invasive mechanical ventilation is an important respiratory support technology for patients with severe COVID-19. Appropriate sedation can increase the efficiency of non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine is more effective and safer than midazolam in these patients, but attention should be paid to HR and blood pressure monitoring.","Xie, Wenjie; Zhong, Zhentong; Li, Guang; Hou, Guo; Huang, Kesheng; Yu, Zhui",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,654,1

AIMS This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tube tip-modified stylet curve on the intubation time in children METHODS: Children aged 1-5 years were randomly assigned to either the standard curve (group S, n=60) or tip-modified curve (group T, n=60) groups. In group S, the ETT curve was similar to that in the GlideScope. In group T, a point approximately 1.5 cm from the tube tip was additionally angled to the left by 15°-20°. The primary outcome was the total intubation time, and the secondary outcomes were incidence of successful intubation in the first attempt, number of additional manipulations of the stylet curve, and visual analogue scale (VAS) score for the easiness of intubation. RESULTS The mean total intubation time was significantly longer ingroup S than that in group T (13.9 [10.8] vs. 9.0 [3.4] sec, mean difference, 4.9 sec; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-7.8; P=0.001). All patients in group T were successfully intubated in the first attempt whereas those in group S were not (100% vs. 93.3%, relative risk [RR], 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-2.02; P=0.1376). Three patients in group S could be intubated after modifying the ETT curve similar to that in group T.

Stress experienced by nursing students is a common precursor of psychological distress and attrition. However, no scale is specifically used to evaluate the sources of stress experienced by nursing students in Mainland China. Aims and Objective. This study is aimed at testing and comparing the reliability and validity including sensitivity and specificity of two nursing students' stress instruments, the Chinese version of Student Nurse Stress Index Scale (SNSI-CHI), and the Stressors in Student Nursing Scale (SINS-CN) in Chinese nursing students, and describing the stress status of nursing students in China. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in two nursing schools in Henan Province from August 2017 to January 2018. Data were collected by using a questionnaire comprising the Chinese version of SNSI (SNSI-CHI), the Chinese version of SINS (SINS-CN), and the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Homogeneity and stability, content, construct and concurrent validity, and sensitivity and specificity were assessed. Results The Cronbach's alpha (α) of SNSI-CHI was 0.90, and the item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.35 to 0.66. The Cronbach's α of SINS-CN was 0.93, and the item-to-total correlations ranged from 0.19 to 0.61. The findings of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) confirmed a good construct validity of SNSI-CHI and SINS-CN. The Pearson's rank correlation coefficients, between total scores of SNSI-CHI and CPSS and SINS-CN and CPSS, were assessed to 0.38 (P < 0.01) and 0.39 (P < 0.01), respectively. Regarding the CPSS, as the criterion, the cut-points of SNSI-CHI and SINS-CN for the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.77and 0.66, respectively. Conclusion Both scales are valid and reliable for evaluating the source of stress of student nurses in China. Each has its own characteristics, but the SNSI-CHI demonstrated marginal advantage over the SINS-CN. The SNSI-CHI is short, is easily understood, and with clear dimension for the nursing students, and the SNSI-CHI is more acceptable for the users in China.","Zhu, Yiru; Liu, Yanjin; Guo, Lina; Jones, Martyn C; Guo, Yuanli; Yv, Suyuan; Guo, Yvru; Namassevayam, Genoosha; Wei, Miao",BioMed research international,654,26

However, the contribution of each aspect of arterial load could be substantially different. In this study, we evaluated the agreement of eight non-commercial algorithms of pulse pressure analysis for estimating cardiac output (PPCO) with esophageal Doppler cardiac output (EDCO) during acute changes of arterial load. In addition, we aimed to determine the optimal arterial load parameter that could detect a clinically significant difference between PPCO and the EDCO. METHODS We included mechanically ventilated patients monitored with a prototype esophageal Doppler (CardioQ-Combi™, Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK) and an indwelling arterial catheter who received a fluid challenge or in whom the vasoactive medication was introduced or modified. Initial calibration of PPCO was made with the baseline value of EDCO. We evaluated several aspects of arterial load: total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR=mean arterial pressure [MAP]/EDCO*80), net arterial compliance (C=EDCO-derived stroke volume/pulse pressure), and effective arterial elastance (Ea=0.9*systolic blood pressure/EDCO-derived stroke volume). We compared CO values with Bland-Altman analysis, four-quadrant plot and a modified polar plot (with least significant change analysis). RESULTS A total of 16,964-paired measurements in 53 patients were performed (median 271; interquartile range: 180-415). Agreement of all PPCO algorithms with EDCO was significantly affected by changes in arterial load, although the impact was more pronounced during changes in vasopressor therapy. When looking at different parameters of arterial load, the predictive abilities of Ea and C were superior to TSVR and MAP changes to detect a PPCO-EDCO discrepancy≥10% in all PPCO algorithms. An absolute Ea change>8.9±1.7% was associated with a PPCO-EDCO discrepancy≥10% in most algorithms. CONCLUSIONS Changes in arterial load profoundly affected the agreement of PPCO and EDCO, although the contribution of each aspect of arterial load to the PPCO-EDCO discrepancies was significantly different. Changes in Ea and C mainly determined PPCO-EDCO discrepancy.","Monge García, Manuel Ignacio; Romero, Manuel Gracia; Cano, Anselmo Gil; Rhodes, Andrew; Grounds, Robert Michael; Cecconi, Maurizio",Critical care,654,31

Because expression of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), and chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been demonstrated in breast cancer, targeting these receptors using radioligands might offer new imaging and therapeutic opportunities for breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to correlate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of GRPR, SSTR2, and CXCR4 with clinicopathologic and biologic factors, and with prognosis and prediction to therapy response, in order to identify specific breast cancer patient groups suited for the application of radioligands targeting these receptors. METHODS First, we studied GRPR and SSTR2 expression in 13 clinical breast cancer specimens by in vitro autoradiography and correlated this with corresponding mRNA levels to investigate whether mRNA levels reliably represent cell surface expression. Next, GRPR, SSTR2, and CXCR4 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 915 primary breast cancer tissues and correlated with known clinicopathologic and biologic factors, disease-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival (DFS, MFS, and OS, respectively). In 224 adjuvant hormonal treatment-naïve estrogen receptor (ER, ESR1)-positive patients who received tamoxifen as first-line therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, the expression levels of the receptors were correlated with progression-free survival. RESULTS Our results showed a significant positive correlation between GRPR and SSTR2 expression analyzed by in vitro autoradiography and by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [Rs]=0.94, P<0.001, and Rs=0.73, P=0.0042, respectively). Furthermore, high GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels were observed more frequently in ESR1-positive specimens, whereas high CXCR4 expression was associated with ESR1-negative specimens. Also, high mRNA expression of CXCR4 was associated with a prolonged DFS, MFS, and OS (multivariate hazard ratio MFS=0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.90], P=0.001), whereas high mRNA levels of GRPR were associated with a prolonged progression-free survival after the start of first-line tamoxifen treatment (multivariate hazard ratio=0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.97], P=0.031). CONCLUSION Our data indicate that imaging and therapy using GRPR or SSTR2 radioligands might especially be beneficial for ESR1-positive breast cancer and CXCR4 radioligands for ESR1-negative breast cancer.","Dalm, Simone U; Sieuwerts, Anieta M; Look, Maxime P; Melis, Marleen; van Deurzen, Carolien H M; Foekens, John A; de Jong, Marion; Martens, John W M","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",654,1

This proof-of-principle study targets PPI between linear ubiquitin chains and NEMO UBAN domain, which activates NF-κB signaling. Using phage display, we generated ubiquitin variants that bind to the functional UBAN epitope with high affinity, act as competitive inhibitors, and structurally maintain the existing PPI interface. When utilized in assay development, variants enable generation of robust cell-based assays for chemical screening. Top compounds identified using this approach directly bind to UBAN and dampen NF-κB signaling. This study illustrates advantages of integrating protein engineering and chemical screening in hit identification, a development that we anticipate will have wide application in drug discovery.","Maculins, Timurs; Garcia-Pardo, Javier; Skenderovic, Anamarija; Gebel, Jakob; Putyrski, Mateusz; Vorobyov, Andrew; Busse, Philipp; Varga, Gabor; Kuzikov, Maria; Zaliani, Andrea; Rahighi, Simin; Schaeffer, Veronique; Parnham, Michael J; Sidhu, Sachdev S; Ernst, Andreas; Dötsch, Volker; Akutsu, Masato; Dikic, Ivan",Cell chemical biology,654,7

It has been shown that chondroitin sulfate interferes with the progression of structural changes in joint tissues and is used in the management of patients with osteoarthritis. METHODS This review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate that may explain the beneficial effects of the drug and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy of oral chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. Data included in the review were derived from a literature search in PubMed. Literature searches were performed in PubMed using the search terms 'chondroitin sulfate', 'pharmaceutical-grade', 'osteoarthritis', 'randomized clinical trials', 'humans'. The MEDLINE database was searched from January 1996 through August 2012 for all randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review articles of chondroitin sulfate in osteoarthritis. RESULTS Chondroitin sulfate exerts in vitro a beneficial effect on the metabolism of different cell lines: chondrocytes, synoviocytes and cells from subchondral bone, all involved in osteoarthritis. It increases type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis in human articular chondrocytes and is able to reduce the production of some pro-inflammatory factors and proteases, to reduce the cellular death process, and improve the anabolic/catabolic balance of the extracellular cartilage matrix (ECM). Clinical trials have reported a beneficial effect of chondroitin sulfate on pain and function. The structure-modifying effects of chondroitin sulfate have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results in knee osteoarthritis demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of decline in joint space width. Because chondroitin sulfate quality of several nutraceuticals has been found to be poor, it is recommended that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate is used rather than food supplements in the treatment of OA. Chondroitin sulfate is recommended by several guidelines from international societies in the management of knee and hip OA. Furthermore, its safety profile is favorable when compared with many other therapies used in OA. CONCLUSION Chondroitin sulfate is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with osteoarthritis.","Hochberg, M; Chevalier, X; Henrotin, Y; Hunter, D J; Uebelhart, D",Current medical research and opinion,654,31

The promotion of inflammation in asthma by IL-17A and IL-17F has been confirmed. In addition to covalent homodimers, both cytokines are also able to form heterodimers, further inducing downstream pathways via binding to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptor complex. In recent years, IL-17RA and its signal transduction pathway have been extensively researched. IL-17RC, however, remains relatively unexplored. In the present study, we self-assembled chitosan (CS) nanoparticles for intranasal delivery of recombinant protein IL-17RC (rIL-17RC) and preliminarily investigated its effect on a murine model of allergic asthma induced by ovalbumin (OVA). rIL-17RC was produced by the prokaryotic expression system and encapsulated into the CS nanoparticles via ionic cross-linking technique. The results showed that CS-RC nanoparticles via intranasal intervention significantly caused inhibition of mucus secretion and airway inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced IL-4, IL-17, IL-17F levels in BALF. Hence, delivering receptor proteins such as IL-17RC, through CS nanoparticles as a carrier, could be an attractive therapeutic intervention for asthma.","Lv, Yongli; Zhang, Jianhua; Wang, Chaoying",Bioengineered,654,5

However, children and adolescents with intellectual disabilities (ID) have consistently been shown to engage in low levels of PA, which are insufficient for long-term health. Despite this, little is known about the effectiveness of interventions to increase PA in children and adolescents with ID. The aims of this study were therefore to systematically review how effective interventions are at increasing PA levels in children and adolescents with ID and to further examine what components have been used in these interventions. METHOD A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Education Resources Information Center, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number trials registry was conducted (up to July 2016). Articles were included if they met the following eligibility criteria: children and adolescents (<18 years) with ID, measurement of PA at baseline and post-intervention and intervention studies. Effect sizes were calculated as standardised mean difference (d) and meta-analysis calculated between intervention and no treatment control intervention. RESULTS Five studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Study design, methodological quality and intervention components were varied. Interventions did not support sufficient changes in PA to improve health. The meta-analysis demonstrated that intervention groups were not more effective at increasing PA levels post-intervention (d: 2.20; 95% CI -0.57 to 0.97) compared with control. However, due to a decrease in PA in the control intervention, a moderate significant effect was demonstrated at follow-up (d: 0.49; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS There is a lack of studies which aim to increase PA levels in children and adolescents with ID, with current interventions ineffective. Future studies are required before accurate recommendations for appropriate intervention design and components can be made.","McGarty, A M; Downs, S J; Melville, C A; Harris, L",Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,654,1

Streamlining and standardizing post-event reporting for MG medical services could improve inter-event comparability, and prospectively influence event safety and planning through the application of a research template, thereby supporting and promoting growth of the evidence base and the operational safety of this discipline. Understanding the relationships between categories of variables is key. The present paper is focused on theory building, providing an evolving conceptual model, laying the groundwork for exploring the relationships between categories of variables pertaining the health outcomes of MGs. METHODS A content analysis of 54 published post-event medical case reports, including a comparison of the features of published data models for MG health outcomes.

A-56-year-old gentleman with alcohol related liver cirrhosis (ARLC) and history of variceal bleeding with insertion of transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic stent shunt presented with two days history of fever, dry cough and worsening of the sensory. The severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharingeal C-reactive protein test was positive. X-ray showed multiple patchy ground glass opacities in both lungs. Despite the therapy, the clinical and laboratory picture deteriorated rapidly. The patient succumbed on day 14 with multi-organ-failure. SARS-Cov-2 infection can overlap with pre-existing chronic liver disease or induce liver damage directly or indirectly. From the data of the literature and from what is inferred from the case report it clearly emerges that alcohol related liver disease (ALD) patients are particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thereafter, some considerations can be deduced from the analysis of the case report: in subjects with pre-existing cirrhosis hepatologists should play more attention to hepatic injury and monitor risk of hepatic failure caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19); it is appropriate to promptly define the alcoholic etiology and investigate whether the patient is actively consuming. In fact, withdrawal symptoms may be present and the prognosis of these patients is also worse. Physicians should be alerted to the possibility of the development of ACLF in this population; hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided; it is recommended to use of hepatoprotective therapy to mitigate the negative impact of Covid-19; it is mandatory to administer anti Covid-19 vaccine to patients with alcohol related liver cirrhosis.","Testino, Gianni; Pellicano, Rinaldo",Minerva gastroenterology,654,12

The use of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs has proven highly effective. Telemedicine is a present-day resource that brings treatment closer to distant areas and may result in savings. OBJECTIVE To implement a microelimination program for HCV using DAAs with support from a telemedicine program to minimize expenses. PATIENTS AND METHODS The program was developed at the Medical Services department of Petróleos Mexicanos (SMPM) with national coverage; patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C were included. These were classified into locals and outsiders. Treatment for foreign patients was indicated, monitored, and completed through telemedicine, thus avoiding their transport to the country's capital city, in order to save up on transportation costs and travel allowances. RESULTS A total of 136 patients, 74 locals and 62 outsiders participated. Transfer was avoided for 62 patients (45.5 %), which meant that telemedicine resulted in USD 3,176.20 savings per patient, with overall savings of USD 196,924,40 from cost minimization. A total of 30 patients remained untreated for lack of medication, hence coverage amounted to 86 %. Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 99% of cases. Only 2 patients had treatment failure. Adverse events included headache and fatigue in 5 % of the sample. CONCLUSIONS With the aid of a telemedicine approach significant savings were achieved by minimizing costs, since nearly half of patients were outsiders. Coverage reached 86 %.

It manifests as allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic asthma or atopic dermatitis if mast cells are activated in the respective organs. In case of systemic mast cell activation, life-threatening anaphylaxis may occur. Currently, type I hypersensitivities are treated either with glucocorticoids, anti-histamines, or mast cell stabilizers. Although these drugs exert a strong anti-allergic effect, their long-term use may be problematic due to their side-effects. RESULTS In the course of a routine in vitro screening process, we identified beta-escin as a potentially anti-allergic compound. Here we tested beta-escin in two mouse models to confirm this anti-allergic effect in vivo. In a model of the early phase of allergic reactions, the murine passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model, beta-escin inhibited the effects of mast cell activation and degranulation in the skin and dose-dependently prevented the extravasation of fluids into the tissue. Beta-escin also significantly inhibited the late response after antigen challenge in a lung allergy model with ovalbumin-sensitized mice. Allergic airway inflammation was suppressed, which was exemplified by the reduction of leucocytes, eosinophils, IL-5 and IL-13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histopathological examinations further confirmed the reduced inflammation of the lung tissue. In both models, the inhibitory effect of beta-escin was comparable to the benchmark dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated in two independent murine models of type I hypersensitivity that beta-escin has potent anti-allergic properties. These results and the excellent safety profile of beta-escin suggest a therapeutic potential of this compound for a novel treatment of allergic diseases.","Lindner, Ines; Meier, Christiane; Url, Angelika; Unger, Hermann; Grassauer, Andreas; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva; Doerfler, Petra",BMC immunology,654,20

Here, we uncover the presence of above-bandgap oscillatory features in the absorption spectra of formamidinium lead triiodide thin films. We attribute these discrete features to intrinsically occurring quantum confinement effects, for which the related energies change with temperature according to the inverse square of the intrinsic lattice parameter, and with peak index in a quadratic manner. By determining the threshold film thickness at which the amplitude of the peaks is appreciably decreased, and through ab initio simulations of the absorption features, we estimate the length scale of confinement to be 10-20 nm. Such absorption peaks present a new and intriguing quantum electronic phenomenon in a nominally bulk semiconductor, offering intrinsic nanoscale optoelectronic properties without necessitating cumbersome additional processing steps.","Wright, Adam D; Volonakis, George; Borchert, Juliane; Davies, Christopher L; Giustino, Feliciano; Johnston, Michael B; Herz, Laura M",Nature materials,654,1

A section along an optic fiber cable is stripped, so that laser light travelling through it will leak outside, while biosensing process taken place on this stripped section can form a new cladding layer of hydrogel, restoring the laser output of the fiber. A short peptide probe immobilized on the stripped section of the fiber can covalently capture a biomarker protein of SARS-Cov-2 from the serum sample. Through the cross-linking of the target protein with the interfering proteins in the serum sample, a hydrogel is covalently immobilized around the stripped section, highly resistant to detergent rinsing that is indispensable for removing nonspecific interference from the clinical sample. Using this ""covalent biosensing"" strategy, only one peptide probe is sufficient to simultaneously achieve ultrahigh affinity toward the biomarker protein of SARS-Cov-2 and effective signal amplification.","Wang, Junxia; Lv, Mengqi; Xia, Hehuan; Du, Jialei; Zhao, Yiwei; Li, Hao; Zhang, Zhongyin",ACS sensors,654,16

In this study, differences in glucose metabolism between adeno- and squamous cell NSCLCs were quantified using the hypoxia and glycolysis-related markers glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4) vasculature, and 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-uptake. Relevance of these markers for disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed. METHODS Patients with curatively resected stage I to II and resectable stage IIIA, cN0-1 adeno- or squamous cell NSCLC, of whom fresh-frozen lung resection biopsies and pretreatment FDG-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were available, were included in this study (n = 108). FDG-uptake was quantified by calculating total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Metabolic marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA]). Patients were retrospectively evaluated for DFS. RESULTS mRNA and protein expression of metabolic markers, with the exception of MCT4, and TLG were higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, whereas adenocarcinomas were better vascularized. Adenocarcinomas had a worse DFS compared with squamous cell carcinomas (p = 0.016) based on the potential to metastasize. High TLG was associated with a worse DFS only in adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that the adenocarcinomas exhibit glycolysis under normoxic conditions, whereas squamous cell carcinomas are exposed to diffusion-limited hypoxia resulting in a very high anaerobic glycolytic rate. Although squamous cell carcinomas have a higher FDG-uptake, in general regarded as a poor prognostic factor, adenocarcinomas have a higher metastatic potential and a worse DFS. These findings show that FDG-PET should be interpreted in relation to histology. This may improve the prognostic potential of FDG-PET and may aid in exploiting FDG-PET in treatment strategies allied to histology.","Schuurbiers, Olga C J; Meijer, Tineke W H; Kaanders, Johannes H A M; Looijen-Salamon, Monika G; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee; van der Drift, Miep A; van der Heijden, Erik H F M; Oyen, Wim J; Visser, Eric P; Span, Paul N; Bussink, Johan",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,654,1

METHODS Twelve cases of laparoscopic duodenectomy for benign duodenal tumors not amenable to endoscopic resection and away from the ampulla performed from 2009 to 2011 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information, patient comorbidities, procedural data, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. These data were compared with the data derived from 6 patients who underwent open duodenectomy for benign duodenal tumors. RESULTS Comparison of the laparoscopic to open duodenectomy data demonstrated that the length of stay was similar between the 2 groups (6.1 ± 0.72 vs. 7 ± 2.1, respectively, P>0.05), but the laparoscopic group was associated with a lower combined short-term and long-term complication rate. Statistically significant difference in patients' body mass index (31 ± 10 for the laparoscopic group vs. 22 ± 4 for the open group, P<0.05) was yielded. The remainder of the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were similar or not statistically different. The mean follow-up for the laparoscopic group was 12 ± 3 months. There were no recurrences in either group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic partial duodenal resection is a safe and effective alternative approach to managing patients with benign nonampullary duodenal neoplasms that are not amenable to endoscopic resection and had similar outcomes compared with the traditional open resection with the added benefit of less postoperative incisional hernias, also suited for patients with higher body mass index.","Kokosis, George; Ceppa, Eugene P; Tyler, Douglas S; Pappas, Theodore N; Perez, Alexander","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",654,7

As epidemiologic and etiopathologic data for canine myocarditis are lacking, we performed a retrospective study using nucleic acid extracted from archived (2007 to 2015) tissues from myocarditis cases and control dogs without myocardial lesions. Heart tissue from pediatric/juvenile and adult dogs was tested with a comprehensive panel of conventional and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting recognized agents of canine myocarditis based on a literature review and informed by the comparative epidemiology of human myocarditis. The PCR screen, which included canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2), canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus, Borrelia spp, West Nile virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, pneumovirus, respiratory coronavirus, influenza virus, Bartonella spp, Rickettsia spp, Mycoplasma spp, and Neospora caninum, did not detect agents in 35 of 66 cases (53%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41%-65%) and was frequently negative in adults (21/26); by comparison, agents were not detected in 27 of 57 controls (47%; 95% CI, 35%-60%). Canine distemper virus, herpesvirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma haemocanis, and N. caninum were occasionally detected in both cases and controls; thus, PCR detection was not considered to indicate causation. We previously reported that CPV-2 continues to be associated with myocarditis in young dogs despite widespread vaccination; in adults, CPV-2 was detected in 2 of 26 cases and 4 of 22 controls. As several agents were similarly detected in cases and controls, it is unclear if these are cardiopathogenic, incidental, or latent. West Nile virus was detected at the analytic limit in 1 adult case. We did not detect Borrelia spp, Bartonella spp, Rickettsia spp, or influenza A virus in the myocarditis cases. These data demonstrate the limitations of current targeted diagnostic tests and the need for additional research to identify unknown agents and develop testing strategies for canine myocarditis.","Molesan, Alex; Goodman, Laura; Ford, Jordan; Lovering, Samantha J; Kelly, Kathleen",Veterinary pathology,654,32

Micro RNA 155 (miR155) promotes CD4+ Th1 response and IFN-γ production by targeting Suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1) and inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (SHIP-1) and therefore could play a role in the resolution of VL. To determine the role of miR155 in VL, we monitored the course of L. donovani infection in miR155KO and WT C57BL/6 mice. miR155KO mice displayed significantly higher liver and spleen parasite loads compared to WT controls and showed impaired hepatic granuloma formation. However, parasite growth eventually declined in miR155KO mice suggesting induction of a compensatory miR155-independent anti-leishmanial pathway. Leishmania antigen-stimulated splenocytes from miR155KO mice produced significantly lower levels of Th1-associated IFN-γ compared to controls. Interestingly, at later time points, levels of Th2-associated IL-4 and IL-10 were also lower in mir155KO splenocyte supernatants compared to WT mice. On the other hand, miR155KO mice displayed significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, iNOS, and TNF-α gene transcripts in their livers than WT mice, indicating that distinct organ-specific anti-parasitic mechanisms were involved in control of L. donovani infection in miR155KO mice. Throughout the course of infection organs of miR155KO mice showed significantly more PDL1 expressing Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes compared to WT mice.

Here, we report development of a single-phase calcium phosphate biomineral nanoparticle (nCP) with dual-mode magnetic resonance contrast (T1-T2) together with radiofrequency (RF) mediated thermal response suitable for image-guided RF ablation of cancer. The nanoparticles (NP) are engineered to provide dual MR contrast by an optimized doping concentration (4.1 at%) of paramagnetic ion, Fe3+, which also renders lossy dielectric character for nCP leading to thermal response under RF exposure. In vivo compatibility and dual-mode MR contrast are demonstrated in healthy rat models. MRI and T2 mapping suggest hepatobiliary clearance by ~96 hours. MRI guided intratumoral injection in subcutaneous rat glioma and orthotopic liver tumor models provide clear visualization of NP in MRI which also helps in quantifying NP distribution within tumor. Furthermore, by utilising RF mediated thermal response, NP treated tumor could be ablated using clinically approved RF ablation system (10 W,13.3 GHz). Real-time in vivo thermal imaging exhibits 119 ± 10% increase in temperature change (ΔT) for NP treated orthotopic liver tumor (ΔT = 51.5 ± 2 °C), compared to untreated healthy liver control (ΔT = 21.5 ± 2 °C).

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)-mediated tumorigenesis and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting the EBV DNA genome. We found that LMP1 upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) coactivator-1β (PGC1β) through activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Furthermore, the activated PGC1β upregulated the expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) through the coactivation of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and GA-binding protein α (GABPα), preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated base incision in the EBV genome and favoring its survival. Interruption of hexokinase domain component 1 (HKDC1) by either shRNA or Tf-D-HKC8 peptide suppressed the interaction of HKDC1 with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), triggering mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive generation of ROS, thus resulting in EBV suppression through ROS-mediated DNA damage. Suppression of the EBV genome inhibited the expression of the LMP1/PGC1β/HKDC1/OGG1 signaling pathway, forming a positive feed forward loop for the generation of ROS, hence inhibiting the EBV genome and subsequent EBV-associated tumor development. We concluded that LMP1 triggers EBV-associated tumorigenesis through activation of the PGC1β pathway. This study provided a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EBV-associated tumors by targeting HKDC1.","Feng, Jia; Chen, Qi; Zhang, Ping; Huang, Xiaodong; Xie, Weiguo; Zhang, Hongyu; Yao, Paul",Stem cell reviews and reports,654,24

In all three countries, the leaders' responses to the outbreak can be characterised by the following features: simplifying the pandemic by downplaying its impacts or touting easy solutions or treatments, spectacularizing their responses to crisis, forging divisions between the 'people' and dangerous 'others', and making medical knowledge claims to support the above. Taken together, the case studies illuminate the role of individual political actors in defining public health crises, suggesting that medical populism is not an exceptional, but a familiar response to them.

A large number of works on multiplicative degree based indices has been developed. However, no attention is paid in investigating their chemical significance. Investigation of the chemical importance of such indices is needed. The computation of topological indices for different chemical structures and networks is a current topic of interest in mathematical chemistry. OBJECTIVE The objective of the present work is to examine the usefulness of the multiplicative degree based indices in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling. In addition, we intend to compute the indices for some antiCOVID-19 chemicals. MATERIALS AND METHOD The regression analysis for octane data set is performed using MATLAB and Excel to check the predictability of the indices. The sensitivity test is conducted to examine the isomer discrimination ability. To study the indices for chemical structures preventing COVID-19, different combinatorial computation methods are utilized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The regression models governing the structural dependence of different properties and activities are derived. The supremacy of the indices as useful molecular descriptors compared to some well-known and most used descriptors is established. Explicit expressions of the indices for hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir (GS-5734) and theaflavin are obtained. CONCLUSION As the indices are shown to have remarkable efficiency in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling and isomer discrimination, the outcomes can predict different properties and activities of the chemicals under consideration.","Mondal, Sourav; De, Nilanjan; Pal, Anita; Gao, Wei",Current organic synthesis,654,17

When present, symptoms arise due to progressive mass effect on the brainstem and adjacent cranial nerves. Historically, a variety of open microsurgical approaches have been used for resection of ECs in this intricate region. In recent years, the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been proposed as an alternative corridor that avoids crossing the plane of the cranial nerves. To date, there is a paucity of data in the literature regarding the safety and efficacy of the EEA in the treatment of ECs of the ventral cranial base.METHODSThe authors reviewed a prospectively acquired database of EEAs for resection of ECs over 8 years at Weill Cornell, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. All procedures were performed by the senior authors. Standardized clinical and radiological parameters were assessed before and after surgery. Statistical tests were used to determine the impact of previous surgery and tumor volume on extent of resection and recurrence as well as the method of closure on rate of CSF leak.RESULTSBetween January 2009 and February 2017, 7 patients (4 males and 3 females; age range 16-70 years) underwent a total of 8 surgeries for EC resection utilizing the EEA. Transplanum and transclival extensions were performed in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. Methods of closure incorporated a gasket seal in 6 of 8 procedures and a nasoseptal flap in 7 of 8 procedures. Gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 43% of patients, and near-total resection (> 95%) was obtained in another 43%. Complications included diabetes insipidus (n = 2), postoperative CSF leak (n = 2), transient third cranial nerve palsy (n = 1), and epistaxis (n = 1). With a mean follow-up of 43.5 months, recurrence has been observed in 2 of 7 patients. In 1 case, reoperation for recurrence was required 71 months following the initial surgery. Use of the gasket-seal technique with nasoseptal flap coverage significantly correlated with the absence of postoperative CSF leakage (p = 0.018). GTR was achieved in 25% of the patients who had prior surgeries and in 50% of patients without previous resections. The mean volume of cysts in which GTR was achieved (4.3 ± 1.8 cm3) was smaller than that in which subtotal or near-total resection was achieved (12.2 ± 11 cm3, p = 0.134).CONCLUSIONSThe EEA for resection of ECs of the ventral cranial base is a safe and effective operative strategy that avoids crossing the plane of the cranial nerves. In the authors' experience, gasket-seal closure with nasoseptal flap coverage has been associated with a decreased risk of postoperative CSF leakage.","Forbes, Jonathan A; Banu, Matei; Lehner, Kurt; Ottenhausen, Malte; La Corte, Emanuele; Alalade, Andrew F; Ordóñez-Rubiano, Edgar G; Greenfield, Jeffrey P; Anand, Vijay K; Schwartz, Theodore H",Journal of neurosurgery,654,1

METHODS Newborn life support (NLS) training was performed in a simulation-based setting. In contrast to the traditional approach, students taught with the modified approach were requested to explain every step of their performance in Peyton's step 3. 123 Students were allocated into both experimental groups. Students were then assessed by megacode on day four (initial assessment) and 6 months (follow-up assessment). RESULTS Both groups showed similar scorings in the initial, follow-up assessment and in mean change. On initial megacode, time to start with initial inflation and post-resuscitation care was significantly faster in the control group. All showed a significant loss of performance irrespective of modification in step-3 in the follow-up assessment. Only time until start with post-resuscitation care shows a significant group difference in mean change between initial and follow-up with increasing time in the control and decreasing time span in intervention group. CONCLUSION Both methods showed equal levels of knowledge acquisition and long-term decline in NLS performances.

Previously, augmentation of epidural analgesia with intraperitoneal local anesthetic was shown to improve functional postoperative recovery following colectomy. OBJECTIVE This study determines whether intraperitoneal local anesthetic improves postoperative recovery in patients undergoing colectomy, in the absence of epidural analgesia, with standardized enhanced recovery after surgery perioperative care. DESIGN This is a multisite, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02449720). SETTINGS This study was conducted at 3 hospital sites in South Australia. PATIENTS Eighty-six adults undergoing colectomy were stratified by approach (35 open; 51 laparoscopic), then randomly assigned to intraperitoneal local anesthetic (n = 44) and control (n = 42) groups. INTERVENTIONS Patients in the intraperitoneal local anesthetic group received an intraoperative intraperitoneal ropivacaine 100-mg bolus both pre- and postdissection and 20 mg/h continuous postoperative infusion for 48 hours. Patients in the control group received a normal saline equivalent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Functional postoperative recovery was assessed by using the surgical recovery scale for 45 days; postoperative pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale; and opioid consumption, use of rescue ketamine, recovery of bowel function, time to readiness for discharge, and perioperative complications were recorded. RESULTS The intraperitoneal local anesthetic group reported improved surgical recovery scale scores at day 1 and 7, lower pain scores, required less rescue ketamine, and passed flatus earlier than the control group (p < 0.05). The improvement in surgical recovery scale at day 7 and pain scores remained when laparoscopic colectomy was considered separately. Opioid consumption and time to readiness for discharge were equivalent. LIMITATIONS This study was powered to detect a difference in surgical recovery scale, but not the other domains of recovery, when the intraperitoneal local anesthetic group was compared with control. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that instillation and infusion of intraperitoneal ropivacaine for patients undergoing colectomy, including by the laparoscopic approach, decreases postoperative pain and improves functional postoperative recovery. We recommend routine inclusion of intraperitoneal local anesthetic into the multimodal analgesia component of enhanced recovery after surgery programs for laparoscopic colectomy.

The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans. In 2012, a similar previously unknown coronavirus emerged, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), thus far causing over 650 laboratory-confirmed infections, with an unexplained steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months. The human MERS fatality rate of ∼ 30% is alarmingly high, even though many deaths were associated with underlying medical conditions. Registered therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infections are not available. Moreover, the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, we have screened a library of 348 FDA-approved drugs for anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell culture. If such compounds proved sufficiently potent, their efficacy might be directly assessed in MERS patients. We identified four compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range (50% effective concentrations [EC(50)s], 3 to 8 μM). Moreover, these compounds also inhibit the replication of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E. Although their protective activity (alone or in combination) remains to be assessed in animal models, our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoonotic coronaviruses like MERS-CoV. Although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low levels, a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune response.","de Wilde, Adriaan H; Jochmans, Dirk; Posthuma, Clara C; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; van Nieuwkoop, Stefan; Bestebroer, Theo M; van den Hoogen, Bernadette G; Neyts, Johan; Snijder, Eric J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,654,32

METHODS Between July 2010 and July 2011, 15 patients (all men; mean age 60.7±9.1 years) underwent endovascular treatment of 17 infrainguinal CTOs that were resistant to guidewire passage, so the blunt microdissection catheter was employed to recanalize the artery. Fourteen lesions were de novo and 3 were in-stent restenoses. Sixteen lesions were in the superficial femoral artery; 8 of 17 CTOs were TASC II type D. Extensive calcification was present in 12 lesions. Mean lesion length was 182.9±66.2 mm (range 57-296). RESULTS Procedural success was 100% and successful crossing without the use of a re-entry device (technical success) was achieved in 15 cases. Twelve lesions were stented. Average fluoroscopy time was 36.5±21.2 minutes (143.8±76.9 Gy*cm (2) radiaton dose area product), during which a mean 172.1±62.2 mL of iodinated contrast were used. Two patients had access site hematomas that were treated conservatively, and there was no perforation, distal embolization, amputation, or need for urgent revascularization. During the mean follow-up of 11.4±0.1 months, 1 patient died, and none required an amputation or surgical revascularization. There was a significant improvement in ankle-brachial index (0.6±0.1 to 0.8±0.2, p=0.001) and symptoms as assessed by Rutherford class at 1 year. Four of 17 limbs required secondary revascularization procedures within 1 year. CONCLUSION The CrossBoss blunt microdissection catheter facilitated successful crossing of CTOs in patients with infrainguinal lesions following unsuccessful guidewire crossing, with an acceptably low rate of periprocedural complications and significant improvement in symptoms.","Banerjee, Subhash; Hadidi, Omar; Mohammad, Atif; Alsamarah, Ali; Thomas, Rahul; Sarode, Karan; Garg, Puja; Baig, Mirza S; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,654,1

We aimed to determine patient satisfaction, perceived barriers, as well as indications for teledermatology appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A survey was sent out via SurveyMonkey's online platform to patients of the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates' Dermatology department who attended telehealth appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Out of 894 invitations sent, 168 patients completed our survey.The most common reasons for making a telehealth appointment were for a new rash (11.6%), eczema (9.8%), and psoriasis (9.1%). The most common reasons respondents liked telehealth were because of time efficiency (81.1%), not requiring transportation (74.2%), and maintaining social distancing (73.6%). The most common reasons respondents did not like telehealth were due to lack of physical touch (26.8%) and feeling they received an inadequate assessment (15.7%). Very few patients reported that they were unlikely to undertake another telehealth visit (9.94%) or recommend a telehealth visit to others (6.92%). CONCLUSION Dermatology patients likely perceive telehealth visits as a convenient and safe method for quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of physical touch, inability to provide close inspection and/or procedural intervention can be frustrating for patients and therefore meaningful selection of appropriate cases for telehealth visits can optimize the patient experience. Overall, telemedicine represents an effective and safe vehicle for delivering care especially during a global pandemic.

Literature on the experience of living with multimorbidity is accumulating but has not yet been synthesised in a manner conducive to informing the design of self-management interventions for this population. This study aimed to systematically review and synthesise findings from published, in-depth qualitative studies about the experience of multimorbidity, with a view to identifying the components and motivation for successful self-management in this population. METHODS Systematic review of and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies that evaluated patient experience of living with and/or self-managing mental and/or physical multimorbidity. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and ASSIA along with reference lists of existing reviews and content pages of non-indexed specialists comorbidity journals were searched. RESULTS Nineteen studies from 23 papers were included. A line of argument synthesis was articulated around three third-order constructs: 1) Encounters with complexity; 2) Marshalling medicines, emotions, and resources; and 3) Self-preservation and prevention. Our interpretation revealed how mental and physical multimorbidity is experienced as moments of complexity rather than mere counts of illnesses. Successful self-management of physical symptoms was contingent upon the tactical use of medicines, whilst emotional health was more commonly managed by engaging in behavioural strategies, commonly with a social or spiritual component. Motivations for self-management were underpinned by a sense of moral purpose to take responsibility for their health, but also by a desire to live a purposeful life beyond an immediate context of multimorbidity. CONCLUSIONS Understanding how people experience the complexities of mental and physical multimorbidity may be crucial to designing and delivering interventions to support successful self-management in this population.

STUDY DESIGN This was a single center, randomized control pilot study of 60 infants <29 weeks' gestation with a high PDAsc (≥5.0) at 36-48 hours of age receiving either Ibuprofen or Placebo intravenously. The study protocol did not allow for additional PDA therapy within the first two weeks. We reported the rate of consent, open label treatment and PDA closure rates. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease/Death. RESULTS 83 families were approached for enrollment with 73 (88%) providing consent; 13 infants had a PDAsc < 5; of the remaining infants, 30 were assigned Ibuprofen and 30 received placebo. Eight infants received open label treatment in the first two weeks (12%). The overall PDA closure rate after treatment was 57% in the Intervention Group and 17% in the Control Group (p<0.01). There was no difference in the primary clinical outcome (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.1). CONCLUSION Using a PDA severity score for infant recruitment to a PDA treatment RCT is feasible. There is a high rate of consent and relatively low rate of open label PDA treatment. The overall PDA closure rate in the intervention arm was low placing the emphasis on devising more effective PDA closure strategies in future RCTs.

Along with their traditional relevance in helminth immunity and allergy, eosinophils have been progressively attributed important roles in a number of homeostatic and pathologic situations. This review aims at summarizing available evidence about eosinophils functions in homeostasis, infections, allergic and autoimmune disorders, and solid and hematological cancers.Their structural and biological features have been described, along with their physiological behavior. This includes their chemokines, cytokines, granular contents, and extracellular traps. Besides, pathogenic- and eosinophilic-mediated disorders have also been addressed, with the aim of highlighting their role in Th2-driven inflammation. In allergy, eosinophils are implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. They are also fundamentally involved in autoimmune disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In infections, eosinophils are involved in protection not only from parasites but also from fungi, viruses, and bacteria. In solid cancers, local eosinophilic infiltration is variably associated with an improved or worsened prognosis, depending on the histotype. In hematologic neoplasms, eosinophilia can be the consequence of a dysregulated cytokine production or the result of mutations affecting the myeloid lineage.Recent experimental evidence was thoroughly reviewed, with findings which elicit a complex role for eosinophils, in a tight balance between host defense and tissue damage. Eventually, emerging evidence about eosinophils in COVID-19 infection was also discussed.","Folci, Marco; Ramponi, Giacomo; Arcari, Ivan; Zumbo, Aurora; Brunetta, Enrico",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,654,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data were prospectively collected from all women undergoing POP surgery between May 2001 and October 2009. Pre- and postoperative urinary symptoms, Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI), and Urinary Impact Questionnaires (UIQ) scores were compared within and between groups. A generalized linear model was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS Out of the 151 patients included, 87 patients underwent LSC, and 64 VS. Overall, after a median follow-up of 32.4 months, POP surgery improved urinary frequency (P = 0.006), voiding difficulty (P = 0.001), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (P = 0.001), but not urgency (P = 0.29). VS was more effective in treating SUI (P < 0.001 vs. 0.52) while LSC more effective on voiding difficulty (P = 0.01 vs. 0.08). Postoperative de novo symptoms were observed in 35.8% of patients with no difference between the groups (P = 0.06). UDI (P = 0.04) and UIQ (P = 0.01) scores were significantly lower after surgery. However, LSC significantly improved UDI (P = 0.03) with no effect on UIQ (P = 0.29) scores while VS significantly improved both scores (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively). Upon multivariate analysis, only the improvement in the impact of urinary symptoms on daily living was independently associated to VS (OR = 5.45 [95% confidence interval 2.20-13.44], P = 0.01). CONCLUSION Most preoperative urinary symptoms decreased after POP surgery with equivalent proportion of de novo symptoms after vaginal and laparoscopic approaches.","Ramanah, Rajeev; Ballester, Marcos; Chereau, Elisabeth; Rouzier, Roman; Daraï, Emile",Neurourology and urodynamics,654,6

Consequently, RNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the regulation of mRNA and protein abundance. Yet, the roles of many RNA-binding proteins are not understood. Our previous research identified the RNA-binding protein ZC3H5 as possibly involved in gene repression, but its role in controlling gene expression was unknown. We here show that ZC3H5 is an essential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein: RNAi targeting ZC3H5 causes accumulation of pre-cytokinetic cells followed by rapid cell death. Affinity purification and pair-wise yeast 2-hybrid analysis suggest that ZC3H5 forms a complex with three other proteins, encoded by genes Tb927.11.4900, Tb927.8.1500 and Tb927.7.3040. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that ZC3H5 is preferentially associated with poorly translated, low-stability mRNAs, the 5'-untranslated regions and coding regions of which are enriched in the motif (U/A)UAG(U/A). As previously found in high-throughput analyses, artificial tethering of ZC3H5 to a reporter mRNA or other complex components repressed reporter expression. However, depletion of ZC3H5 in vivo caused only very minor decreases in a few targets, marked increases in the abundances of very stable mRNAs, an increase in monosomes at the expense of large polysomes, and appearance of ""halfmer"" disomes containing two 80S subunits and one 40S subunit. We speculate that the ZC3H5 complex might be implicated in quality control during the translation of sub-optimal open reading frames.","Bajak, Kathrin; Leiss, Kevin; Clayton, Christine; Erben, Esteban",The Journal of biological chemistry,654,31

RESULTS We demonstrate that the SDS adopted in São Paulo City and State clearly brought meaningful results to delay the growth of COVID-19 cases. We also show that by using this type of time series it is possible to identify different trends for regions, allowing for targeted approaches. Additionally, by using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible to identify, for São Paulo City, the effects of the SDS with the Social Isolation Index (SII) adopted in the state and to make a gross estimate for the SII, which prevents the growth of the disease.

Possible predictive biomarkers for tumor angiogenesis, such as, microvessel density (MVD), hypoxia and cell proliferation, can be determined using immunohistochemical staining. However, patients ineligible for surgical treatment need to undergo invasive diagnostic interventions in order to determine these biomarkers. CT perfusion (CTP) is an emerging functional imaging technique, which can non-invasively determine vascular properties of solid tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CTP with histological biomarkers in CRLM. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients with CRLM underwent CTP one day before liver surgery. CTP analysis was performed on the entire volume of the largest metastases in each patient. Dual-input maximum slope analysis was used and data concerning arterial flow (AF), portal flow (PF) and perfusion index (PI) were recorded. Immunohistochemical staining with CD34, M75/CA-IX and MIB-1 was performed on the rim in the midsection of the tumor to determine respectively MVD, hypoxia and cell proliferation. RESULTS Twenty CRLM in 20 patients were studied. Mean size of the largest CRLM was 37 mm (95% CI 21-54 mm). Mean AF and PF were respectively 64 ml/min/100ml (95% CI 48-79) and 30 ml/min/100ml (95% CI 22-38). Mean PI was 68% (95% CI 62-73). No significant correlation was found between tumor growth patterns and CTP (p = 0.95). MVD did not significantly correlate to AF (r = 0.05; p = 0.84), PF (r = 0.17; p = 0.47) and PI (r = -0.12; p = 0.63). Cell proliferation also did not significantly correlate to AF (r = 0.07; p = 0.78), PF (r = -0.01; p = 0.95) and PI (r = 0.15; p = 0.52). Hypoxia did not significantly correlate to AF (r = -0.05; p = 0.83), however, significantly to PF (r = 0.51; p = 0.02) and a trend to negative correlation with PF (r = -0.43; p = 0.06). However, after controlling the false discovery rate, no significant correlation between CTP and used immunohistochemical biomarkers was found. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this feasibility study found a trend to negative correlation between PI and hypoxia, CTP might therefore possibly evaluate this prognostic marker in CRLM non-invasively. However, CTP is not an appropriate technique for the assessment of microvessels or cell proliferation in CRLM.","van Amerongen, M J; Vos, A M; van der Woude, W; Nagtegaal, I D; de Wilt, J H W; Fütterer, J J; Hermans, J J",PloS one,654,16

OBJECTIVE To characterize the relationships between cognition and risk for IADL impairment among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS Participants included 6,292 community-dwelling adults from the Study of Latinos - Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging, an ancillary study of 45+ year-olds in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Cognitive data (learning, memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and a Global cognitive composite) were collected at Visit 1. IADL functioning was self-reported 7 years later, and treated as a categorical (i.e., risk) and continuous (i.e., degree) measures of impairment. Survey two-part models (mixture of logit and generalized linear model with Gaussian distribution) and ordered logistic regression tested the associations of cognitive performance (individual tests and composite z-score) with IADL impairment. Additionally, we investigated the moderating role of age, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background on the association between cognition and IADL impairment. RESULTS Across all cognitive measures, poorer performance was associated with higher odds of IADL impairment 7 years later. Associations were generally stronger for the oldest group (70+ years) relative to the youngest group (50-59 years). Sex and Hispanic/Latino background did not modify the associations. Across the full sample, lower scores on learning, memory, and the Global cognitive composite were also associated with higher degree of IADL impairment.

METHODS We parametrised and fitted a deterministic of HIV transmission model to Yaoundé-specific demographic, behavioural, HIV and intervention coverage data in a Bayesian framework. We estimated the fraction of incident HIV infections averted by condoms and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the fraction of all infections over 10-year periods directly and indirectly attributable to unprotected sex within and between each risk group. RESULTS Condom use and ART together may have averted 43% (95% uncertainty interval: 31-54) of incident infections over 1980-2018 and 72% (66-79) over 2009-2018. Most onward transmissions over 2009-2018 stemmed from unprotected sex between lower-risk individuals (47% (32-61)), clients (37% (23-51)), and MSM (35% (20-54)) with all their partners. The contribution of commercial sex decreased from 25% (8-49) over 1989-1998 to 8% (3-22) over 2009-2018, due to higher intervention coverage among FSW. CONCLUSION Condom use and recent ART scale-up mitigated the HIV epidemic in Yaoundé and changed the contribution of different partnerships to onward transmission over time. Findings highlight the importance of prioritizing HIV prevention and treatment for MSM and clients of FSW whose unmet needs now contribute most to onward transmission, while maintaining services which successfully reduced transmissions in the context of commercial sex.","Silhol, Romain; Baral, Stefan; Bowring, Anna L; Mukandavire, Christinah; Njindam, Iliassou Mfochive; Rao, Amrita; Schwartz, Sheree; Tamoufe, Ubald; Billong, Serge C; Njoya, Oudou; Zoung-Kanyi Bissek, Anne-Cecile; Garcia Calleja, Jesus Maria; Vickerman, Peter; Mishra, Sharmistha; Boily, Marie-Claude",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,654,15

Viroporins interact with cell membranes, triggering membrane permeabilization and promoting release of viral particles. In vitro electrophysiological methods have revealed changes in membrane ion currents when Vpu is present; however, in vivo the molecular mechanism of Vpu at the plasma membrane is still uncertain. We used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a genetic model system to analyze how Vpu ion channel impacts cellular homeostasis. Inducible expression of Vpu impaired cell growth, suggesting that this viral protein is toxic to yeast cultures. This toxicity decreased with extracellular acidic pH. Also, Vpu toxicity diminished as the extracellular K(+) concentration was increased. However, expression of the Vpu protein suppresses the growth defect of K(+) uptake-deficient yeast (Δtrk1,2). The phenotype rescue of these highly hyperpolarized cells was almost total when they were grown in medium supplemented with high concentrations of KCl (100 mM) at pH 7.0 but was significantly reduced when the extracellular K(+) concentration or pH was decreased. These results indicate that Vpu has the ability to modify K(+) transport in both yeast strains. Here, we show also that Vpu confers tolerance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic hygromycin B in Δtrk1,2 yeast. Our results suggest that Vpu interferes with cell growth of wild-type yeast but improves proliferation of the hyperpolarized trk1,2 mutant by inducing plasma membrane depolarization. Furthermore, evaluation of the ion channel activity of the Vpu protein in Δtrk1,2 yeast could aid in the development of a high-throughput screening assay for molecules that target the retroviral protein.","Herrero, Laura; Monroy, Noemí; González, María Eugenia",Biochemistry,654,13

To investigate these differences, we infected male and female mice of different age groups with SARS-CoV and analyzed their susceptibility to the infection. Our results showed that male mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection compared with age-matched females. The degree of sex bias to SARS-CoV infection increased with advancing age, such that middle-aged mice showed much more pronounced differences compared with young mice. Enhanced susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV was associated with elevated virus titers, enhanced vascular leakage, and alveolar edema. These changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory monocyte macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of male mice, and depletion of inflammatory monocyte macrophages partially protected these mice from lethal SARS. Moreover, the sex-specific differences were independent of T and B cell responses. Furthermore, ovariectomy or treating female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist increased mortality, indicating a protective effect for estrogen receptor signaling in mice infected with SARS-CoV. Together, these data suggest that sex differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV in mice parallel those observed in patients and also identify estrogen receptor signaling as critical for protection in females.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Fett, Craig; Mack, Matthias; Ten Eyck, Patrick P; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,654,31

They carry higher complication rates compared to handsewn techniques. In human surgery various causes likely to lead to failure of stapled techniques have been evaluated, including staple line failure. Recently Freeman proposed a technique to perform a stapled jejunocecal anastomosis in horses while avoiding blind pouch formation. The aim of this study is to describe a method for stapled side-to-side jejunocecal anastomosis in horses and to compare it with other techniques with computed tomography to assess stomal area, shape and blind pouch size. METHODS Intestinal specimens comprising the cecum, ileum and jejunum from 18 horses were collected and were divided into three groups. In Group S a standard stapled side-to-side jejunocecal anastomosis was performed. In Group F the anastomosis was performed using a modified technique proposed by Freeman. In Group G the anastomosis was performed with a modified technique proposed by the authors. Inflated bowel segments were CT scanned to obtain a MultiPlanar Reconstruction of the stoma and afferent small intestine before calculating the cross-sectional area of each of these regions. The ratio of the measured areas was compared between the three techniques. The volume of the blind-end pouch was measured and its ratio with the intestinal area compared between techniques. The cecum was opened and the length of the stoma measured with a caliper and compared to the intended initial length. RESULTS The stomal/intestinal area ratio was not significantly different between techniques. CONCLUSIONS Both the Freeman and the new (G) technique were comparable to the standard technique in terms of stomal area, stomal shape and difference in stomal elongation. They consistently produced a smaller blind pouch and allowed easier placement of the staplers.","Gandini, Marco; Giusto, Gessica; Iotti, Bryan; Valazza, Alberto; Sammartano, Federica",BMC veterinary research,654,1

Blood facilities from 16 countries were invited to participate. Individually completed questionnaires were grouped by country and descriptive analysis performed. RESULTS Ten blood establishments and two blood banks from eight African countries confirmed the availability of a host of training programs for laboratory staff; the majority of which were syllabus or curriculum-guided and focused on both theoretical and practical laboratory skills development. Training was usually preplanned, dependent on student and trainer availability and delivered through lecture-based classroom training as well as formal and informal on the job training. There were minimal online didactic and self-directed learning. Teaching of humanistic values appeared to be lacking. CONCLUSION We confirmed the availability of diverse training programs across a variety of African countries. Incorporation of virtual learning platforms, rather than complete reliance on didactic, in-person training programs may improve the education reach of the existing programs. Digitalization driven by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may provide an opportunity to narrow the knowledge gap in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).","Rambiritch, Vanitha; Vermeulen, Marion; Bell, Hazel; Knox, Patricia; Nedelcu, Elena; Al-Riyami, Arwa Z; Callum, Jeannie; van den Berg, Karin",Transfusion,654,8

Upregulated brain AA metabolism associated with neuroinflammation has been imaged in rodents using [1-(14)C]AA and with PET in Alzheimer disease patients using [1-(11)C]AA. Radiotracer brain AA uptake is independent of cerebral blood flow, making it an ideal tracer despite altered brain functional activity. However, the 20.4-min radioactive half-life of (11)C-AA and challenges of routinely synthesizing (11)C fatty acids limit their translational utility as PET biomarkers. METHODS As a first step to develop a clinically useful (18)F-fluoroarachidonic acid ((18)F-FAA) with a long radioactive half-life of 109.8 min, we report here a high-yield stereoselective synthetic method of nonradioactive 20-(19)F-FAA. We tested its in vivo pharmacokinetics by infusing purified nonradioactive (19)F-FAA intravenously for 5 min at 2 doses in unanesthetized mice and measured its plasma and brain distribution using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS Incorporation coefficients of injected (19)F-FAA into brain phospholipids (ratio of brain (19)F-FAA concentration to plasma input function) were 3- to 29-fold higher for choline glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylinositol than for ethanolamine glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylserine at each of the 2 tested doses. The selectivities and values of incorporation coefficients were comparable to those reported after [1-(14)C]AA (the natural arachidonate) infusion in mice. CONCLUSION These results suggest that it would be worthwhile to translate our stereoselective synthetic method for (19)F-FAA to synthesize positron-emitting (18)F-FAA for human brain AA metabolism in neuroinflammatory disorders such as Alzheimer disease.","Pichika, Rama; Taha, Ameer Y; Gao, Fei; Kotta, Kishore; Cheon, Yewon; Chang, Lisa; Kiesewetter, Dale; Rapoport, Stanley I; Eckelman, William C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",654,31

In this study, nsp1β was determined to suppress the expression of reporter genes as well as to suppress 'self-expression' in transfected cells, and this activity appeared to be associated with its interferon (IFN) antagonist function. To knock down the effect of nsp1β on IFN activity, a panel of site-specific mutations in nsp1β was analysed. Double mutations K130A/R134A (type 1 PRRSV) or K124A/R128A (type 2 PRRSV) targeting a highly conserved motif of nsp1β, GKYLQRRLQ (in bold), impaired the ability of nsp1β to suppress IFN-β and reporter gene expression, as well as to suppress 'self-expression' in vitro. Subsequently, viable recombinant viruses vSD01-08-K130A/R134A and vSD95-21-K124A/R128A, containing double mutations in the GKYLQRRLQ motif were generated using reverse genetics. In comparison with WT viruses, these nsp1β mutants showed impaired growth ability in infected cells, but the PLPβ cleavage function was not directly affected. The expression of selected innate immune genes was determined in vSD95-21-K124A/R128A mutant-infected cells. The results consistently showed that gene expression levels of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-stimulated gene 15 were upregulated in cells that were infected with the vSD95-21-K124A/R128A compared with that of WT virus. These data suggest that PRRSV nsp1β may selectively suppress cellular gene expression, including expression of genes involved in the host innate immune function. Modifying the key residues in the highly conserved GKYLQRRLQ motif could attenuate virus growth and improve the cellular innate immune responses.","Li, Yanhua; Zhu, Longchao; Lawson, Steven R; Fang, Ying",The Journal of general virology,654,1

Moreover, it is required in the characterization of major unique antigens that are useful in the development of effective immunological-based preventive measures. The current study aimed to evaluate the frequency of three encoding-virulence genes associated with Enterotoxigenic (ET) and Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli/EC) pathotypes (k99, stx1, and stx2) in North of Sistan and Baluchistan Province, Iran. The frequency of k99, stx1, and stx2 was determined via polymerase chain reaction among E. coli isolates collected from the feces of the clinically healthy suckling (n=50) and diarrheic calves (n=50). The k99 gene was absent in all isolates, and the frequencies of the E. coli containing stx1 and stx2 or both stx1 and stx2 were estimated at 8%, 14%, and 4%, respectively, in the clinically healthy suckling calves (P>0.05), compared to 24%, 16%, and 6% in diarrheic animals (p <0.05). Among the three studied genes, there was a statistically significant difference between clinically healthy suckling and diarrheic calves in terms of the frequency of E. coli isolatescontaining stx1. On the other hand, the results of this study indicated that k99 was not a major fimbrial antigen-encoding gene in the ETECpopulation in the region. It is assumed that in any health measure intended to control the pathogen, other genes involved with encoding fimbriae should also be considered. The noticeable high frequency of E. coli isolates bearing stx1 and/or stx2 virulence elementsboth in clinically healthy and diarrheic suckling calves in this study isa concern for public health. Accordingly, it is recommended that further epidemiological studies be conducted on the role of the stx1 gene in the diarrhea of suckling calves in Sistan and Baluchistan Province, Iran.","Keykhaei, N; Salari, S; Rashki, A",Archives of Razi Institute,654,28

We developed a method for automated detection of VLCBV and examined whether patients with reperfused-VLCBV are at increased risk of PH after endovascular reperfusion therapy. METHODS Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to optimize a relative CBV threshold associated with PH in patients from the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution 2 (DEFUSE 2) study. Regional reperfused-VLCBV was defined as regions with low relative CBV on baseline imaging that demonstrated normal perfusion (Tmax <6 s) on coregistered early follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. The association between VLCBV, regional reperfused-VLCBV and PH was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS In 91 patients, the greatest area under the curve for predicting PH occurred at an relative CBV threshold of <0.42 (area under the curve, 0.77). At this threshold, VLCBV lesion volume ≥3.55 mL optimally predicted PH with 94% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Reperfused-VLCBV lesion volume was more specific (0.74) and equally sensitive (0.94). In total, 18 patients developed PH, of whom 17 presented with VLCBV (39% versus 2%; P=0.001), all of them had regional reperfusion (47% versus 0%; P=0.01), and 71% received intravenous alteplase. VLCBV lesion (odds ratio, 33) and bridging with intravenous alteplase (odds ratio, 3.8) were independently associated with PH. In a separate model, reperfused-VLCBV remained the single independent predictor of PH (odds ratio, 53). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that VLCBV can be used for risk stratification of patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy in trials and routine clinical practice.","Mishra, Nishant K; Christensen, Søren; Wouters, Anke; Campbell, Bruce C V; Straka, Matus; Mlynash, Michael; Kemp, Stephanie; Cereda, Carlo W; Bammer, Roland; Marks, Michael P; Albers, Gregory W; Lansberg, Maarten G",Stroke,654,16

The patient required an urgent laparoscopy and was discharged without complications. Typically, appendicitis is an acute surgical problem whereas chronic abdominal pain is routinely considered a medical problem.

METHODS Participants (N = 30) were practicing surgeons who signed up for a hands-on postgraduate laparoscopic hernia course. An LVH simulator, with prior validity evidence, was modified for the course to increase difficulty. Participants completed 1 of the 3 variations in hernia anatomy: incarcerated omentum, incarcerated bowel, and diffuse adhesions. During the procedure, course faculty and peer observers rated surgeon performance using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills-Incisional Hernia and Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills rating scales with prior validity evidence. Rating scale reliability was reassessed for internal consistency. Peer and faculty raters' scores were compared. In addition, quality and completeness of the hernia repairs were rated. RESULTS Internal consistency on the general skills performance (peer α = .96, faculty α = .94) and procedure-specific performance (peer α = .91, faculty α = .88) scores were high. Peers were more lenient than faculty raters on all LVH items in both the procedure-specific skills and general skills ratings. Overall, participants scored poorly on the quality and completeness of their hernia repairs (mean = 3.90/16, standard deviation = 2.72), suggesting a mismatch between course attendees and hernia difficulty and identifying a learning need. CONCLUSIONS Simulation-based continuing medical education courses provide hands-on experiences that can positively affect clinical practice. Although our data appear to show a significant mismatch between clinical skill and simulator difficulty, these findings also underscore significant learning needs in the surgical community.","Pugh, Carla M; Arafat, Fahd O; Kwan, Calvin; Cohen, Elaine R; Kurashima, Yo; Vassiliou, Melina C; Fried, Gerald M",American journal of surgery,654,19

Growth and developmental plasticity of a plant is under the strict surveillance of the diurnal and circadian control mechanism, fine-tuned by the biological clock. Success of plant life-cycle resides on the continual battle against pathogen that they encounter at different developmental stages. GIGANTEA (GI), a higher plant specific nuclear protein, has been shown to play a major role in shaping plant development by coupling clock function to the circadian phasing of gene expression in Arabidopsis. Despite the central role of GI in regulating light signalling, clock function, flowering time control and in abiotic stress tolerance, its possible function in pathogen defence is not well known. Here we show that, GI expression positively correlates with susceptibility of plants to the spot blotch pathogen infection in both Arabidopsis and bread wheat. Furthermore, we also show that GI expression promotes disease severity by down regulating the salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and alters the phenylpropanoid pathway, thereby suppressing PR gene expression. It is possible that GI-mediated regulation of SA signalling may be one of the possible ways of coupling the light-temperature input pathway to pathogen defence through circadian clock. Our results indicate that the down-regulation of GI could be beneficial in generating disease tolerant crop plants for sustainable agriculture.","Kundu, Pritha; Sahu, Ranabir",Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,654,5

Five plasmodial species of P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax are responsible for causing malaria in humans. According to the World Malaria Report 2019, there were 229 million cases and ~ 0.04 million deaths of which 67% were in children below five years of age. While more than 3 billion people are at risk of malaria infection globally, antimalarial drugs are their only option for treatment. Antimalarial drug resistance keeps arising periodically and thus threatens the main line of malaria treatment, emphasizing the need to find new alternatives. The availability of whole genomes of P. falciparum and P. vivax has allowed targeting their unexplored plasmodial enzymes for inhibitor development with a focus on multistage targets that are crucial for parasite viability in both the blood and liver stages. Over the past decades, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have been explored as anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drug targets, and more recently (since 2009) aaRSs are also the focus of antimalarial drug targeting. Here we dissect the structure-based knowledge of the most advanced three aaRSs - lysyl- (KRS), prolyl- (PRS) and phenylanalyl- (FRS) synthetases in terms of development of antimalarial drugs. These examples showcase the promising potential of this family of enzymes to provide druggable targets that stall protein synthesis upon inhibition and thereby kill malaria parasites selectively.

Very low rectal cancers are still treated by abdominoperineal excision of the rectum (APER). Perineal wound complications are common after APER. There is evidence that radiotherapy increases wound complications. We wished to examine the effect of preoperative radiotherapy (SCPRT) and long course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) on perineal wound complications. METHODS We undertook a review of all patients undergoing APER at one institution between 2000 and 2010. Details of SCPRT, LCCRT and both minor and major wound complications were identified by retrospective notes review. RESULTS Of 74 patients suitable for analysis, 38 (51%) had recorded wound complications, with 23 (31%) having major wound complications. 43 patients (58%) underwent LCCRT and 11 (15%) SCPRT. Overall wound complications were more common in the LCCRT group than those receiving no treatment (58% vs 30%, p = 0.03), and major wound complications more common after SCPRT than LCCRT (45% vs 35%, p = 0.04) or no treatment (45% vs 10%, p = 0.04). Use of mesh led to more wound complications (71% vs 41%), but almost all of these patients received LCCRT.

Factors affecting the kinetics/titers of the elicited neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the mean persistence time of NAbs after infection, risk of reinfection, and enhanced respiratory disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) are the main issues needing to be clarified. Recently published studies have suggested an association between increased antibody titers and COVID-19 infection severity. Although there exist insufficient data, the titers of antibodies have been reported to be decreasing rapidly, suggesting a risk of reinfection. If reinfection occurs, another concern is whether it will be more severe due to the preexisting low level antibodies. To combat the continuing pandemic, antibody-based treatments, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), convalescent plasma (CP) therapies, and vaccine studies, have been investigated. Although it may not be as troublesome as in the Dengue fever, clinicians should be alert about the possible risk of ADE. Non-neutralizing antibodies or sub-protective levels of NAbs may trigger immunopathogenic events via immune complex-mediated or Fc receptor-dependent endocytosis, resulting in enhanced viral infection.

Current investigations on ZIKV replication have revealed the construction of replication compartments (RCs) and the utilization of host cellular endomembranes, without careful examination of the cytoskeletal network. Here, we investigated the function of vimentin, one of the intermediate filaments (IFs) that play a central role in basic cellular functions and diseases, in the life cycle of ZIKV infection. Using advanced imaging techniques, we uncovered that vimentin filaments have drastic reorganization upon viral protein synthesis, to form a perinuclear cage-like structure that embraces and concentrates RCs. Genetically removal of vimentin markedly reduced viral genome replication, viral protein production and infectious virions release, without interrupting viral binding and entry. Furthermore, proteomics and transcriptome screens by mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing identified intense interaction and regulation between vimentin and hundreds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident RNA-binding proteins. Among them, the cytoplasmic-region of ribosome receptor binding protein 1 (RRBP1), an ER transmembrane protein directly binds viral RNA, can interact with vimentin, resulting in modulation of ZIKV replication. Together, our work discovered a dual role for vimentin as being not only a structural element for RCs but also an RNA-binding-regulating hub in the ZIKV infection model, unveiling another layer of the complexity between host and virus interaction.","Zhang, Yue; Zhao, Shuangshuang; Li, Min; Li, Yian; Feng, Fengping; Cui, Jie; Xue, Yanhong; Jin, Xia; Jiu, Yaming",bioRxiv,654,1

As of June 11 2021, later one has attributed more than 174 million confirmed cases and over 3.5 million deaths globally. Nonetheless, a World Bank Group flagship report features Covid-19 induced global crisis as the strongest post-recession since World WarII. Currently, all approved therapeutics or vaccines are strictly allowed for emergency use. Hence, in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, it is vital to analyze data set covering the growth rates of positive human cases, number of recoveries, other factors, and future strategies to manage the growth of fatal Covid-19 effectively. The Uttarakhand state of India is snuggled in the lap of the Himalayas and occupies more people than Israel, Switzerland, Hong Kong, etc. This study analyzed state Covid-19 data, fetched from an authenticated government repository using Python 3.9 from April 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021. The highest recovery rate was attributed to the hilly district Rudraprayag. The analysis also revealed that a very high doubling rate was seen during the last week of May to the first week of Jun 2020. At last, based on this blueprint, we have suggested 6-points solutions for preventing the next pandemic.","Joshi, G.; Pande, A.; Gupta, O.; Nautiyal, A.; Jasola, S.; Gahtori, P.",,654,1

We describe STI positivity among SHC attendees between 2011-2020. Methods National SHC surveillance data contained information on demographics, sexual behaviour, STI testing and diagnoses. We split 2020 into periods: 1 January-12 March (prelockdown), 13 March-31 May (lockdown) and 1 June-31 August (post-lockdown). Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and HIV positivity (n positive/N tested) trends were explored by gender and sexual contact. Results In 2020, weekly numbers of consultations varied between 2,803 and 3,515 pre-lockdown, 564 and 1,298 during lockdown and 1,084 and 1,976 post-lockdown. Relatively more MSM, PrEP users and clients notified for or with symptoms of STI were seen during- and post-lockdown compared to pre-lockdown. Chlamydia positivity was around 18% among heterosexual men and 15% among women from 2016-2019, and increased to 21.1% and 16.6% respectively in 2020. Positivity increased during lockdown, up to 32% among heterosexual men, followed by decreases post-lockdown to pre-lockdown levels. Among MSM, the increase during lockdown was smaller, only slightly affecting overall positivity in 2020. Gonorrhoea positivity also increased during lockdown, causing further increasing trends among heterosexuals from 1.8% in 2011 to 2.2% in 2020 and among MSM from 9.0% to 12.1%. Syphilis positivity among MSM fluctuated between 2.0% and 2.9% in 2011-2020. Positivity peaked (6.7%) during lockdown, while the number of diagnoses was similar to pre-lockdown. In contrast, HIV positivity continued to decrease from 2,0% to 0,3% among MSM in 2011-2020. Conclusion Prioritising persons at highest risk caused decreases in diagnoses, especially chlamydia and gonorrhoea, but increases in positivity.

Differences in technological affinity are likely to lead to differences in the adoption of digital health technology and subsequent inequalities in healthcare between older and younger people and between men and women. Design: The study represents an example of a technology adoption study employing a survey-based cross sectional correlational design. Attitude towards digital health technology was measured using the 20 item Digital Health Scale. Age, gender, frequency of use of health technology and employment status data were gathered using a demographics questionnaire. The opportunity sample (N = 247) included volunteer participants aged 16-84 years (M = 31.7, SD = 19.35, 156 females and 91 males). Results: Results indicated a significant negative correlation between age and positive attitude towards digital health technology (r = -0.24, p < .01). Gender differences in attitudes towards digital health technology were non-significant (p > .05). Significant differences in frequency of use were also found, where occasional and frequent use resulted in more positive attitudes than never having used digital health technology (p < 0.05) and participants reporting frequent use were significantly older than those reporting never or occasional use (p < .05) Conclusion: Findings identified age, but not gender, as a significant factor in attitude towards digital health technology, suggesting that continued and increased reliance on digital technology in healthcare may lead to age, but not gender, related inequalities in access to healthcare in the UK. That frequent users of digital health technology were also older, highlights the greater demand for healthcare services by older individuals and is further evidence for the potential of digital healthcare to lead to age related inequalities in access to and provision of healthcare. Recommendations for successful application of digital healthcare technology are considered in the light of these findings.","Cassidy, R.",,654,1

Methods: This was a prospective descriptive observational study. Study population: healthcare professionals at the Parc Salut Mar (Barcelona) who used PPE for protection against COVID-19 between March 30 and June 15, 2020. Intervention: Each professional was provided with an individual kit to prevent PPE-induced lesions, friction, or moisture. A multidisciplinary surveillance team was deployed for the early detection of these adverse events. Results: Individual kits were provided to 1044 professionals, 32 of whom were scheduled for in-person medical assessments. Six participants (0.57%) developed Stage III or IV pressure ulcers, 24 (2.3%) had dermatitis, folliculitis, eczema and two participants did not show for their appointments. The overall rate of pressure ulcers was 0.57%;for dermatitis it was 2.3%. Conclusions: The use of preventive measures appears to be effective in preventing facial pressure ulcers induced by EPIs among healthcare professionals. Our resultsalso underscore the importance of expanding preventive measures to include not only pressure ulcers but also dermatitis.

However, the very same crisis may be an opportunity for the appearance of a new type of leadership that creatively and constructively channels the tensions caused by the loss and humiliation experienced by many individuals. Psychoanalyst Vamik Volkan calls this kind of leadership reparative. However, the metaphor he uses to give content to this concept reveals that it is anchored in the same regressive dynamic that it seeks to overcome. For this reason, this paper proposes a new concept of leadership without leaders, which—based on its collective character, rotation, and selection by lot—would allow recovering the idea of politics as a public service. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Four themes are explored: Remote work, Team management, Work/Life balance, and Technology/Software Engineering Methods. Our research has demonstrated that software companies will derive tangible benefits from supporting their employees during this uncertain time through ergonomic home offices, listening to their concerns, as well as encouraging breaks and hard stops to boost long term well-being and productivity. It shows that communication and collaboration tools, critical to project success, have been utilised. The hiring of new talent has been reimagined, with managers playing a vital role in the process. The insights gained are significant as they will assuage some pre-existing concerns regarding remote work, creating a new understanding of its role in the future. Looking to a post-COVID-19 future, we envision the rise of hybrid software development working arrangements, with a focus on the Working-From-Home to Not-Working-From-Home ratio - WFH: NWFH - perhaps colloquialised as Home: Not Home (HNH). For many this ratio will be neither 100:0 or 0:100, the former would lead to team breakdowns, developer isolation, difficulties onboarding and too many communication gaps, the latter would lead to disaffected employees. We identify plausible future software engineering working arrangements, noting that there are challenging times ahead for employers and employees as they navigate this HNH future, but there are benefits for both parties in getting the balance right. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nolan, A.; White, R.; Soomro, M.; Dopamu, B.

Several vaccines have been developed and vaccination campaigns started in December 2020. The objective of our study was to assess the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine by hospital staff. Methods: cross-sectional study conducted on a representative sample drawn at random from the staff of the Military General Hospital of Tunis. Data was collected between August and September 2020 by a clinical psychologist. We studied the associations between the different characteristics of our population and the decision to accept or refuse vaccination against COVID-19. Results: a total of 398 hospital staff agreed to answer our questionnaire. Our sample was composed of 9% (n=36) physicians, 0.9% (n=3) pharmacists, 41.3% (n=164) paramedics, 16.1% (n=64) cleaning staff and 32.7% (n=131) administrative staff. The rapid discovery of the vaccine was hoped by 97% (n=386). Vaccination was considered a means of collective protection by 84.7% (n=337). However, only 58% (n=231) agreed to be vaccinated by the COVID-19 vaccine. The main factors significantly associated with acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was previous influenza vaccination (aOR: 2.58, 95% CI 1.69-3.94;p=0.000). Conclusion: apprehension about vaccination does not appear to be sparing the future COVID-19 vaccine. Fear of vaccine side effects outweighs fear of the disease, even among hospital staff. To achieve vaccination coverage, several awareness and communication activities must be carried out. © Hamdi El Kefi et al.","El Kefi, H.; Kefi, K.; Krir, M. W.; Brahim, C.

There is an emerging body of evidence on the importance of everyday environmental exposures regarding the mental health of city inhabitants. For example, contemplative landscapes, through a series of neuroscience experiments, were shown to trigger improved mood and restoration of attention. While the Contemplative Landscape Model (CLM) for scoring landscape views was applied to single images, its suitability was never tested for walking paths and areas with a diversity of viewpoints. This study aims to fill this gap using the high-density downtown of Singapore, also known as a “City in a Garden” for its advanced urban greening strategies, as a case study. In this study, 68 360° photos were taken along four popular walking paths every 20 m. A photo set of 204 items was created by extracting three view angles from each photo. Each of them was independently scored by three experts and average CLM scores for each view and path were obtained. The results were then fed into an open-source Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) for visualization. Cohen’s kappa agreement between experts’ scores was computed. The outcomes were mapped to facilitate the identification of the most contemplative viewpoints and paths. Moreover, specific contemplative landscape patterns have been distinguished and assessed allowing the recommendation of design strategies to improve the quality of viewpoints and paths. The inter-rater agreement reached substantial to perfect values. CLM is a reliable and suitable tool that enables the fine-grained assessment and improvement of the visual quality of the urban living environments with consideration of the mental health and well-being of urbanites. It can be used at a larger scale owing to 360° photos taken from the pedestrian’s point of view. Utilizing spatially explicit maps in QGIS platforms enables a wider range of visualizations and allows for spatial patterns to be revealed that otherwise would have remained hidden. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of our semi-automated method. Furthermore, given the high inter-rater agreement observed, we suggest that there is potential in developing fully automated methods.","Hou, Yanru Masoudi Mahyar Chadala Agnieszka Olszewska-Guizzo Agnieszka",Remote Sensing,654,1

Viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has the potential to detect any virus present in a patient sample and is increasingly being used for difficult to diagnose cases. The aim of this study was to analyse the performance of mNGS for viral pathogen detection in the clinical setting of international travellers returning with febrile illness. Methods Thirty-eight serum samples from international travellers returning with febrile illness and presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands in the time period 2015-2016 were selected retrospectively. Samples were processed for viral metagenomic sequencing using a probe panel capturing all known vertebrate viruses. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using Genome Detective software for metagenomic virus detection. Metagenomic virus findings were compared with viral pathogen detection using conventional methods. Results In 8 out of the 38 patients (21%), a pathogenic virus was detected by mNGS. All viral pathogens detected by conventional assays were also detected by mNGS: dengue virus (n=4 patients), Epstein-Barr virus (n=2), hepatitis B virus (n=1). In addition, mNGS resulted in additional pathogenic findings in 2 patients (5%): dengue virus (n=1), and hepatitis C virus (n=1). Non-pathogenic viruses detected were: GB virus C (n=1) and torque teno viruses (n=3). High genome coverage and depth using capture probes enabled typing of the dengue viruses detected. Conclusions Viral metagenomics has the potential to assist the detection of viral pathogens and co-infections in one step in international travellers with a febrile syndrome. Furthermore, viral enrichment by probes resulted in high genome coverage and depth which enabled dengue virus typing.","Reyes, A.; Carbo, E. C.; van Harinxma thoe Slooten, J.; Kraakman, M. E.

AIMS & OBJECTIVES * to identify competing definitions of Covid-19 through quantitative and qualitative analyses of online Long Covid narratives in the UK; * to map UK Long Haulers' experiences, emotions and practices as articulated online; * to encourage further dialogue between patients, doctors and researchers to reassess existing definitions of Covid-19, with the collective aim of improving care and support for Long Haulers. DESIGN A rapid qualitative mixed methods study combining social media data (n=144,637 posts) with quantitative sentiment analysis and qualitative discourse analysis of themed post samples. SETTING Social media data studied were posts from people who self-reported having long-term symptoms of Covid-19. Data was analysed from the UK. All posts were anonymised to fit within ethics guidelines. No interventions were made. RESULTS Quantitative analysis found an output of 7,099 social media users who posted 144,637 posts. 27% of posts had negative sentiment, 12% were positive, 59% were neutral. The qualitative results demonstrate the negative impacts of competing definitions of Covid-19 for Long Haulers in the UK. These are mainly: time/duration; symptoms/testing; emotional impact; support and resources. CONCLUSIONS Through our analysis of UK Long Covid narratives online, we identify four main areas that need further urgent attention and reconsideration to improve support for Long Haulers: a) the time-frames assigned to Covid-19; b) the range of symptoms, which affects testing/diagnoses; c) the emotional/intellectual impact on Long Haulers; d) lack of resources and information.","Miyake, E.; Martin, S.",,654,5

During September and October 2020, at Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit we have attended patients who presented altered eating behaviors whose onset was during lockdown. We report a series of seven cases of adolescent girls between the ages of 11 and 16, who had no previous history of mental illness. During lockdown, they have presented restriction of food and increased physical exercise, with weight loss. Some of these patients have also presented food binges and purging behaviors.ObjectivesReview the impact of lockdown on eating behavior, specially on weight loss.MethodsLiterature review of scientific papers searching in Pubmed.ResultsThere are articles that study the variations in eating habits and exercise ocurred during confinement. Most focus on two trends: on the one hand, increased intake and the tendency to a more sedentary life;on the other hand, the worsening of people with a previous diagnosis of eating disorder. However, there is a third trend for which there are few studies: the new appearance of restrictive eating behaviors, together with increased physical exercise, bingeing and purging. This is the case of the patients we present. These studies describe as a possible cause of these alterations that confinement is a novel situation, which generates stress, social isolation, boredom, anxiety and a feeling of loneliness, which can influence self-concept and eating behaviors.ConclusionsLockdown has favored a change in eating habits and exercise.

Subsamples from four time periods were compared using ANOVA. The first dataset was collected before the official restrictions’ introduction (n=88). The second subsample was gathered during the “days off” week (n=262). The third period started with the “days off” extension and ended with the strict self-isolation announcement (n=296). The fourth dataset was gathered during self-isolation (n=303). General linear models (GLM) were used to determine the effect of variables on anxiety, depression, and general symptomatic index (GSI).ResultsHardiness, anxiety, depression, and GSI differed significantly between the time-periods (F=4.899, p<0.01;F=3.173, p<0.05;F=8.096, p<0.01;F=3.244, p<0.022 ;F=4.899, p<0.01 respectively). GLMs showed gender, chronic diseases, self-assessed fears, and hardiness contribution to anxiety, depression, and GSI. Hardiness had the biggest effect on all models. Anxiety was additionally influenced by the time factor, which also interacted with hardiness (see Figure 1). With lower hardiness, higher anxiety arose over time.ConclusionsHardiness notably contributes to personal adaptation during the COVID-19 outbreak-related restrictions.","Dovbysh, D.; Epishin, V.; Salikhova, A.; Bogacheva, N.; Bogdanova, M.; Kiseleva, M.",European Psychiatry,654,16

Diagnosing patients with this disease is very critical allowing fast care response and to isolate them from public. As the virus spread widely to millions of people, the fastest way to detect it is by analyzing radiology images. Early studies showed irregularity in the chest X-ray images of patients with high clinical belief of COVID-19 infection. Hence, these studies motivated us to investigate the use of machine learning techniques to help diagnosing COVID-19 patients from chest CT scans. In this paper, we propose to use a robust feature extraction descriptor and to apply a Random Forests classifier to predict COVID-19 disease in a dataset of 5000 images. First, 408 texture features are extracted using a powerful variation of Local Binary Patterns descriptor called Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence among Local Binary Patterns. Then, Random Forests classifier is applied with 250 trees to perform the classification task. Moreover, the performance of our approach was improved by using a multiresolution scheme where features are extracted from both the original input image and the subsampled image. Two metrics were used to evaluate our approach, sensitivity and specificity. We achieved 99.0% and 91.3% for both metrics, respectively.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Guideline, a risk assessment approach is the backbone of laboratory biosafety. In laboratories, risk assessment is recommended at predetermined periods and in the event of new circumstances. On February 12, 2020, the WHO published an interim guidance document, ""Laboratory biosafety guidance related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)"" and it was highly recommended that all coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) testing procedures be performed based on a local risk assessment. This study was designed to evaluate the biosafety risk in a biochemistry laboratory where routine testing of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is performed. METHODS: Risk assessment for tests performed on analyzers and a complete urinalysis was performed using the risk assessment template included in the subsequent WHO interim guidance document, “Laboratory biosafety guidance related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19).” RESULTS: The overall initial risk for tests performed on analyzers and a complete urinalysis test was determined to be very high. Processes such as pipetting a sample and checking a sample tube by scanning the barcode during tests performed on analyzers were suspended until additional risk control measures could be implemented. The manual microscopic urinalysis process was also discontinued. To reduce the risk, surgical masks, surgical caps, eye protection, and disposable laboratory coats were added to the previously mandated personal protective equipment. After implementing additional risk control measures, the total residual risk of both processes was graded medium. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Since there is as yet no effective treatment for COVID-19, exposure risk is considered severe. Therefore, the probability of exposure is important in determining the level of risk. Measures put in place reduced the total residual risk.","Zorbozan, Nergiz Zorbozan Orçun",International Journal of Medical Biochemistry,654,15

Such models project that containment measures flatten the curve, i.e., reduce but delay the peak in daily infections, cause a longer epidemic, and increase the death toll. These projections have entered common understanding; individuals and governments often advocate lifting containment measures such as social distancing to shift the peak forward, limit societal and economic disruption, and reduce mortality. It was, then, an extraordinary surprise to discover that COVID-19 pandemic data exhibit phenomenology opposite to the projections of SIR models. With the knowledge that the commonly used SIR equations only approximate the original equations developed to describe epidemics, we identified a closed form solution to the original epidemic equations. Unlike the commonly used approximations, the closed form solution replicates the observed phenomenology and quantitates pandemic dynamics with simple analytical tools for policy makers. The complete solution is validated using independently measured mobility data and accurately predicts COVID19 case numbers in multiple countries.","Duclos, T. G.; Reichert, T. A.",,654,32

Previous literature has indicated that pegfilgrastim administration prior to 24 hours post chemotherapy, may result in a deepened and prolonged neutropenia due to the increase in circulating granulocytes exposed to chemotherapy. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce potential SAR-CoV-2 exposure to cancer patients on therapy, we implemented same day administration of injectable pegfilgrastim-cbqv among select breast cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens from March 2020 - February 2021. Methods: Utilizing retrospective EHR chart reviews, 55 patients among 4 medical oncologists in our breast cancer group were identified as meeting the criteria of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv administration. Inclusion was based on completion of at least 2 consecutive cycles of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv 6 mg subcutaneous injection for primary or secondary prophylaxis. The selected patient charts were reviewed for the incidence and severity of FN. Among the patients who had documented FN, further subgroup analyses were done regarding baseline characteristics, timing of neutropenia, regimens, regimen sequence, and reported ADRs associated with pegfilgrastim-cbqv. Results: 9 (16.4%) of the 55 patients experienced FN (Grades 3-4) and 6 (10.9%) patients were hospitalized. There were no Grade 5 events and none had therapy discontinued due to FN. 8 (88.9%) of the patients experienced FN between cycles 1 and 2. Of note, there were no cases of COVID-19 among the 9 patients who had an episode of FN. 52 (94.5%) of the 55 patients received treatment with curative intent and 3 (5.5%) had metastatic disease on a subsequent line of therapy. The median age was 49.1 years (range 29-71) and patients were 56.4% Caucasian, 18.1% Black or African American, 12.7% Asian, and 12.7% Hispanic/Latina. Conclusions: Based on the retrospective data analysis, same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv appears to be a safe and effective option in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of FN with myelosuppressive standard of care chemotherapy used in breast cancer treatment. Though our review was limited by a relatively small sample size and confined to younger (49.1 median age) breast cancer patients, this opens the door to further re-evaluation of same day pegfilgrastim-cbqv administration in other patient populations. In a post pandemic treatment world, this slight change in practice has the potential to reduce patient financial toxicity associated with multiple medical visits, provide an alternative to on-body injector formulations, and ensure treatment adherence.","Leiva, M.; Pennisi, A.; Harnden, K.

It is unclear what effect this will have on outcomes and admission rates for heart failure (HF). We describe our approach and outcomes in managing HF in a Veteran's Affairs population with previously implanted CardioMEMS™ during this time.Methods: Starting February 15th 2020, virtual visits were utilized in patients with CardioMEMS™ during which their symptoms were discussed and medications adjusted. Patients also received weekly phone calls to ensure that they had medications and to adjust diuretics based on pulmonary artery (PA) pressure readings. They received text message reminders if a reading was missed. A nurse was also tasked to follow up on lab results. Data was collected by reviewing the charts of CardioMEMS™ patients followed in our clinic by cardiology fellows and divided into pre pandemic period of July 1st 2018 to February 14th 2020 and a post pandemic period of February 15th 2020 to May 15th 2020. Data collected included baseline demographics, number of in-office and virtual visits, hospital admissions for HF, PA pressures, and compliance with CardioMEMS™ readings. Phone calls to adjust diuretics or review labs were not counted as virtual visits.Results: In the pre-pandemic period we identified 49 patients with prior CardioMEMS™;baseline demographics are shown in Table 1A. Table 1B shows our results comparing the pre pandemic and post pandemic periods when our telemedicine program was started. Although in the post pandemic period our encounter rate was lower, our virtual program was able to maintain stable PA pressures and a lower overall hospital admission rate. Compliance with CardioMEMS™ also increased though this was not statistically significant.Conclusion: Both CardioMEMS™ and virtual visits may be used effectively to maintain low PA pressures and reduce hospital admissions for in patients with chronic HF.","Patel, N.; Alam, A.; Banerjee, S.; Minniefield, N.; Hall, S.; Joseph, S.; Wencker, D.; Cheeran, D.; Gong, T.",Circulation,654,5

METHODS: Pearson's Correlation and Linear Regression analyses were applied to a subset of the CLOZUK2 dataset (N=208) to assess the association between Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and plasma clozapine concentration. Norclozapine and the metabolic ratio between clozapine and norclozapine were also investigated, along with SNPs associated with clozapine metabolism. RESULTS: Association between ANC and plasma clozapine concentration was found to be significant in a linear regression model (beta=-1.41, p=0.009), with a decrease in ANC of approximately 141 cells/mm3 for every 0.1 mg/litre increase in clozapine concentration. This association was attenuated by the addition of the metabolic ratio, which was significantly negatively correlated with ANC (beta=-0.69, p=0.021). In a further regression model, three SNPs previously associated with norclozapine plasma concentrations and clozapine/norclozapine ratio were also found to be significantly associated with ANC: rs61750900 (beta=-0.410, p=0.048), rs2011425 (beta=0.450, p=0.026) and rs1126545 (beta=0.330, p=0.039). CONCLUSION: ANC was found to be significantly negatively associated with plasma clozapine concentration. Further investigation has suggested that the relationship is mediated by the clozapine/norclozapine ratio, and potentially moderated by genetic variants with effects on clozapine metabolism.","Willcocks, I.

The reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases based on molecular tests do not completely cover the total number of infected people. These reports do not include the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients and also the patients with false-negative RT-PCR results, while the infection is contagious in all of these conditions. Objective: In this study, we tried to improve our conception of the hidden perspective of SARS-CoV-2 in epidemiological reports. Methods: From May 30 to June 17, 2020, blood samples were collected from two groups of people: asymptomatic or mild symptomatic volunteer participants and severe symptomatic hospitalized patients with negative PCR results. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was done with ELISA kit targeting N or S proteins. Results: Totally 716 samples from volunteer participants and 81 samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients with negative PCR were evaluated. The test performance-adjusted seroprevalence (95% CI) of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG was 17.3% (8.8%, 25.8%) for volunteers and 25.5% (12.8%, 39.7%) for anti-N and S IgM in hospitalized group. There was an association between high-risk occupations, high-risk behaviors, or symptomatic diseases with positive SARA-Cov-2 N antibody results. Among anti-N positive infected individuals, 49.2% (21.4%, 78.8%) were anti-S positive. Conclusion: The results showed that SARS-COV-2 infection occurs in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, but in more than half of them, the produced antibody is not protective. Findings of hospitalized patients also showed that the combination of IgM assay with real-time PCR improves the detection of the disease by more than 25% in negative molecular cases.","Hajiahmadi, N.; mojtahedzade, F.; Yari, A.; Tat, M.; Soleimanjahi, H.; Amel Jamehdar, S.; Jafari, M.; Asli, S.; Dorostkar, R.; Nazemipour, M.; Mansournia, M.

Staff and students who felt supported by the university management experienced less psychological distress. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, there has been an effort to develop hybrid forms of teaching. Because the social work curriculum contains building blocks that are difficult to implement in the form of distance learning, the transition posed challenges for both staff and students.

Although scRNA-seq provides unprecedented insights into the biology of heterogeneous cell populations, analyzing such data on a gene-by-gene basis is challenging due to the large number of tested hypotheses, high level of technical noise and inflated zero counts. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis. By combining the expression data for all genes in a pathway, gene set testing can mitigate the impacts of sparsity and noise and improve interpretation, replication and statistical power. Unfortunately, statistical and biological differences between single cell and bulk expression measurements make it challenging to use gene set testing methods originally developed for bulk tissue on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific methods has been limited. To address this challenge, we have developed a new gene set testing method, variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that seamlessly integrates with the Seurat framework and is designed to accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both exploratory data visualization and statistical gene set enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, inference can be performed at both the population and single cell levels. As we demonstrate using both simulation studies and real data analyses, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.","Frost, H.

Despite the peculiarity of the pandemic situation, one year is a time long enough to analyze the evolution of the students’ perceptions and understand if could be put in relation with a possible start-up of processes of technology innovation and/or acceptance. In this article, we present the outcomes of an investigation conducted by means of an online survey at almost one year distance from the first one that involved, like this time, the students of the bachelor course in Educational Science of the University of Tor Vergata: this year 159 students (98% women). We have been able to explore the relevance of many categories of factors: intrinsic to the characteristics of the learning ecosystems, personal, contextual, related to the educational activities, perceived values of the technology-based processes. It appears that the main causal chain moves from the characteristics of the learning ecosystem, toward the impressions about the learning activities and their effectiveness to, finally, the future intentions and expectations. Not very relevant appear to be individual and contextual factors. The overall impressions of the students about the online activities seem to be positive but personal setting (equipment and connectivity) appear to be more effective than that provided by the university, possibly to underline criticalities met with the delivering of parallel blended activities. In addition, students deem very importantly the collaboration/interaction among peers and with the teachers and, as well, collaborative and design activities, while, on the contrary, most of the implemented learning activities seem to have a transmissive nature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Giovannella, C.","6th International Conference on Smart Learning Ecosystems and Regional Development, SLERD 2021",654,1

Eight organic farmers were purposefully chosen as informants because they have possessed forty-seven resilience components (SERCs) needed to cope with all kinds of social-ecological change. They were asked using a structured questionnaire to assign each SERC’s contribution value before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, in which each time scoring must be coupled with entailed explanations. Then, the paired samples t-test was run to compare such means of SERCs’ contribution values to examine whether their organic rice production’s resilience was affected by the pandemic and how. Results showed the means of SERCs before and after the pandemic have no significant difference as the p-value is 1.00 at the 95% confidence interval. This meant the pandemic does not influence the organic rice production’s social-ecological resilience. But several practices and qualifications were found varying from the original to make production more suitable. The dependence on household labor and that on mutual labor exchange were respectively increased and decreased in their roles in resilience building. Labor availability was interrupted by the social distancing protocol that had restricted people from gathering. Besides, the household accounts recording was adopted more than usual for being seen as a solution to improving the household economy during the time of financial vulnerability. Importantly, relying on local goods was remarkably recognized for increased importance. This was an attempt to get access to materials possibly free from the COVID-19 contamination because of the absent transportation. These findings provide two key interests.

Improvements include: ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine database confirms low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed for ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic.

Statement of significance When assigning taxonomic attribution in bottom-up metaproteomics, the potential for shared tryptic peptides among organisms in mixed communities should be considered. The software program METATRYP v 2 and associated interactive web portals enables users to identify the frequency of shared tryptic peptides among taxonomic groups and evaluate the occurrence of specific tryptic peptides within complex communities.

Methods: We undertook a prospective, intensive contact tracing study in schools with consecutive scarlet fever cases to assess the impact of standard interventions on transmission of Streptococcus pyogenes between cases, classroom contacts, households, and classroom environments over 4 weeks using genome sequencing. Findings: Six classes, comprising 12 scarlet fever cases, 17 household contacts, and 278 classroom contacts were recruited. Prevalence of the outbreak strain in asymptomatic classroom contacts was high, increasing from 9.6% in week 1, to 26.9% in week 2, 23.9% in week 3, then 14.3% in week 4. Colonisation with non-outbreak strains was 0 - 7.5%. Genome sequencing showed clonality of isolates within each of six classes, confirming recent transmission accounted for high carriage. Of asymptomatic classroom contacts with S. pyogenes-positive throat swabs who were tested for transmissibility, 6/28 (21%) had positive cough plates and/or hand swabs, of whom three remained S. pyogenes-positive for 3 weeks. Only 1/60 surface swabs taken in 3 classrooms yielded S. pyogenes. In contrast, settle plates placed in elevated locations were S. pyogenes-positive in both classrooms tested. Interpretation: S. pyogenes transmission in schools is intense and may occur prior to, or in spite of reported treatment of cases, underlining a need for rapid case management. Despite guideline adherence, heavy shedding of S. pyogenes by small numbers of classroom contacts may perpetuate outbreaks, and airborne transmission has a plausible role in spread.","Cordery, R.; Purba, A.; Begum, L.; Mills, E.; Mosavie, M.; Vieira, A.; Jauneikaite, E.; Leung, R.

This study aims to assess the online learning experience during the pandemic and recognize its perceived barriers according to university professors in Jordan. Methods This is a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional, and descriptive study. A web-based survey was distributed to all university professors and lecturers in public universities across Jordan. Results A total of 508 educators responded to this study. Males (67.5%, n=343) dominated the study population compared to females (32.5%, n=165). Educators spent an average of 20.2 ± 15.9 hours/week using the internet for educational purposes during the pandemic. Positive attitudes towards online teaching were seen, as 65.7% reported being prepared for online teaching, while 40.8% were comfortable communicating with students via online platforms. Institutional support for online learning also appears to have increased following the coronavirus outbreak. An overwhelming majority (81.9%, n=416) stated that their universities supported online education during the pandemic, compared to 56.5% (n=287) before.

As India is ushering towards ""Digital India"" it becomes essential for the government to embrace the cloud to enhance governance and meet the citizen expectations. This paper aims to discuss the evolution of cloud computing (Meghraj) in government organizations by examining the various information technology (IT) and cloud policies, thereby focusing on the policy gaps. The second part of this study assesses the cloud adoption trend by analyzing adopted cloud services, deployments models, leading sectors in cloud adoption and cloud approach. Eventually, in consultation with experts, a conceptual framework for cloud adoption in the government organizations of India is developed for wider cloud adoption. Design/methodology/approach The authors reviewed various IT/cloud policies and related literature to find the policy gaps for slow cloud adoption in government organizations. Authors have researched to collect the data from the various government procurement portals and analysed the tender and contracts of 500 organizations for cloud requirements to infer the cloud adoption trends. Based on the review of policy gaps, adoption trends and by consulting the experts a conceptual cloud adoption framework has been developed for wider cloud adoption in government organizations. Findings This study can be a pathfinder where the most innovative findings are about the cloud adoption trends in the government organizations in the time frame from 2013 till 2020. Several key findings are - the public cloud are the most widely adopted, infrastructure as a service model is the most used services, the majority of the applications migrating to the cloud are legacy applications, the leading sector in cloud adoption are - IT, transport and education. It is observed that the pandemic Covid-19 has acted as a catalyst and accelerated cloud adoption in government organizations. Eventually, a conceptual cloud adoption framework has been suggested addressing the policy gaps, deficiencies, overcoming the gaps and their related outcomes for the wider cloud adoption in the government organizations. Practical implications The findings of this work highlight the cloud adoption trends in government organizations which can prove vital to the policymakers. This work will assist policymakers, government organizations, researchers, IT professionals and others interested in analyzing the state of cloud adoption. The conceptual cloud adoption framework developed endeavours to uncover the policy gaps, suggest the gap resolution mechanism and outcomes which may assist the organization for wider cloud adoption. This research work effectively connects the policies to practice by stimulating the interest in understanding the policies, strategies and thereby creating the enabling environment for cloud adoption. This study provides feedback on cloud adoption trends which can assist in policy refinement and further strengthen policy/strategies.

Design/methodology/approach: This study estimates the effects of statewide stay-at-home orders on new COVID-19 cases and deaths within 19 central states, of which 14 had stay-at-home orders. It uses synthetic control analysis and nearest neighbor matching to estimate the effects at two geographic levels: counties and health service areas. Findings: Statewide stay-at-home orders significantly reduced the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Central USA starting about three weeks after their effective dates;during the fourth week after their effective dates, the orders reduced the number of new cases per capita by 31%–57%. Statewide stay-at-home orders did not reduce the number of new COVID-19 deaths in the Central USA. Social implications: The main purpose of stay-at-home orders in Spring 2020 was to “flatten the curve” so that hospitalizations would not exceed capacity. It is likely that stay-at-home orders in the Central USA reduced hospitalizations to some extent, although the effect on hospitalizations was likely smaller than the effect on cases.

Fever is defined when the rectal temperature reaches over 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F). Temperatures measured from other sites of body are usually less. There is no defined threshold for fever due to variation of body temperatures between different individuals as much as 1 degrees F. Fever itself is not life threatening unless the rectal temperature is persistent over than 41.6 degrees C (107 degrees F). Fever may be due to a serious illness such as COVID-19 and usually is caused by common infections, which are not serious. However, a fever can be caused by other reasons other than infections. Since continuous temperature monitoring is inapplicable at the rectal site, the paper aims at developing a real-time system using wireless sensor network for wireless continuous fever monitoring on the head skin or wrist, which are the most applicable area with suitable compensation for the read temperature correction. The system can record the temperature on the patient's side who is required to be isolated and transmit the fever status and critical situations to an alarming system on the side of taking-care people. This system will help in in-home care for pediatrics suffering from fever and especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic. (C) 2021 The Author. Published by Atlantis Press B.V.","Al-Mejrad, A.

The development of Eglin steel and AF 9628 has facilitated the current wave of research into next-generation HSLA steels. These alloys are characterized by both high levels of strength and increased levels of ductility and impact toughness over traditional HSLA alloys such as AISI 4340/4330. AF 9628 has proven difficult to machine due to strain hardening while turning. Manual and CNC turning experiments were carried out on AF 9628 cylindrical bars based on current machining practices. In an effort to optimize material removal rate and tool life, quantitative measurements of tool flank wear, surface roughness, hardness, microhardness, and chip thickness were taken. Qualitative observations made on microstructural evolution and chip color and morphology are also discussed.","Hasbrouck, C.

An understanding of current modes of care delivery and HCP experiences is required to improve care. The UK Diabetes Technology Network undertook an online survey aimed at members providing care in T1D. One hundred and forty three HCPs (47.6% diabetes physicians, 51.8% diabetes educators) from 105 UK NHS centers (51.7% university hospitals, 45.8% general/community hospitals), responded. Median (IQR) percentage of consultations and time taken via face-to-face, telephone and video were 20%(5-30), 30 minutes (20-34);50% (30-80), 20 minutes (15-30) and 10% (0-35), 30 minutes (20-30), respectively. Sixty four percent responded that remote consultations offered an effective strategy for care delivery. Common barriers were patient familiarity with technology (72%) and access to patient device data (67.1%). Devices with smartphone based automated cloud uploads made consultations easier (73.4%), more effective (84.6%) and facilitated hospital discharges (60.9%). Median (IQR) responses on a 7-point scale for effectiveness of remote training, compared to face-to face, for new CSII starts, CSII renewals and CGM starts, were reported as 5 (4-6), 5.5 (5-6) and 6 (5-6), respectively. Common barriers included patient digital literacy (60.8%), limited HCP experience (46.2%) and time required per patient (43.6%). A reduction in new starts (72.8%) and renewals (60.9%) for CSII was highlighted by most. Variation was noted in proportion of new CSII starts being done virtually (53.9% respondents reporting <20% and 32.9% reporting >60%). Most (92.4%) responded that remote consultations and technology training are likely to continue post-Covid19. This survey highlights the impact of COVID-19 on access to diabetes technology and demonstrates how HCP's have embraced remote care delivery, but digital literacy remains a barrier.","Forde, Hannah E.; Choudhary, Pratik Hussain Sufyan",Diabetes,654,16

Methods: A pool of starting candidate therapies was developed in collaboration with a community of infectious disease clinicians and included EIDD-1931 (metabolite of EIDD-2801), baricitinib, ebselen, selinexor, masitinib, nafamostat mesylate, telaprevir (VX-950), SN-38 (metabolite of irinotecan), imatinib mesylate, remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. Following the initial drug pool assessment, a focused, 6-drug pool was interrogated at 3 dosing levels per drug representing nearly 10,000 possible combination regimens. IDentif.AI 2.0 paired prospective, experimental validation of multi-drug efficacy on a SARS-CoV-2 live virus (propagated, original strain and B.1.351 variant) and Vero E6 assay with a quadratic optimization workflow. Results: Within 3 weeks, IDentif.AI 2.0 realized a list of combination regimens, ranked by efficacy, for clinical go/no-go regimen recommendations. IDentif.AI 2.0 revealed EIDD-1931 to be a strong candidate upon which multiple drug combinations can be derived. Conclusions: IDentif.AI 2.0 rapidly revealed promising drug combinations for a clinical translation. It pinpointed dose-dependent drug synergy behavior to play a role in trial design and realizing positive treatment outcomes. IDentif.AI 2.0 represents an actionable path towards rapidly optimizing combination therapy following pandemic emergence.","Blasiak, A.; Truong, A. T.; Remus, A.; Hooi, L.; Seah, S. G.

Nowadays, curricula around SAP ERP typically include face-to-face instruction by a lecturer as well as hands-on practice phases with the SAP system to apply and reinforce theoretical knowledge. In the era of COVID-19, this has created challenges, since courses needed to be redesigned to be fully digital within a very short amount of time. The purpose of this paper is to identify existing digital elements around SAP ERP education and training that could help lecturers to design engaging hybrid or fully digital learning offerings. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted, and the results show that the identified offerings are either infrastructural offerings or simulations. Furthermore, SAP S/4HANA is hardly addressed in prior research, even though it is supposed to become the industry standard by 2027. Consequently, future research should focus on developing digital elements for education and training around SAP S/4HANA. Existing simulations might be adapted, but research should also try to explore further digital elements beyond simulations.","Soellner, S.",International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy,654,1

Acute risk of catastrophic events such as a rare disaster, a coronavirus pandemic, trigger a global scale setback which has a substantial impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. Catastrophic events halt economic landscape, collapse commodity prices, and silence production engines which interact in complex ways. During this phase of volatility and opacity, roles of sustainable supply chain, productions and circular economy get more important than ever. Such disruptions are therefore to be addressed by identifying sustainable supply chain strategies. This paper intends to establish underlying patterns of disruptive factors in the supply chain to evaluate strategies in formation and structuring of sustainable supply chain by applying it to real world example in Turkish Kitchen Equipment Manufacturer (KEM). Selection of sustainable supply chain strategy is a complex Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) issue involving various parameters that may be contradictory at the same time. Analytical-Hierarchy-Process (AHP) and VlseKriterijumska-Optimizacija-I-Kompromisno-Resenje (VIKOR) methods can be used to solve such problems. In order to strengthen these methods in terms of their lacking capability of coping with uncertainty and incomplete information, they are extended with Interval-Valued Picture-Fuzzy Set (IVPFS) to better simulate human judgment. MCDM processes can be enhanced with Group-Decision-Making (GDM) to combine individual Decision Makers’(DMs) opinions into group judgments. Found outcome reveal that supply chains to respond catastrophic disruptions, businesses should primarily diversify supply chain from a geographic perspective, and should diversify disruptive forces in motion from a physical perspective. Originality of article is based on integrated AHP and VIKOR approaches in IVPFS based GDM algorithm as a first in the literature and presentation of its application for supply chain sustainability in catastrophic disruptions as a decision support tool.

Given the current pandemic, and the shortage of test supplies for COVID-19, group testing can play a critical role in time and cost efficient diagnostics. In many scenarios, samples collected from users are also accompanied with auxiliary information (such as demographics, history of exposure, onset of symptoms). Such auxiliary information may differ across patients, and is typically not considered while designing group testing algorithms. In this paper, we abstract such heterogeneity using a model where the population can be categorized into clusters with different prevalence rates. The main result of this work is to show that exploiting knowledge heterogeneity can further improve the efficiency of group testing. Motivated by the practical constraints and diagnostic considerations, we focus on two-stage group testing algorithms, where in the first stage, the goal is to detect as many negative samples by pooling, whereas the second stage involves individual testing to detect any remaining samples. For this class of algorithms, we prove that the gain in efficiency is related to the concavity of the number of tests as a function of the prevalence. We also show how one can choose the optimal pooling parameters for one of the algorithms in this class, namely, doubly constant pooling. We present lower bounds on the average number of tests as a function of the population heterogeneity profile, and also provide numerical results and comparisons.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) inflicts severe complications to the infected host, including cough, dyspnoea, fever, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs), and multiple organ failure. These manifestations are the consequence of the dysregulated immune system, which gives rise to excessive and unattended production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Elevated circulatory cytokine and chemokine levels are accompanied by spontaneous haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia and systemic inflammation, which are the cardinal features of life-threatening cytokine storm syndrome in advanced COVID-19 diseases. Coronavirus hijacked NF-kappa B (NF-κB) is responsible for upregulating the expressions of inflammatory cytokine, chemokine, alarmins and inducible enzymes, which paves the pathway for cytokine storm. Given the scenario, the systemic approach of simultaneous inhibition of NF-κB offers an attractive therapeutic intervention. Targeted therapies with proteasome inhibitor (VL-01, bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib), bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (acalabrutinib), nucleotide analogue (remdesivir), TNF-α monoclonal antibodies (infliximab and adalimumab), N-acetylcysteine and corticosteroids (dexamethasone), focusing the NF-κB inhibition have demonstrated effectiveness in terms of the significant decrease in morbidity and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. Hence, this review highlights the activation, signal transduction and cross-talk of NF-κB with regard to cytokine storm in COVID-19. Moreover, the development of therapeutic strategies based on NF-κB inhibition are also discussed herein.","Attiq, Ali; Jin Yao, Lui; Afzal, Sheryar; Ali Khan, Mansoor",,654,22

Several lines of evidence suggest these networks can be fine-tuned by the largest family of TE controllers, the KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). One tissue permissive for TE transcriptional activation (termed ‘transposcription’) is the adult human brain, however comprehensive studies on the extent of this process and its potential contribution to human brain development are lacking. In order to elucidate the spatiotemporal transposcriptome of the developing human brain, we have analysed two independent RNA-seq datasets encompassing 16 distinct brain regions from eight weeks post-conception into adulthood. We reveal an anti-correlated, KZFP:TE transcriptional profile defining the late prenatal to early postnatal transition, and the spatiotemporal and cell type specific activation of TE-derived alternative promoters driving the expression of neurogenesis-associated genes. We also demonstrate experimentally that a co-opted antisense L2 element drives temporal protein re-localisation away from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggestive of novel TE dependent protein function in primate evolution. This work highlights the widespread dynamic nature of the spatiotemporal KZFP:TE transcriptome and its potential importance throughout neurotypical human brain development.","Playfoot, Christopher J.; Duc, Julien; Sheppard, Shaoline; Dind, Sagane; Coudray, Alexandre; Planet, Evarist; Trono, Didier",bioRxiv,654,29

The Regulation on the EU Digital COVID Certificate was adopted on 14 June 2021 and it will start to apply from 1 July 2021. This article examines the main declared goals of the new Regulation-the first being that Digital COVID Certificates facilitate safe cross-border movement, the second being that they preclude more restrictive national measures, the third being that they prevent discrimination and the fourth being that they coordinate Member States' actions. In so doing, it highlights the main benefits and weaknesses of the Regulation, but it also goes beyond the Regulation by tackling broader questions of EU law that will be of relevance even once the pandemic is over. In this respect, the paper highlights the importance of science in assessing the proportionality of pandemic-related measures and of choosing the least restrictive and the most individualised options when restricting free movement due to public health reasons.

This paper reviews how one international supply chain performed and identifies lessons that may be helpful to improve future resilience. Economic and employment data through November 2020 are used to review the effects of COVID-19 on operations of the bioenergy supply chain in the southeastern United States (SE United States) that utilizes wood fiber to fabricate pellets. Conditions associated with the production of pellets in the SE United States changed with the outbreak of COVID-19. Federal and state government programs and classification of workers in this sector as ""essential"" during the pandemic helped maintain the woody pellet supply chain and other industries during a period of general shut down in 2020. The availability of personal protective equipment, long-term supply contracts, and established safety cultures are among the factors that enhance supply chain resilience while limited availability of skilled workers, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and dependence on external policies are among factors that reduce resilience. The analysis concludes with recommendations for the SE pellet supply chain, and other biomass supply chains, to improve their resilience to future disturbances. When best practices are implemented, SE United States biomass offers opportunities to contribute to post-pandemic economic recovery while incentivizing better forest resource management.","Kline, K.

Through this article, a special emphasis is given to one of the main challenges in the healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, the cyber risk. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has detected a dramatic increase in the number of cyber-attacks. For instance, in Italy the COVID-19 emergency has heavily affected cybersecurity; from January to April 2020, the total of attacks, accidents, and violations of privacy to the detriment of companies and individuals has doubled. Using a systematic and rigorous approach, this paper aims to analyze the literature on the cyber risk in the healthcare sector to understand the real knowledge on this topic. The findings highlight the poor attention of the scientific community on this topic, except in the United States. The literature lacks research contributions to support cyber risk management in subject areas such as Business, Management and Accounting; Social Science; and Mathematics. This research outlines the need to empirically investigate the cyber risk, giving a practical solution to health facilities.

We also investigate the relative advantages of deep learning (DL), radiomics, and DL of radiomic-embedded feature maps in predicting these outcomes. METHODS This two-center, retrospective study analyzed deidentified CXRs taken from 514 patients suspected of COVID-19 infection on presentation at Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH) and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBIMC) between the months of March and June 2020. A DL segmentation pipeline was developed to generate masks for both lung fields and artifacts for each CXR. Machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality were trained and evaluated on 353 baseline CXRs taken from COVID-19 positive patients. A novel radiomic embedding framework is also explored for outcome prediction. RESULTS Classification models for mechanical ventilation requirement (test N=154) and mortality (test N=190) had AUCs of up to 0.904 and 0.936, respectively. We also found that the inclusion of radiomic-embedded maps improved DL model predictions of clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the potential for computerized analysis of baseline CXR in predicting disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our results also suggest that radiomic embedding improves DL models in medical image analysis, a technique that might be explored further in other pathologies. The models proposed in this study and the prognostic information they provide, complementary to other clinical data, might be used to aid physician decision making and resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bae, Joseph; Kapse, Saarthak; Singh, Gagandeep; Phatak, Tej; Green, Jeremy; Madan, Nikhil; Prasanna, Prateek",ArXiv,654,31

Previous studies have described a 170 to 180 kDa molecule (p170 or gp180) that binds in vitro to the pre-S domain of the large envelope protein of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV); cDNA cloning revealed the binding protein to be duck carboxypeptidase D (DCPD). In the present study, the DCPD cDNA was transfected into several nonpermissive human-, monkey-, and avian species-derived cell lines. Cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length DCPD protein bound DHBV particles, whereas cells expressing truncated versions of DCPD protein that fail to bind the pre-S protein did not. The DHBV binding to DCPD-reconstituted cells was blocked by a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) and also by a pre-S peptide previously shown to inhibit DHBV infection of PDH. In addition to promoting virus binding, DCPD expression was associated with internalization of viral particles. The entry process was prevented by incubation of reconstituted cells with DHBV at 4 degrees C and by the addition of energy-depleting agents known to block DHBV entry into PDH. These results demonstrated that DCPD is a DHBV receptor. However, the lack of complete viral replication in DCPD-reconstituted cells suggested that additional factors are required for postentry events in immortalized cell lines.","Tong, S; Li, J; Wands, J R",Journal of virology,654,28

In this study, we determined the crystal structure of 3CLpro with the C-terminal prosequence and the catalytic-site C145A mutation, in which the enzyme binds the C-terminal prosequence of another molecule. Surprisingly, Phe at the P3' position [Phe(P3')] is snugly accommodated in the S3' pocket. Mutations of Phe(P3') impaired the C-terminal autoprocessing, but did not affect N-terminal autoprocessing. This difference was ascribed to the P2 residue, Phe(P2) and Leu(P2), in the C- and N-terminal sites, as follows. The S3' subsite is formed by Phe(P2)-induced conformational changes of 3CLpro and the direct involvement of Phe(P2) itself. In contrast, the N-terminal prosequence with Leu(P2) does not cause such conformational changes for the S3' subsite formation. In fact, the mutation of Phe(P2) to Leu in the C-terminal autoprocessing site abolishes the dependence on Phe(P3'). These mechanisms explain why Phe is required at the P3' position when the P2 position is occupied by Phe rather than Leu, which reveals a type of subsite cooperativity. Moreover, the peptide consisting of P4-P1 with Leu(P2) inhibits protease activity, whereas that with Phe(P2) exhibits a much smaller inhibitory effect, because Phe(P3') is missing. Thus, this subsite cooperativity likely exists to avoid the autoinhibition of the enzyme by its mature C-terminal sequence, and to retain the efficient C-terminal autoprocessing by the use of Phe(P2).","Muramatsu, Tomonari; Takemoto, Chie; Kim, Yong-Tae; Wang, Hongfei; Nishii, Wataru; Terada, Takaho; Shirouzu, Mikako; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,654,9

Many structural and functional alterations in skeletal muscles contribute to this disability. METHODS To evaluate the effects of exercise training on uraemic myopathy, seven HD patients (mean age 44.1+/-17.2 years) were studied. Open muscle biopsies were taken from their vastus lateralis muscle before and after a 6-month exercise rehabilitation programme and examined by routine light- and transmission electron-microscopy. Histochemical stainings of frozen sections were performed and morphometric analysis was also applied to estimate the proportion of each fibre type and the muscle fibre area. Spiroergometric and neurophysiological testing and peak extension forces of the lower limbs were measured before and after exercise training. RESULTS All patients showed impaired exercise capacity, which was associated with marked muscular atrophy (mean area 2548+/-463 microm2) and reduction in muscle strength and nerve conduction velocity. All types of fibres were atrophied, but type II were more affected. The ultrastructural study showed severe degenerative changes in skeletal muscle fibres, mitochondria, and capillaries. Exercise training had an impressive effect on muscular atrophy; in particular the proportion of type II fibres increased by 51% and mean muscle fibre area by 29%. Favourable changes were also seen on the structure and number of capillaries and mitochondria. These results were confirmed by a 48% increase in VO2 peak and a 29% in exercise time, as well as an improvement in the peak muscle strength of the lower limbs and in nerve conduction velocity. CONCLUSIONS Skeletal muscle atrophy in HD patients contribute to their poor exercise tolerance. The application of an exercise training rehabilitation programme improved muscle atrophy markedly, and therefore had beneficial effects in overall work performance.","Kouidi, E; Albani, M; Natsis, K; Megalopoulos, A; Gigis, P; Guiba-Tziampiri, O; Tourkantonis, A; Deligiannis, A","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",654,30

The chip fabrication capabilities have been extended into design and fabricate chips with higher degree of complexity in different materials, such as quartz, glass, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS). A set of methods for surface modification of micro-channels on such materials have been developed, which results in better reproducibility and higher efficiency in protein and peptide analysis. The use of novel materials for chip fabrication is also under investigation. A series of microfluidic workstations with integrated chip manipulation as well as laser induced fluorescence (LIF), ultraviolet (UV), electrochemical and chemiluminescence detection modules have been developed to attain the abilities of complex microfluidic control and data acquisition schemes. A single cell/single molecule imagining system was built up for dynamic analysis of molecular or cellular events too. Based on the work mentioned above, different functional units, such as membrane, monolithic, isotachophoresis (ITP) etc were set up and integrated. Glycoform separation of turkey ovalbumin in a lectin monolithic column and an electrophoresis channel was performed on an integrated microchip. And a novel technique has been developed that allows for the coupling of ITP and non-gel sieving electrophoresis for protein analysis in a single microchip and resulting in - 50 fold increase of the sensitivity in comparison with the use of gel electrophoresis only. A single molecule detection (SMD) based technique was developed for simultaneously measuring both bulk flow and near-wall flow velocity in the microchannels. And more recently, an SMD based technology was developed for observing molecular interactions at single molecule level.

Here, we report a reverse genetic approach to elucidate the role of N in coronavirus replication and transcription. We found that human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) vector RNAs that lack the N gene were greatly impaired in their ability to replicate, whereas the transcription of subgenomic mRNA from these vectors was easily detectable. In contrast, vector RNAs encoding a functional N protein were able to carry out both replication and transcription. Furthermore, modification of the transcription signal required for the synthesis of N protein mRNAs in the HCoV-229E genome resulted in the selective replication of genomes that are able to express the N protein. This genetic evidence leads us to conclude that at least one coronavirus structural protein, the N protein, is involved in coronavirus replication.","Schelle, Barbara; Karl, Nadja; Ludewig, Burkhard; Siddell, Stuart G; Thiel, Volker",Journal of virology,654,17

Nine mRNAs carrying a set of common 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) are synthesized from the incoming viral genomic RNA in cells infected with SCoV. A nonstructural SCoV nsp1 protein causes a severe translational shutoff by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunits. The nsp1-40S ribosome complex further induces an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5'UTR of host mRNA. However, the mechanism by which SCoV viral proteins are efficiently produced in infected cells in which host protein synthesis is impaired by nsp1 is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of the viral UTRs in evasion of the nsp1-mediated shutoff. Luciferase activities were significantly suppressed in cells expressing nsp1 together with the mRNA carrying a luciferase gene, while nsp1 failed to suppress luciferase activities of the mRNA flanked by the 5'UTR of SCoV. An RNA-protein binding assay and RNA decay assay revealed that nsp1 bound to stem-loop 1 (SL1) in the 5'UTR of SCoV RNA and that the specific interaction with nsp1 stabilized the mRNA carrying SL1. Furthermore, experiments using an SCoV replicon system showed that the specific interaction enhanced the SCoV replication. The specific interaction of nsp1 with SL1 is an important strategy to facilitate efficient viral gene expression in infected cells, in which nsp1 suppresses host gene expression. Our data indicate a novel mechanism of viral gene expression control by nsp1 and give new insight into understanding the pathogenesis of SARS.","Tanaka, Tomohisa; Kamitani, Wataru; DeDiego, Marta L; Enjuanes, Luis; Matsuura, Yoshiharu",Journal of virology,654,16

The aneurysm wall was encapsulated and sealed within a 5 ml syringe filled with saline and a pressure sensor guide wire (ComboWire, Volcano Corp.) to detect pressure changes in the perivascular compartment (outer aneurysm wall). A second pressure sensor guide wire was advanced inside the aneurysm sac. Both pressure sensors were continuously measuring pressure inside and outside the aneurysm under pulsatile flow under the following conditions: 1) baseline (reference); 2) a 16 mm by 3.75 mm flow-diverting stent (ev3/Covidien Vascular, Mansfield, MA) deployed in front of the aneurysm; 3) two flow-diverting stents (16 mm by 3.5 mm) were deployed; and 4) a covered stent (4 mm by 16 mm VeriFlex coronary artery stent covered with rubber sheet) was deployed. RESULTS Mean (±SD) baseline pressures inside and outside the aneurysm were 53.9 (±2.4) mmHg (range 120-40 mmHg) and 15.4 (±0.7) mmHg (range 40-8mmHg), respectively. There was no change in pressure inside and outside the aneurysm after deploying the first and second flow-diverting stents (partial flow impairment) and it remained at 53.9 (±2.7) mmHg and 14.9 (±1) mmHg for the pressure inside and outside the aneurysm, respectively. The pressure recording from outside the aneurysm dropped from 15.4 (±0.7) mmHg to 0.3 (±0.7) mmHg after deploying the covered stent (complete flow impairment). There was no change in pressure inside the aneurysm after deploying the covered stent. Mean (±SD) pressure within the aneurysm was 55.1 (±1.7) mmHg and it remained 54.7 (±1.7) mmHg after covered stent deployment. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest a major discordance between the pressures within the aneurysm and partial or complete flow impairment (flow independent). The outer wall pressure is reduced after covered stent placement. These finding may assist clinicians in better understanding of aneurysm hemodynamics and rupture after flow-diverting stent deployment.","Majidi, Shahram; Watanabe, Masaki; Chaudhry, Saqib A; Qureshi, Adnan I",Journal of vascular and interventional neurology,654,16

Twelve healthy control and eighteen diarrheic calves were fed lactose or D-xylose on consecutive days at 1.15 g/kg body weight and a concentration of 46 g/L. Breath and blood samples were collected at 1 h intervals from 0 to 7 h. After administration of lactose, there was a significant increase in breath hydrogen excretion in diarrheic versus control calves. The increase in plasma glucose concentrations was delayed in diarrheic calves but the area under the absorption curve was similar in control and diarrheic calves. After administration of D-xylose, breath hydrogen excretion did not increase significantly but plasma D-xylose concentrations were significantly reduced in diarrheic calves. The pathogens commonly isolated from the feces were Cryptosporidium species, rotavirus and coronavirus. The number of pathogens and the severity of the calves' acid-base deficit were not related to the severity of carbohydrate malabsorption. Decreased absorption of lactose and D-xylose may be the result of intestinal villous atrophy caused by viral or parasite infection. It was concluded that carbohydrate malabsorption rather than a specific lactose maldigestion is a significant problem in diarrheic calves. Diarrheic calves appear to digest and absorb lactose when fed in small amounts.","Nappert, G; Hamilton, D; Petrie, L; Naylor, J M",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,654,1

In this study, seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against PCV2-ORF2 capsid protein were generated, biologically characterized, and subsequently used to map the antigenic sites of PCV2 capsid protein by using infectious PCV DNA clones containing PCV1/PCV2-ORF2 chimeras. The PCV1/PCV2-ORF2 chimeras were constructed by serial deletions of PCV2-ORF2 and replacement with the corresponding sequences of the PCV1-ORF2. The reactivities of chimeric PCV1/PCV2 clones in transfected PK-15 cells with the seven MAbs were detected by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The chimera (r140) with a deletion of 47 amino acids at the N terminus of PCV2-ORF2 reacted strongly to all seven MAbs. Expanding the deletion of PCV2-ORF2 from residues 47 to 57 (r175) abolished the recognition of MAb 3B7, 3C11, 4A10, 6H2, or 8F6 to the chimera. Further deletion of PCV2-ORF2 to 62 residues disrupted the binding of this chimera to all seven MAbs. IFA reactivities with all MAbs were absent when residues 165 to 233 at the C terminus of PCV2-ORF2 was replaced with that of PCV1-ORF2. Extending the sequence of PCV2-ORF2 from residues 165 (r464) to 185 (r526), 200 (r588), or 224 (r652) restored the ability of the three chimeras to react with MAbs 3C11, 6H2, 9H7, and 12G3 but not with 8F6, 3B7, or 4A10. When the four amino acids at the C terminus of r588 were replaced with that of PCV2-ORF2, the resulting chimera (r588F) reacted with all seven MAbs. The results from this study suggest that these seven MAbs recognized at least five different but overlapping conformational epitopes within residues 47 to 63 and 165 to 200 and the last four amino acids at the C terminus of the PCV2 capsid protein.","Lekcharoensuk, Porntippa; Morozov, Igor; Paul, Prem S; Thangthumniyom, Nattarat; Wajjawalku, Worawidh; Meng, X J",Journal of virology,654,1

With the human coronaviruses as models, this test utilizes the binding properties of the chromic cation to attach viruses to glutaraldehyde-treated sheep erythrocytes. The most satisfactory system consisted of stabilizing washed sheep erythrocytes with 0.0073% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 23 degrees C, binding a high concentration of virus to a 25% erythrocyte suspension with 0.0016% chromic chloride for 20 min at 23 degrees C, stopping the reaction with phosphate-saline, and finally mixing the treated, rewashed cells with complement and agarose at 45 degrees C to prepare a slide gel.

We studied host-pathogen interactions using native lung tissue and a model of well-differentiated cultures of primary human airway epithelia. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for both the SARS-CoV and the related human respiratory coronavirus NL63, was expressed in human airway epithelia as well as lung parenchyma. As assessed by immunofluorescence staining and membrane biotinylation, ACE2 protein was more abundantly expressed on the apical than the basolateral surface of polarized airway epithelia. Interestingly, ACE2 expression positively correlated with the differentiation state of epithelia. Undifferentiated cells expressing little ACE2 were poorly infected with SARS-CoV, while well-differentiated cells expressing more ACE2 were readily infected. Expression of ACE2 in poorly differentiated epithelia facilitated SARS spike (S) protein-pseudotyped virus entry. Consistent with the expression pattern of ACE2, the entry of SARS-CoV or a lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein in differentiated epithelia was more efficient when applied to the apical surface. Furthermore, SARS-CoV replicated in polarized epithelia and preferentially exited via the apical surface. The results indicate that infection of human airway epithelia by SARS coronavirus correlates with the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression and localization. These findings have implications for understanding disease pathogenesis associated with SARS-CoV and NL63 infections.","Jia, Hong Peng; Look, Dwight C; Shi, Lei; Hickey, Melissa; Pewe, Lecia; Netland, Jason; Farzan, Michael; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Perlman, Stanley; McCray, Paul B",Journal of virology,654,24

Resource-poor countries often struggle to establish and maintain the crucial link with the periphery. A simple syndrome-based outbreak surveillance system initially developed and evaluated in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa was adapted for the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu. Eight syndromes were identified for surveillance: acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis), profuse watery diarrhoea (cholera), diarrhoea outbreak, dysentery outbreak, febrile disease with abdominal symptoms and headache (typhoid), febrile disease with generalized non-blistering rash (measles), febrile disease with intense headache and/or neck stiffness with or without haemorrhagic rash (meningococcal meningitis), and outbreaks of other febrile diseases of unknown origin. A user-oriented manual, the Tuvalu Outbreak Manual (http://www.wepi.org/books/tom/), was developed to support introduction of the surveillance system. Nurses working in seven outer island clinics and the hospital outpatient department on the main island rapidly report suspected outbreaks and submit weekly zero-reports to the central communicable disease control unit. An evaluation of the system after 12 months indicated that the Outbreak Manual was regarded as very useful by clinic nurses, and there was early evidence of improved surveillance and response to the disease syndromes under surveillance.","Nelesone, Tekaai; Durrheim, David N; Speare, Richard; Kiedrzynski, Tom; Melrose, Wayne D",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,654,9

With the use of a new technique called representational difference analysis both these diseases have recently been associated with new lymphotropic herpesviruses, i.e. human herpesviruses (HHV) 6 and 8. HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus and the etiological agent of exanthema subitum. Viral neuroinvasion occurs frequently in primary HHV-6 infection, and meningitis, encephalitis and demyelination have been described as rare complications. A relation with MS has been suggested for HHV-6, as the virus has been detected in MS plaques in the brain. Data from different studies are, however, conflicting and a definitive role for HHV-6 in MS pathogenesis has not been established. HHV-8 is believed to be the causative agent of KS, and is also associated with some rare hematological malignancies. The viral genome contains several potential oncogenes that are believed to have been picked up from the human genome during evolution. The role of HHV-8 in healthy, immunocompetent individuals is however uncertain. In conclusion, the full spectrum of human diseases associated with these new viruses is not yet understood, and rapid developments in molecular biology will continue to shed new light on the interactions between herpesviruses and their hosts.","Enbom, M",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,654,1

SOURCES Systematic review of Medline and Lilacs databases. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS The use of new diagnostic methods such as immunological techniques and polymerase chain reaction has proven invaluable for specific diagnosis and epidemiological investigation, showing adequate sensitivity, specificity and promptness of results, with the aim of guiding therapy properly. Review of epidemiological studies of community acquired pneumonia showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae is still one of the most significant etiologic agents in all age groups, in developing and industrialized countries. Resistance of this agent to penicillin and cephalosporins is increasing in all continents and is worrisome. Atypical agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are common in community acquired pneumonia, mainly in children older than 4 years, representing one third of the cases in industrial countries. However, their prevalence in developing countries remain to be determined. Respiratory syncytial virus is also a very common etiology of community acquired pneumonia and may cause severe infections, mainly in infants and younger children. The introduction of new conjugated vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b resulted in significant reduction of morbidity and mortality of pneumonia in children. CONCLUSIONS A significant impact on morbidity and mortality of acute pneumonia in children is likely to occur if microbiological and antimicrobial control is continuously and dynamically performed, thus allowing for the development of new vaccines, particularly against the respiratory syncytial virus.","Rodrigues, Joaquim Carlos; da Silva Filho, Luiz Vicente Ferreira; Bush, Andrew",Jornal de pediatria,654,7

DESIGN This was a cohort study using surveys in a random sample of Australians participating in an Australian Health Report series, supported by Pfizer. This article focuses on perceptions about menopause of 710 women. RESULTS Peri- and postmenopausal women experienced more fatigue, sleeplessness, fluid retention, and bloating than premenopausal women expected to experience. Perimenopausal and postmenopausal women rated menopause as the ""first day of the rest of [my] life"" significantly more than premenopausal women. All women perceived that menopause had an impact on aging and weight gain, but more premenopausal women feared loss of sexuality (55%), loss of femininity (39%), and the inability to have more children (37%). Perceptions of illnesses differed from actual incidence, with 27% of all women perceiving breast cancer and 11% perceiving heart disease as a health risk, compared with actual female mortality figures of 3% and 41%, respectively. Perceptions of the effects of hormone therapy were inaccurate, with 53% of all women expecting a reduction in hot flushes, 44% expecting that hormone therapy increased breast cancer, and 23% expecting that hormone therapy decreased fractures. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests a difference between perceptions of symptoms, fears, risks of future illnesses, and side effects of symptomatic treatments at menopause and actual experience. Because risk perception influences health-related behaviors, visits to healthcare providers, and treatment decisions and can be modified through education, an understanding of risk perception is clinically important.

To investigate the role of viruses in diabetes, we used a model of viral induction of autoimmune diabetes in genetically susceptible biobreeding diabetes-resistant (BBDR) rats. BBDR rats do not develop diabetes in viral-Ab-free environments, but approximately 25% of animals infected with the parvovirus Kilham rat virus (KRV) develop autoimmune diabetes via a mechanism that does not involve beta cell infection. Using this model, we recently documented that TLR agonists synergize with KRV infection and increase disease penetrance. We now report that KRV itself activates innate immunity through TLR ligation. We show that KRV infection strongly stimulates BBDR splenocytes to produce the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12p40 but not TNF-alpha. KRV infection induces high levels of IL-12p40 by splenic B cells and Flt-3-ligand-induced bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) but only low levels of IL-12p40 production by thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages or GM-CSF plus IL-4-induced bone marrow-derived DCs. KRV-induced cytokine production is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase R and NF-kappaB. Genomic KRV DNA also induces BBDR splenocytes and Flt-3L-induced DCs from wild-type but not TLR9-deficient mice to produce IL-12p40; KRV-induced up-regulation of B lymphocytes can be blocked by TLR9 antagonists including inhibitory CpG and chloroquine. Administration of chloroquine to virus-infected BBDR rats decreases the incidence of diabetes and decreases blood levels of IL-12p40. Our data implicate the TLR9-signaling pathway in KRV-induced innate immune activation and autoimmune diabetes in the BBDR rat.","Zipris, Danny; Lien, Egil; Nair, Anjali; Xie, Jenny X; Greiner, Dale L; Mordes, John P; Rossini, Aldo A",Journal of immunology,654,24

When Crutzen and Stoermer talk of “human activity”, they are talking about all the kinds of things we think of currently as “environmental” problems or threats, such as population growth, the growth of urbanism so that it has become a dominant way of life, consumption of fossil fuels, emission of greenhouse gases, speed of species extinction and so on.

Despite an initial reluctance to perform autopsies due to concerns for aerosolization of viral particles, a large number of autopsy studies published since May 2020 have shed light on the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review summarizes the histopathologic findings and clinicopathologic correlations from autopsies and biopsies performed in patients with COVID-19. PubMed and Medline (EBSCO and Ovid) were queried from June 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and histopathologic data from autopsy and biopsy studies were collected based on 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 58 studies reporting 662 patients were included. Demographic data, comorbidities at presentation, histopathologic findings, and virus detection strategies by organ system were collected. Diffuse alveolar damage, thromboembolism, and nonspecific shock injury in multiple organs were the main findings in this review. The pathologic findings emerging from autopsy and biopsy studies reviewed herein suggest that in addition to a direct viral effect in some organs, a unifying pathogenic mechanism for COVID-19 is ARDS with its known and characteristic inflammatory response, cytokine release, fever, inflammation, and generalized endothelial disturbance. This study supports the notion that autopsy studies are of utmost importance to our understanding of disease features and treatment effect to increase our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and contribute to more effective treatment strategies.","Caramaschi, Stefania; Kapp, Meghan E; Miller, Sara E; Eisenberg, Rosana; Johnson, Joyce; Epperly, Garretson; Maiorana, Antonino; Silvestri, Guido; Giannico, Giovanna A",Mod. pathol,654,5

The efforts to understand the details of this disease in hope of providing effective treatments are commendable. It is clear now that the virus can cause far more damage in patients with comorbid conditions-particularly in those with respiratory, cardiovascular, or immune-compromised system-than in patients without such comorbidities. Drug use can further exacerbate the condition. In this regard, the ill effects of smoking are amply documented, and no doubt can be a confounding factor in COVID-19 progression. Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.","Tizabi, Yousef; Getachew, Bruk; Copeland, Robert L; Aschner, Michael",FEBS j,654,22

METHODS: Incidence and mortality age-standardized rates (ASR) were calculated, and trends were identified by determining the Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC). Five-year relative survival were estimated. RESULTS: The overall incidence ASR (1996-2012) was 164.2/1,000,000 in both genders. In boys was 176.6/1,000,000, in girls it was 151.8/1,000,000. Overall mortality ASR for both gender were 69.3/1,000,000. Incidence rates (AAPC: -0.5; 95 %CI: -2.4;1.4) and mortality rates (AAPC: 0.0; 95 %CI: -2.6;2;7) were stable in the period. Five-year relative survival for all cancers were 63.9 %, with the highest survival rates for retinobastoma (83.5 %), germ cell tumors (79.8 %), and lymphomas (72.7 %). It was observed an increase in survival in the period from de 62.8 % (1996 a 2003) to 65.0 % from 2004 to 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescent cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher in Goiania, but both are stable overall.

The seminar ""The Lonely Patient"" is based on a real patient case and deals with the German health care system from the perspective of a patient. In order to create more space for discussion and exchange among students, the seminar was redesigned on the basis of the Inverted Classroom Method (ICM). Project description: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new, purely digital teaching formats had to be developed quickly in the sense of Emergency Remote Teaching. Therefore, the Inverted Classroom concept of the seminar was transformed into an online ICM. In order to promote active learning based on the ICAP model (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive), the online face-to-face part was designed as a synchronous interactive learner-centered course using the gamified audience response system Kahoot! Results: Evaluation results to date and feedback rounds with students indicate that the online ICM-version of the seminar leads to at least as good evaluation results as the previous face-to-face course. In particular, the students positively emphasize the use of Kahoot! as an activating digital medium. Discussion: Through the use of the ICM and the gamified audience response system Kahoot!, students could be activated in meaningful ways. The resulting discussions about the patient case and teaching content of the quiz questions in the synchronous online course could be implemented just as well as in the classroom-based course of previous semesters. Conclusion: The application of the online ICM, along with the consideration of the ICAP Model, has led to the successful implementation of a digital course within the context of the increased difficulty surrounding the emergency remote teaching. Additionally, students' learning success has remained at a similar level as during traditional classroom-based courses of previous semesters.","Huber, Johanna; Witti, Matthias; Schunk, Michaela; Fischer, Martin R; Tolks, Daniel",GMS J Med Educ,654,20

In this paper, we present the largest systematic measurement of the Amazon Alexa skill ecosystem to date. We study developers' practices in this ecosystem, including how they collect and justify the need for sensitive information, by designing a methodology to identify over-privileged skills with broken privacy policies. We collect 199,295 Alexa skills and uncover that around 43% of the skills (and 50% of the developers) that request these permissions follow bad privacy practices, including (partially) broken data permissions traceability. In order to perform this kind of analysis at scale, we present SkillVet that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques, and generates high-accuracy prediction sets. We report a number of concerning practices including how developers can bypass Alexa's permission system through account linking and conversational skills, and offer recommendations on how to improve transparency, privacy and security.

The replication of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome involves the core replication-transcription complex (RTC, nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and the proofreading complex (nsp14-nsp10) that can correct mismatched base pairs during replication. Structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 RTC have been actively studied, yet little is known about SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10. Here, we purified, reconstituted, and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 proofreading nuclease in vitro. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 is activated by nsp10, functioning as a potent RNase that can hydrolyze RNAs in the context of single- and double-stranded RNA and RNA/DNA hybrid duplex. SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 shows a metal-dependent nuclease activity but has different metal selectivity from RTC. While RTC is activated by Ca2+, nsp14-nsp10 is completely inhibited. Importantly, the reconstituted SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 efficiently removed the A:A mismatch at the 3'-end of the primer, enabling the stalled RTC to restart RNA replication. Our collective results confirm that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 functions as the RNA proofreading complex in SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a useful foundation to understand the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism.","Ma, Zhijun; Pourfarjam, Yasin; Kim, In-Kwon",Protein Expr Purif,654,16

METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant articles involving the features of chest CT imaging in Chinese patients with COVID-19. All data were analyzed utilizing R i386 4.0.0 software. Random-effects models were employed to calculate pooled mean differences. RESULTS: 19 retrospective studies (1332 cases) were included. The results demonstrated that the combined proportion of ground-glass opacities (GGO) was 0.79 (95% CI 0.68, 0.89), consolidation was 0.34 (95% CI 0.23, 0.47); mixed GGO and consolidation was 0.46 (95% CI 0.37; 0.56); air bronchogram sign was 0.41 (95% CI 0.26; 0.55); crazy paving pattern was 0.32 (95% CI 0.17, 0.47); interlobular septal thickening was 0.55 (95% CI 0.42, 0.67); reticulation was 0.30 (95% CI 0.12, 0.48); bronchial wall thickening was 0.24 (95% CI 0.11, 0.40); vascular enlargement was 0.74 (95% CI 0.64, 0.86); subpleural linear opacity was 0.28 (95% CI 0.12, 0.48); intrathoracic lymph node enlargement was 0.03 (95% CI 0.00, 0.07); pleural effusions was 0.03 (95% CI 0.02, 0.06). The distribution in lung: the combined proportion of central was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.11); peripheral was 0.74 (95% CI 0.62, 0.84); peripheral involving central was 0.38 (95% CI 0.19, 0.75); diffuse was 0.19 (95% CI 0.06, 0.32); unifocal involvement was 0.09 (95% CI 0.05, 0.14); multifocal involvement was 0.57 (95% CI 0.48, 0.68); unilateral was 0.16 (95% CI 0.10, 0.23); bilateral was 0.83 (95% CI 0.78, 0.89); The combined proportion of lobes involved (> 2) was 0.70 (95% CI 0.61, 0.78); lobes involved (â¦ 2) was 0.35 (95% CI 0.26, 0.44). CONCLUSION: GGO, vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening more frequently occurred in patients with COVID-19, which distribution features were peripheral, bilateral, involved lobes > 2.

METHODS: A mathematical model for the transmission of SARS-CoV2 in London. The model was parametrised using data on notified cases, deaths, contacts, and mobility to analyse the epidemic in the UK capital. We investigated the impact of multiple non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and combinations of these measures on future incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: Immediate action at the early stages of an epidemic in the affected districts would have tackled spread. While an extended lockdown is highly effective, other measures such as shielding older populations, universal testing and facemasks can all potentially contribute to a reduction of infections and deaths. However, based on current evidence it seems unlikely they will be as effective as continued lockdown. In order to achieve elimination and lift lockdown within 5 months, the best strategy seems to be a combination of weekly universal testing, contact tracing and use of facemasks, with concurrent lockdown. This approach could potentially reduce deaths by 48% compared with continued lockdown alone. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of NPIs such as universal testing, contact tracing and mask use while under lockdown would be associated with least deaths and infections. This approach would require high uptake and sustained local effort but it is potentially feasible as may lead to elimination in a relatively short time scale.","Goscé, Lara; Phillips, Professor Andrew; Spinola, P; Gupta, Dr Rishi K; Abubakar, Professor Ibrahim",J Infect,654,25

It might contribute to the fast spread of COVID-19. However, there are few scientific reports about quantitative comparison of COVID-19 exposure dose (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) for the susceptible individual when the viruses were released from the larynx or lungs. In this paper, a typical numerical model was built based on a breathing human model with real respiratory tract. By using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, two kinds of virus released sites in the infected individual's respiratory tract (larynx, lungs), seven kinds of particle sizes between 1 and 50 µm, three kinds of expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min) were used to compare the particle deposition proportion and escape proportion. The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%-44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%-37.1%). The exposure doses (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) of the susceptible individual in different situations were discussed. The susceptible individual suffered a higher exposure dose when the viruses were released from the larynx rather than lungs (the difference for 1 µm particles was 1.2-2.2 times). This study provides a possible explanation for the higher transmission risk of COVID-19 virus compared to other viruses and some control advice of COVID-19 in typical indoor environments were also discussed.","Wu, Jialin; Weng, Wenguo",Environ Res,654,1

When inoculated intranasally, mCoV is pneumotropic and recapitulates several clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 infection. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation in the heart, adipose tissue, and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of Î³Î´ T cells in lungs. Activation of ketogenesis in aged mice expands tissue protective Î³Î´ T cells, deactivates the NLRP3 inflammasome, and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged mice.

METHODS: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for four vulnerable settings (long-term care and detention facilities, schools, and homeless shelters) and eight social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker status, occupational sector, income, and education) (180 ""equity-related"" indicators) as of December 31, 2020. Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. RESULTS: Overall, information was more complete for cases and deaths than for tests, hospitalizations, and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 58%, ""D"") than that for equity-related indicators (average score of 17%, ""F""). Only British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario provided case-delimited data, with Ontario and Alberta providing case information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' immigration status, race/ethnicity, income, or education. Though several provinces reported on cases in long-term care facilities, only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for detention facilities and schools, and only Ontario reported on cases within homeless shelters and across occupational sectors.

Methods: An online survey, containing 31 questions, was conducted among medical doctors using a secure Google forms link. The survey was open for 48 hours from 16th-18th April 2020. Results: Responses were received from 556 physicians (including 266 ophthalmologists). About a third (n = 205) wanted to start OP immediately after lockdown. In OP, mask of any kind for patient (60.8%), 3-ply for assistants (52.7%) and N95 for doctors (72.7%) were most common preferences. In OP, 31.5% and 46.6% felt full PPE and gloves alone were sufficient respectively. Ophthalmologists were more likely to start immediately after lockdown compared to other specialists (P = 0.004). Among 299 surgeons, an almost equal number (27%) wanted to start routine OT services immediately and 2 weeks post lockdown. A large majority (76.9%) would mandate COVID-19 tests before elective surgeries. In OT, 34.1% wanted N95 for surgical team and 3-ply for patient, 23.4% wanted 3-ply masks for everyone. 40.5% felt additional personal protective equipment (PPE) is not required and 33.1% felt that full PPE is required for everyone in OT. Ophthalmic surgeons preferred 3-ply masks and were less inclined to use full PPE (P < 0.001).

Here, we aimed to investigate the phylogenetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Chicago, Illinois, and assess their relationship to clinical parameters. METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from COVID-19 patients in Chicago in mid-March, 2020. Using these and other publicly available sequences, we performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and phylodynamic analyses. Patient data was assessed for correlations between demographic or clinical characteristics and virologic features. FINDINGS: The 88 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in our study separated into three distinct phylogenetic clades. Clades 1 and 3 were most closely related to viral sequences from New York and Washington state, respectively, with relatively broad distributions across the US. Clade 2 was primarily found in the Chicago area with limited distribution elsewhere. At the time of diagnosis, patients infected with Clade 1 viruses had significantly higher average viral loads in their upper airways relative to patients infected with Clade 2 viruses, independent of disease severity. INTERPRETATION: These results show that multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 were circulating in the Chicago area in mid-March 2020 that differed in their relative viral loads in patient upper airways. These data suggest that differences in virus genotype can impact viral load and may influence viral spread.

The marked inflammatory response and coagulopathic state in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote pulmonary fibrosis. However, little is known about the incidence and seriousness of post-COVID-19 pulmonary pathology. Objectives: To describe the respiratory recovery and self-reported health after infection at the time of outpatient attendance. Methods: Infection severity was graded into three groups: 1) not requiring admission, 2) requiring hospital admission, and 3) requiring intensive care unit care. Participants underwent chest radiography and a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Fatigue and subjective return to health were assessed, and concentrations of CRP (C-reactive protein), IL-6 (interleukin-6), sCD25 (soluble CD25), and D-dimer were measured. The associations between initial illness and abnormal chest X-ray findings, 6MWT distance, and perception of maximal exertion were investigated. Results: A total of 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of whom 153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. A total of 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest X-ray findings were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered was 460 m. A reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of inpatient stay. A total of 95 (62%) patients believed that they had not returned to full health, whereas 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill health and fatigue were associated with an increased perception of exertion. None of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial disease severity. Conclusions: This study highlights the rates of objective respiratory disease and subjective respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 and the complex multifactorial nature of post-COVID-19 ill health.","Townsend, Liam; Dowds, Joanne; O039,; Brien, Kate; Sheill, Grainne; Dyer, Adam H; Kelly, Brendan; Hynes, John P; Mooney, Aoife; Dunne, Jean; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Farrelly, Cliona; Bourke, Nollaig M; Conlon, Niall; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Bergin, Colm; Nadarajan, Parthiban; Bannan, Ciaran",Ann Am Thorac Soc,654,1

However, the maternal-fetal immune responses initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and whether this virus is detectable in the placenta, are still under investigation. Herein, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy primarily induced specific maternal inflammatory responses in the circulation and at the maternal-fetal interface, the latter being governed by T cells and macrophages. SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy was also associated with a cytokine response in the fetal circulation (i.e. umbilical cord blood) without compromising the cellular immune repertoire. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection neither altered fetal cellular immune responses in the placenta nor induced elevated cord blood levels of IgM. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the placental tissues, nor was the sterility of the placenta compromised by maternal viral infection. This study provides insight into the maternal-fetal immune responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and further emphasizes the rarity of placental infection.","Garcia-Flores, V.; Romero, R.; Xu, Y.; Theis, K.; Arenas-Hernandez, M.; Miller, D.; Peyvandipour, A.; Galaz, J.; Levenson, D.; Bhatti, G.; Gershater, M.; Pusod, E.; Kracht, D.; Florova, V.; Leng, Y.; Tao, L.; Faucett, M.; Para, R.; Hsu, C.

METHODS: We systematically searched online databases to identify any report on maternal depression during pregnancy or postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey (EPDS) and maternal anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) until 5th July 2020. The random-effects model was used to pool the effect sizes and standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eight studies reported depressive and anxiety states of 7750 women, either pregnant or postpartum were included. The overall pooled EPDS score was higher among women during pandemic (SMD= 0.40, 95% CI: -0.05 - 0.86, p = .083) compared to previous non-pandemic times, without reaching a statistically significant difference. However, the overall pooled STAI score was significantly higher during pandemic (SMD= 0.82, 95% CI: 0.49 - 1.16, p < .001). No significant publication bias existed in selected studies (p > .05). CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis provides evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increases the risk of anxiety among women during pregnancy and perinatal period. Support measures should be considered for women during pregnancy or perinatal period to guarantee mental health for this susceptible population.","Hessami, Kamran; Romanelli, Chiara; Chiurazzi, Martina; Cozzolino, Mauro",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,654,1

For unincentivized vaccines, the delays are even more profound, as both the supply of a vaccine from developing country manufacturers and vaccine demand from countries with the high disease burdens have to be generated in order for impact to be manifest. A number of poverty-associated infectious diseases, whose burden is greatest in low-income and middle-income countries, would benefit from appropriate levels of support for vaccine development such as Group A Streptococcus, invasive non-typhoid salmonella, schistosomiasis, shigella, to name a few. With COVID-19 vaccines we will hopefully be able to provide novel vaccine technology to all countries through a unique collaborative effort, the COVAX facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). Whether this effort can deliver vaccine to all its participating countries remains to be seen, but this ambitious effort to develop, manufacture, distribute, and vaccinate 60-80% of the world's population will hopefully be a lasting legacy of COVID-19.","Excler, Jean-Louis; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Kim, Jerome H",Curr Opin Immunol,654,22

These airway teams were implemented in various hospitals around the world to respond to the acute increase of critical ill patients requiring ventilatory support. We created a financial model to estimate the costs for staffing and maintaining a dedicated COVID-19 airway response team based on the experience at an urban academic hospital in the Northeastern United States between March and June of 2020. METHODS: The institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital approved this protocol and the requirement for informed consent was waived. The average reimbursement for 125 COVID-19 airway consultations was measured. Our team estimated the costs of consumable items for each airway based on previously published recommendations for equipment and personal protective equipment. A sensitivity analyses was performed for variable numbers of monthly airway consults and different staffing patterns based on a literature review of available COVID-19 airway team structures. RESULTS: Based on the average reimbursements and estimates of the consumable costs, each airway procedure represented a net loss of $34 to the institution. The overall estimated cost of staffing a dedicated airway team was between $109,472 and $204,575 per month. CONCLUSIONS: Development and implementation of a dedicated COVID-19 airway response teams represents a significant institutional expense. Institutions should establish necessary cost sharing, consider volume and team structure, and identify reimbursement opportunities that mitigate the necessary expense associated with airway response programs.","Stone, Alexander B; Grant, Michael C; Dasani, Serena S; Nascimben, Luigino",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,654,16

There has been limited systematic analysis of PET findings after COVID-19 vaccination. Objective: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of abnormal FDG and 11C-choline uptake on PET imaging performed after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This retrospective study included 67 patients (mean age 75.6±9.2 years; 43 men, 24 women) who underwent PET examination (PET/CT in 66, PET/MRI in 1; FDG in 54, 11C-choline in 13) between December 14th 2020 and March 10th 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 52, Moderna vaccine in 15) and who had undergone pre-vaccination PET without visible axillary node uptake. PET was performed a median of 13 and 10 days after vaccination in patients who had received one (n = 44) and two (n = 23) doses, respectively. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed images, blinded to injection laterality and days since vaccination. Lymph node or deltoid SUVmax greater than blood pool SUVmax was considered positive. Interreader agreement was assessed, and the more experienced physician's measurements were used for subsequent analysis. Results: Positive axillary lymph node uptake was observed in 10.4% (7/67) of patients [7.4% (4/54) of FDG examinations, 23.1% (3/13) of 11C-choline examinations]; four and three patients with positive axillary lymph nodes had received Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively. Injection laterality was documented in five of seven patients with positive axillary lymph nodes and was ipsilateral to the positive node in all five patients. PET was performed within 24 days of vaccination in all patients with a positive node. One patient exhibited extra-axillary lymph node uptake (ipsilateral supraclavicular uptake on FDG PET). Ipsilateral deltoid uptake was present in 14.5% (8/55) of patients with documented injection laterality, including in 42.9% (3/7) of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. Interreader agreement for SUV measurements ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.600 to 0.988. Conclusion: Increased axillary lymph node or ipsilateral deltoid uptake is occasionally observed on FDG or 11C-choline PET performed after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Clinical impact: Interpreting physicians should recognize characteristics of abnormal uptake on PET after COVID-19 vaccination to guide optimal follow-up management and reduce unnecessary biopsies.","Schroeder, Dane G; Jang, Samuel; Johnson, Derek R; Takahashi, Hiroaki; Navin, Patrick J; Broski, Stephen M; Thorpe, Matthew P; Johnson, Geoffrey B; Young, Jason R",,654,10

We found that a significant proportion of teachers were providing less science during lockdown than in the normal school week. Teachers, particularly those working in more deprived areas, reported that translating the science curriculum for home learning had been difficult, with concerns around resources, internet access and parental ability to help. Some areas of the curriculum posed particular difficulties, leading to a narrowing of topics being taught. Both teachers and parents felt that schools prioritised English and maths above science. Meanwhile some parents reported that their children had engaged in sophisticated extracurricular activities, bolstered by resources available at home and knowledgeable adult help, but others said that their children had done no science at all. Parents who had studied science at post-compulsory level were much more comfortable in helping their children with science home learning. These factors combine to create conditions which may exacerbate existing inequalities as to who can access science education and careers.","Canovan, Cherry Fallon Naomi",SN Social Sciences,654,1

The electronic databases Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and ProQuest were used to search for potentially relevant articles. Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected. The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries. In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels (r = -0.42, 95%, p = 0.005). The results of this review showed that myocardial injury in patients with COVID 19 has a poor prognosis.

However, using that objective ignores that some of these interventions, like bans of public events or lockdowns, must be transitory and as short as possible because of their significant economic and societal costs. Here, we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the desired maximum of disease prevalence and the maximum decrease of disease transmission that the interventions can achieve. We study the implications of our theoretical results for designing non-pharmaceutical interventions in 16 cities and regions during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of each region's contact rate necessary to control the epidemic optimally. Our results contribute to establishing a rigorous methodology to design optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for mitigating epidemic outbreaks.","Angulo, Marco Tulio; Castaños, Fernando; Moreno-Morton, Rodrigo; Velasco-Hernández, Jorge X; Moreno, Jaime A",J R Soc Interface,654,0

The major landmarks assessed by clinicians for triaging using LUS are pleura, A and B lines. There have been many efforts for the automatic detection of these landmarks. However, restricting to a few pre-defined landmarks may not reveal the actual imaging biomarkers particularly in case of new pathologies like COVID-19. Rather, the identification of key landmarks should be driven by data given the availability of a plethora of neural network algorithms. This work is a first of its kind attempt towards unsupervised detection of the key LUS landmarks in LUS videos of COVID-19 subjects during various stages of infection. We adapted the relatively newer approach of transporter neural networks to automatically mark and track pleura, A and B lines based on their periodic motion and relatively stable appearance in the videos. Initial results on unsupervised pleura detection show an accuracy of 91.8% employing 1081 LUS video frames.","Tripathi, Arpan; Panicker, Mahesh Raveendranatha; Hareendranathan, Abhilash R; Chen, Yale Tung; Jaremko, Jacob L; Narayan, Kiran Vishnu; Kesavadas, C",,654,24

National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them. SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions. GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.","Vinay, Rasita; Baumann, Holger; Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Br Med Bull,654,16

However, they have not yet been given a voice on how their living conditions have been affected by COVID-19. AIMS: This study aims to report the impact on people with IDD of COVID-19 and the response measures applied in Spain during the lockdown. METHOD: Data on 582 individuals with IDD were collected through a survey. Seven open questions were included to capture the perspectives of people with IDD on COVID-19 and its consequences. Content analysis was performed to identify themes and categories across participant responses. Chi-square tests were used to analyze the relationship between reporting a specific category and participants' characteristics. RESULTS: Supports have been conditioned by the living context. People living in specific settings had fewer natural supports, while those living with their family relied heavily on it. Participants also lacked supports considered necessary. It is worth stressing that persons with IDD have also provided support to others. CONCLUSIONS: Although people with IDD have generally received the assistance they need during the lockdown, it must be ensured that appropriate supports are provided regardless of the context in which they live.","Navas, Patricia; Amor, Antonio M; Crespo, Manuela; Wolowiec, Zofia; Verdugo, Miguel Á",Res Dev Disabil,654,1

Genetically engineered MSCs are currently in non-clinical and clinical development for a wide range of applications including the delivery of pro-drugs and therapeutic proteins or modified to enhance their regenerative potential. Unmodified MSCs have been shown to have good safety profiles in clinical development. The introduction of exogenous transgenes introduces possible additional risks that need to be assessed in non-clinical studies prior to initiating clinical studies. The use of ex vivo non-viral genetic modification approaches potentially reduces the risks associated with viral vector transfection approaches, including the potential for cell transformation.

This survey was carried out to assess private facility readiness in providing screening services in Edo State. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out among private facilities in Edo state. Facilities were selected using stratified sampling technique. Data was collected using adapted questionnaires and an observational checklist. Facility readiness was assessed using the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control recommendations for screening. Parameters were scored and overall scores were converted to proportions. Facilities that scored 70% and above were adjudged to be ready while facilities that scored 69% and below were adjudged to be not ready. Results: A total of 252 health facilities were assessed, comprising 149 (59.1%) hospitals/clinics, 62 (24.6%) pharmacies and 41 (16.3%) laboratories. One hundred and forty-two (95.3%), 60 (96.8%) and 41 (100.0%) hospitals/clinics, pharmacies and laboratories, respectively had hand hygiene facilities. However, overall facility readiness assessment scores for screening services were low with only 51 (34.2%) hospitals/clinics, 2 (3.2%) pharmacies and 2 (4.9%) laboratories achieving high enough scores to be adjudged ready for screening services. Conclusion: Overall facility readiness of the private health sector to provide screening services in Edo State was assessed to be low.

However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the COVID-19 impact on people with dementia and their care partners. The objective of this scoping review was to synthesize the existing literature on the COVID-19 experiences of people with dementia and their care partners. METHODS: Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, we searched five electronic databases (Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science) and an online search engine (Google Scholar). Inclusion criteria consisted of English-language articles focusing on the COVID-19 experiences of people with dementia and their care partners. SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one articles met our inclusion criteria: six letters to the editor, seven commentaries, and eight original research studies. In the literature, five main themes were identified: (i) care partner fatigue and burnout; (ii) lack of access to services and supports; (iii) worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive function; (iv) coping with COVID-19; and (v) the need for more evidence-informed research. Factors such as living alone, having advanced dementia, and the length of confinement were found to exacerbate the impact of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Urgent action is needed to support people living with dementia and their care partners in the pandemic. With little access to supports and services, people with dementia and their care partners are currently at a point of crisis. Collaboration and more evidence-informed research are critical to reducing mortality and supporting people with dementia during the pandemic.","Bacsu, Juanita-Dawne R; O039,; Connell, Megan E; Webster, Claire; Poole, Lisa; Wighton, Mary Beth; Sivananthan, Saskia",Can J Public Health,654,21

Surfaces that retain the native conformation of adsorbed proteins (antimetamorphic surfaces) represent one of the main strategies for creating biocompatible materials, which are in great demand in biotechnology. Though the influence of surfaces on protein conformation has been studied for decades, real-time investigations of protein conformational behavior on a surface obtained at the single-molecule or sub-molecular level are still lacking and remain a challenge. In this work, we apply time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM) in aqueous solution to visualize the conformational dynamics of individual model protein molecules (E.coli RNA polymerase, RNAP) adsorbed on modified highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces. We quantitatively characterize the evolution of height and shape of individual RNAP molecules adsorbed on a HOPG surface modified with an oligoglycine-hydrocarbon graphite modifier (GM) during the unfolding process and determine the characteristic unfolding time as â¼7 min. Furthermore, we make a HOPG surface antimetamorphic by modifying it with a denatured RNAP protein layer. Our results provide direct evidence of GM-HOPG-induced RNAP unfolding at the single-molecule level and open new strategies for the development and investigation of antimetamorphic graphitic surfaces.","Dubrovin, Evgeniy V; Klinov, Dmitry V; Schäffer, Tilman E",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,654,20

We tested the extraversion hypothesis, which suggests that the sociability facet of extraversion may predispose people to becoming infected with the coronavirus via greater human-to-human contact. Since extraverts seek out social opportunities and seem less likely to follow containment measures related to social distancing, we hypothesized that people who have previously become infected would exhibit greater extraversion than would those who have not contracted the virus. We measured overall extraversion and three of its facets–sociability, assertiveness, and energy levels–as well as political orientation. We collected data from 217 adults, aged 40 and older, from the US and the UK, of whom 53 had had the virus at some point prior to the study, and 164 had not. Participants who had had COVID-19 were more dispositionally sociable and were also more conservative-leaning compared to participants who had never had COVID-19.

In this research, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), which integrates determinants across eight models, was utilised to analyse students' intentions to use and their actual usage of Moodle, an e-learning system at Hashemite University, a public university in Jordan, one of developing countries. Four principal determinants of intention and usage were explored: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Data were collected from 370 undergraduate students and analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. The results indicated that performance expectancy and effort expectancy affected behavioural intentions to use Moodle whereas social influence did not. In addition, the results confirmed the direct impact of behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions on students' use of Moodle. UTAUT thus provides a valuable tool that enables university decision makers, faculty members, and designers to understand the factors driving e-learning system acceptance and thus facilitate the adoption of the system by students.

In addition, a systemic prothrombotic phenotype has been reported in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 62 subjects were included in our study (n=38 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 and n=24 non-COVID-19 controls). We performed histopathologic assessment of autopsy cases, surface marker-based phenotyping of neutrophils and platelets, and functional assays for platelet, neutrophil functions, and coagulation tests, as well. RESULTS: We provide evidence that organ involvement and prothrombotic features in COVID-19 are linked by immunothrombosis. We show that, in COVID-19, inflammatory microvascular thrombi are present in the lung, kidney, and heart, containing neutrophil extracellular traps associated with platelets and fibrin. Patients with COVID-19 also present with neutrophil-platelet aggregates and a distinct neutrophil and platelet activation pattern in blood, which changes with disease severity. Whereas cases of intermediate severity show an exhausted platelet and hyporeactive neutrophil phenotype, patients severely affected with COVID-19 are characterized by excessive platelet and neutrophil activation in comparison with healthy controls and non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Dysregulated immunothrombosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 pneumonia is linked to both acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic hypercoagulability. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data point to immunothrombotic dysregulation as a key marker of disease severity in COVID-19.

Methods: From March 20, 2020, to April 22, 2020 (intra-COVID-19), virtual training on the MiniMed 670 G system was completed using Zoom with satisfaction captured through online post-training surveys. Training efficiency was measuring by the days between the date of product shipment and the date of the first and final trainings. Patient satisfaction with training on the MiniMed 670 G was determined by Net Promotor Score® (NPS®). Uploads from CareLink&#8482; Personal and CareLink Professional and calls to the Medtronic 24-h technical support team requesting educational/software assistance and/or help with health care provider telehealth visits were recorded.

Our study aimed to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were collected from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2000-2002, 1989-1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). PARTICIPANTS: A web survey was sent to the cohorts. Anybody who responded to the survey was included, resulting in 14 891 eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: The survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received in a week during the first UK COVID-19 national lockdown. INTERVENTIONS: Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, COVID-19 infection, key worker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts, and meta-regression was used to evaluate the effect of age as a moderator. RESULTS: Women (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.05) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR&#8776;2.00, all p<0.002). SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Age was not independently associated with either outcome in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly women, ethnic minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a fourthwave.","Topriceanu, Constantin-Cristian; Wong, Andrew; Moon, James C; Hughes, Alun D; Bann, David; Chaturvedi, Nishi; Patalay, Praveetha; Conti, Gabriella; Captur, Gaby",BMJ Open,654,24

It is the comparative analysis of information management during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, the United Kingdom and Italy. From the theoretical approach, the crisis management usually deals with two main models. The first one is defined as the post-reactive model, which is based on reacting to events after the first symptoms of the crisis and the communication model remains the top-down process. The second one is described as the pro-reactive model, which is based on building a dialogue space with the participatory community and it is the bottom-up communication process. In this case, the community becomes an active partner in bridging the crisis. The main goal of the proposed article is to examine the ways in which digital media influences the quality of strategic communication management in local public spaces and what type of crisis management strategy is applied to each political culture. The article discusses the pros and cons of information distributed through digital platforms by both the media and public institutions in terms of community awareness and crisis governance. The article applies a mixed method approach, which includes content analysis (media and governmental digital services), interviews (with the authorities’ members and media representatives) and social media network analysis (mainly Facebook). The analysis has been ongoing since the beginning of the pandemic in Europe (March–September 2020). The research has demonstrated that the shape and distribution of information during the pandemic were of great importance for the quality of information strategy activities. The problem was noticeable disinformation at all levels, which was the result of a lack of control over the message and the pursuit of sensation or conspiracy. It was clearly observed that without the support of crisis communication during the pandemic by the media, mainly digital platforms, it would be impossible to implement it. In all three countries, social media was the ‘information management centre’ in the COVID-19 era, but the activity of individual municipalities was slightly different. As far as the urbanized and semi-urbanized level is concerned, some consistency can be observed. In all three cases, communication on social media platforms was conducted very intensively and with the use of various tools (texts, statistics, instructional videos, scientific articles, infographics, etc.). All the ‘organizers’ of the local public sphere (presidents, mayors, journalists, service representatives) tried to keep in touch with the inhabitants. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 12th and May 13, 2020. Quota sampling was used to attain equal gender and age distributions representative of the Japanese population. RESULTS: A total of 4127 complete responses were analysed. Higher educational level (B = 0.045, p = 0.002) and household income (B = 0.04, p = 0.009) were associated with a higher increase in preventive measures when comparing before and after the state of emergency was declared. The highest reported social anxiety was a feeling of fear (65.6%), followed by embarrassment (43.8%), keeping infection a secret (41.3%), avoidance (41.3%), and stigma (25.5%). A total of 86.1% of the respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety. The partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that being female has the greatest effect (B = 0.246, p < 0.0001) on higher current preventive measures, followed by social anxiety (B = 0.119; p = 0.001) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores (B = 0.153; p < 0.001). Perceived susceptibility (B = 0.033, p = 0.020), knowing someone who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 (B = 0.097, p < 0.001), higher income (B = 0.079, p < 0.001) and educational level (B = 0.045; p = 0.004) all had a small but significant effect on influencing levels of preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate level of preventive practices found in this study indicates the need to encourage behavioural change to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The provision of mental health services is warranted as anxiety symptoms are prevalent.","Cai, Guoxi; Lin, Yulan; Lu, Yixiao; He, Fei; Morita, Kouichi; Yamamoto, Taro; Aoyagi, Kiyoshi; Taguri, Toshitsugu; Hu, Zhijian; Alias, Haridah; Danaee, Mahmoud; Wong, Li Ping",J Psychiatr Res,654,24

There are serious limitations in the CFRs when making comparisons. We examined how the age distribution of the cases is responsible for the COVID-19 CFR differences between countries. METHODS: COVID-19 cases and deaths, by ten-year age-groups, were available from the reports of seven countries. The overall and age-specific CFRs were computed for each country. The age-adjusted CFRs were computed by the direct method, using the combined number of cases in all seven countries in each age group as the standard population. A meta-analytic approach was used to obtain pooled age-specific CFRs. FINDINGS: The crude overall CFRs varied between 0.82% and 14.2% in the seven countries and the variation in the age-specific CFRs were much smaller. There was wide variation in the age distribution of the cases between countries. The ratio of the crude CFR for the country with the highest CFR to that with the lowest (6.28) was much lower for the age-adjusted CFRs rates (2.57). CONCLUSIONS: The age structure of the cases explains much of differences in the crude CFRs between countries and adjusting for age substantially reduces this variation. Other factors such as the definition of cases, coding of deaths and the standard of healthcare are likely to account for much of the residual variation. It is misleading to compare the crude COVID-19 CFRs between countries and should be avoided. At the very least, age-specific and age-adjusted CFRs should be used for comparisons.","Green, Manfred S; Peer, Victoria; Schwartz, Naama; Nitzan, Dorit",PLoS One,654,18

It is known that the structure of the human contact network plays an important role in the spread of transmissible diseases. In this work, we study a structure aware model of COVID-19 CGEM. This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else with the same probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs, mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating the scale of the second peak after reopening.","Leung, Abby; Ding, Xiaoye; Huang, Shenyang; Rabbany, Reihaneh",,654,24

Here, we studied the time trend of inflammatory markers in a population of hemodialysis (HD) patients affected by COVID-19, undergoing two different dialysis approaches. In a prospective study, thirty-one maintenance HD patients with COVID-19 were randomized to expanded HD (HDx), performed using a medium cut-off membrane, or standard treatment using a protein-leaking dialyzer (PLD). Circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TLR4 (sTLR4), and interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), were collected at diagnosis, and one and two weeks after. Compared with 14 non-infected HD patients, COVID-19 patients showed lymphopenia and higher ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Moreover, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of IL-10 (15.2 (12.5) vs. 1.2 (1.4) pg/mL, p = 0.02). Twenty-nine patients were randomized to HDx (n = 15) or PLD (n = 14). After a single treatment, IL-8 showed a significant reduction in both groups, whereas IL-10 decreased only in HDx. All over the study, there were no significant modifications in circulating cytokine levels between the two groups, except for a parallel increase of IL-8 and IL-10 at one week control in the HDx group. No correlations were found between cytokine levels and clinical outcomes. In maintenance HD patients, COVID-19 is not related to a sustained inflammatory response. Therefore, modulation of inflammation seems not to be a suitable therapeutic target in this specific population.","Esposito, Pasquale; Cipriani, Leda; Verzola, Daniela; Grignano, Maria Antonietta; De Amici, Mara; Testa, Giorgia; Grosjean, Fabrizio; Russo, Elisa; Garibotto, Giacomo; Rampino, Teresa; Viazzi, Francesca",,654,32

METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center's CEA and Global Health CEA registries, containing 6907 cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and 698 cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) studies published through 2018. We examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine recommended analytic perspectives. RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile range [IQR] 2900-110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing.

Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017-2018) reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991-49,603]) was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY [IQR 10,486-77,179]). Most governmental guidelines (67%) recommended either a healthcare sector or a payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Researchers should justify and be transparent about their choice of perspective and costing approaches. The use of the impact inventory and reporting of disaggregate outcomes can reduce inconsistencies and confusion.","Kim, David D; Silver, Madison C; Kunst, Natalia; Cohen, Joshua T; Ollendorf, Daniel A; Neumann, Peter J",Pharmacoeconomics,654,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital introduced the use of video consultations to provide continued patient care at a time when face-to-face appointments were not possible.Aim To assess patient and clinician satisfaction with the Attend Anywhere video consultations used by the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital.Method Two separate satisfaction questionnaires were piloted and developed: one for patients and one for clinicians. All patients scheduled for a video consultation between 15 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 were invited to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at the end of their consultation.Results In total, 114 patients attended video consultations in the time period assessed, of which 111 completed a satisfaction questionnaire (97.4% response rate). Fifty-six percent of patients were female with an average age of 16.5 years. Patient satisfaction was highest for the video consultations being easy to use and convenient. Over 90% of patients strongly agreed or agreed with all of the satisfaction statements and in terms of whether they would recommend using video consultations. Approximately one-third of patients preferred the video consultation to a face-to-face appointment and one-third of patients were neutral.Conclusion This study found high levels of patient satisfaction with video consultations in orthodontics. Thoughtful consideration needs to be given to the application of video clinics, going forwards, to ensure that high standards of patient care are maintained.","Parker, Kate; Chia, Matthew",Br. dent. j,654,16

We articulate a two-layer network model where a fraction of nodes are inter-layer travelers that can hop between layers. We develop a theoretical framework based on the quenched mean-field approximation to accurately predict the epidemic thresholds and final states in both layers. Extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and empirical networks demonstrate that, in the general setting where the structures of the two network layers are asymmetric, intense hopping can lead to simultaneous epidemic outbreak in both layers. In general, the impacts of hopping on the spreading dynamics in the two layers can be quite distinct. As the inter-layer coupling strength is increased, the epidemic threshold of the denser layer increases monotonically, while for the sparser layer, a surprising non-monotonic behavior of the threshold with a minimize value arises. Another finding is that, as a result of hopping, recurrent outbreaks can occur in the sparser layer, providing a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of multiple outbreaks observed from real health data.","Wu, Dayu; Tang, Ming; Liu, Zonghua; Lai, Ying-Cheng",Comm.

METHODS: We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial of a messenger RNA vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) in healthy adults. The trial was expanded to include 40 older adults, who were stratified according to age (56 to 70 years or &#8805;71 years). All the participants were assigned sequentially to receive two doses of either 25 µg or 100 µg of vaccine administered 28 days apart. RESULTS: Solicited adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity and most frequently included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site. Such adverse events were dose-dependent and were more common after the second immunization. Binding-antibody responses increased rapidly after the first immunization. By day 57, among the participants who received the 25-µg dose, the anti-S-2P geometric mean titer (GMT) was 323,945 among those between the ages of 56 and 70 years and 1,128,391 among those who were 71 years of age or older; among the participants who received the 100-µg dose, the GMT in the two age subgroups was 1,183,066 and 3,638,522, respectively. After the second immunization, serum neutralizing activity was detected in all the participants by multiple methods. Binding- and neutralizing-antibody responses appeared to be similar to those previously reported among vaccine recipients between the ages of 18 and 55 years and were above the median of a panel of controls who had donated convalescent serum. The vaccine elicited a strong CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study involving older adults, adverse events associated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine were mainly mild or moderate. The 100-µg dose induced higher binding- and neutralizing-antibody titers than the 25-µg dose, which supports the use of the 100-µg dose in a phase 3 vaccine trial.

Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months. RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.","Gerhards, Catharina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Kittel, Maximilian; Becker, Celine; Ast, Volker; Hetjens, Michael; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,654,16

We then utilize human computation for classifying search strings. Leveraging these resources, we construct a tracking model of ILI prevalence that outperforms strong historical benchmarks using only a limited stream of search data and lends itself to tracking ILI in smaller geographic units.

STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases for articles published between December 2019 and April 29, 2020 using a combination of the keywords such as COVID-19, coronavirus 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pregnancy, vaginal delivery, cesarean section, vertical transmission, management, and guidelines. Peer-reviewed case studies with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 women who delivered were included to determine mode of delivery, indications for cesarean section, and maternal and neonatal characteristics. RESULTS: A review of 36 total articles revealed deliveries in 203 SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women. A comparable severity of disease in pregnant versus nonpregnant women was noted, as previously determined. Overall, 68.9% of women delivered via cesarean section, with COVID-19 status alone being a common indication. Maternal COVID-19 may also be associated with increased risk of preterm labor, although neonatal outcomes were generally favorable. Despite eight of 206 newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, there remains no definitive evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 status alone became a common indication for cesarean delivery early in the pandemic, despite lack of evidence for vertical transmission. The increase in cesarean rate in this data may reflect obstetricians attempting to serve their patients in the best way possible given the current climate of constantly evolving guidelines on safest mode of delivery for the mother, infant, and provider. Upholding current recommendations from trusted organizations as new data are published, while also providing individualized support to expecting mothers on most appropriate mode of delivery, will reduce the amount of unnecessary, unplanned cesarean sections and could lessen the psychological impact of delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 may result in an increased rate of cesarean delivery for SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women.. · COVID-19 is a commonly reported indication for cesarean section, despite management guidelines urging against this.. · Although eight neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all additional fluid and tissue samples tested negative..","Debrabandere, Margot L; Farabaugh, Dana C; Giordano, Carolyn",Am. j. perinatol,654,26

Neste estudo, examinamos os efeitos terapêuticos de dois transplantes (12x106 céls/transplante) de células-tronco mesenquimais alogênicas derivadas do tecido adiposo (CTDAs) em 11 cães com lesões crônicas traumáticas toracolombares da medula espinhal. As CTDAs foram foram cultivadas in vitro, a proliferação e a viabilidade foram avaliadas. As suspensões foram expandidas e administradas no espaço intradural com intervalo de uma semana entre transplantes. Os cães foram submetidos à avaliações clínicas, laboratoriais, radiográficas, tomográficas, sensitivas, motoras e cistométricas. A maioria dos animais não tinha raça definida (63,63%), mesma proporção para o acometimento de fêmeas e foi observada predominância de fratura com subluxação vertebral (81,81%). Na comparação dos cães pré e pós-transplante não foram observadas alterações hematológicas e três animais (27,27%) apresentaram cistite bacteriana. Em relação a sensibilidade, motricidade e cistometria, também não houve alterações significativas dos índices antes e pós transplantes, sendo observado a ausência nociceptiva na maioria dos animais (72,73%), paraplegia e incontinência urinária na mesma proporção. Neste estudo concluiu-se que o protocolo utilizado de transplante de CTDAs, demonstrou ser um tratamento seguro para cães com lesão medular crônica, com melhora discreta da funcionalidade vesical, porém sem melhora clínica significativa.(AU)","Silva, Thais Gabrielle F.

Since March 2020, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan recommended original criteria for considering polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, although there was a lack of clear evidence for appropriate targets for COVID-19 testing. This study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 positive ratio and pre-screening criteria in Tokyo immediately after insurance-covered SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing became available in Japan. We tested 277 individuals (positive: 9.0%) from March 9-29, 2020. In total, 277 patients with mild symptoms in metropolitan Tokyo underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The results revealed that 25 (9.0%) patients were PCR positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the MHLW criteria were 100% and 10.7%, respectively. When the criteria excluded nonspecific symptoms, fatigue, and dyspnea, sensitivity slightly decreased to 92%, and specificity increased to 22.2%. Specificity was highest when the fever criterion was &#8805;37.5°C for &#8805;4 days, and exposure/travel history, including age and underlying comorbidities, was considered.

Currently, South East England and Greater London have the highest BEV sales as a percentage of new vehicle sales. The spatial distribution of EV chargers across the different regions is also analysed. The spatial analysis clearly shows the regional disparity in the uptake of EV. South East England has the highest number of public chargers excluding Greater London. However, if we consider the number of EVs in that region, it has the second-lowest ratio of approx. 1 charger per 10 BEV.

The role and impact of imaging predates this declaration and continues to change rapidly. This article is a consensus statement provided by the Canadian Society of Thoracic Radiology and the Canadian Association of Radiologists outlining the role of imaging in COVID-19 patients. The objectives are to answer key questions related to COVID-19 imaging of the chest and provide guidance for radiologists who are interpreting such studies during this pandemic. The role of chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography (CT), and lung ultrasound is discussed. This document attempts to answer key questions for the imager when dealing with this crisis, such as ""When is CXR appropriate in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection?"" or ""How should a radiologist deal with incidental findings of COVID-19 on CT of the chest done for other indications?"" This article also provides recommended reporting structure for CXR and CT, breaking diagnostic possibilities for both CXR and CT into 3 categories: typical, nonspecific, and negative based on imaging findings with representative images provided. Proposed reporting language is also outlined based on this structure.

To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation's largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital COVID-19 data. This paper presents time series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators during April 1-July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27-July 14, 2020, NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and availability/use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic's April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased during April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near-real time indicators of the pandemic's magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after declining from a peak in April. Patient outcomes appeared to improve from early April to mid-July.","Sapiano, Mathew R P; Dudeck, Margaret A; Soe, Minn; Edwards, Jonathan R; O039,; Leary, Erin N; Wu, Hsiu; Allen-Bridson, Katherine; Amor, Agasha; Arcement, Rashad; Chernetsky Tejedor, Sheri; Dantes, Ray; Gross, Cindy; Haass, Kathryn; Konnor, Rebecca; Kroop, Seth R; Leaptrot, Denise; Lemoine, Kent; Nkwata, Allan; Peterson, Kelly; Wattenmaker, Lauren; Weiner-Lastinger, Lindsey M; Pollock, Daniel; Benin, Andrea L",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,654,10

The in vasiveness and intensity of chosen therapy corresponds with patient's condition and technical means available. If a large number of patients with hypoxic failure suddenly occur, the available equipment and/or human capacity to provide effective oxygen therapy may be greatly strained. The goal of our experiment was to test functionality of a simple device equipped with a Venturi nozzle Corovalve which we designed and printed on a 3D printer. We incorporated the nozzle into a system assembled from parts commonly available in the Czech Republic. We put this device through a static test and a dynamic test performed on ourselves and measured its basic parameters. In our experiment during spontaneous ventilation the device was able to generate positive mean airway pressure. At higher flow rates, the system was able to maintain a slightly positive pressure even during the inspiration, so we can talk about a system that allows, under certain circumstances, spontaneous ventilation at continuous positive airway pressure. The most effective from setting tested was oxygen input of 15 L/min combined with PEEP valve set to 10-15 cm H2O. Mean airway pressure ranged at 9-12 cm H2O and oxygen concentration in the inspiration mixture was 40-42%. We therefore conclude that our nozzle Corovalve printed on a 3D printer can be used in a simple device allowing positive pressure oxygen application during spontaneous ventilation EPAP/CPAP. It is economical and easy to provide method and therefore of a rather interesting potential. With a sufficient number of 3D printed nozzles it could be deployed quickly and on a mass scale.","Rogozov, V.; Furdova, A.; Durica, D.; Vanek, T.; Reichertova, M.; Filipova, B.; Kacer, P.",Anesteziologie a Intenzivni Medicina,654,26

METHODS: The demographic data of 43 COVID-19 patients identified in Weifang were used to investigate whether they had traveled to epidemic areas and whether they had close contact with confirmed cases. On admission, patients' symptoms and results of laboratory tests and imaging were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 43 COVID-19 patients. including 9 third generation infected cases, 16 (37.2%) were imported, who infected the rest. Most cases were middle-aged with approximate sex ratio. A ""super spreader"", Mr. Zhang made it necessary to quarantine 69 medical personnel. Mr. Zhang directly infected six individuals who, in turn, infected another six individuals. Another patient, Mr. Wang, spread the infection to his five family members at a family gathering. Subsequently, the daughter infected her husband. The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever, weakness, dry cough, and cough sputum. In most patients, white blood cell counts were not elevated and lymphocyte counts were decreased. Elevated C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein (SAA) levels were commonly observed. There was no death among the patients or infection among the medical staff. CONCLUSIONS: The infection by the COVID-19 in Weifang was mostly the result of close contact with imported cases. These circumstances underscore the need to comprehensively strengthen the management for patients to prevent and control the spread of the virus.","Wang, Qingxiu; Zheng, Shiliang; Tan, Wei; Qi, Li; Shao, Weiguang; Zhang, Ming; Sun, Xiaodong",Ann Palliat Med,654,13

The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is an important enzyme for viral replication. Small molecules that inhibit this protease could lead to an effective COVID-19 treatment. The 2-pyridone scaffold was previously identified as a possible key pharmacophore to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. A search for natural, antimicrobial products with the 2-pyridone moiety was undertaken herein, and their calculated potency as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was investigated. Thirty-three natural products containing the 2-pyridone scaffold were identified from the literature. An in silico methodology using AutoDock was employed to predict the binding energies and inhibition constants (Ki values) for each 2-pyridone-containing compound with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. This consisted of molecular optimization of the 2-pyridone compound, docking of the compound with a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and evaluation of the predicted interactions and ligand-enzyme conformations. All compounds investigated bound to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, close to the catalytic dyad (His-41 and Cys-145). Thirteen molecules had predicted Ki valuesâ¯<â¯1â¯µM. Glu-166 formed a key hydrogen bond in the majority of the predicted complexes, while Met-165 had some involvement in the complex binding as a close contact to the ligand. Prominent 2-pyridone compounds were further evaluated for their ADMET properties. This work has identified 2-pyridone natural products with calculated potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and with desirable drug-like properties, which may lead to the rapid discovery of a treatment for COVID-19.","Forrestall, Katrina L; Burley, Darcy E; Cash, Meghan K; Pottie, Ian R; Darvesh, Sultan",Chem Biol Interact,654,29

The number of confirmed cases is rapidly increasing and has recently reached over 14 million on July 18, 2020, with over 600,000 confirmed deaths. In the research presented within this paper, a new forecasting model to predict the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease is proposed. The model proposed in this paper is a hybrid between machine learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and enhanced genetic algorithm metaheuristics. The enhanced genetic algorithm is applied to determine the parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and to enhance the overall quality and performances of the prediction model. Proposed hybrid method was tested by using realistic official dataset on the COVID-19 outbreak in the state of China. In this paper, proposed approach was compared against multiple existing state-of-the-art techniques that were tested in the same environment, on the same datasets. Based on the simulation results and conducted comparative analysis, it is observed that the proposed hybrid approach has outperformed other sophisticated approaches and that it can be used as a tool for other time-series prediction. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Zivkovic, M.; K, V.; Bacanin, N.; Djordjevic, A.; Antonijevic, M.; Strumberger, I.; Rashid, T.

PURPOSE.: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based time-use intervention on the occupational balance of university students. METHOD.: A total of 60 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group received eight sessions of web-based time management intervention, while the control group received a single-session web-based time management intervention. Pre-and post-intervention occupational balance of the participants was evaluated with Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ). FINDINGS.: The eight-session intervention was more effective than the single-session intervention in improving OBQ total scores and all individual OBQ item scores except for ""Having sufficient things to do during a regular week."" IMPLICATIONS.: Occupational therapists can implement web-based time management interventions to promote the occupational balance of university students during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Pekçetin, Serkan; Günal, Ayla",Can J Occup Ther,654,20

Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.","Nguyen, Nam P.; Vinh-Hung, Vincent; Baumert, Brigitta; Zamagni, Alice; Arenas, Meritxell; Motta, Micaela; Lara, Pedro Carlos; Myint, Arthur Sun; Bonet, Marta; Popescu, Tiberiu; Vuong, Te; Appalanaido, Gokula Kumar; Trigo, Lurdes; Karlsson, Ulf; Thariat, Juliette",Cancers,654,7

(Special Issue: COVID preparedness: lessons learned from the pandemic center: issue 2.),18.591524,4.6335335,2020,"The declaration of a state of national disaster in South Africa, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was followed by excessive-pricing regulations pertaining to certain consumer and medical products and services. The regulations and their application suggest an intertemporal benchmark to judge excessive pricing, deviating from previous practice. Intertemporal comparisons assume a structural shift during COVID-19 that changes competitive conditions, related to changes in consumer behaviour. Such comparisons must also account for demand and cost changes. While the COVID-19 regulations allow for cost-based price increases, demand-based increases are not explicitly accounted for, suggesting that the regulations are framed more generally as price-gouging regulations. The differences between price-gouging and excessive-pricing benchmarks depends on the type of disaster-period demand shock. They are similar following a transitory demand spike, provided sufficient time is allowed for dynamic price behaviour, but differ markedly when demand is elevated for the duration of the disaster period. Applying simple cost-based comparisons in recently concluded cases against smaller retailers are consistent with excessive pricing, given the presence of a demand spike. To the extent that these involve persistently higher demand, cases against wholesalers and larger retailers will be more complicated, as such demand must be reflected in competitive prices.","Boshoff, Willem H",,654,1

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.","Kraemer, Moritz U G; Yang, Chia-Hung; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Klein, Brennan; Pigott, David M; du Plessis, Louis; Faria, Nuno R; Li, Ruoran; Hanage, William P; Brownstein, John S; Layan, Maylis; Vespignani, Alessandro; Tian, Huaiyu; Dye, Christopher; Pybus, Oliver G; Scarpino, Samuel V",Science,654,1

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.","De la Fuente, Carlos I; Guadagnin, Eliane Celina; Kunzler, Marcos Roberto; Carpes, Felipe P",Adv Physiol Educ,654,24

The sustainability of systems for producing food and other products is sometimes assessed using too narrow a range of component factors. A production system might be unsustainable because of adverse effects on a wide range of aspects of human welfare, animal welfare, or the environment. All factors should be included in sustainability evaluation, otherwise products or actions might be avoided without adequate consideration of key factors or of the diversity of production systems. A scoring method that is based on scientific information and potentially of general relevance is presented here, using beef production as a example with a review of each of its sustainability components. This includes an overall combined score and specific factors that make the system unacceptable for some consumers. The results show that, in this example, the sustainability of the best systems is very much better than that of the worst systems. By taking account of scores for a wide range of components of sustainability in comparing beef-production systems, better quality policies about beef use can be formulated than when statements referring only to one system are considered. The least sustainable beef-production systems are extensive grazing that causes land degradation and the use of feedlots or indoor housing with grain feeding. Semi-intensive silvopastoral systems are the most sustainable beef-production systems, and well-managed pasture-fed beef from areas where crop production is uneconomic is also sustainable. This simple, scientifically based scoring system could be modified to use positive as well as negative scores and is of value for policy makers, researchers, producers, organisations aiming to improve sustainability, and the general public.","Broom, Donald M",Biol. rev. camb.

In this paper we argue why artificial intelligence-based, non-invasive lie detection technologies are likely to experience a rapid advancement in the coming years, and that it would be irresponsible to wait any longer before discussing its implications. Legal and popular perspectives are reviewed to evaluate the potential for these technologies to cause societal harm. To understand the perspective of a reasonable person, we conducted a survey of 129 individuals, and identified consent and accuracy as the major factors in their decision-making process regarding the use of these technologies. In our analysis, we distinguish two types of lie detection technology, accurate truth metering and accurate thought exposing. We generally find that truth metering is already largely within the scope of existing US federal and state laws, albeit with some notable exceptions. In contrast, we find that current regulation of thought exposing technologies is ambiguous and inadequate to safeguard civil liberties. In order to rectify these shortcomings, we introduce the legal concept of mental trespass and use this concept as the basis for proposed regulation.","Sen, Taylan; Haut, Kurtis; Lomakin, Denis; Hoque, Ehsan",,654,14

This allows cells to rapidly respond to environment changes. The highly conserved nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway was initially identified as a pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs. NMD is now recognized as a pathway with additional functions including precisely regulating the expression of select natural mRNAs. Majority of these natural mRNAs encode fully functional proteins. Regulation of natural mRNAs by NMD is activated by NMD targeting features and environmental cues. Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from three genetic backgrounds respond differentially to NMD depending on the environmental stimuli. We found that wild type and NMD mutant W303a, BY4741 and RM11-1a yeast strains respond similarly to copper in the environment but respond differentially to toxic cadmium. Furthermore, the PCA1 alleles encoding different mRNAs from W303a and RM11-1a strains are regulated similarly by NMD in response to the bio-metal copper but differentially in response to toxic cadmium.","Wong, Angelo; Lam, Ernest Moses; Pai, Cheryl; Gunderson, Annika; Carter, Tamar E; Kebaara, Bessie W",Yeast,654,24

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a thromboprophylaxis algorithm. This was a retrospective, single-center study in critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (University affiliated Hospital) for acute respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). From March 16 to April 9, 2020, thromboprophylaxis was adjusted according to weight (control group, n = 19) and after this date, thromboprophylaxis depended on an algorithm based on thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk factors (protocol group, n = 13). With regard to safety (number of major bleeding events and blood transfusions), the groups were not significantly different. With regard to efficacy, the number of thrombotic events decreased from 37 to 0%, p = 0.025 after implementation of the algorithm. Also, peak fibrinogen dropped from 8.6 (7.2-9.3) to 6.5 (4.6-8.4) g/L, p = 0.041 and D-dimers from 2194 (1464-3763) to 1486 (900-2582) ng/mL, p = 0.0001. In addition, length of stay declined from 19 (10-31) to 5 (3-19) days, p = 0.009. In conclusion, a tailored thromboprophylaxis algorithm (risk stratification based on clinical parameters and biological markers) reduce thrombotic phenomena in critically ill COVID-19 patients without increasing major bleeding.","Fattorutto, Maurizio; Bouckaert, Yves; Brauner, Jonathan; Franck, Stéphane; Bouton, Fabrice; Heuse, Danielle; Bouckaert, Charlotte; Bruyneel, Arnaud",J. thromb. thrombolysis,654,23

People were forced to restrict their movement and social contacts, therefore having a higher risk of inactivity. This study, carried out among Italian undergraduates, explored their sedentary and physical activities (PA) during the lockdown with respect to their previous habits. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was administered once to students attending three Italian universities after the end of lockdown. Results: A total of 1430 students (mean age 22.9 ± 3.5 years, 65.5% females) completed the questionnaire. All the sedentary behaviors increased significantly, and all the physical activities decreased significantly during the lockdown. Time spent using electronic devices showed the highest increase (+52.4 min/day), and walking the greatest decrease (-365.5 min/week). Being younger than 22 years old, female, and previously active, attending the universities of Naples and Rome and having at least one graduate parent were associated with the achievement of recommended levels of PA even during the lockdown. Conclusions: This study highlights the reduction of PA among Italian undergraduates in the course of home-confinement due to the CoViD-19 pandemic. The practice of adequate PA during the lockdown was mainly associated with the previous adoption of an active lifestyle.

The main concern is the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, it is important to find approaches to prevent or reduce the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus. Currently, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Considering the clinical effects that occur during the disease, attacking the human respiratory and hematopoietic systems, and the changes in biochemical parameters (including decreases in haemoglobin [Hb] levels and increases in serum ferritin), it is clear that iron metabolism is involved. SARS-CoV-2 induces haemolysis and interacts with Hb molecules via ACE2, CD147, CD26, and other receptors located on erythrocytes and/or blood cell precursors that produce dysfunctional Hb. A molecular docking study has reported a potential link between the virus and the beta chain of haemoglobin and attack on haem. Considering that haem is involved in miRNA processing by binding to the DGCR8-DROSHA complex, we hypothesised that the virus may check this mechanism and thwart the antiviral response.","Rapozzi, Valentina; Juarranz, Angeles; Habib, Ahsan; Ihan, Alojz; Strgar, Rebeka",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,654,33

It is the foundation for many protocols, including medical care systems, government recommendations, epidemic planning, etc. At this time of global COVID-19, credible data on epidemic spread can help governments make better decisions. This study's aim is to evaluate the cyclicity in the number of daily diagnosed coronavirus patients, thus allowing governments to plan how to allocate their resources more effectively. Methods: : To assess this cycle, we consider the time series of the first and second differences in the number of registered patients in different countries. The spectral densities of the time series are calculated, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the maximum spectral peaks are estimated. Results: : It is shown that two types of cycles can be distinguished in the time series of the case numbers. Cyclical fluctuations of the first type are characterized by periods from 100 to 300 days. Cyclical fluctuations of the second type are characterized by a period of about seven days. For different countries, the phases of the seven-day fluctuations coincide. It is assumed that cyclical fluctuations of the second type are associated with the weekly cycle of population activity. Conclusions: : These characteristics of cyclical fluctuations in cases can be used to predict the incidence rate.","Soukhovolsky, Vladislav; Kovalev, Anton; Pitt, Anne; Shulman, Katerina; Tarasova, Olga; Kessel, Boris",Chaos Solitons Fractals,654,16

This is the third and largest coronavirus outbreak since the new millennium after SARS in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Over 3 million people have been infected and the COVID-19 has caused more than 217 000 deaths. A concern exists regarding the vulnerability of patients who have been treated with immunosuppressive drugs prior or during this pandemic. Would they be more susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 and how would their clinical course be altered by their immunosuppressed state? This is a question the wider medical fraternity-including ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, gastroenterologist and transplant physicians among others-must answer. The evidence from the SARS and MERS outbreak offer some degree of confidence that immunosuppression is largely safe in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary clinical experiences based on case reports, small series and observational studies show the morbidity and mortality rates in immunosuppressed patients may not differ largely from the general population. Overwhelmingly, current best practice guidelines worldwide recommended the continuation of immunosuppression treatment in patients who require them except for perhaps high-dose corticosteroid therapy and in patients with associated risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.","Thng, Zheng Xian; De Smet, Marc D; Lee, Cecilia S; Gupta, Vishali; Smith, Justine R; McCluskey, Peter J; Thorne, Jennifer E; Kempen, John H; Zierhut, Manfred; Nguyen, Quan Dong; Pavesio, Carlos; Agrawal, Rupesh",Br. j. ophthalmol,654,8

This modality of teleconsultation allows one to follow the evolution of patients and attend early to possible complications of the disease. The purpose of the study was to analyze the evolution of a cohort of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 disease followed by primary care professionals and to determine the factors that are associated with hospital admission. A prospective cohort study was carried out on 166 patients selected by consecutive sampling that showed symptoms compatible with COVID-19. The follow-up was approached via telephone for 14 days analyzing hospitalization and comorbidities of the patients. There were 75% of the hospitalized patients that were male (p = 0.002), and 70.8% presented comorbidities (p &lt;0.001). In patients with diabetes, the risk of hospitalization was 4.6-times larger, in hypertension patients it was 3.3-times, those suffering from renal insufficiency 3.8-times, and immunosuppressed patients 4.8-times (IC 95%: 1.9–11.7). In 86.7% of the cases, clinical deterioration was diagnosed in the first seven days of the infection, and 72% of healing was reached from day seven to fourteen. Monitoring from primary care of patients with COVID-19 allows early diagnosis of clinical deterioration and detection of comorbidities associated with the risk of poor evolution and hospital admission.","Coronado-Vázquez, Valle Ramírez-Durán Maria del Valle Gómez-Salgado Juan Dorado-Rabaneda María Silvia Benito-Alonso Elena Holgado-Juan Marina Bronchalo-González Cristina",Journal of Personalized Medicine,654,1

We aimed to explore the value of bedside LUS in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated lung injury. METHODS: Sixty-three severe and 33 critical hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Bedside LUS was performed in all subjects; chest computed tomography was performed on the same day as bedside LUS in 23 cases. The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones. LUS score based on B-lines and lung consolidation was evaluated. RESULTS: The most common abnormality of LUS was the various forms of B-lines, detected in 93 (96.9%) subjects; as the second most frequent abnormality, 80 (83.3%) subjects exhibited lung consolidation, mainly located in the posterior lung region. Twenty-four (25.0%) subjects had pleural line abnormalities, and 16 (16.7%) had pleural effusion; 78 (81.3%) subjects had &#8805; 2 abnormal LUS patterns, and 93 (96.9%) had bilateral lung involvement. The proportion of bilateral or unilateral lung consolidation and pleural effusion in the critical COVID-19 group were higher than that in the severe group (P < .05). The lung consolidation of critical subjects showed a marked increase in most lung areas, including bilateral lateral lung, posterior lung, and left anterior-inferior lung area. The median (interquartile range) LUS scores of critical cases were higher than those of severe cases: left: 14 (12-17) vs 7 (5-12); right: 14 (10-16) vs 8 (3-12); bilateral: 28 (23-31) vs 15 (8-22) (P < .001 for all). There was a good correlation between the LUS score and the chest computed tomography score (r = 0.887, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common abnormal LUS pattern in subjects with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia was B-lines, followed by lung consolidation. Bedside LUS can provide important information for pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19.","Kong, Shuangshuang; Wang, Jing; Li, Yuman; Tian, Ying; Yu, Cheng; Zhang, Danqing; Li, Hong; Zhang, Li; Pang, Xueqin; Xie, Mingxing",Respir Care,654,10

However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. We studied the reticuloendothelial organs of 4 consecutive patients who died of COVID-19 and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on 4 patients who died of COVID-19. Routine H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD163 were performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from premortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. RESULTS: All 4 cases demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage within the lungs. Three of the 4 cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217, while a second patient likely had HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to a missing triglyceride level. The remaining 2 patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated HLH.

The employment of these external techniques is because the gain medium itself is incapable of modifying or multiplying the generated laser pulse. Herein, with single femtosecond laser pulse excitation, we achieve the double-pulsed stimulated emission with pulse duration of around 40 ps and pulse interval of around 70 ps from metal-halide perovskite multiple quantum wells. These unique stimulated emissions originate from one fast vertical and the other slow lateral high-efficiency carrier funneling from low-dimensional to high-dimensional quantum wells. Furthermore, such gain medium surprisingly possesses nearly Auger-free stimulated emission. These insights enable us a fresh approach to multiple the ultrashort laser pulse by gain medium.","Guo, Jia; Liu, Tanghao; Li, Mingjie; Liang, Chao; Wang, Kaiyang; Hong, Guo; Tang, Yuxin; Long, Guankui; Yu, Siu-Fung; Lee, Tae-Woo; Huang, Wei; Xing, Guichuan",Nat Commun,654,23

All vehicular movement, construction work, industries, national highways, etc. remained closed during lockdown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on the case load and epidemiology of orthopaedic trauma cases in the state of Telangana. Methods: This study was a multi-centre, retrospective observational study. Data were collected from 8 teaching hospitals, 8 corporate hospitals, 1 dedicated industrial trauma, and hand injury center and 56 consultants with individual practice. Data were collected in two groups, pre-lockdown period (23rd Feb to 24th March) and lockdown period (25th march to 25th April). Patient demographics, type of injury, and cause of injury were collected. This was done using an online survey form and retrieval of case data from health records. Results: There was a significant decrease in total trauma numbers during lockdown by 1266 cases (pre-lockdown n = 2020 and lockdown n = 754), amounting to a decrease by 62.7% (p < 0.01). RTA was the leading cause of trauma in all age groups except in elderly and we found a reduction of 77.9% cases during lockdown (n = 1343 vs. n = 298). The numbers of fragility fractures in elderly were unaffected due to lockdown. Conclusion: RTA was the major cause of injuries in young adults and adults. Though they cannot be eliminated, RTA numbers can be reduced by strict implementation of traffic rules and better road infrastructure. Lockdown had no effect on incidence of fragility fractures in elderly. With changes in life style and more people working from home there may be a reduction in overall injuries in future.","Maryada, Venkateshwar Reddy; Mulpur, Praharsha; Guravareddy, Annapareddy Venkata; Pedamallu, Sudhir Kumar; Vijay Bhasker, Bolgam",Indian J Orthop,654,29

Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

At this time, diagnosis is based on the positivity of specific RT-PCR and/or chest computed tomography scan, which are time-consuming and may delay diagnosis. Complete blood count (CBC) can potentially contribute to the diagnosis of COVID-19. We studied whether the analysis of cellular population data (CPD), provided as part of CBC-Diff analysis by the DxH 800 analyzers (Beckman Coulter), can help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Cellular population data of the different leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed in 137 controls, 322 patients with proven COVID-19 (COVID+), and 285 patients for whom investigations were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-). When CPD of COVID+ were different from controls and COVID- patients, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to test the discriminating capacity of the individual parameters. Using a random forest classifier, we developed the algorithm based on the combination of 4 monocyte CPD to discriminate COVID+ from COVID- patients. This algorithm was tested prospectively in a series of 222 patients referred to the emergency unit. RESULTS: Among the 222 patients, 86 were diagnosed as COVID-19 and 60.5% were correctly identified using the discriminating protocol. Among the 136 COVID- patients, 10.3% were misclassified (specificity 89.7%, sensitivity 60.5%). False negatives were observed mainly in patients with a low inflammatory state whereas false positives were mainly seen in patients with sepsis. CONCLUSION: Consideration of CPD could constitute a first step and potentially aid in the early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Vasse, Marc; Ballester, Marie-Christine; Ayaka, Degnile; Sukhachev, Dmitry; Delcominette, Frédérique; Habarou, Florence; Jolly, Emilie; Sukhacheva, Elena; Pascreau, Tiffany; Farfour, Éric",Int. j. lab. hematol,654,24

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential SARS-CoV-2 neurological injury that could lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A mutualistic relationship between AD and COVID-19 seems to exist. On the one hand, COVID-19 patients seem to be more prone to developing AD. On the other hand, AD patients could be more susceptible to severe COVID-19. In this review, we sought to provide an overview on the relationship between AD and COVID-19, focusing on the potential role of biomarkers, which could represent precious tool for early identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of developing AD.","Ciaccio, Marcello; Lo Sasso, Bruna; Scazzone, Concetta; Gambino, Caterina Maria; Ciaccio, Anna Maria; Bivona, Giulia; Piccoli, Tommaso; Giglio, Rosaria Vincenza; Agnello, Luisa",,654,2

Objective: To evaluate the association of race, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, on all-cause, in-hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 11â¯210 adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) hospitalized with confirmed severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between February 19, 2020, and May 31, 2020, in 92 hospitals in 12 states: Alabama (6 hospitals), Maryland (1 hospital), Florida (5 hospitals), Illinois (8 hospitals), Indiana (14 hospitals), Kansas (4 hospitals), Michigan (13 hospitals), New York (2 hospitals), Oklahoma (6 hospitals), Tennessee (4 hospitals), Texas (11 hospitals), and Wisconsin (18 hospitals). Exposures: Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample. Main Outcomes and Measures: Death during hospitalization was examined overall and by race. Race was self-reported and categorized as Black, White, and other or missing. Cox proportional hazards regression with mixed effects was used to evaluate associations between all-cause in-hospital mortality and patient characteristics while accounting for the random effects of hospital on the outcome. Results: Of 11â¯210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting to hospitals, 4180 (37.3%) were Black patients and 5583 (49.8%) were men. The median (interquartile range) age was 61 (46 to 74) years. Compared with White patients, Black patients were younger (median [interquartile range] age, 66 [50 to 80] years vs 61 [46 to 72] years), were more likely to be women (2259 [49.0%] vs 2293 [54.9%]), were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (611 [13.3%] vs 1031 [24.7%]), and had higher median (interquartile range) scores on the Neighborhood Deprivation Index (-0.11 [-0.70 to 0.56] vs 0.82 [0.08 to 1.76]) and the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (21 [0 to 44] vs 22 [0 to 46]).

Leishmaniasis is transmitted from one human to other through the bite of sandflies. It is endemic in around 98 countries including tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Southern America, and the Mediterranean region. Sterol C-24 methyltransferase (LdSMT) of Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) mediates the transfer of CH3-group from S-adenosyl methionine to C-24 position of sterol side chain which makes the ergosterol different from cholesterol. Absence of ortholog in human made it potential druggable target. Here, we performed virtual screening of library of natural compounds against LdSMT to identify the potential inhibitor for it and to fight leishmaniasis. Gigantol, flavan-3-ol, and parthenolide showed the best binding affinity towards LdSMT. Further, based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and biological activity prediction, gigantol showed the best lead-likeness and drug-likeness properties. Therefore, we further elucidated its antileishmanial properties. We found that gigantol inhibited the growth and proliferation of promastigotes as well as intra-macrophagic amastigotes. Gigantol exerted its antileishmanial action through the induction of reactive oxygen species in dose-dependent manner. Our study, suggested the possible use of gigantol as antileishmanial drug after further validations to overcome leishmaniasis.","Rahman, Fazlur; Tabrez, Shams; Ali, Rahat; Akand, Sajjadul Kadir; Zahid, Mariya; Alaidarous, Mohammed A; Alsaweed, Mohammed; Alshehri, Bader Mohammed; Banawas, Saeed; Bin Dukhyil, Abdul Aziz; Rub, Abdur",J. cell. biochem,654,24

We endeavoured to establish the experiences of families of children attending a neurodevelopmental service after a transition to virtual consultations. METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were posted to parents of children registered in virtual clinics over a 10-week period. RESULTS: Thirty parental questionnaires were completed. Parents reported a very high level of satisfaction (8.2/10) with previous face-to-face clinic appointments and virtual consultations (8.2/10). Individual aspects of virtual consultations received very positive ratings. Overall, 77% of parents highlighted a future preference for a combined service of both virtual and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high level of parental satisfaction with the service, but especially satisfaction with the unplanned transition to virtual clinics. Virtual clinics cannot replace the holistic approach gained from face-to-face consultations; however, we identified their benefits of convenience and accessibility for our vulnerable population. In response, we have developed an integrated outpatient service involving both forms of consultation to potentiate satisfaction and adapt to meet the needs of our patients.

However, it remains a grand challenge to further reduce the overpotentials and increase current density for large-scale applications. Here, spontaneously Sn doped Bi/BiOx nanowires (denoted as Bi/Bi(Sn)Ox NWs) with a core-shell structure were synthesized by an electrochemical dealloying strategy. The Bi/Bi(Sn)Ox NWs exhibit impressive formate selectivity over 92% from -0.5 to -0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and achieve a current density of 301.4 mA cm-2 at -1.0 V vs RHE. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Sn atoms into BiOx species can promote the stabilization of the *OCHO intermediate on the Bi(Sn)Ox surface and suppress the competitive H2/CO production. This work provides effective in situ construction of the metal/metal oxide hybrid composites with heteroatom doping and new insights in promoting electrochemical CO2 conversion into formate for practical applications.","Zhao, Yang; Liu, Xunlin; Liu, Zhixiao; Lin, Xin; Lan, Jiao; Zhang, Yanlong; Lu, Ying-Rui; Peng, Ming; Chan, Ting-Shan; Tan, Yongwen",Nano lett,654,24

In this paper, we scrutinize the effectiveness of deep learning models for semantic segmentation of pneumonia-infected area segmentation in CT images for the detection of COVID-19. Traditional methods for CT scan segmentation exploit a supervised learning paradigm, so they (a) require large volumes of data for their training, and (b) assume fixed (static) network weights once the training procedure has been completed. Recently, to overcome these difficulties, few-shot learning (FSL) has been introduced as a general concept of network model training using a very small amount of samples. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of few-shot learning in U-Net architectures, allowing for a dynamic fine-tuning of the network weights as new few samples are being fed into the U-Net. Experimental results indicate improvement in the segmentation accuracy of identifying COVID-19 infected regions. In particular, using 4-fold cross-validation results of the different classifiers, we observed an improvement of 5.388 ± 3.046% for all test data regarding the IoU metric and a similar increment of 5.394 ± 3.015% for the F1 score. Moreover, the statistical significance of the improvement obtained using our proposed few-shot U-Net architecture compared with the traditional U-Net model was confirmed by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value = 0.026).","Voulodimos, Athanasios; Protopapadakis, Eftychios; Katsamenis, Iason; Doulamis, Anastasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos",Sensors (Basel),654,20

Despite its close phylogenetic relationship to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased human-to-human transmission dynamics, likely due to efficient early replication in the upper respiratory epithelium of infected individuals. Since different temperatures encountered in the human upper and lower respiratory tract (33°C and 37°C, respectively) have been shown to affect the replication kinetics of several respiratory viruses, as well as host innate immune response dynamics, we investigated the impact of temperature on SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection using the primary human airway epithelial cell culture model. SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated to higher titers when infections were performed at 33°C rather than 37°C. Although both viruses were highly sensitive to type I and type III interferon pretreatment, a detailed time-resolved transcriptome analysis revealed temperature-dependent interferon and pro-inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 that were inversely proportional to its replication efficiency at 33°C or 37°C. These data provide crucial insight on pivotal virus-host interaction dynamics and are in line with characteristic clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as well as their respective transmission efficiencies.","V039,; kovski, Philip; Gultom, Mitra; Kelly, Jenna N; Steiner, Silvio; Russeil, Julie; Mangeat, Bastien; Cora, Elisa; Pezoldt, Joern; Holwerda, Melle; Kratzel, Annika; Laloli, Laura; Wider, Manon; Portmann, Jasmine; Tran, Thao; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Hartmann, Rune; Gardeux, Vincent; Alpern, Daniel; Deplancke, Bart; Thiel, Volker; Dijkman, Ronald",PLoS Biol,654,23

Rheumatologists were among the pre-World War II pioneers developing and documenting arthroscopy. The post-War father of modern arthroscopy, Watanabe, found rheumatologists among his early students, who took back the technique to their home countries, teaching orthopedists and rheumatologists alike. Rheumatologists described and analyzed the intra-articular features of their common diseases in the '60s and '70s. A groundswell of interest from academic rheumatologists in adapting arthroscopy grew considerably in the '90s with development of ""needle scopes"" that could be used in an office setting. Rheumatologists helped conduct the very trials the findings of which reduced demand for their arthroscopic services by questioning the efficacy of arthroscopic debridement in osteoarthritis (OA) and also developing biological compounds that greatly reduced the call for any resective intervention in inflammatory arthropathies. The arthroscope has proven an excellent tool for viewing and sampling synovium and continues to serve this purpose at several international research centers. While cartilage is now imaged mainly by magnetic resonance imaging, some OA features - such as a high prevalence of visible calcinosis - beg further arthroscopy-directed investigation.

The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×106- 5.5×107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.","Haage, Verena; Ferreira de Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Kühne, Arne; Fischer, Carlo; Sacks, Jilian A; Corman, Victor Max; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",J Clin Virol,654,1

The predilection for thrombosis in COVID-19 may be driven by at least two distinct, but interrelated, processes: a hypercoagulable state responsible for large vessel thrombosis and thromboembolism, and direct vascular and endothelial injury responsible for in situ microvascular thrombosis. The presence of pulmonary thrombosis may explain why hypoxemia is out of proportion to impairment in lung compliance in some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Because pulmonary embolism and COVID-19 pneumonia share many signs and symptoms, diagnosing pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.

261779,261779,261779,Tough Decisions During the COVID 19 Pandemic: A Frail Latino Patient,18.623064,4.5977254,2020,"By the beginning of the global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection has dramatically impacted on oncology daily practice. In the current oncological landscape, where immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies, distinguishing between COVID-19 and immune-mediated pneumonitis can be hard because of shared clinical, radiological and pathological features. Indeed, their common mechanism of aberrant inflammation could lead to a mutual and amplifying interaction.We describe the case of a 65-year-old patient affected by metastatic squamous head and neck cancer and candidate to an experimental therapy including an anti-PD-L1 agent. COVID-19 ground-glass opacities under resolution were an incidental finding during screening procedures and worsened after starting immunotherapy. The diagnostic work-up was consistent with ICIs-related pneumonia and it is conceivable that lung injury by SARS-CoV-2 has acted as an inflammatory primer for the development of the immune-related adverse event.Patients recovered from COVID-19 starting ICIs could be at greater risk of recall immune-mediated pneumonitis. Nasopharyngeal swab and chest CT scan are recommended before starting immunotherapy. The awareness of the phenomenon could allow an easier interpretation of radiological changes under treatment and a faster diagnostic work-up to resume ICIs. In the presence of clinical benefit, for asymptomatic ICIs-related pneumonia a watchful-waiting approach and immunotherapy prosecution are suggested.","Dipasquale, Angelo; Persico, Pasquale; Lorenzi, Elena; Rahal, Daoud; Santoro, Armando; Simonelli, Matteo",J. immunotherap. cancer,654,1
262581,262581,262581,The Impact of Nutrition on the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Nutrition,18.764172,4.265133,2021,"Importance: It is now established that across the United States, minoritized populations have borne a disproportionate burden from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about the interaction among a county's racial/ethnic composition, its level of income inequality, political factors, and COVID-19 outcomes in the population. Objective: To quantify the association of economic inequality, racial/ethnic composition, political factors, and state health care policy with the incidence and mortality burden associated with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 3142 counties in the 50 US states and for Washington, DC. Data on the first 200 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the first confirmed US case on January 22 to August 8, 2020, were gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USAFacts.org, the US Census Bureau, the American Community Survey, GitHub, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Council of State Governments, and the National Governors Association. Exposures: Racial/ethnic composition was determined as percentage of the population that is Black or Hispanic; income inequality, using the Gini index; politics, political affiliation and sex of the state governor, gubernatorial term limits, and percentage of the county's population that voted Republican in 2016; and state health care policy, participation in the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Six additional covariates were assessed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates for US counties during the first 200 days of the pandemic. Main measures include percentage Black and Hispanic population composition, income inequality, and a set of additional covariates. Results: This study included 3141 of 3142 US counties. The mean Black population was 9.365% (range, 0-86.593%); the mean Hispanic population was 9.754% (range, 0.648%-96.353%); the mean Gini ratio was 44.538 (range, 25.670-66.470); the proportion of counties within states that implemented Medicaid expansion was 0.577 (range, 0-1); the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100â¯000 population was 1093.882 (range, 0-14â¯019.852); and the mean number of COVID-19-related deaths per 100â¯000 population was 26.173 (range, 0-413.858). A 1.0% increase in a county's income inequality corresponded to an adjusted risk ratio (RR) of 1.020 (95% CI, 1.012-1.027) for COVID-19 incidence and adjusted RR of 1.030 (95% CI, 1.012-1.047) for COVID-19 mortality. Inequality compounded the association of racial/ethnic composition through interaction, with higher income inequality raising the intercepts of the incidence curve RR by a factor of 1.041 (95% CI, 1.031-1.051) and that of the mortality curve RR by a factor of 1.068 (95% CI, 1.042-1.094) but slightly lowering their curvatures, especially for Hispanic composition. When state-level specificities were controlled, none of the state political factors were associated with COVID-19 incidence or mortality. However, a county in a state with Medicaid expansion implemented would see the incidence rate RR decreased by a multiplicative factor of 0.678 (95% CI, 0.501-0.918). Conclusions and Relevance: This county-level ecological analysis suggests that COVID-19 surveillance systems should account for county-level income inequality to better understand the social patterning of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. High levels of income inequality may harm population health irrespective of racial/ethnic composition.","Liao, Tim F; De Maio, Fernando",JAMA Netw Open,654,24

However, long-term reliance on this mode of teaching raises the prospect that transferring the whole of the learning environment to an impersonal digital world will lead to loss of anatomy's humanistic side. In looking to a future increasingly dependent upon digital input to teaching, a number of roadblocks are identified. These are: the peril of abandoning the ethos of anatomy; for the workload of staff and especially for female academic staff; by a lack of adequate resources; to the research nature of departments, including the quality of research; to the position of anatomy in the biomedical sciences; and from pressures to retreat from a dissection-based education. In tracing a future trajectory for anatomy, issues outlined are the inevitability of change, the need for anatomy to market itself to the world, and the opportunities presented for anatomy to view itself increasingly as a contributor to broad scholastic endeavors. Suggestions include exploring the possibilities presented by virtual anatomy museums, the use of online learning to reach those not normally in touch with anatomy teaching, and exploring integrated courses with humanities disciplines. It is concluded that anatomy will flourish if there is a willingness to expand traditional horizons and be prepared to integrate all that is best in the person-to-person and digital worlds.","Jones, David Gareth",Anat. sci. educ,654,1

Co-circulation of other respiratory viruses is largely unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic but would inform strategies to rapidly and accurately test patients with respiratory symptoms. METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 298,415 respiratory specimens collected from symptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 testing in the three months since COVID-19 was initially documented in the province of Alberta, Canada (March-May, 2020). By focusing on 52,285 specimens that were also tested with the Luminex Respiratory Pathogen Panel for 17 other pathogens, this study examines the prevalence of 18 potentially co-circulating pathogens and their relative rates in prior years versus since COVID-19 emerged, including four endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 2.2% of all specimens. Parallel broad multiplex testing detected additional pathogens in only 3.4% of these SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens: significantly less than in SARS-CoV-2-negative specimens (p < 0.0001), suggesting very low rates of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. Furthermore, the overall co-infection rate was significantly lower among specimens with SARS-CoV-2 detected (p < 0.0001). Finally, less than 0.005% of all specimens tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and any of the four endemic coronaviruses tested, strongly suggesting neither co-infection nor cross-reactivity between these coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Broad respiratory pathogen testing rarely detected additional pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens. While helpful to understand co-circulation of respiratory viruses causing similar symptoms as COVID-19, ultimately these broad tests were resource-intensive and inflexible in a time when clinical laboratories face unprecedented demand for respiratory virus testing, with further increases expected during influenza season. A transition from broad, multiplex tests toward streamlined diagnostic algorithms targeting respiratory pathogens of public health concern could simultaneously reduce the overall burden on clinical laboratories while prioritizing testing of pathogens of public health importance. This is particularly valuable with ongoing strains on testing resources, exacerbated during influenza seasons.","Marshall, Natalie C; Kariyawasam, Ruwandi M; Zelyas, Nathan; Kanji, Jamil N; Diggle, Mathew A",Virol J,654,24

FedMoCo has two novel modules: metadata transfer, an inter-node statistical data augmentation module, and self-adaptive aggregation, an aggregation module based on representational similarity analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first FCL work on medical images. Our experiments show that FedMoCo can consistently outperform FedAvg, a seminal federated learning framework, in extracting meaningful representations for downstream tasks. We further show that FedMoCo can substantially reduce the amount of labeled data required in a downstream task, such as COVID-19 detection, to achieve a reasonable performance.","Dong, Nanqing; Voiculescu, Irina",,654,3

In India, where millions have recently transitioned to using a toilet, pandemic-related barriers to use might increase open defecation practices. We assessed changes in reported defecation practices in peri-urban communities in Tamil Nadu. Field assistants conducted phone surveys in 26 communities in two districts from May 20, 2020 to May 25, 2020. They asked respondents about their access to a toilet, whether they or a family member left their house to defecate in the past week, and whether specific practices had changed since the lockdown. Among 2,044 respondents, 60% had access to a private toilet, 11% to a public or community toilet, whereas 29% lacked access to any toilet facility. In our study, 92% of the respondents did not change their defecation behaviors in the 2 months following the pandemic-related lockdown. About a third (27%) reported that they or a family member left their house daily to defecate amid lockdown measures. A majority of those with private toilets (91%) or with public toilets (69%) continued using them. Respondents with private toilet access were more likely to report an increased frequency of handwashing with soap (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.04-3.05) since the lockdown. The lack of private toilets contributes to the need to leave the house amid a lockdown. Maintaining shared toilets require disinfection protocols and behavioral precautions to limit the risk of fomite transmission.

METHODS: A pre-tested survey form was sent to 40 neurology tertiary care centers in all the provinces in the country in the first week of July 2020. 33 filled forms were received, out of which 18 were public (government) and 15 were private hospitals. RESULTS: Estimated 1300 HCW (faculty, medical officers, trainees and nurses) work at these 33 participating centers. There were 17 deaths among HCW (1.3%) at ten centers. Sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) were provided to 158 HCW (12%). 129 (10%)HCW tested positive for COVID 19 at 31 centers including trainees/medical officers (39), consultants (29) and nursing and other staff (61). Due to low neurology admissions, 23/33 hospitals (70%) posted neurology trainees in COVID 19 units to contribute to covid care. Less than 50% hospitals did covid screening PCR before admission to neurology wards. Only 10% hospitals provide training and regular update to HCW.

We examined the intention to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and the associated factors in a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong. METHODS: We did a dual-frame (landline and mobile) cross-sectional survey of a random sample of 1501 Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or older (53.6% females) in April 2020. We collected data on the intention to receive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine when it becomes available (yes/ no/ undecided), knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, smoking, alcohol drinking, and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence estimates were weighted by the sex, age, and education of the general population of Hong Kong. RESULTS: Overall, 45.3% (95% CI: 42.3-48.4%) of the participants had intentions to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when it becomes available, 29.2% (26.5-32.1%) were undecided, and 25.5% (22.9-28.2%) had no intention. The most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (undecided or no intention) was safety concerns (56.5%). Multivariable partial proportional odds model showed higher vaccine hesitancy in males, younger adults, those with no chronic disease, current smokers, and non-alcohol drinkers. After adjusting for sociodemographic and other factors, inadequate knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.27 to 2.63; P < 0.05) and lower perceived danger of COVID-19 (adjusted ORs ranged from 1.62 to 2.47; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: In a representative sample of Chinese adults in Hong Kong, only 45.3% of the participants intended to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 when available. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with inadequate knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 transmission and lower perceived danger of COVID-19, which needed to be addressed to improve vaccination uptake.","Luk, Tzu Tsun; Zhao, Shengzhi; Wu, Yongda; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wang, Man Ping; Lam, Tai Hing",Vaccine,654,16

The ID NOW COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular test run on an instrument with a small footprint enabling point-of-care diagnostics. MethodsIn the first wave, outsourced RT-PCR testing regularly required 36-48 hours before results were available. This prospective study was conducted in the second wave (October 2020-April 2021) and evaluated the impact the implementation of the ID NOW COVID-19 test in the ED had on clinical care processes and patient pathways. 710 patients were recruited upon arrival at the ED which included those presenting clinical symptoms, asymptomatic individuals or persons fulfilling epidemiological criteria. The first anterior nasal swab was taken by trained nurses in the ambulance or a separate consultation room. The ID NOW COVID-19 test was performed in the ED in strict compliance with the manufacturers instructions and positive or suspected cases were additionally tested with RT_PCR (cobas SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR, Roche) following collection of a second nasopharyngeal NP specimen. ResultsSwabs directly tested with the ID NOW COVID-19 test showed a diagnostic concordance of 98 % (sensitivity 99.59 %, specificity 94.55 %, PPV 97.6 %, NPV 99.05 %) compared to RT-PCR as reference. The 488 patients that tested positive with the ID NOW COVID-19 had a Ct range in RT-PCR results between 7.94 to 37.42 (in 23.2 % > 30). Two false negative results (0.28%) were recorded from patients with Ct values > 30. 14 (1.69%) discordant results were reviewed case-by-case and usually associated with either very early or very advanced stages of infection. Furthermore, patients initially negative with the ID NOW COVID-19 test and admitted to the hospital were tested again on days 5 and 12: no patient became positive. DiscussionThe ID NOW COVID-19 test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated excellent diagnostic agreement with RT-PCR under the above-mentioned patients pathways implemented during the second wave. The main advantage of the system was the provision of reliable results within a few minutes. This not only allowed immediate initiative of appropriate therapy and care for COVID-19 (patient benefit) but provided essential information on isolation and thus available beds. This drastically helped the overall finances of the department and additionally allowed more patients to be admitted including those requiring immediate attention; this was not possible during the first wave since beds were blocked waiting for diagnostic confirmation. Our findings also show that when interpreting the results, the clinical condition and epidemiological history of the patient must be taken into account, as with any test procedure. Overall, the ID NOW COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 provided a rapid and reliable alternative to laboratory-based RT-PCR in the real clinical setting which became an acceptable part of the daily routine within the ED and demonstrated that early patient management can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the hospital.","Kortuem, Stefan O.; Krause, Marina; Ott, Hans-Juergen; Kortuem, Lisa; Schlaudt, Hans-Peter",,654,16

It is caused by disruption in any part of the mitral valve apparatus. Surgical intervention remains the mainstay of management for severe cases. CASE SUMMARY: We are reporting a case of pneumonia with severe sepsis, that had a complicated hospital course. The patient developed multi-organ failure. Echocardiography on admission showed severe mitral regurgitation. He required early mechanical ventilation and then Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (VV-ECMO) over 29 days. He might be the first case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in our hospital. Mitral valve replacement was done after stabilization of the patient and weaning from the ECMO. DISCUSSION: Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV-ECMO as a bridge for stabilization, facilitates management of the critically ill respiratory failure patient with severe MR and patient outcomes. Still the long-term results and the optimal timing of intervention need more research to define. CONCLUSION: Our report demonstrates that the use of a long term VV ECMO facilitates management of patients with respiratory failure associated with severe MR. Future studies focusing on stabilizing such patients, might help to define the optimal timing for intervention in these patients and the long-term outcome.","Abdalghafoor, Tamer; Sarhan, Hatem; Kindawi, Ali",Perfusion,654,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%). Health literacy was observed to be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95% CI: 1.81-6.88)]; COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95%CI; 1.14-3.69] and compliance to pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.47-6.35] but not for physical activity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 awareness, preventive behavior, and compliance to pharmacological management is associated with health literacy among patients of chronic disease availing services from primary health facility. Focusing on health literacy could thus be an essential strategic intervention yielding long term benefits.","Gautam, Vaishali; S, Dileepan; Rustagi, Neeti; Mittal, Ankit; Patel, Mehul; Shafi, Shazia; Thirunavukkarasu, Prasanna; Raghav, Pankaja",Diabetes Metab Syndr,654,26

Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified. We focus on Singapore as a case study that has recently deployed contact tracing wearables nationally, but also reference debate about wearables in Australia and New Zealand. Our analysis will be relevant to counties trialling similar portable tracing wearables.","Schaefer, G Owen; Ballantyne, Angela",J. med. ethics,654,7

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of adult (age &#8805;18 years) acute cardiovascular deaths (n=5 87 225) in England and Wales, from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2020. The exposure was the COVID-19 pandemic (from onset of the first COVID-19 death in England, 2 March 2020). The main outcome was acute cardiovascular events directly contributing to death. RESULTS: After 2 March 2020, there were 28 969 acute cardiovascular deaths of which 5.1% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute cardiovascular mortality of 2085 (+8%). Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Death at home had the greatest excess acute cardiovascular deaths (2279, +35%), followed by deaths at care homes and hospices (1095, +32%) and in hospital (50, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute cardiovascular death during this period was stroke (10 318, 35.6%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (7 098, 24.5%), heart failure (6 770, 23.4%), pulmonary embolism (2 689, 9.3%) and cardiac arrest (1 328, 4.6%). The greatest cause of excess cardiovascular death in care homes and hospices was stroke (715, +39%), compared with ACS (768, +41%) at home and cardiogenic shock (55, +15%) in hospital. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute cardiovascular deaths, nearly half of which occurred in the community and most did not relate to COVID-19 infection suggesting there were delays to seeking help or likely the result of undiagnosed COVID-19.","Wu, Jianhua; Mamas, Mamas A; Mohamed, Mohamed O; Kwok, Chun Shing; Roebuck, Chris; Humberstone, Ben; Denwood, Tom; Luescher, Thomas; de Belder, Mark A; Deanfield, John E; Gale, Chris P",Heart,654,1

Evaluation of occupational hazard control use for COVID-19 prevention can identify inadequately protected workers and opportunities to improve use. CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health used data from the June 2020 SummerStyles survey to characterize required and voluntary use of COVID-19-related occupational hazard controls among U.S. non-health care workers. A survey-weighted regression model was used to estimate the association between employer provision of hazard controls and voluntary use, and stratum-specific adjusted risk differences (aRDs) among workers reporting household incomes <250% and &#8805;250% of national poverty thresholds were estimated to assess effect modification by income. Approximately one half (45.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.0%-50.3%) of non-health care workers reported use of hazard controls in the workplace, 55.5% (95% CI = 48.8%-62.2%) of whom reported employer requirements to use them. After adjustment for occupational group and proximity to others at work, voluntary use was approximately double, or 22.3 absolute percentage points higher, among workers who were provided hazard controls than among those who were not. This effect was more apparent among lower-income (aRD = 31.0%) than among higher-income workers (aRD = 16.3%). Employers can help protect workers from COVID-19 by requiring and encouraging use of occupational hazard controls and providing hazard controls to employees (1).","Billock, Rachael M; Groenewold, Matthew R; Free, Hannah; Haring Sweeney, Marie; Luckhaupt, Sara E",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,654,24

Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of 274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples' qualitative responses about their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133 of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance. There were nuanced differences between the egalitarian strategies in their relationships with outcomes, with the Alternating Days egalitarian category emerging as the overall strategy that best preserved wives' and husbands' well-being while allowing both to maintain adequate job performance.

We analyzed a census of public communications (n = 372,466) from 704 public health agencies, state and local emergency management agencies, and elected officials posted on Twitter between January 1 and August 31, 2020, measuring message retransmission via the number of retweets (ie, a message passed on by others), an important indicator of engagement and reach. To assess content, we extended a lexicon developed from the early months of the pandemic to identify key concepts within messages, employing it to analyze both the textual content of messages themselves as well as text included within embedded images (n = 233,877), which was extracted via optical character recognition. Finally, we modelled the message retransmission process using a negative binomial regression, which allowed us to quantify the extent to which particular message features amplify or suppress retransmission, net of controls related to timing and properties of the sending account. In addition to identifying other predictors of retransmission, we show that the impact of images is strongly driven by content, with textual information in messages and embedded images operating in similar ways.

These include evidence of a hyperactive coagulation system with elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and microthrombi coupled with an activated and highly permeable vascular endothelium. Common immune abnormalities include progressive hypercytokinemia with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1ß, proinflammatory chemokines, activated macrophages and increased levels of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF&#954;B). Inflammasome activation and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is common to COVID-19, H1N1, and MAS but does not appear to be a feature of CRS. Elevated levels of IL-18 are detected in patients with COVID-19 and MAS but have not been reported in patients with H1N1 influenza and CRS. Elevated interferon-Î³ is common to H1N1, MAS, and CRS but levels of this molecule appear to be depressed in patients with COVID-19. CD4+ T, CD8+ and NK lymphocytes are involved in the pathophysiology of CRS, MAS, and possibly H1N1 but are reduced in number and dysfunctional in COVID-19. Additional elements underpinning the pathophysiology of cytokine storms include Inflammasome activity and DAMPs. Treatment with anakinra may theoretically offer an avenue to positively manipulate the range of biochemical and immune abnormalities reported in COVID-19 and thought to underpin the pathophysiology of cytokine storms beyond those manipulated via the use of, canakinumab, Jak inhibitors or tocilizumab. Thus, despite the relative success of tocilizumab in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients already on dexamethasone and promising results with Baricitinib, the combination of anakinra in combination with dexamethasone offers the theoretical prospect of further improvements in patient survival. However, there is currently an absence of trial of evidence in favour or contravening this proposition. Accordingly, a large well powered blinded prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test this hypothesis is recommended.","Morris, Gerwyn; Bortolasci, Chiara C; Puri, Basant K; Marx, Wolfgang; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Athan, Eugene; Walder, Ken; Berk, Michael; Olive, Lisa; Carvalho, Andre F; Maes, Michael",Cytokine,654,24

The combination of prone positioning and non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients may have a role in improving oxygenation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of prone positioning in spontaneously ventilating patients receiving non-invasive ventilation admitted to the intensive care. Clinical data of 81 patients admitted with COVID 19 pneumonia and acute hypoxic respiratory failure were retrieved from electronic medical records and examined. Patients who had received prone positioning in combination with non-invasive ventilation were identified. A total of 20 patients received prone positioning in conjunction with non-invasive ventilation. This resulted in improved oxygenation as measured by a change in PaO 2/FiO 2 (P/F) ratio of 28.7 mmHg while prone, without significant change in heart rate or respiratory rate. Patients on average underwent 5 cycles with a median duration of 3 hours. There were no reported deaths, 7 of the 20 patients (35%) failed non-invasive ventilation and subsequently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. In our cohort of 20 COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure, prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation resulted in improved oxygenation. Prone positioning with non-invasive ventilation may be considered as an early therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 patients with moderate acute hypoxic respiratory failure.","Burton-Papp, Helmi C; Jackson, Alexander I R; Beecham, Ryan; Ferrari, Matteo; Nasim-Mohi, Myra; Grocott, Michael P W; Chambers, Robert; Dushianthan, Ahilanandan",F1000Res,654,1

One of the most demanding procedures in limb salvage surgery is the reconstruction of bony defects after tumour resection. Even though still limited in clinical practice, early results of the use of 3D technology are gradually revealing its potentially huge impact in bone tumour surgery. Here, we present a case series illustrating our experience with the use of 3D printing technology in the reconstruction of bone defects after tumour resection, and its impact on cosmesis and quality of life. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 11 patients in whom a custom-made 3D-printed prosthesis was used to reconstruct a bone defect after resection for a bone tumour. Ten out of 11 patients were children (aged between 5 and 16 years) with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma of the pelvis (2 children) or the arm (8 children), and one patient was a 67-year-old lady with a chondrosarcoma of the pelvis. All underwent wide resections resulting in considerable bone defects necessitating further reconstruction. RESULTS: Custom-made implants were extremely useful both in reconstruction of bone defects and in terms of cosmesis, recovery facilitation, and quality of life. In this respect, pelvic and humeral reconstructions with 3D-printed custom implants particularly showed a great potential. The mean follow-up was 33 months. Four patients died of disease (36%) and overall the major and minor complication rate was 54% (6 out of 11 patients). Three patients had implant dislocation (27% [3/11 cases]), one had leg-compartment syndrome, and one patient reported limited range of motion. Only two out of 11 patients developed local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Use of 3D customized implant helped us achieve two major goals in orthopaedic oncology-clear surgical resection and functional recovery with a good quality of life. Large studies with long-term follow-up are needed to reveal the value and future of 3D printing in orthopaedic oncology.","Jovicic, Marijana Simic; Vuletic, Filip; Ribicic, Tomislav; Simunic, Sven; Petrovic, Tadija; Kolundzic, Robert",Int. orthop,654,16

This study addresses a pressing knowledge gap and is important in its global scope, its use of technology for recruitment, and focus on transgender people living with HIV. The objective of this study is to examine correlates of HIV infection and HIV treatment engagement outcomes (i.e., currently on ART, having an HIV provider, having access to HIV treatment without burden, and remote refills) since the COVID-19 pandemic began. METHODS: We utilized observational data from the Global COVID-19 Disparities Survey 2020, an online study that globally sampled trans and nonbinary people (n = 902) between April and August 2020. We conducted a series of multivariable logistic regressions with lasso selection to explore correlates of HIV treatment engagement outcomes in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 120 (13.3%) trans and nonbinary people living with HIV in this survey, the majority (85.8%) were currently on HIV treatment. A smaller proportion (69.2%) reported having access to an HIV provider since COVID-19 control measures were implemented. Less than half reported being able to access treatment without burdens related to COVID-19 (48.3%) and having the ability to remotely refill HIV prescription (44.2%). After adjusting for gender in the multivariable models, younger age and anticipated job loss were significantly associated with not having access to HIV treatment without burden. Outcomes also significantly varied by geographic region, with respondents reporting less access to an HIV provider in nearly every region outside of South-East Asia. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that currently taking ART, having access to an HIV provider, and being able to access HIV treatment without burden and remotely refill HIV medication are suboptimal among trans and nonbinary people living with HIV across the world. Strengthening support for HIV programs that are well-connected to trans and nonbinary communities, increasing remote access to HIV providers and prescription refills, and providing socioeconomic support could significantly improve HIV engagement in trans and nonbinary communities.","Restar, Arjee Javellana; Garrison-Desany, Henri M; Adamson, Tyler; Childress, Chase; Millett, Gregorio; Jarrett, Brooke A; Howell, Sean; Glick, Jennifer L; Beckham, S Wilson; Baral, Stefan",BMC Public Health,654,1

Objective: To understand whether the transition to remote visits is associated with disparities in patient use of care, diagnostic test ordering, and medication prescribing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used electronic health records data for all ambulatory cardiology visits at an urban, multisite health system in Los Angeles County, California, during 2 periods: April 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019 (pre-COVID) and April 1 to December 31, 2020 (COVID-era). Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2021. Exposure: In-person or remote ambulatory cardiology clinic visit at one of 31 during the pre-COVID period or COVID-era period. Main Outcomes and Measures: Comparison of patient characteristics and frequencies of medication ordering and cardiology-specific testing across 4 visit types (pre-COVID in-person (reference), COVID-era in-person, COVID-era video, COVID-era telephone). Results: This study analyzed data from 87â¯182 pre-COVID in-person, 74â¯498 COVID-era in-person, 4720 COVID-era video, and 10â¯381 COVID-era telephone visits. Across visits, 79â¯572 patients were female (45.0%), 127â¯080 patients were non-Hispanic White (71.9%), and the mean (SD) age was 68.1 (17.0) years. Patients accessing COVID-era remote visits were more likely to be Asian, Black, or Hispanic individuals (24â¯934 pre-COVID in-person visits [28.6%] vs 19â¯742 COVID-era in-person visits [26.5%] vs 3633 COVID-era video visits [30.4%] vs 1435 COVID-era telephone visits [35.0%]; P < .001 for all comparisons), have private insurance (34â¯063 pre-COVID in-person visits [39.1%] vs 25â¯474 COVID-era in-person visits [34.2%] vs 2562 COVID-era video visits [54.3%] vs 4264 COVID-era telephone visits [41.1%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs video and COVID-era in-person vs telephone), and have cardiovascular comorbidities (eg, hypertension: 37â¯166 pre-COVID in-person visits [42.6%] vs 31â¯359 COVID-era in-person visits [42.1%] vs 2006 COVID-era video visits [42.5%] vs 5181 COVID-era telephone visits [49.9%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs telephone; and heart failure: 14â¯319 pre-COVID in-person visits [16.4%] vs 10â¯488 COVID-era in-person visits [14.1%] vs 1172 COVID-era video visits [24.8%] vs 2674 COVID-era telephone visits [25.8%]; P < .001 for COVID-era in-person vs video and COVID-era in-person vs telephone). After adjusting for patient and visit characteristics and in comparison with pre-COVID in-person visits, during video and telephone visits, clinicians had lower odds of ordering any medication (COVID-era in-person: odds ratio [OR], 0.62 [95% CI, 0.60-0.64], COVID-era video: OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.20-0.24]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.13-0.15]) or tests, such as electrocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.58-0.62]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.02-0.04]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.01-0.03]) or echocardiograms (COVID-era in-person: OR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.18-1.24]; COVID-era video: OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.42-0.52]; COVID-era telephone: OR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.25-0.31]). Conclusions and Relevance: Patients who were Asian, Black, or Hispanic, had private insurance, and had at least one of several cardiovascular comorbidities used remote cardiovascular care more frequently in the COVID-era period. Clinician ordering of diagnostic testing and medications consistently decreased when comparing pre-COVID vs COVID-era and in-person vs remote visits. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these decreases represent a reduction in the overuse of tests and medications vs an underuse of indicated testing and prescribing.","Yuan, Neal; Pevnick, Joshua M; Botting, Patrick G; Elad, Yaron; Miller, Shaun J; Cheng, Susan; Ebinger, Joseph E",JAMA Netw Open,654,16

METHODS: We obtained random urine samples from 9,275 cases of acute first stroke and 9,726 matched controls (8,761 matched pairs for conditional analysis) from 27 countries and estimated the 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion, a surrogate for intake, using the Tanaka formula. Using multivariable conditional logistic regression, we determined the associations of estimated 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion with stroke and its subtypes. RESULTS: The mean estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium urinary excretion was 3·29g/day and 1·57g/day, with 0·01% of participants having both low sodium (<2·0g/day) and high potassium excretion (>3·5g/day). There was a moderate positive correlation between sodium and potassium excretion (r=0·4435, P<0.001) and between sodium excretion and blood pressure (P<0.001). Compared with an estimated urinary sodium excretion of 2·8-3·5g/day (second quartile, reference), higher (>4·26g/day) (OR 1.81;95%CI,1.65-2.00) and lower (<2·8g/day) sodium excretion (OR 1.39;95%CI,1.26-1.53) were significantly associated with increased risk of stroke. The stroke risk associated with the highest quartile of sodium intake (sodium excretion >4·26g/day) was significantly greater (P<0.001) for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (OR 2.38;95%CI,1.93-2.92) than for ischemic stroke (OR 1.67;95%CI,1.50-1.87), and greater for large vessel and small vessel ischemic stroke than for cardioembolic ischemic stroke. Urinary potassium was inversely and linearly associated with risk of stroke, and stronger for ischemic stroke than ICH (P=0.026). In an analysis of combined sodium and potassium excretion, the combination of high potassium intake (>1·58g/day) and moderate sodium intake (2.8-3.5 g/day) was associated with the lowest risk of stroke. CONCLUSION: The association of sodium intake and stroke is J-shaped, with high sodium intake a stronger risk factor for intracerebral haemorrhage than ischemic stroke. Our data suggest that moderate sodium intake - rather than low sodium intake - combined with high potassium intake may be associated with the lowest risk of stroke and expected to be a more feasible combined dietary target.","Judge, Conor; O039,; Donnell, Martin J; Hankey, Graeme J; Rangarajan, Sumathy; Chin, Siu Lim; Rao-Melacini, Purnima; Ferguson, John; Smyth, Andrew; Xavier, Denis; Lisheng, Liu; Zhang, Hongye; Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio; Damasceno, Albertino; Langhorne, Peter; Rosengren, Annika; Dans, Antonio L; Elsayed, Ahmed; Avezum, Alvaro; Mondo, Charles; Ryglewicz, Danuta; Czlonkowska, Anna; Pogosova, Nana; Weimar, Christian; Diaz, Rafael; Yusoff, Khalid; Yusufali, Afzalhussein; Oguz, Aytekin; Wang, Xingyu; Lanas, Fernando; Ogah, Okechukwu S; Ogunniyi, Adesola; Iversen, Helle K; Malaga, German; Rumboldt, Zvonko; Oveisgharan, Shahram; Hussain, Fawaz Al; Yusuf, Salim",Am. j. hypertens,654,16

Direct viral entry as well as systemic mechanisms such as cytokine storm are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation in these patients. Biomarkers of COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment are currently lacking, but there is some limited evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could preferentially target the frontal lobes, as suggested by behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms, fronto-temporal hypoperfusion on MRI, EEG slowing in frontal regions, and frontal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET. Possible confounders include cognitive impairment due to hypoxia and mechanical ventilation and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conversely, patients already suffering from dementia, as well as their caregivers, have been greatly impacted by the disruption of their care caused by COVID-19. Patients with dementia have experienced worsening of cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, and the rate of COVID-19-related deaths is disproportionately high among cognitively impaired people. Multiple factors, such as difficulties in remembering and executing safeguarding procedures, age, comorbidities, residing in care homes, and poorer access to hospital standard of care play a role in the increased morbidity and mortality. Non-pharmacological interventions and new technologies have shown a potential for the management of patients with dementia, and for the support of their caregivers.","Toniolo, Sofia; Scarioni, Marta; Di Lorenzo, Francesco; Hort, Jakub; Georges, Jean; Tomic, Svetlana; Nobili, Flavio; Frederiksen, Kristian Steen",J. alzheimers dis,654,24

Though various therapeutic possibilities have been tested against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most adequate treatment has not yet been established. Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and experimental data point to potential against viral targets. We hypothesized that propolis can reduce the negative effects of COVID-19. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial, hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF®ï¸) as an adjunct therapy. Patients were allocated to receive standard care plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis for seven days, or standard care alone. Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency duration. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Patients were followed for 28 days after admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 124 patients; 40 were assigned to EPP-AF®ï¸ 400 mg/day, 42 to EPP-AF®ï¸ 800 mg/day, and 42 to the control group. The length of hospital stay post-intervention was shorter in both propolis groups than in the control group; lower dose, median 7 days versus 12 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.23 to -0.07; p = 0.049) and higher dose, median 6 days versus 12 days (95% CI -7.00 to -1.09; p = 0.009). Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. In the high dose propolis group, there was a lower rate of acute kidney injury than in the controls (4.8 vs 23.8%), (odds ratio [OR] 0.18; 95% CI 0.03-0.84; p = 0.048). No patient had propolis treatment discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of propolis to the standard care procedures resulted in clinical benefits for the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially evidenced by a reduction in the length of hospital stay. Consequently, we conclude that propolis can reduce the impact of COVID-19.","Silveira, Marcelo Augusto Duarte; De Jong, David; Berretta, Andresa Aparecida; Galvão, Erica Batista Dos Santos; Ribeiro, Juliana Caldas; Cerqueira-Silva, Thiago; Amorim, Thais Chaves; Conceição, Luis Filipe Miranda Rebelo da; Gomes, Marcel Miranda Dantas; Teixeira, Maurício Brito; Souza, Sergio Pinto de; Santos, Marcele Helena Celestino Alves Dos; San Martin, Raissa Lanna Araújo; Silva, Márcio de Oliveira; Lírio, Monique; Moreno, Lis; Sampaio, Julio Cezar Miranda; Mendonça, Renata; Ultchak, Silviana Salles; Amorim, Fabio Santos; Ramos, João Gabriel Rosa; Batista, Paulo Benigno Pena; Guarda, Suzete Nascimento Farias da; Mendes, Ana Verena Almeida; Passos, Rogerio da Hora",Biomed Pharmacother,654,26

Ex vivo analysis revealed significantly elevated BTK activity, as evidenced by autophosphorylation, and increased IL-6 production in blood monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19 compared with blood monocytes from healthy volunteers. These results suggest that targeting excessive host inflammation with a BTK inhibitor is a therapeutic strategy in severe COVID-19 and has led to a confirmatory international prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.","Roschewski, Mark; Lionakis, Michail S; Sharman, Jeff P; Roswarski, Joseph; Goy, Andre; Monticelli, M Andrew; Roshon, Michael; Wrzesinski, Stephen H; Desai, Jigar V; Zarakas, Marissa A; Collen, Jacob; Rose, Keith; Hamdy, Ahmed; Izumi, Raquel; Wright, George W; Chung, Kevin K; Baselga, Jose; Staudt, Louis M; Wilson, Wyndham H",Sci. immunol,654,21

Infants exposed to opioids during pregnancy often show signs and symptoms of withdrawal after birth, which are easy to miss with the human eye. The constellation of clinical features, termed as Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), include tremors, seizures, irritability, etc. The current standard of care uses Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Scoring System (FNASS), based on subjective evaluations. Monitoring with FNASS requires highly skilled nursing staff, making continuous monitoring difficult. In this paper we propose an automated tremor detection system using amplified motion signals. We demonstrate its applicability on bedside video of infant exhibiting signs of NAS. Further, we test different modes of deep convolutional network based motion magnification, and identify that dynamic mode works best in the clinical setting, being invariant to common orientational changes. We propose a strategy for discharge and follow up for NAS patients, using motion magnification to supplement the existing protocols. Overall our study suggests methods for bridging the gap in current practices, training and resource utilization.","Malik, Girik; Gulati, Ish K.",,654,26

BMW management is mostly implemented at municipal level following regulatory guidelines defined by respective states and the Union. This article is a narrative of the status of BMW generation, management and regulation in India in the context of COVID-19 crisis. The article is based on comparative analysis of data on BMW generation and management from authentic sources, a systematic literature review and review of news reports. In the current pandemic situation where media has been playing a significant role in highlighting all the concerns related to COVID-19 spread and management. Assessing the ground situation regarding effectiveness of prevailing BMW management facilities, requirement and suggestions can provide insights to the subject with policy implications for India and countries as well. The discussion has been built on different dimensions of BMW management during the pandemic including existing infrastructures, capacity utilisation, policy guidelines, operational practices and waste-handlers aspects. The results on state-wise analysis of reported BMW quantity and active COVID-19 patients also reveal some non-linear relationship between the two variables. Delhi, the National Capital is situated at a better position in terms of BMW management as compared to other studied states. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights to the policy makers and other relevant authorities to evaluate adequateness as well as efficiency quotients of entire BMW management landscape.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single referral regional center (Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel). Prevalence of the diagnosis of EP, treatment modality and associated complications during the COVID-19 lockdown period in the state of Israel (March 10-May 12, 2020) was compared to patients receiving the same diagnosis during the parallel timeframe in the previous year (2019). RESULTS: Overall there were 29 and 43 cases of EP during the COVID-19 and pre COVID-19 epoch, respectively. COVID-19 period patients presented to the emergency room with significantly higher ß-human chorionic gonadotrophin level; median of 1364 versus 633 IU, P = 0.001. The rate of ruptured EP was; 20.7% versus 4.3% P = 0.031, and surgical approach; 55.2% versus 27.9%, P = 0.001. Significantly higher median volume of blood loss; median volume 852 versus 300 ml, P = 0.042 were observed in patients during the COVID-19 epoch. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to delayed presentation of patients with EP, and the requirement of subsequent emergency surgical management and excessive blood loss.

These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed either directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely accurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office of National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years, in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11 years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors can be operationalized by taking say the 10\% quantile of the number of deaths. This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries. The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between countries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing, that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the height of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.","Davies, Laurie",,654,16

Wuhan City was the first place detected as the source of the pandemic. Without suspicion, it spreads over the world, along with human mobility. In such a condition, every country seems quite stuttering to prepare its health system to prevent its people from the possible transmission. This paper aims to describe the preparedness of the networking laboratory in Indonesia. Methods: We conducted a rapid assessment of laboratory availability and preparedness to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We held the data collection on the third and fourth week of March 2020 by sending an electronic questionnaire to all 44 networking laboratories under the Ministry of Health structure. The variables assessed in this study were the availability and the requirements of the COVID-19 related laboratory's substances, including reagents and other equipment types. Results: The Ministry of Health established the networking laboratory in 2009, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has renewed twice to enhance and expand the laboratory capacities over the country. Our studies showed preparedness among networking laboratories in Indonesia regarding this new emerging COVID-19 condition was quite devastating. Both surveillance and diagnostic laboratories have a similar situation. The availability of their primary materials was mediocre, but the adequacy was far beyond the capacity in handling the COVID-19 specimen. We found a similar case in the laboratory, supporting materials, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Conclusion: Laboratory preparedness during initial period of time of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the health system is still weak. The availability of the necessary equipment, supporting materials, and personal protective equipment are far beyond the requirements.

For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2 after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (IC50) were determined from serum samples (n=246) from COVID-19 patients (n=113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau and then in some cases a gradual decline at later timepoints after 40 days post-symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau and then remains constant up to 8 months post-infection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","Luo, Yiqi Ruben; Yun, Cassandra; Chakraborty, Indrani; Wu, Alan H B; Lynch, Kara L",J. clin. microbiol,654,16

The immune response of pregnant women to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects the neonatal passive immunity have not been studied systematically. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with the maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity that the neonate received from the mother. STUDY DESIGN: Women who gave birth and who tested positive for immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using semiquantitative detection in a New York City hospital between March 22, 2020, and May 31, 2020, were included in this study. A retrospective chart review of the cases that met the inclusion criteria was conducted to determine the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the use of oxygen support. Serology levels were compared between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using a Welch 2 sample t test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted to identify the dates of self-reported onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms and the timing of the peak immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody levels after symptom onset was visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing on log2-scaled serologic values. To study the neonatal serology response, umbilical cord blood samples of the neonates born to the subset of serology positive pregnant women were tested for serologic antibody responses. The maternal antibody levels of serology positive vs the maternal antibody levels of serology negative neonates were compared using the Welch 2 sample t test. The relationship between the quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using a Pearson correlation and linear regression. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine the predictors of neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. RESULTS: A total of 88 serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. The antibody levels were higher in symptomatic pregnant women than in asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data revealed that the maternal immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels peak around 15 and 30 days after the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, respectively. Furthermore, studies of 50 neonates born to this subset of serology positive women showed that passive immunity in the form of immunoglobulin G is conferred in 78% of all neonates. The presence of passive immunity is dependent on the maternal antibody levels, and the levels of neonatal immunoglobulin G correlate with maternal immunoglobulin G levels. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive neonatal immunity. The maternal immunoglobulin G levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predicted the neonatal immunoglobulin G levels. These data will further guide the screening for this uniquely linked population of mothers and their neonates and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies.","Kubiak, Jeffrey M; Murphy, Elisabeth A; Yee, Jim; Cagino, Kristen A; Friedlander, Rachel L; Glynn, Shannon M; Matthews, Kathy C; Jurkiewicz, Magdalena; Sukhu, Ashley C; Zhao, Zhen; Prabhu, Malavika; Riley, Laura E; Yang, Yawei J",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,654,16

RESULTS: Among 4664 HCWs from 23 healthcare facilities, 139 (3%) were seropositive. Non-occupational exposures independently associated with seropositivity were contact with a COVID-19-positive household (adjusted OR 59, 95% CI 33-106), stay in a COVID-19 hotspot (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2) and male sex (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Blood group 0 vs. non-0 (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.8), active smoking (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.7), living with children <12 years (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) and being a physician (aOR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5) were associated with decreased risk. Other occupational risk factors were close contact to COVID-19 patients (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.4), exposure to COVID-19-positive co-workers (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), poor knowledge of standard hygiene precautions (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) and frequent visits to the hospital canteen (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4-3.8). DISCUSSION: Living with COVID-19-positive households showed the strongest association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. We identified several potentially modifiable work-related risk factors, which might allow mitigation of the COVID-19 risk among HCWs. The lower risk among those living with children, even after correction for multiple confounders, is remarkable and merits further study.","Kahlert, Christian R; Persi, Raphael; Güsewell, Sabine; Egger, Thomas; Leal-Neto, Onicio B; Sumer, Johannes; Flury, Domenica; Brucher, Angela; Lemmenmeier, Eva; Möller, J Carsten; Rieder, Philip; Stocker, Reto; Vuichard-Gysin, Danielle; Wiggli, Benedikt; Albrich, Werner C; Babouee Flury, Baharak; Besold, Ulrike; Fehr, Jan; Kuster, Stefan P; McGeer, Allison; Risch, Lorenz; Schlegel, Matthias; Friedl, Andrée; Vernazza, Pietro; Kohler, Philipp",Clin. microbiol. infect,654,22

The current study conducted a situation analysis on the pandemic preparedness of Bangladesh and provided recommendations on the transition to the new reality and gradual restoration of normalcy. METHOD: A complex adaptive system (CAS) framework was theorized based on four structural dimensions obtained from the crisis and complexity theory to help evaluate the health system of Bangladesh. Data sourced from published reports from the government, non-governmental organizations, and mainstream media up to June 15, 2020 were used to conduct a qualitative analysis and visualize the spatial distribution of countrywide COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: The findings suggested that Bangladesh severely lacked the preparedness to tackle the spread of COVID-19 with both short- and long-term implications for health, the economy, and good governance. Absence of planning and coordination, disproportionate resource allocations, challenged infrastructure, adherence to bureaucratic delay, lack of synchronized risk communication, failing leadership of concerned authorities, and incoherent decision-making have led to a precarious situation that will have dire ramifications causing many uncertainties in the coming days. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of response protocols addressing the needs of the community and the stakeholders from the central level is urgently needed. The development of mechanisms for dynamic decision-making based on regular feedback and long-term planning for a smooth transition between the new reality and normalcy should also be urgently addressed in Bangladesh.","Biswas, Raaj Kishore; Huq, Samin; Afiaz, Awan; Khan, Hafiz T A",J Eval Clin Pract,654,16

METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed clinical variables in patients with stage G1-G4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with complete or incomplete remission of proteinuria, who were managed in a nephrology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in Tokyo. The clinical variables during the COVID-19 pandemic (term 1, June-July 2020) were compared to those one year before the pandemic (term 0, June-July 2019). The urinary protein excretion (UPE) was used as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: This study included 325 patients with stage G1-G4 CKD (mean age 58.5 years old, 37.5% female, 80.6% on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors [RAASis], 12.0% on maintenance dose immunosuppression therapy) evaluated at term 0. The UPE at terms 0 and 1 was 247 (92-624) and 203 (84-508) mg/day [median (25th-75th percentile)], respectively; the value in term 1 was 18% lower than that in term 0 (p<0.001), with no marked difference in body weight, blood pressure, protein intake or urinary salt excretion. In multivariable analyses, incomplete remission of proteinuria in term 0 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70, p = <0.001), RAASi use (OR = 2.09, p = 0.02) and decreased urinary salt excretion in term 1 vs. term 0 (OR = 1.94, p = 0.002) were identified as independent variables associated with reduced UPE in term 1 vs. term 0. No significant interactions between the variables were observed. CONCLUSION: In kidney disease patients receiving standard medical care from nephrologists, the UPE after the emergency declaration in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic was lower than before the declaration. The UPE reduction may be associated with reduced dietary salt intake during the pandemic in patients treated with RAASi for insufficient control of proteinuria. Our results support the current proposal to continue therapeutic approaches to these patients, which involve RAASi therapy along with optimizing dietary habits, even while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tsuboi, Nobuo; Sasaki, Takaya; Kashihara, Naoki; Yokoo, Takashi",PLoS One,654,25

Here we examined country-specific kidney transplantation and graft failure rates in children and explore their country- and patient-level determinants. Patients under 20 years of age initiating kidney replacement therapy from January 2007 through December 2015 in 37 European countries participating in the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry were included in the analyses. Countries were categorized as low-, middle-, and high-income based on gross domestic product. At five years of follow-up, 4326 of 6909 children on kidney replacement therapy received their first kidney transplant. Overall median time from kidney replacement therapy start to first kidney transplantation was 1.4 (inter quartile range 0.3-4.3) years. The five-year kidney transplantation probability was 48.8% (95% confidence interval: 45.9-51.7%) in low-income, 76.3% (72.8-79.5%) in middle-income and 92.3% (91.0-93.4%) in high-income countries and was strongly associated with macro-economic factors. Gross domestic product alone explained 67% of the international variation in transplantation rates. Compared with high-income countries, kidney transplantation was 76% less likely to be performed in low-income and 58% less likely in middle-income countries. Overall five-year graft survival in Europe was 88% and showed little variation across countries. Thus, despite large disparities transplantation access across Europe, graft failure rates were relatively similar. Hence, graft survival in low-risk transplant recipients from lower-income countries seems as good as graft survival among all (low-, medium-, and high-risk) graft recipients from high-income countries.","Bonthuis, Marjolein; Cuperus, Liz; Chesnaye, Nicholas C; Akman, Sema; Melgar, Angel Alonso; Baiko, Sergey; Bouts, Antonia H; Boyer, Olivia; Dimitrova, Kremena; Carmo, Carmen do; Grenda, Ryszard; Heaf, James; Jahnukainen, Timo; Jankauskiene, Augustina; Kaltenegger, Lukas; Kostic, Mirjana; Marks, Stephen D; Mitsioni, Andromachi; Novljan, Gregor; Palsson, Runolfur; Parvex, Paloma; Podracka, Ludmila; Bjerre, Anna; Seeman, Tomas; Slavicek, Jasna; Szabo, Tamas; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Torres, Diletta D; Van Hoeck, Koen J; Ladfors, Susanne Westphal; Harambat, Jérôme; Groothoff, Jaap W; Jager, Kitty J",Kidney Int,654,16

KIDSNTS conducts regular multidisciplinary training courses, which includes in situ simulation. Due to the current pandemic, the simulation faculty has adapted their training to include virtual simulation sessions. To study whether virtual simulation sessions is an effective modality for multispecialty health care workers (HCWs) training. METHODS: Thirty (30) candidates were selected to attend a virtual course which included three hours of simulation and debriefing. Candidates were pre assigned into 3 groups, based on their speciality and job role. Each group watched a 10 minutes pre-recorded simulation episode with two facilitators via Zoom. Using the advocacy inquiry (AI) model, each group spent 50 minutes debriefing. Candidates were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire (utilising likert scale) following the simulation sessions. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (90%) of the selected candidates attended the course (table 1) of which 96% (Fig.1) completed a questionnaire. 100% of the candidates achieved their learning objectives and would recommend the course. 72% and 96 % respectively score the simulation session as excellent (Fig.2 + 3). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual simulation and debriefing appears to be a positive adjunct to multispecialty HCWs training. This provides quality a learning experience facilitating multidisciplinary discussions and shared learning. Setting clear learning objectives and zoom rules enabled good engagement. There will be limitations where hands on practical skills are required. For non-technical skills virtual simulation has a definite role in training. Further research is indicated to inform the validity of virtual simulation in training.","Kelly, L.; Roge, H.; Hodgson, A.; Cooper, A.; Zafurallah, I.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,654,20

Regular orthodontic visits were strongly and widely interrupted by the unprecedented epidemiological threat. METHODS: The data regarding orthodontic queries were investigated in a real-time surveillance using Google Trends. Search terms ""braces"", ""invisalign"", ""get braces"", ""get braces off"", ""braces pain"" and the phrase ""social distancing"" were analyzed regarding the year preceding the pandemic outbreak and the time of the pandemic. Moreover, the five-year trend for queries ""braces"" vs. ""invisalign"", as an example of different types of orthodontic appliances, was compared. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in orthodontics phrase queries in the spring of 2020, connected with the worldwide restrictions and lockdowns announced all over the world. There was a lower interest in the ""braces pain"" query during the first lockdown in 2020. The number of searches for ""invisalign"" increased steadily over time, while the number of searches for ""braces"" was relatively stable across the investigated time period. CONCLUSIONS: The course of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the orthodontic-related search queries.

METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to obstetricians and gynecologists in Japan via email and social media to collect voluntary responses. This survey was conducted from September 1 to 30, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 852 valid responses were included in the analysis; 76% (644) of the physicians felt that the COVID-19 pandemic caused them physical and mental stress equal to or greater than the most severe disaster they had ever experienced. Physicians who reported high mental and physical stress were more likely to be in areas with high numbers of infected patients (odds ratio (OR) 1.571, p = 0.012). Physicians experienced great stress to the point of wearing heavy personal protective equipment during routine vaginal deliveries by mothers with no COVID-19 symptoms. This trend was markedly pronounced for physicians working in regions with fewer cases of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetricians and gynecologists who reported high mental and physical stress were more likely to be in areas with high numbers of infected patients. One potential reason for this may be that they were required to wear more personal protective equipment than necessary. Infection control methods that ensure the safety of obstetricians and gynecologists while not causing unnecessary physical or psychological stress are needed.","Umazume, Takeshi; Miyagi, Etsuko; Haruyama, Yasuo; Obata, Soichiro; Kobashi, Gen; Kurasawa, Kentaro; Suzuki, Yukio; Ikeda, Tomoaki; Kimura, Tadashi; Yamada, Hideto",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,654,1

Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protective efficacy, and potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) mediated by Ad26.COV2.S in a moderate disease Syrian hamster challenge model, using the currently most prevalent G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 variant. Vaccine doses of 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 VP elicited substantial neutralizing antibodies titers and completely protected over 80% of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Syrian hamsters from lung infection and pneumonia but not upper respiratory tract infection. A second vaccine dose further increased neutralizing antibody titers that was associated with decreased infectious viral load in the upper respiratory tract after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Suboptimal non-protective immune responses elicited by low-dose A26.COV2.S vaccination did not exacerbate respiratory disease in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated Syrian hamsters with breakthrough infection. In addition, dosing down the vaccine allowed to establish that binding and neutralizing antibody titers correlate with lower respiratory tract protection probability. Overall, these preclinical data confirm efficacy of a one-dose vaccine regimen with Ad26.COV2.S in this G614 spike SARS-CoV-2 virus variant Syrian hamster model, show the added benefit of a second vaccine dose, and demonstrate that there are no signs of VAERD under conditions of suboptimal immunity.","van der Lubbe, Joan E M; Rosendahl Huber, Sietske K; Vijayan, Aneesh; Dekking, Liesbeth; van Huizen, Ella; Vreugdenhil, Jessica; Choi, Ying; Baert, Miranda R M; Feddes-de Boer, Karin; Izquierdo Gil, Ana; van Heerden, Marjolein; Dalebout, Tim J; Myeni, Sebenzile K; Kikkert, Marjolein; Snijder, Eric J; de Waal, Leon; Stittelaar, Koert J; Tolboom, Jeroen T B M; Serroyen, Jan; Muchene, Leacky; van der Fits, Leslie; Rutten, Lucy; Langedijk, Johannes P M; Barouch, Dan H; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Zahn, Roland C; Wegmann, Frank",NPJ Vaccines,654,16

We have analyzed the growth behavior of the top 25 most affected countries by means of a local slope analysis and found three distinct patterns that individual countries follow depending on the strictness of the lockdown protocols: exponential rise and fall, power law, or logistic. For countries showing power law growth we have determined the scaling exponents. For countries that showed a strong slowdown in the rate of infections we have extrapolated the expected saturation of the number of infections and the expected final date. Two different extrapolation methods (logistic and parabolic) were used. Both methods agree on the order of magnitude of saturation and end dates. Global infections rates are analyzed with the same methods. The relevance and accuracy of these extrapolations is discussed.","Singer, H. M.",,654,31

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: A single tertiary, university-affiliated medical centre in Israel. Time period, 1 June 2020 through to 31 July 2020. POPULATION: Women who were hospitalised in a single tertiary medical centre, who were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. METHODS: Women were diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR test. Vaginal RT-PCR swabs were obtained from all study participants after a proper cleansing of the perineum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal RT-PCR swabs. RESULTS: Vaginal and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 35 women, aged 21-93 years. Twenty-one women (60%) were in their reproductive years, of whom, five were in their third trimester of pregnancy. Most of the participants (57%) were healthy without any underlying medical conditions. Of the 35 patients sampled, 2 (5.7%) had a positive vaginal RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, one was premenopausal and the other was a postmenopausal woman. Both women had mild disease. CONCLUSION: Our findings contradict most previous reports, which did not detect the presence of viral colonisation in the vagina. Although passage through the birth canal exposes neonates to the vaginal polymicrobial flora, an acquisition of pathogens does not necessarily mandate neonatal infection or clinical disease. Nevertheless, when delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation, even if it is uncommon. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: When delivering the infant of a woman with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, a clinician should consider the possibility of vaginal colonisation.","Schwartz, A; Yogev, Y; Zilberman, A; Alpern, S; Many, A; Yousovich, R; Gamzu, R",BJOG,654,20

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the impact on cancer diagnostic service in public facilities across Hong Kong. Quantifying the temporal changes in the number of cancer diagnosis before, during and after the outbreak, is useful to establish the scale of the problem and to assess if there has been an adequate level of response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide database in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2020 using consecutive specimens received for pathological diagnosis in public laboratories in 41 hospitals were retrieved. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 455,453 pathological specimens were received, which amounted to a 15.5% reduction compared to prior 3-year average (p-value < 0.001). Analysis on confirmed malignant pathological diagnosis revealed a statistically significant reduction in colorectal (-10.0%, p-value < 0.001), prostate (-19.7%, p-value < 0.001), non-significant reduction for lung (-3.0%, p-valueâ¯=â¯0.0526), and a marginal but non-significant increase for breast (0.7%, p-valueâ¯=â¯0.7592) regions.

The utility and sustainability of inpatient telemedicine initiatives need to be evaluated as the number of COVID-19 inpatients is expected to continue declining. In this viewpoint, we describe the use of a rapidly deployed inpatient telemedicine workflow at a large academic medical center and discuss the potential impact on PPE savings. In early 2020, videoconferencing software was installed on patient bedside iPads at two academic medical center teaching hospitals. An internal website allowed providers to initiate video calls with patients in any patient room with an activated iPad, including both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Patients were encouraged to use telemedicine technology to connect with loved ones via native apps or videoconferencing software. We evaluated the use of telemedicine technology on patients' bedside iPads by monitoring traffic to the internal website. Between May 2020 and March 2021, there were a total of 1240 active users of the Video Visits website (mean 112.7, SD 49.0 connection events per month). Of these, 133 (10.7%) connections were made. Patients initiated 63 (47.4%) video calls with family or friends and sent 37 (27.8%) emails with videoconference connection instructions. Providers initiated a total of 33 (24.8%) video calls with the majority of calls initiated in August (n=22, 67%). There was a low level of adoption of inpatient telemedicine capability by providers and patients. With sufficient availability of PPE, inpatient providers did not find a frequent need to use the bedside telemedicine technology, despite a high census of patients with COVID-19. Compared to providers, patients used videoconferencing capabilities more frequently in September and October 2020. We did not find savings of PPE associated with the use of inpatient telemedicine.","Halabi, Reem; Smith, Geoffrey; Sylwestrzak, Marc; Clay, Brian; Longhurst, Christopher A; Lander, Lina",J Med Internet Res,654,16

Treatments for COVID-19 are limited; however, monoclonal antibodies are emerging as a potential therapeutic option to change the trajectory of high-risk patients. This retrospective single center cohort study evaluated the outcomes of SOT recipients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who received bamlanivimab monotherapy. Eighteen SOT recipients (15 kidney, 2 liver, and 1 heart) received the medication between November 9, 2020 and February 10, 2021 with no reported infusion reactions. One patient experienced headache and fatigue following the infusion that resolved within 3 days. Fourteen patients continued their recovery as an outpatient with no further escalation in care. Three patients required hospitalization: two for suspected bacterial pneumonia 9 and 32 days postinfusion, respectively, and one for acute kidney injury 7 days postinfusion. One patient had an emergency room visit for gastrointestinal symptoms 24 days postinfusion. In this small cohort of SOT recipients, bamlanivimab monotherapy appeared to be a well-tolerated option for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19, but it was not completely effective in preventing hospitalization. One month following the end of this cohort, COVID-19 treatment guidance changed due to the rising prevalence of resistant variants. For this reason, bamlanivimab is now recommended to be used only in combination with etesevimab. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the role of this therapy in SOT recipients.","Kutzler, Heather L; Kuzaro, Hillary A; Serrano, Oscar K; Feingold, Andrew; Morgan, Glyn; Cheema, Faiqa",Transpl Infect Dis,654,16

Obesity increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it is one of the independent risk factors for the most severe cases of COVID-19. Currently, the most effective treatment against obesity available is bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS), which further resolves or improves other independent risk factors like diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: Provide recommendations for the resumption of elective BMS during COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: This document was created by the IFSO-LAC Executive Board and a task force. Based on data collected from a survey distributed to all IFSO-LAC members that obtained 540 responses, current evidence available, and consensus reached by other scientific societies. RESULTS: The resumption of elective BMS must be a priority maybe similar to oncological surgery, when hospitals reach phase I or II, treating obesity patients in a NON-COVID area, avoiding inadvertent intrahospital contagion from healthcare provider, patients, and relatives. Same BMS indication and types of procedures as before the pandemic. Discard the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within 72 h prior to surgery. Continues laparoscopic approach. The entire team use N95 mask. Minimum hospital stays. Implement remote visits for the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Resumption of elective BMS is crucial because it is not only a weight loss operation but also resolves or improves comorbidities and appears to be an immune restorative procedure of obese patients in the medium term, offering them the same probability of contracting COVID-19 as the regular population.","Behrens, Estuardo; Poggi, Luis; Aparicio, Sergio; Martínez Duartez, Pedro; Rodríguez, Nelson; Zundel, Natan; Ramos Cardoso, Almino; Camacho, Diego; López-Corvalá, Juan Antonio; Vilas-Bôas, Marcos Leão; Laynez, Jorge",Obes Surg,654,1

It also identified factors related to the knowledge and behavior regarding the same among older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted via a telephone survey involving 283 older adults living alone in S City from March to April 2020. Knowledge and behavior pertaining to face mask usage were measured using Hilda Ho's Face Mask Use Scale; reliability of the measurement was Kuder-Richardson formula-20 = .62, Cronbach's &#945; = .92. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Older adults used one mask for 3.55 days on an average. The knowledge level was 9.97 (± 1.84) out of 12 and behavior level was 15.49 (± 1.55) out of 16. Level of education (ß = - .31, p < .001), living region (ß = .13, p = .017), personal income (ß = .12, p = .041) significantly affected the face mask usage-related knowledge, and living region (ß = .15, p = .010) significantly affected the face mask usage-related behavior. CONCLUSION: Older adults living alone are aware of the effects of using face masks. However, their mask usage is inappropriate, for example, the prolonged use of the same mask. Considering the low level of face mask usage-related knowledge, it is necessary to develop customized education programs and infectious disease prevention strategies for older adults possessing low educational levels living alone in urban-rural complex areas.","Han, A Reum; Park, Yeon Hwan",J Korean Acad Nurs,654,16

World health organization (WHO) had recommended online education to keep social distance which still needs further evaluation. This study aimed to examine whether an open online course is superior to conventional education in emergency nursing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two groups of conventional education students (CG) and two groups of students participating in an online course that utilized an application (called SuperStar) as the SuperStar Group (SSG) were studied to compare their abilities in the process of new knowledge acquisition. The SSG was divided into a blended group (S1) and an online group (S2). The emergency nursing course was scheduled in 16 independent classes, which contained stochastic tests at least eight times. RESULTS: The CG group showed better performance on the final exam than the SSG group, but there was no statistically significant difference. The CG group obtained better scores on the memory capacity tests while the SSG had better scores on the application capacity tests. The SSG group scored higher on the later tests during the process of education compared to the CG group. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehension of an emergency nursing course was stronger in the SSG group than in the CG group. Horizontal comparison of subentry tests discriminated between the groups, with a better trend for the SSG group in application ability. There are potential effects on chronological learning through the use of the online course for emergency nursing education, not only during COVID-19 but also in the post-pandemic era.","Lei, Tao; Yu, Xiaoxue; Zou, Min; Wang, Peipei; Yuan, Rong Hua",Australas.

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3-98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0-10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users. The results of empirical studies demonstrate that by constantly inputting medical knowledge into the system, the proposed method will be capable to detect unknown diseases from existing ones and perform an early response to the initial outbreaks.","Feng, Rui; Hu, Qiping; Jiang, Yingan",Front Public Health,654,1

Among 1010 consecutive STEMI patients, 91 were identified as Covid-19 (10.9%). With the exception of smoking status (more frequent in non-Covid-19) and previous coronary artery disease (more frequent in Covid-19), clinical characteristics were similar between groups, but Covid-19 patients had more heart failure on arrival (31.9% vs 18.4%, p=0.002).

This imaging modality gives insights into low-volume, rapidly oscillating cardiac-driven movement as well as sustained, high-volume, slowly oscillating inspiration-driven movement. Inspiration means a spontaneous or artificial increase in the intrathoracic dimensions independent of body position. Alterations in thoracic diameter enable the thoracic and spinal epidural venous compartments to be emptied and filled, producing an upward surge of cerebrospinal fluid inside the spine during inspiration; this surge counterbalances the downward pooling of venous blood toward the heart. Real-time MRI, as a macroscale in vivo observation method, could expand our knowledge of neurofluid dynamics, including how astrocytic fluid preloading is adjusted and how brain buoyancy and turgor are maintained in different postures and zero gravity. Along with these macroscale findings, new microscale insights into aquaporin-mediated fluid transfer, its sensing by cilia, and its tuning by nitric oxide will be reviewed.

An environmental realistic higher tier test is a STP simulation test as described in OECD 303A (2001) which for nanoparticles can also be used to study their sorption behavior to activated sludge. However, information is limited on the influence of synthetic sewage on the microbial community of the activated sludge. A modified community can result in modifications of the sludge floccules affecting the sorption behavior. The main objective of our study was to show whether a representative microbial diversity remains under standardized test conditions as described in OECD 303A (2001) using synthetic sewage as influent. Furthermore, we investigated whether just considering the functional properties of a STP (elimination of dissolved organic carbon; nitrification), is sufficient for an assessment of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) or whether the influence on microbial diversity also needs to be considered. AuNPs were used as a case study due to their rising medical applications and therefore increasing probability to reach the sewer and STP. The results can provide significant input for the interpretation of results from the regulatory point of view. To deliver these objectives, the general changes of the microbial population in activated sludge and its influence on the degradation activity (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen) using freshly collected sludge from the municipal STP in an artificial test system as a model STP in accordance with OECD 303A (2001) were assessed. Additionally, we evaluated the potential impact of AuNPs and its dispersant on the microbial composition and the overall impact on the function of the STP in terms of DOC degradation and nitrogen removal to observe if an assessment based on functional properties is sufficient. The bacteria composition in our study, evaluated at a class level, revealed commonly described environmental bacteria. Proteobacteria (ß, &#945;, Î´) accounted for more than 50% but also nitrifying bacteria as Nitrospira were present. Our results show that mainly within the first 7 days of an acclimatization phase by addition of synthetic sewage, the bacterial community changed. Even though AuNPs can have antibacterial properties, no adverse effects on the function and structure of the microorganisms in the STP could be detected at concentrations of increased modeled PEC values by a factor of about 10,000. Complementary to other metallic nanomaterials, gold nanomaterials also sorb to a large extent to the activated sludge. If activated sludge is used as fertilizer on agricultural land, gold nanoparticles can be introduced into soils. In this case, the effect on soil (micro)organisms must be investigated more closely, also taking into account the structural diversity.","Schlich, Karsten; Díaz, Cecilia; Gomez Pizarro, Benjamin; Knopf, Burkhard; Schlinkert, Ruben; Wege, Franziska Frederike; Jurack, Anne; Hund-Rinke, Kerstin",,654,16

The results have suggested that doxorubicin could inhibit the virus spike protein and prevent the access of the SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell.

The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia are shown to be affected by some explanatory variables that are recorded daily: recovered COVID-19 cases, critical cases, daily active cases, tests per million, curfew hours, maximal temperatures, maximal relative humidity, maximal wind speed, and maximal pressure. Restrictions applied by the Saudi Arabia government due to the COVID-19 outbreak, from the suspension of Umrah and flights, and the lockdown of some cities with a curfew are based on information about COVID-15. The aim of the paper is to propose some predictive regression models similar to generalized linear models (GLMs) for fitting COVID-19 data in Saudi Arabia to analyze, forecast, and extract meaningful information that helps decision makers. In this direction, we propose some regression models on the basis of inverted exponential distribution (IE-Reg), Bayesian (BReg) and empirical Bayesian regression (EBReg) models for use in conjunction with inverted exponential distribution (IE-BReg and IE-EBReg). In all approaches, we use the logarithm (log) link function, gamma prior and two loss functions in the Bayesian approach, namely, the zero-one and LINEX loss functions. To deal with the outliers in the proposed models, we apply Huber and Tukey's bisquare (biweight) functions. In addition, we use the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm to estimate Bayesian regression coefficients. Further, we compare IE-Reg, IE-BReg, and IE-EBReg using some criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), deviance (D), and mean squared error (MSE). Finally, we apply the collected data of the daily confirmed from March 23 - June 21, 2020 with the corresponding explanatory variables to the theoretical findings. IE-EBReg shows good model for the COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia compared with the other models.","Al-Dawsari, Sarah R; Sultan, Khalaf S",Math Biosci Eng,654,16

Despite the existence of multiple studies on the different digestive symptoms and their relationship with this disease, it is still vital to highlight the severity of the different symptoms, the need to diagnose it properly and quickly. Currently in Colombia there are no writings that highlight the above. CASE PRESENTATION: This article reports the case of a 37-year-old female patient, with no important history, who consulted for 10 h of a generalized intense abdominal pain, of sudden onset, associated with multiple stools of diarrheal consistency, and no respiratory symptoms and no epidemiological exposure. Physical examination with intense pain in the colic frame with tenderness. It was decided to rule out surgical pathology and a CT scan was performed finding no evidence of acute intra-abdominal pathology, but with a peripheral alveolar, and ground-glass opacities at lung bases, classic COVID-19 radiological pattern, confirmed by a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, leading to consider that the gastrointestinal symptoms were secondary to this infection. Symptomatic management was given with subsequent improvement.

Virtually all organs and biological systems suffer from this new coronavirus infection, either because the virus targets directly specific tissues or because of indirect effects. Endocrine diseases are not an exception and some of endocrine organs are at risk of direct or indirect lesion by COVID-19. Although there is still no evidence of higher predisposition to contract the infection in patients with diabetes and/or obesity, the coexistence of these conditions contributes to a worse prognosis because both conditions confer an impaired immunologic system. Cytokines storm can be amplified by these two latter conditions thereby leading to multisystemic failure and death. Glycaemic control has been demonstrated to be crucial to avoiding long hospital stays, ICU requirement and also prevention of excessive mortality. Endocrine treatment modifications as a consequence of COVID-19 infection are required in a proactive manner, in order to avoid decompensation and eventual hospital admission. This is the case of diabetes and adrenal insufficiency in which prompt increase of insulin dosage and substitutive adrenal steroids through adoption of the sick day's rules should be warranted, as well as easy contact with the health care provider through telematic different modalities.

We aimed to investigate the use of steroids and its impact. We conducted a retrospective chart review and analysis of 226 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were divided into those who received steroids (steroid group) and those who did not (no steroid group). Inverse weighted probability weighted analysis was performed to assess the effect of steroids for in-hospital mortality. The steroid group had higher rates of preexisting hypertension and peripheral vascular disease than no steroid group and also had higher lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and inflammatory makers compared to no steroid group (all P<0.05). The steroid group had significantly higher rates of multifocal pneumonia than no steroid group at admission (75.4% versus 50.3%, P=0.001). Notably, steroid group had higher rates of bacterial infection (25% versus 13.1%, P=0.041) and fungal infection (12.7% versus 0.7%, P<0.001) during hospital course. After adjustment, steroid did not decrease or increase in-hospital mortality (OR [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.60-1.73, P=0.94]). Steroid did not decrease the in-hospital mortality rate. There were increased bacterial and fungal infections with steroid use.","Obata, Reiichiro; Maeda, Tetsuro; DO, Dahlia Rizk; Kuno, Toshiki",Jpn. j. infect. dis,654,16

Many countries were forced to a global lockdown with a great socio-economic impact. In Italy, one of the problems was the complex mobility network structure of the Northern regions that made ineffective the attempts to isolate the initial hotspots. In the paper we study a simple model that simulates the epidemic spread on a community network that may exchange population according to a daily mobility rate. In each community the epidemic evolution is provided by a stochastic compartmental model whose parameters are tuned to reproduce the Covid-19 evolution observed in Italy before the global lockdown policies. We initially study the delay in the epidemic spread due to the finite local mobility by proposing a power law relation for the increasing of the infection peak time in each node and the network distance from the initial node where the epidemic starts. We consider two scenarios to study the effectiveness of local lockdown policies: the presence of two clusters weakly connected by the mobility or a homogeneous chain of communities that exchange the population at a fixed rate. In both cases we show the existence of a threshold effect, in a probabilistic sense, for the effectiveness of lockdown policies as a function of the delay time at which such policies are applied, or of the network distance from the outbreak node.","Bazzani, A.; Lunedei, E.; Rambaldi, S.",Rivista di Biologia,654,5

The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission. Objective: The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India. Methodology: In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India. Results: Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly. Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 infection at any point in pregnancy and collected paired maternal and cord blood samples at the time of delivery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays were performed to measure maternal plasma and cord blood concentrations and neutralizing potency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Differences in concentrations according to symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infection and time from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result to delivery were analyzed using nonparametric tests of significance. The ratio of cord to maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers was analyzed to assess transplacental transfer efficiency. RESULTS: Thirty-two paired samples were analyzed. Detectable anti-receptor-binding domain IgG was detected in 100% (n=32) of maternal and 91% (n=29) of cord blood samples. Functional neutralizing antibody was present in 94% (n=30) of the maternal and 25% (n=8) of cord blood samples. Symptomatic infection was associated with a significant difference in median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers compared with asymptomatic infection (log 3.2 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.7 [2.9-1.4], P=.03). Median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers were not significantly higher in patients who delivered more than 14 days after a positive PCR test result compared with those who delivered within 14 days (log 3.3 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.67 [2.8-1.6], P=.05). Median (range) cord/maternal antibody ratio was 0.81 (0.67-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate robust maternal neutralizing and anti-receptor-binding domain IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet a lower-than-expected efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer and a significant reduction in neutralization between maternal blood and cord blood. Maternal infection does confer some degree of neonatal antibody protection, but the robustness and durability of protection require further study.","Joseph, Naima T; Dude, Carolynn M; Verkerke, Hans P; Irby, Les039; Shon, S; Dunlop, Anne L; Patel, Ravi M; Easley, Kirk A; Smith, Alicia K; Stowell, Sean R; Jamieson, Denise J; Velu, Vijayakumar; Badell, Martina L",Obstet. gynecol,654,29

These shortages have led to the creation of protocols to disinfect and reuse potentially contaminated personal protective equipment. A simple and inexpensive decontamination procedure that does not rely on the use of consumable supplies is dry heat incubation. Although reprocessing with this method has been shown to maintain the integrity of N95 respirators after multiple decontamination procedures, information on the ability of dry heat incubation to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is largely unreported. Here, we show that dry heat incubation does not consistently inactivate SARS-CoV-2-contaminated N95 respirators, and that variation in experimental conditions can dramatically affect viability of the virus. Furthermore, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on N95 respirators that remain at room temperature for at least five days. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that dry heat incubation procedures and ambient temperature for five days are not viable methods for inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on N95 respirators for potential reuse.

This protein is susceptible to cleavage of its linker-peptides by several proteases, and the resulting cleaved forms, N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and C-terminal CRD, bind to various glycans. It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities. We propose that FL-Gal-9 regulates the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, HIV co-infected with opportunistic infection (HIV/OI), dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis (TB). We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB. The protease cleavage of FL-Gal-9 may lead to uncontrolled hyper-immune activation, including a cytokine storm. In summary, Gal-9 has potential to reflect the disease severity for the acute and chronic infectious diseases.","Iwasaki-Hozumi, Hiroko; Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile; Ashino, Yugo; Hattori, Toshio",Biomolecules,654,24

In addition to air freight, ocean-going ships play a non-negligible role in spreading COVID-19 due to frequent visits to countries with infected populations. This research introduces a method to dynamically assess the infection risk of ships based on a datadriven approach. It automatically identifies the ports and countries these ships approach based on their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data and a spatio-temporal density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. We derive daily and 14 day cumulative ship exposure indexes based on a series of country-based indices, such as population density, cumulative confirmed cases, and increased rate of confirmed cases. These indexes are classified into high-, middle-, and low-risk levels that are then coded as red, yellow, and green according to the health Quick Response (QR) code based on the reference exposure index of Wuhan on April 8, 2020. This method was applied to a real container ship deployed along a Eurasian route. The results showed that the proposed method can trace ship infection risk and provide a decision support mechanism to prevent and control overseas imported COVID-19 cases from international shipping.","Wang, Zhihuan; Yao, Mengyuan; Meng, Chenguang; Claramunt, Christophe",ISPRS Int.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to identify predictors of risk factors for deterioration in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. METHODS: Design: Nested case-control study within a cohort. SETTING: 13 acute care centers of the Osakidetza-Basque Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with clinical deterioration-defined as onset of severe ARDS, ICU admission, or death-were considered cases. Two controls were matched to each case based on age. Sociodemographic data; comorbidities; baseline treatment; symptoms; date of onset; previous consultations; and clinical, analytical, and radiological variables were collected. An explanatory model of clinical deterioration was created by means of conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 99 cases and 198 controls were included. According to the logistic regression analysis, the independent variables associated with clinical deterioration were: emergency department O2 saturation &#8804;90% (OR 16.6; 95%CI 4-68), pathological chest X-ray (OR 5.6; 95%CI 1.7-18.4), CRP >100 mg/dL (OR 3.62; 95%CI 1.62-8), thrombocytopenia with <150,000 platelets (OR 4; 95%CI 1.84-8.6); and a medical history of acute myocardial infarction (OR 15.7; 95%CI), COPD (OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.43-6.5), or HT (OR 2.21; 95%CI 1.11-4.4). The model's AUC was 0.86.

Ensuring an adequate ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces. In this study, we estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates with the Wells-Riley equation, where the quantum generation rate (q) by a COVID-19 infector was obtained using a reproductive number-based fitting approach. The estimated q value of COVID-19 is 14-48 h-1. To ensure an infection probability of less than 1%, a ventilation rate larger than common values (100-350 m3/h per infector and 1200-4000 m3/h per infector for 0.25 h and 3 h of exposure, respectively) is required. If the infector and susceptible person wear masks, then the ventilation rate ensuring a less than 1% infection probability can be reduced to a quarter respectively, which is easier to achieve by the normal ventilation mode applied in typical scenarios, including offices, classrooms, buses, and aircraft cabins. Strict preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks and preventing asymptomatic infectors from entering public spaces using tests) that have been widely adopted should be effective in reducing the risk of infection in confined spaces.","Dai, Hui; Zhao, Bin",Build Simul,654,5

The objective of this study is to assess the students' anxiety levels. The method we used was a cross-section of the university students in Sudan using a proportionate stratified random sampling technique to assess their anxiety level using Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) during the COVID-19 pandemic through an online self-administered questionnaire. Results indicated that of the 478 participants, 75.1% had a low anxiety level, 15.5% had a moderate anxiety level and 9.4% had a potentially concerning level of anxiety. Experiencing no symptoms during the past 14 days was associated with a low level of anxiety. Moreover, experiencing fever, sore throat, and myalgia or fatigue were associated with low to moderate anxiety levels among the participants. While having a relative or a friend diagnosed or suspected with the disease or having headache were associated with a low anxiety level, Thus the conclusion was that not complying with the curfew measures, and the preventive etiquette of covering mouth while coughing or sneezing were associated with potentially concerning levels of anxiety while experiencing fever, sore throat and myalgia were associated with moderate anxiety levels.

The presence of one or more of these conditions can make the patients immunocompromised. Methods and procedures From March to May 2020, data of non-ICU patients with Covid-19 infection were collected at discharge. Data on age, sex, comorbidities, weight loss at admission, reduced oral intake and Body Mass Index (BMI) at admission, outcome, Artificial Nutrition and severity of disease were recorded. Mean and standard deviation or percentage were calculated;stratification of BMI values was performed. Results Data from n. 130 non-ICU patients were collected (Table 1). Patients are mostly men (64%), mean age 65,2 years and mean BMI 26,3. Most common comorbidities are hypertension (52%), diabetes (29%), ischemic heart disease (25%). Only 11% experienced weight loss in last 3 months and 18% reduced their oral intake in previous 3 days. Almost half of patients falls within overweight or obese BMI range (49%).

Countries will want to know how to better prepare for future events. The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) is a broad, independent assessment of 195 countries' preparedness for biothreats that may aid this endeavour. However, to be useful, the GHSI's external validity must be demonstrated. We aimed to validate the GHSI against a range of external metrics to assess how it could be utilised by countries. METHODS: Global aggregate communicable disease outcomes were correlated with GHSI scores and linear regression models were examined to determine associations while controlling for a number of global macroindices. GHSI scores for countries previously exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola and recipients of US Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) investment were compared with matched control countries. Possible content omissions in light of the progressing COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. RESULTS: GHSI scores for countries had strong criterion validity against the Joint External Evaluation ReadyScore (rho=0.82, p<0.0001), and moderate external validity against deaths from communicable diseases (-0.56, p<0.0001). GHSI scores were associated with reduced deaths from communicable diseases (F(3, 172)=22.75, p<0.0001). The proportion of deaths from communicable diseases decreased 4.8% per 10-point rise in GHSI. Recipient countries of the GHSA (n=31) and SARS-affected countries (n=26), had GHSI scores 6.0 (p=0.0011) and 8.2 (p=0.0010) points higher than matched controls, respectively. Biosecurity and biosafety appear weak globally including in high-income countries, and health systems, particularly in Africa, are not prepared. Notably, the GHSI does not account for all factors important for health security. CONCLUSION: The GHSI shows promise as a valid tool to guide action on biosafety, biosecurity and systems preparedness. However, countries need to look beyond existing metrics to other factors moderating the impact of future pandemics and other biothreats. Consideration of anthropogenic and large catastrophic scenarios is also needed.","Boyd, Matthew J; Wilson, Nick; Nelson, Cassidy",,654,20

Since bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) collected during fibrobronchoscopy may increase test sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, it was performed during the 2020 pandemic in clinically or radiologically suspected cases. Our aim was to determine whether clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) findings or laboratory tests may predict patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study with multivariable analysis of suspected patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after at least one negative nasopharyngeal swab. Univariable logistic regression for odds ratio and multivariate models was calculated to determine clinical, radiological and laboratory predictors. 32/198 (16%) patients had BAL positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 65/198 tested positive for other pathogens at BAL. Of the 32 patients positive for COVID, 4 had a coinfection at BAL, being thus positive both for COVID as well as for another pathogen while the remaining 105 patients were negative for COVID and other pathogens at BAL. COVID-19 patients had more often highly suggestive CT findings, higher number of involved lobes, more often ground glass opacity of more than 50% of lung parenchyma, and less frequently other radiologically suspected infections. At multivariate model, temperature also predicted BAL positivity. The procedure was well tolerated-with only one desaturation episode-while no healthcare worker was infected. In conclusion, when nasopharyngeal swabs are negative but there is clinical or imaging suspicion of COVID-19, BAL represents a complementary diagnostic tool, particularly in conjunction with suggestive/more extensive lung involvement at CT scan. The procedure did not carry increased risks for patients nor for operators, while allowing to free hospital resources, avoiding unnecessary isolations.","Barberi, Caterina; Castelnuovo, Elena; Dipasquale, Andrea; Mrakic Sposta, Federica; Vatteroni, Giulia; Canziani, Lorenzo Maria; Alloisio, Marco; Ciccarelli, Michele; Selmi, Carlo; Ferraroli, Giorgio Maria",Intern. emerg. med,654,3

Purpose To conduct meta-analysis of the study-level incidence of PE and DVT and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE from multicenter individual patient data. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the incidence of PE or DVT in patients with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 15, 2020. These outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and were further evaluated using metaregression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer tests for PE was estimated on the basis of individual patient data using the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Results Twenty-seven studies with 3342 patients with COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The pooled incidence rates of PE and DVT were 16.5% (95% CI: 11.6, 22.9; I2 = 0.93) and 14.8% (95% CI: 8.5, 24.5; I2 = 0.94), respectively. PE was more frequently found in patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (24.7% [95% CI: 18.6, 32.1] vs 10.5% [95% CI: 5.1, 20.2] in those not admitted to the ICU) and in studies with universal screening using CT pulmonary angiography. DVT was present in 42.4% of patients with PE. D-dimer tests had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.737 for PE, and D-dimer levels of 500 and 1000 µg/L showed high sensitivity (96% and 91%, respectively) but low specificity (10% and 24%, respectively). Conclusion Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 16.5% and 14.8% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respectively, and more than half of patients with PE lacked DVT. The cutoffs of D-dimer levels used to exclude PE in preexisting guidelines seem applicable to patients with COVID-19. © RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Its impact on the environment includes acid rain and decreased visibility, but more importantly, it also has an impact on human health. The rise of COVID-19 demonstrates the cost of failing to manage AP. COVID-19 can be spread through the air, and atmospheric particulate matters (PMs) can create a good atmosphere for the long-distance spread of the virus. Moreover, these PMs can cause lung cell inflammation, thereby increasing sensitivity and the severity of symptoms in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we emphasized the potential role of PMs in the spread of COVID-19. The relationship among COVID-19, PMs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (receptor involved in virus entry into lung cells and inflammation) was also summarized.","Khan, Zafran; Ualiyeva, Daniya; Khan, Asaf; Zaman, Nasib; Sapkota, Sanjeep; Khan, Ayub; Ali, Babar; Ghafoor, Dawood",J Environ Public Health,654,22

For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics. OBJECTIVES: We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States. DISCUSSION: Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","Keshaviah, Aparna; Hu, Xindi C; Henry, Marisa",Environ Health Perspect,654,16

SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study. METHODS: Ten ophthalmology residents were stratified by postgraduate year and randomized to perform a corneal suturing task consisting of placing the 4 cardinal sutures for a penetrating keratoplasty in porcine eyes with or without remote ophthalmology attending feedback. Subsequently, both groups repeated the same task without remote feedback to test whether initial remote feedback affected subsequent performance. Finally, the group without feedback was crossed over to repeat the same corneal suturing task with remote feedback. The effectiveness of the remote wet lab was assessed subjectively by survey and objectively by grading each suture pass. RESULTS: Resident-reported comfort with corneal suturing improved significantly after the remote wet lab for all residents. Residents and attendings rated the remote wet lab as equally or more effective compared to prior in-person wet labs and overall effective in corneal suturing. Attendings rated the remote wet lab as effective in multiple domains of microsurgical education using a modified microsurgical global rating scale. Objective corneal suturing performance was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: The remote wet lab was feasible and effective for training ophthalmology residents in corneal suturing.

The activity was conducted in Italy during weeks of lockdown. In the spring of 2020, due to containment measures adopted by the Italian government to face with COVID-19, day-long meetings of students of social work with Experts by Experience were suspended. This impediment encouraged educators to develop a new initiative named ‘Social work student telephones Expert by Experience’ in which 119 students of social work and 69 Experts by Experience participated. The activity entailed a telephone call exchanged between a student and an Expert by Experience. After their respective calls, each student was invited to fill out an online form describing the lived experience through a short story addressed to an imaginary friend. Three main themes emerged from the content analysis of the students’ stories: students’ learnings acquired through the activity;students’ feelings during the activity;students’ overall opinions on the educational activity. In the international field of service users’ involvement in social work education, the activity represents an innovation that could inspire other universities to adopt similar practices.

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.","Liu, Fengjun; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Chao; Shi, Chunzi; Wang, Lin; Shi, Nannan; Fang, Cong; Shan, Fei; Mei, Xue; Shi, Jing; Song, Fengxiang; Yang, Zhongcheng; Ding, Zezhen; Su, Xiaoming; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhu, Tongyu; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shi, Lei; Shi, Yuxin",Theranostics,654,16

STUDY DESIGN: We offered the study at 10 sites that provided the service in 13 states and Washington DC. Interested individuals obtained any needed preabortion tests locally and had a videoconference with a study clinician. Sites sent study packages containing mifepristone and misoprostol by mail and had remote follow-up consultations within one month by telephone (or by online survey, if the participant could not be reached) to evaluate abortion completeness. The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and 10 serious adverse events occurred, including 5 transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the 6 months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the 6 months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. CONCLUSIONS: This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, participants did not need to visit any facilities to obtain the service, which was critical to protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: Medical abortion using telemedicine and mail is effective and can be safely provided without a pretreatment ultrasound. This method of service delivery has the potential to greatly improve access to abortion care in the United States.","Chong, Erica; Shochet, Tara; Raymond, Elizabeth; Platais, Ingrida; Anger, Holly A; Raidoo, Shandhini; Soon, Reni; Grant, Melissa S; Haskell, Susan; Tocce, Kristina; Baldwin, Maureen K; Boraas, Christy M; Bednarek, Paula H; Banks, Joey; Coplon, Leah; Thompson, Francine; Priegue, Esther; Winikoff, Beverly",Contraception,654,16

While do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions are made in advance in certain medical situations, in particular in the setting of poor prognosis like in advanced oncology, the discussion of DNR in relation to acute medical conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic in this example, might impose ethical dilemmas to the patient and family, healthcare providers (HCPs) including physicians and nurses, and to the institution. The literature on DNR decisions in the more recent pandemics and outbreaks is scarce. DNR was only discussed amid the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, with clear global recommendations. The unprecedented condition of the COVID-19 pandemic leaves healthcare systems worldwide confronting tough decisions. DNR has been implemented in some countries where the healthcare system is limited in capacity to admit, and thus intubating and resuscitating patients when needed is jeopardized. Some countries were forced to adopt a unilateral DNR policy for certain patient groups. Younger age was used as a discriminator in some, while general medical condition with anticipated good outcome was used in others. The ethical challenge of how to balance patient autonomy vs. beneficence, equality vs. equity, is a pressing concern. In the current difficult situation, when cases top 100 million globally and the death toll surges past 2.7 million, difficult decisions are to be made. Societal rather than individual benefits might prevail. Pre-hospital triaging of cases, engagement of other sectors including mental health specialists and religious scholars to support patients, families, and HCPs in the frontline might help in addressing the psychological stress these groups might encounter in addressing DNR in the current situation.","Sultan, Hala; Mansour, Razan; Shamieh, Omar; Al-Tabba039,; Amal,; Al-Hussaini, Maysa",Front Public Health,654,24

We aimed to determine this risk in apparently non-diabetic individuals. MATERIAL METHODS: Baseline demographic and clinical data from 100 apparently non-diabetic household members (related or unrelated) of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were collected until 49 days of lockdown and analyzed using the XL-STAT statistical software. A two-pronged analytical strategy was employed. First, the metabolic risk profile related to age, sex, weight, family history, and exercise pattern was analyzed. This was followed by an assessment of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes using an established risk assessment engine. RESULTS: There was a trend towards weight gain seen in 40% of the cohort, with 16% of the population experiencing a 2.1-5 kg weight increment. When all the risk parameters were analyzed together using the ADA risk engine, there was an increase in the ADA diabetes risk score in 7% of the population, with 6.66% in the high-risk group. There was a further increase in weight among 3% of the population who were already obese at baseline. CONCLUSION: We show an increased risk of T2MD consequent to weight gain during 49 days of lockdown in India.","Ghosal, Samit; Arora, Bhavya; Dutta, Koel; Ghosh, Amerta; Sinha, Binayak; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,654,1

Nos anos 80 as espécies brasileiras de Ornithonyssus de roedores e marsupiais foram sinonimizadas e reduzidas a quatro somente, O. bacoti (Hirst), O. matogrosso (Fonseca), O. pereirai (Fonseca) e O. wernecki (Fonseca). O presente estudo reuniu informações sobre a morfologia dessas espécies a partir de tipos e material depositados na Coleção Acarológica do Instituto Butantan, bem como, de espécimes recentemente coletado em pequenos mamíferos terrestres. Para dar suporte à morfologia, estudos de biologia molecular foram conduzidos a fim de esclarecer o status taxonômico desse gênero. Adicionalmente foi investigada a presença de bactérias do gênero Rickettsia no material coletado. Os caracteres morfológicos foram estudados através de microscopia óptica e eletrônica de varredura. Para a taxonomia molecular o DNA foi extraído e a região 16SrDNA do gene mitocondrial foi seqüenciada, incluindo espécimes dos Estados Unidos e Peru. Na pesquisa de Rickettsia foi utilizada a técnica da PCR para dois genes, citrato sintase (gltA) e proteína externa de membrana A (ompA), além de seqüências obtidas do gene gltA para análises de distância. Os estudos de morfologia e molecular sugerem a ausência de O. bacoti no Brasil, e a incerteza da validade de registros na América Latina.

It is unclear whether solid organ transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing severe complications and how they should be managed, also concerning immunosuppression. This is a report about the course and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in liver transplant recipients from a single center in Northwestern Italy in the period March-April 2020. Three patients who were treated at our institution are reported in detail, whereas summary data are provided for those managed at peripheral Hospitals. Presentation varied from asymptomatic to rapidly progressive respiratory failure due to bilateral interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, treatment and changes to immunosuppression were adapted to the severity of the disease. Overall mortality was 20%, whereas Covid-related mortality was 10%. Two cases of prolonged (>2 months) viral carriage were observed in two asymptomatic patients who contracted the infection in the early course after transplant. Besides depicting Covid-19 course and possible treatment scenarios in liver transplant patients, these cases are discussed in relation to the changes in our practice prompted by Covid-19 epidemic, with potential implications for other transplant programs.","Patrono, Damiano; Lupo, Francesco; Canta, Francesca; Mazza, Elena; Mirabella, Stefano; Corcione, Silvia; Tandoi, Francesco; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Romagnoli, Renato",Transpl Infect Dis,654,16

METHODS: Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ± 1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005).

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the incidence of TC in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and what is the relationship between the dose of anticoagulant therapy and the incidence of TC? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All consecutive patients referred to eight French ICUs for COVID-19 were included in this observational study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from ICU admission to day 14, including anticoagulation status and thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The effect of high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (either at intermediate or equivalent to therapeutic dose), defined using a standardized protocol of classification, was assessed using a time-varying exposure model using inverse probability of treatment weight. RESULTS: Of 538 patients included, 104 patients experienced a total of 122 TCs with an incidence of 22.7% (95% CI, 19.2%-26.3%). Pulmonary embolism accounted for 52% of the recorded TCs. High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation was associated with a significant reduced risk of TC (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99]) without increasing the risk of bleeding (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.70-1.75). INTERPRETATION: High-dose prophylactic anticoagulation is associated with a reduction in thrombotic complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients without an increased risk of hemorrhage. Randomized controlled trials comparing prophylaxis with higher doses of anticoagulants are needed to confirm these results.

This study aimed to identify the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and genes in KD and explore the molecular mechanisms underlying KD. Methods GSE68004 and GSE73464 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and genes (DEGs) in KD were identified using the criteria of p &lt; 0.05 and ;log2 (fold change) ;≥ 1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) related to KD were searched from databases. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks involving the DElncRNAs and DEGs were constructed. Results A total of 769 common upregulated, 406 common downregulated DEGs, and six DElncRNAs were identified in the KD samples. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network consisted of four miRNAs, three lncRNAs (including the upregulated PSORS1C3, LINC00999, and the downregulated SNHG5) and four DEGs (including the downregulated GATA3 and the upregulated SOD2, MAPK14, and PPARG). Validation in the GSE18606 dataset showed that intravenous immunoglobulin treatment significantly alleviated the deregulated profiles of the above RNAs in KD patients. Three ceRNA networks of LINC00999-hsa-miR-6780-SOD2, PSORS1C3-hsa-miR-216a-PPARG/MAPK14, and SNHG5-hsa-miR-132/hsa-miR-92-GATA3 were identified. Four genes were associated with functional categories, such as inflammatory response and vascular endothelial cell. Conclusions The ceRNA networks involve genes, such as SOD2, MAPK14, and PPARG, and lncRNAs, including PSORS1C3, LINC00999, and SNHG5, which might play a key role in the pathogenesis and development of KD by regulating inflammation.","Guo, Changsheng Yuanqing Hua Qian Zuanhao",PeerJ,654,16

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study conducted in an academic fertility centre. Online questionnaires were distributed between 18 April 2020 and 23 April 2020 to patients whose treatment cycle had been postponed or discontinued. The outcome measures included agreement with the reproductive society guidelines to postpone treatments; willingness to resume treatments, given the choice; patients' emotional reactions; and psychological distress level, measured by the Mental Health Inventory validated scale. A multivariate linear regression was conducted to identify factors associated with psychological distress. RESULTS: Because of the small number of male respondents, only women were included in the analysis (nâ¯=â¯181). Forty-three per cent expressed disagreement with the guidelines and 82% were willing to resume treatments, given the choice. Sadness and anxiety were the most common emotional reactions expressed towards the guidelines. In the multivariate analysis, COVID-19-related anxiety (Bâ¯=â¯0.145, Pâ¯=â¯0.04) and disagreement with treatment suspension (Bâ¯=â¯-0.44, Pâ¯=â¯0.001) were found to be significantly associated with patients' psychological distress. Background characteristics of patients did not contribute significantly to their distress. CONCLUSIONS: Suspension of fertility treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with patients' negative emotional reactions. Anxiety related to COVID-19 and disagreement with treatment suspension were found to be significantly associated with psychological distress among women undergoing fertility treatment, regardless of their background characteristics. Our findings suggest the need to monitor the mental health of patients and provide psychological support should a shutdown of fertility care re-occur.","Marom Haham, Lilach; Youngster, Michal; Kuperman Shani, Adi; Yee, Samantha; Ben-Kimhy, Reut; Medina-Artom, Tamar R; Hourvitz, Ariel; Kedem, Alon; Librach, Clifford",Reprod Biomed Online,654,33

Because the diagnostic procedure for the detection of cystic oviducts by postmortem examinations in IBV-positive replacement pullet flocks could involve the unnecessary sacrifice of numerous healthy pullets without reproductive tract anomalies, the development of a noninvasive and nonlethal diagnostic procedure would be desirable. The first objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a transcutaneous ultrasonography method to predict the presence of cystic oviducts compared to postmortem examinations in a commercial pullet flock positive for an IBV genotype Delmarva (DMV) variant. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of the same ultrasonography method to later detect false layers in the same flock in sexually mature hens by identifying the presence of an egg in the oviduct due to the presence of atretic oviducts undetectable by ultrasonography and the absence of cystic oviducts at that age. In replacement pullets, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the ultrasonography (index test) compared to the postmortem examination (reference standard test) were 73% and 91%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 67% and 93%. The ultrasonography technique showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 7.82 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.30. In sexually mature hens, the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of the ultrasonography compared to the laying status were 98%. The LR+ was 49.00 and the LR- was 0.02 when compared to the laying status. In conclusion, the ultrasonography could replace postmortem examinations to detect cystic oviducts in commercial flocks of replacement pullets previously infected with an IBV-DMV 1639 variant. Although the test accuracy of ultrasonography was excellent for the hens at production peak to identify laying and nonlaying hens based on the presence of an egg in the reproductive tract, its practicality was limited due to atretic oviducts being not detectable.","Parent, Eric; Gagnon-Francoeur, Ariane; Lanthier, Benoît; Hébert, Ghislain; Buczinski, Sébastien; Boulianne, Martine",Avian Dis,654,20

This similarity raises the question: does coronaviral infection by one create protection to others? Convalescent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) sera were tested for cross reactivity with peptides from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which shares 74% homology. Our results showed significant cross-reactivity with a peptide of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein. Sera samples of 47 validated seropositive convalescent COVID-19 patients and 40 sera samples of control patients, collected in pre-COVID time were used to establish cross-bind reactivity with the MERS-CoV peptide. Significantly stronger binding (p < 0.0001) was observed for IgG antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 patients compared to the control group. In ELISA, MERS-CoV peptide helps to discriminate post-COVID-19 populations and non-infected ones by the presence of antibodies in blood samples. This suggests that polyclonal antibodies established during SARS-CoV-2 infection can recognize and probably decrease severity of MERS-CoV and other coronaviral infections. The high homology of the spike protein domain also suggests that the opposite effect can be true: coronaviral infections produce cross-reactive antibodies effective against SARS-CoV-2. The collected data prove that despite the core HR2 region is hidden in the native viral conformation, its exposure during cell entry makes it highly immunogenic. Since inhibitory peptides to this region were previously described, this opens new possibilities in fighting coronaviral infections and developing vaccines effective even after possible viral mutations.","Rabets, Andrii; Bila, Galyna; Grytsko, Roman; Samborskyy, Markian; Rebets, Yuriy; Vari, Sandor G; Pagneux, Quentin; Barras, Alexandre; Boukherroub, Rabah; Szunerits, Sabine; Bilyy, Rostyslav",Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),654,16

Guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources, such as mechanical ventilation, during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of the severity scoring systems Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IVa (APACHE IVa), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) across four ethnicities in two large ICU databases to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. METHODS: Data from the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, built from patient episodes in the USA from 2014-15 and 2001-12, respectively, were analysed for score performance in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White people after appropriate exclusions. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups, using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for different ethnicities to assess discrimination, and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) or proxy measures to assess calibration. FINDINGS: We analysed 166â751 participants (122â919 eICU-CRD and 43â832 MIMIC-III). Although measurements of discrimination were significantly different among the groups (AUROC ranging from 0·86 to 0·89 [p=0·016] with APACHE IVa and from 0·75 to 0·77 [p=0·85] with OASIS), they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. However, measurements of calibration indicated persistent, and in some cases statistically significant, patterns of difference between Hispanic people (SMR 0·73 with APACHE IVa and 0·64 with OASIS) and Black people (0·67 and 0·68) versus Asian people (0·77 and 0·95) and White people (0·76 and 0·81). Although calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently showed a pattern of overpredicting mortality for Black people and Hispanic people. Similar results were seen using SOFA scores across the two databases. INTERPRETATION: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnicities suggest that illness severity scores reflect statistical bias in their predictions of mortality.

The study was conducted on 250 Nile tilapia. Ten fish were used to isolate the probiotic strain. Two isolates showed an in vitro inhibitory effect against pathogenic A. hydrophila. The isolate with the largest zone was identified by PCR. Sixty fish were used to test the safety of a potential probiotic. One hundred and eighty fish were used in a two-month feeding experiment. Fish were divided into 3 groups, group (1): the control, group (2): fed on potential probiotics, and group (3): fed on commercial probiotic (Organic Green&#8482;). The effects of tested products on the immune response were recorded in all groups. After one and two months of feeding experiment, blood and nonspecific immune parameters were evaluated. Disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated through challenge experiment. The histopathology of the treated groups was fully recorded in comparison with the control group. The potential probiotic based on the in vitro antimicrobial activity test was identified as P. putida using routine and gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA sequencing. During the first and the second month of experiment, there was a highly significant increase in the survival percent of the experimental fish in both treated groups with probiotics. In the first phase of the experiment, a significant increase in the haematocrit values and NBT, lysozyme activity, and phagocytic activity was seen in all treated groups in comparison with the control. The increase in the TLC was significant in the group fed with P. putida in comparison with the control group. In the second phase, a nonsignificant increase in the hematocrit values and significant increases in the NBT and phagocytic index were seen in P. putida and organic green groups in comparison with the control group. The TLC and DLC revealed nonsignificant changes in the treated groups in comparison with the control. The RLP in the groups treated with P. putida was higher than that in those treated with organic green.

This unprecedented COVID-19 viral pandemic, characterized by its enigmatic nature and bewildering spread, respects no borders and has nearly paralyzed healthcare systems throughout the world. Indeed, in the absence of specific, proven medical interventions, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed, thus limiting their ability to treat patients with non-emergent medical conditions and those awaiting elective procedures. Although it is beyond the scope of this editorial to discuss what constitutes a necessary or elective procedure, this radical change in medical practice has had an enormous impact on discontinuation of fertility care services, especially the assisted reproductive technologies (ART). It is eminently clear that reducing or discontinuing elective procedures and essential ART treatments was crucial not only to enable hospitals and medical facilities to manage (or to treat) the explosive rise in SARS-CoV-2 patients, but also to reduce disease transmission vis-à-vis various mitigating strategies-especially individual isolation and social distancing, strategies utilized effectively in China and Italy.","David, Adamson; Zev, Rosenwaks; Van Der Spuy, Zephne; Díaz Yamal, Ivonne",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,654,9

They allow for computational case studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions thereby providing an important basis for policy makers. While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged &#8805; 80 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections.

This study sought to characterize the demand for and provision of neurosurgical acute care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional observational analysis compared nonambulatory neurosurgical consult encounters during the peri-surge period (March 9 to May 31, 2020) with those during an analogous period in 2019. Outcomes included consult volume, distribution of problem types, disease severity, and rate of acute operative intervention. RESULTS: A total of 1494 neurosurgical consults were analyzed. Amidst the pandemic surge, 583 consults were seen, which was 6.4 standard deviations below the mean among analogous 2016-2019 periods (mean 873; standard deviation 45, P = 0.001). Between 2019 and 2020, the proportion of degenerative spine consults decreased in favor of spinal trauma (25.6% vs. 34% and 51.9% vs. 41.4%, P = 0.088). Among aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage cases, poor-grade (Hunt and Hess grades 4-5) presentations were more common (30% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.086). A greater proportion of pandemic era consults resulted in acute operative management, with an unchanged absolute frequency of acutely operative consults (123/583 [21.1%] vs. 120/911 [13.2%], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical consult volume during the pandemic surge hit a 5-year institutional low. Amidst vast reallocation of health care resources, demand for high-acuity nonambulatory neurosurgical care continued and proportionally increased for greater-acuity pathologies. In our continued current pandemic as well as any future situations of mass health resource reallocation, neurosurgical acute care capacities must be preserved.","Shao, Belinda; Tang, Oliver Y; Leary, Owen P; Abdulrazeq, Hael; Sastry, Rahul A; Brown, Sarah; Wilson, Ira B; Asaad, Wael F; Gokaslan, Ziya L",World neurosurgery (Online),654,33

Among the identified drugs, Baricitinib has become a keen interest for researchers because of its ability to inhibit the viral assembly by the prevention of Clarithrin associated endocytosis. We tried to explore the reasons on why Baricitinib is not an ideal option for COVID 19.","Praveen, D; Puvvada, Ranadheer Chowdary; M, Vijey Aanandhi",Int J Antimicrob Agents,654,1

We aim to evaluate the accuracy of the IgM-Shed Acute Phase Antigen (IgM-SAPA) test in the diagnosis of CChD at birth. METHODS: Two cohort studies (training and validation cohorts) were conducted in three hospitals in the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Pregnant women were screened for Chagas disease, and all infants born to seropositive mothers were followed for up to nine months to diagnose CChD. A composite reference standard was used to determine congenital infection and was based on the parallel use of microscopy, qPCR, and IgM-TESA-blot (Trypomastigote Excreted-Secreted Antigens) at birth and/or 1-month, and/or the detection of anti-Trypanosomacruzi IgG at 6- or 9- months. The diagnostic accuracy of the IgM-SAPA-test was calculated at birth against the composite reference standard. RESULTS: Adherence to the 6- or 9-month follow-up ranged from 43.8% to 59.7%. Most cases of CChD (training and validation cohort: 76.5% and 83.7%, respectively) were detected during the first month of life using the combination of microscopy, qPCR and/or IgM-TESA-blot. Results from the validation cohort showed that when only one infant sample obtained at birth was evaluated, the qPCR and the IgM-SAPA-test have similar accuracy (sensitivity: range 79.1% to 97.1%, and 76.7% to 94.3%, respectively, and specificity: 99.5%, and 92.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The IgM-SAPA-test has the potential to be implemented as an early diagnostic tool in areas that currently rely only on microscopy.","Castro-Sesquén, Yagahira E; Tinajeros, Freddy; Bern, Caryn; Galdos-Cardenas, Gerson; Malaga, Edith S; Valencia Ayala, Edward; Hjerrild, Kathryn; Clipman, Steven J; Lescano, Andrés G; Bayangos, Tabitha; Castillo, Walter; Menduiña, María Carmen; Talaat, Kawsar R; Gilman, Robert H",,654,29

Social capital has also been associated with behaviors that promote better health and reduce the impacts of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, face masking, and vaccination have all been essential in controlling contagion. These behaviors have not been uniformly adopted by communities in the United States. Using different facets of social capital to explain the differences in public behaviors among communities during pandemics is lacking. ObjectiveThis study examines the relationship among public health behavior--vaccination, face masking, and physical distancing--during COVID-19 pandemic and social capital indices in counties in the United States. MethodsWe used publicly available vaccination data as of June 2021, face masking data in July 2020, and mobility data from mobile phones movements from the end of March 2020. Then, correlation analysis was conducted with county-level social capital index and its subindices (family unity, community health, institutional health, and collective efficacy) that were obtained from the Social Capital Project by the United States Senate. ResultsWe found the social capital index and its subindices differentially correlate with different public health behaviors. Vaccination is associated with institutional health: positively with fully vaccinated population and negatively with vaccination hesitancy. Also, wearing masks negatively associates with community health, whereases reduced mobility associates with better community health. Further, residential mobility positively associates with family unity. By comparing correlation coefficients, we find that social capital and its subindices have largest effect sizes on vaccination and residential mobility. ConclusionOur results show that different facets of social capital are significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors, e.g., social distancing, face masking, and vaccination. As such, our results suggest that differential facets of social capital imply a Swiss cheese model of pandemic control planning where, e.g., institutional health and community health, provide partially overlapping behavioral benefits.","Ferwana, Ibtihal; Varshney, Lav R.",,654,27

Its sweetness is 70% that of sucrose. d-allulose is a metabolic regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, few reports concerning its effect on diabetes and related metabolic disturbances in db/db mice are available. In this study, we evaluated d-allulose's effect on hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes and inflammatory responses in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Mice were divided into normal diet, erythritol supplemented (5% w/w), and d-allulose supplemented (5% w/w) groups. Blood glucose and plasma glucagon levels and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) were significantly lower in the d-allulose group than in the normal diet group, and plasma insulin level was significantly increased. Further, d-allulose supplement significantly increased hepatic glucokinase activity and decreased hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Expression of glucose transporter 4, insulin receptor substrate 1, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha and AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 were also upregulated by d-allulose supplement in adipocyte and muscle. Finally, d-allulose effectively lowered plasma and hepatic triglyceride and free fatty acid levels, and simultaneously reduced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activity. These changes are likely attributable to suppression of hepatic fatty acid synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Notably, d-allulose also reduced pro-inflammatory adipokine and cytokine levels in plasma. Our results indicate that d-allulose is an effective sugar substitute for improving lipid and glucose metabolism.","Lee, Dayoun; Han, Youngji; Kwon, Eun-Young; Choi, Myung-Sook",Molecules (Basel),654,0

For the derivatives of the screening test results, data from individuals with a contact history who underwent nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing between July 2020 and April 2021 (6,156 participants, including 550 test-positive patients) were used. The value of Nt correlated with the weekly RT-PCR test-positive rate after close contact, prevalence of cough symptoms in test-positive individuals or in test-negative individuals, lower air temperature, lower air humidity, and higher wind speed. The weekly test-positive rate correlated with lower air humidity and higher wind speed. In cross-correlation analyses, natural environmental factors correlated with the regional epidemic status on a scale of months, whereas the airway symptoms among non-COVID-19 population affected on a scale of weeks. When applying an autoregression model to the serial data of Nt, large-scale movements of people were suggested to be another factor to influence the local epidemics on a scale of days.

Some of them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases, negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections, particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort. Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3, 2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\%\thicksim 5.0\%$ for Hubei province and $0.7\%\thicksim1.0\%$ for the region outside Hubei. We emphasize that our predictions may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data analysis is purely empirical and various assumptions are used.","Li, Ming; Chen, Jie; Deng, Youjin",,654,3

During this time hospital outpatient appointments were conducted virtually (via telephone). This project aimed to assess patients experience of Covid19 cocooning and the virtual outpatient service. Methods Patients attending an outpatient geriatric medicine service were invited to participate in this project following their routine virtual assessment. A proforma questionnaire was administered to participants contacted virtually within one week of consent. Data was anonymised, imported into excel and analysed using SPSS (chi-squared test). Results 31 patients were included, median age was 83 years. 52% were male, 25% lived alone and 52% had cognitive impairment. 77% had heard of “cocooning”, of which 79% correctly understood the term. Three-quarters stated that cocooning had negatively impacted their quality of life (QoL);anxiety, loneliness and depression were reported in 49%, 36% and 29% respectively. 39% strongly feared getting Covid19. Cognition and living status did not correlate significantly with the psychological impact of Covid19. 61% did not use modern social media, its use did not impact QoL scores (p = 0.075). 45% experienced a reduction in support services. 87% found the OPD telephone service useful and 77% reported their needs were addressed. Three-quarters favoured future virtual assessments. Conclusion One third of patients poorly understood “cocooning”.

CD8+ T cell responses were detected in almost all convalescent individuals and were directed against several structural and nonstructural target epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample and characterized by early differentiation kinetics. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response.

Using Google Trends, we inferred search trends between December 28th 2018 and December 27th 2020 for queries consisting of ""mother"", ""father"" or ""parents"" combined with each of the 11 maltreatment-related verbs used in the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child version. Raw search counts from the Google Trends data were estimated using Comscore. RESULTS: Results. Of all 33 search terms, 28 terms showed increases in counts after the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions. These findings indicate a strong increase in internet searches relating to occurrence, causes or consequences of emotional and physical maltreatment since the lockdown and call for the use of maltreatment-related queries to direct parents or children to online information and support.","Riem, Madelon; De Carli, Pietro; Guo, Jing; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian; van IJzendoorn, Marinus; Lodder, Paul",,654,21

We aimed to verify whether there is an association between the OHCA difference compared with 2019 and the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all the consecutive OHCAs which occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantova in the 2 months following the first documented case of COVID-19 in the Lombardia Region and compared them with those which occurred in the same time frame in 2019. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 from 21 February to 20 April 2020 in the study territory was 956 COVID-19/100 000 inhabitants and the cumulative incidence of OHCA was 21 cases/100 000 inhabitants, with a 52% increase as compared with 2019 (490 OHCAs in 2020 vs. 321 in 2019). A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cumulative incidence of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants both for the overall territory (&#961; 0.87, P < 0.001) and for each province separately (Lodi: &#961; 0.98, P < 0.001; Cremona: &#961; 0.98, P < 0.001; Pavia: &#961; 0.87, P < 0.001; Mantova: &#961; 0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The increase in OHCAs in 2020 is significantly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and is coupled with a reduction in short-term outcome.

(Special Issue: COVID-19 and orthopaedics.),18.467937,4.625303,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine whether the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Carlucci, Philip M; Zervou, Fainareti N; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Rebick, Gabriel; Klein, Elizabeth; Reich, Jenna; Jones, Simon; Rahimian, Joseph",,654,24

This strongly implies global transmission occurred before the lockdown of China. However, the initial source's transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 remain obscure and controversial. Research data suggest bat (RaTG13) and pangolin carried CoV were the proximal source of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used systematic phylogenetic analysis of Coronavirinae subfamily along with wild type human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains. The key residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and O-linked glycan were compared. SARS-CoV-2 strains were clustered with RaTG13 (97.41% identity), Pangolin-CoV (92.22% identity) and Bat-SL-CoV (80.36% identity), forms a new clade-2 in lineage B of beta-CoV. The alignments of RBD contact residues to ACE2 justified? Those SARS-CoV-2 strains sequences were 100% identical by each other, significantly varied in RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic cleavage site with an inserted sequence of PRRA compared to RaTG13 and only PRR to pangolin.

Capacity needs in cities in China could inform the planning of local health care resources. Objectives: To describe and compare the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2 cities in China to estimate the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if an outbreak equivalent to that in Wuhan occurs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Exposures: Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of critical and severe patient-days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 19â¯425 patients (24.5 per 10â¯000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10â¯000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10â¯000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10â¯000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence. Conclusions and Relevance: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local health care systems in US cities.","Li, Ruoran; Rivers, Caitlin; Tan, Qi; Murray, Megan B; Toner, Eric; Lipsitch, Marc",JAMA Netw Open,654,16

A cytokine storm in some patients after infection contributes to this mortality. In addition to lungs, the intestine is targeted during COVID-19 infection. The intestinal membrane serves as a barrier to prevent leakage of microorganisms and their products into the bloodstream; however, dietary fats can affect the gut microbiome and may increase intestinal permeability. In obese or diabetic individuals, there is an increase in the abundance of either Gram-negative bacteria in the gut or their product, endotoxin, in systemic circulation. We speculate that when the COVID-19 infection localizes in the intestine and when the permeability properties of the intestinal membrane are compromised, an inflammatory response is generated when proinflammatory endotoxin, produced by resident Gram-negative bacteria, leaks into the systemic circulation. This review discusses conditions contributing to inflammation that are triggered by microbially derived factors from the gut.","Onishi, J C; Häggblom, M M; Shapses, S A",mBio (Online),654,1

Life satisfaction can be understood as the extent to which individuals' experiences in a host country help them achieve their personal goals and satisfy their expectations regarding acculturation. This paper examines past research, especially international literature, to provide an overview of factors that may influence the life satisfaction of international students in countries other than their own, and looks particularly at those matters that may also affect overseas students in China. Comparisons are made between variables identified in general and those in Asia, and specifically China.

Advanced glycation end products are produced under the influence of oxidative stress and in the skin (measured by skin autofluorescence [SAF]) serve as marker for cumulative oxidative stress. Aim of study was to determine whether SAF is associated with presence of affective disorders. METHODS: Participants in the Lifelines cohort study who had completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for affective disorders and a SAF-measurement were included. Cross-sectional associations between SAF and presence of the following psychiatric disorders were investigated through logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, cardiometabolic parameters, and somatic morbidities: major depressive disorder, dysthymia, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or social phobia. RESULTS: Of 81,041 included participants (41.7% male, aged 18-91 years), 6676 (8.2%) were cases with an affective disorder. SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders (OR=1.09 [95%CI 1.07-1.12], P<.001 adjusted for sociodemographic factors). Association with major depressive disorder was strongest and significant after adjustment for all confounders (OR=1.31 [95%CI 1.25-1.36], P<.001 in the crude model; OR=1.12 [95%CI 1.07-1.17], P<.001 in the fully adjusted model). For other disorders, associations lost significance after adjustment for cardiometabolic parameters and somatic morbidities. LIMITATIONS: Persons of non-Western descent and severely (mentally or physically) ill individuals were underrepresented. CONCLUSIONS: SAF was associated with presence of affective disorders, suggesting a link between these disorders and cumulative oxidative stress. For major depressive disorder, this association was strongest and independent of sociodemographic, cardiometabolic factors, and somatic morbidities.","Hagen, Julia M; Sutterland, Arjen L; da Fonseca Pereira de Sousa, Paulo A L; Schirmbeck, Frederike; Cohn, Danny M; Lok, Anja; Tan, Hanno L; Zwinderman, Aeilko H; de Haan, Lieuwe",J Affect Disord,654,18

However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY: Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.","Merchant, Rutvij; Torous, John; Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Naslund, John A",Curr Opin Psychiatry,654,2

We aimed to explore reflections of these unexpected changes to newly diagnosed cancer patients. METHOD: We searched the 2 months after the index case of our country. The first admission day and the first day of intravenous treatment of newly diagnosed patients were recorded. RESULTS: In the 60 days measured during the pandemic, the total number of patients on polyclinics was 159/weekdays, and the total applied chemotherapy cycles were 276/week. For comparison, the total numbers in the previous year were 267/weekday and 363/week for polyclinic and applied chemotherapy cycles, respectively. The total number of newly admitted patients in 2020 was 283. For comparison, the number of new patients in the same 60-day period in 2019 was 495. Patients who were admitted for adjuvant treatment required a median of 8 days for the first course, those who were admitted for neoadjuvant treatment required 12 days, and metastatic patients required 14 days; there were no significant differences between treatment types (p = 0.233). However, the median treatment time was 11.5 and 17 days, in 2020 and in 2019, respectively. A significant difference was observed between the 2 groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The effective shift of workers and accurate regulations have not resulted in apparent delays in patient care. While a decrease in the number of patients has detected, faster healthcare service was introduced to newly diagnosed patients. The reason for the decrease in the number of patients should be investigated with new studies.","Ak, Naziye; Vatansever, Sezai",Chemotherapy,654,24

We aim to evaluate frequency and quality of facemask use in general populations. METHODS: A multi-site observational study was carried out from June to July 2020 in the west of France. An observer was positioned at a predetermined place, facing a landmark, and all individual passing between the observer and the landmark were included. The observer collected information on facemask use (type, quality of positioning), location and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 3354 observations were recorded. A facemask was worn by 56.4% (n = 1892) of individuals, including surgical facemasks (56.8%, n = 1075) and cloth masks (43.2%, n = 817). The facemask was correctly positioned in 75.2% (n = 1422) of cases. The factors independently associated with wearing a facemask were being indoors (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.28-3.19), being in a mandatory area (aOR, 6.92; 95% CI 5-9.7), female gender (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI 1.54-2.04), age 41-65 years (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI 1.43-2.02) and age > 65 years (aOR, 2.28; 95% CI 1.83-2.85). The factors independently associated with correct mask position were rural location (aOR, 1.38; 95% CI 1.07-1.79), being in an indoor area (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI 1.49-2.3), use of clothmask (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI 1.23-1.91), and age > 40 years (aOR, 1.75 95%CI 1.37-2.23). CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency and quality of facemask wearing remained low in the community setting. Young people in general, and men in particular, represent the priority targets for information campaigns. Simplifying the rules to require universal mandatory facemasking seemed to be the best approach for health authorities.","Deschanvres, Colin; Haudebourg, Thomas; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Blanckaert, Karine; Boutoille, David; Lucet, Jean-Christophe; Birgand, Gabriel",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,654,1

Here we discovered that both thiolated and non-thiolated DNA/RNA can be efficiently attached to AuNPs to achieve high-stable spherical nucleic acid (SNA) within minutes under a domestic microwave (MW)-assisted heating-dry circumstance. Further studies showed that for non-thiolated DNA/RNA the conjugation is poly (T/U) tag dependent. Spectroscopy, test strip hybridization, and loading counting experiments indicate that low-affinity poly (T/U) tag mediates the formation of a standing-up conformation, which is distributed in the outer layer of such a SNA structure. In further applications study, CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA (135 bp), RNA from Nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 (1279 bp), and rolling circle amplification (RCA) DNA products (over 1000 bp) could be successfully attached on AuNPs, which overcomes the routine methods in long-chain nucleic acid-AuNP conjugation, exhibiting great promise in novel biosensing and nucleic acids delivery strategy.

However, epidemiologically these outbreaks are not well defined. We aimed to define such outbreaks in ACFs by systematically reviewing literature published during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched 11 bibliographic databases for literature published on COVID-19 in ACFs between December 2019 and September 2020. Original studies reporting extractable epidemiological data as part of outbreak investigations or non-outbreak surveillance of ACFs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020211424. Findings: We identified 5,148 publications and selected 49 studies from four continents reporting data on 214,380 residents in 8,502 ACFs with 25,567 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Aged care residents form a distinct vulnerable population with single-facility attack rates of 45% [95% CI 32-58%] and case fatality rates of 23% [95% CI 18-28%]. Of the cases, 31% [95% CI 28-34%] were asymptomatic. The rate of hospitalization amongst residents was 37% [95% CI 35-39%]. Data from 21 outbreaks identified a resident as the index case in 58% of outbreaks and a staff member in 42%. Findings from the included studies were heterogeneous and of low to moderate quality in risk of bias assessment. Interpretation: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases. Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into ACFs is key, and both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of paramount importance.

Our review focuses on the viral entry mechanisms to give a better understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the eye. We highlighted findings that give evidence for multiple potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface. Additionally, we focused on data concerning the detection of viral RNA and its spike protein in the various ocular tissues from patients. However, the expression level seemed to be relatively low compared to the respiratory tissues as a result of a unique environment surrounding the ocular surface and the innate immune response of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, our review suggests the ocular surface as a potential route for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and as a result of this study we strongly recommend the protection of the eyes for ophthalmologists and patients at risk.","Kitazawa, Koji; Deinhardt-Emmer, Stefanie; Inomata, Takenori; Deshpande, Sharvari; Sotozono, Chie",,654,1

Then, we consider a Bayesian setting to implement our model. We consider hierarchical priors using multivariate normal and inverse Wishart distributions, and establish the posterior consistency. Based on this result and following appropriate Gibbs sampling algorithms, we can infer about aggregate data. The methodology is illustrated in detail with two real life applications, in the contexts of political election and sales forecasting.

Forcibly displaced people and migrant populations face particular vulnerabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which leaves them at further risk of developing TB. They inhabit environments where measures such as ""physical distancing"" are impossible to realize and where facilities like camps and informal temporary settlements can easily become sites of rapid disease transmission. In this viewpoint we utilize three case studies-from Peru, South Africa, and Syria-to illustrate the lived experience of forced migration and mobile populations, and the impact of COVID-19 on TB among these populations. We discuss the dual pandemics of TB and COVID-19 in the context of migration through a syndemic lens, to systematically address the upstream social, economic, structural and political factors that - in often deleterious dynamics - foster increased vulnerabilities and risk. Addressing TB, COVID-19 and migration from a syndemic perspective, not only draws systematic attention to comorbidity and the relevance of social and structural context, but also helps to find solutions: the true reality of syndemic interactions can only be fully understood by considering a particular population and bio- social context, and ensuring that they receive the comprehensive care that they need. It also provides avenues for strengthening and expanding the existing infrastructure for TB care to tackle both COVID-19 and TB in migrants and refugees in an integrated and synergistic manner.","Knipper, Michael; Sedas, Ana Cristina; Keshavjee, Salmaan; Abbara, Aula; Almhawish, Naser; Alashawi, Hani; Lecca, Leonid; Wilson, Michael; Zumla, Almuddin; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Orcutt, Miriam",Int. j. infect. dis,654,24

Here, we show that upon infection of human cells, Campylobacter jejuni secretes its Cas9 (CjeCas9) nuclease into their cytoplasm. Next, a native nuclear localization signal enables CjeCas9 nuclear entry, where it catalyzes metal-dependent nonspecific DNA cleavage leading to cell death. Compared to CjeCas9, native Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense. Moreover, these unique catalytic features may therefore make CjeCas9 less suitable for genome editing applications.","Saha, Chinmoy; Mohanraju, Prarthana; Stubbs, Andrew; Dugar, Gaurav; Hoogstrate, Youri; Kremers, Gert-Jan; van Cappellen, Wiggert A; Horst-Kreft, Deborah; Laffeber, Charlie; Lebbink, Joyce H G; Bruens, Serena; Gaskin, Duncan; Beerens, Dior; Klunder, Maarten; Joosten, Rob; Demmers, Jeroen A A; van Gent, Dik; Mouton, Johan W; van der Spek, Peter J; van der Oost, John; van Baarlen, Peter; Louwen, Rogier",Sci.

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event. Psychological interventions to counteract short- and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary.","Forte, G.; Favieri, F.; Tambelli, R.; Casagrande, M.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,654,21

In this cross-section study we evaluated COVID-19 seroprevalence in military police forces of 10 major cities in Rio Grande do Sul, South of Brazil. METHODS: Sampling was randomly performed in clusters, in respect to the number of professionals at service per city and military unit. Research subjects were evaluated on July 23, 2020 (first wave peak in Brazil). Clinical information was obtained, and venous blood was taken for ELISA testing (IgA, and IgG antibodies). Sample size consisted of 1,592 military workers (33.6% of study population). They were mostly man (81.2%) and young (median 34 years-old). Most had been asymptomatic (75.3%) during pandemic, and 27.5% reported close contact with COVID-19 cases (after a median time of 21 days). Antibodies were detected in 3.3% of the participants, mostly IgA (2.7%), and IgG (1.7%). After 3 weeks, 66.7% of IgA and IgG results turned negative, in addition to 78.3% and 100% of borderline IgA and IgG results, respectively. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of COVID-19 amongst military police was at least 3.4 higher than the findings of other studies performed in the general population, in the same cities and dates. Most detectable antibodies were of IgA class, which implies recent exposure.

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter AEC. We determined what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and COPD. METHODS: We obtained lower AEC from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89 years, Newcastle (n = 115) and Perth (n = 30), Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n = 37) and COPD (n = 38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was assessed by qPCR, and protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AEC. RESULTS: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (P = 0.03) and male sex (P = 0.03), but not with pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma patients (P = 0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in patients with asthma (P = 0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface, was increased (P = 0.02). ACE2 protein expression was also reduced in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients. CONCLUSION: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.","Wark, Peter A B; Pathinayake, Prabuddha S; Kaiko, Gerard; Nichol, Kristy; Ali, Ayesha; Chen, Ling; Sutanto, Erika N; Garratt, Luke W; Sohal, Sukhwinder S; Lu, Wenying; Eapen, Mathew S; Oldmeadow, Christopher; Bartlett, Nathan; Reid, Andrew; Veerati, Punnam; Hsu, Alan C-Y; Looi, Kevin; Iosifidis, Thomas; Stick, Stephen M; Hansbro, Philip M; Kicic, Anthony",Respirol.

However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health.

However, the very basis of spatial concentration and formation of cities is presence of agglomeration economies, benefits accruing to economic agents operating in cities. Presence of these agglomeration benefits in local labour markets manifests themselves in the form of an upward sloping wage curve in urban areas. We estimate the upward sloping wage curve for various size classes of cities in Indian economy and establish the presence of positive returns to occupation and industry concentration at urban locations. Controlling for worker-specific characteristics influencing wages, we establish that higher the share of an industry or an occupation in local employment as compared to national economy, the desirability of firms to pay higher wages increases. For casual labourers, occupational concentration results in higher wages. However, impact of industry concentration varies across sectors. Results supporting presence of upward sloping urban wage curve, therefore, endorse policies to correct the market failure in cities and promote migration as a desirable process.JEL Classification Codes: J2, R2","Agarwalla, Astha D’Souza Errol",The Indian Economic Journal,654,4

The role of perception can be relevant in exploring effects and pollution control actions. The purpose of this study was to explore studies that analyse people's perception, together with the measurement of air pollution, in order to elucidate the relationship between them. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In March 2020, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were explored in an attempt to search for studies published from 2000 to 2020. The review included 38 studies, most of which were conducted in China (n = 13) and the United States (n = 11) and published over the last four years (n = 26). Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n = 24) or dispersion models (n = 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research.","Cori, Liliana; Donzelli, Gabriele; Gorini, Francesca; Bianchi, Fabrizio; Curzio, Olivia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),654,21

This study aimed to evaluate postdischarge SARS-CoV-2 status of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy that, at birth, were negative to SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study of neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Seven pregnant women with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection have been evaluated in our institution. One woman had a spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks of gestational age, four women recovered and are still in follow-up, and two women delivered. Two newborns were enrolled in the study. At birth and 3 days of life, newborns were negative to SARS-CoV-2. At 2-week follow-up, one newborn tested positive although asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy, since they remain at risk of contracting the infection in the early period of life and long-term consequences are still unknown. KEY POINTS: · Newborns to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy can acquire the infection later after birth.. · Newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy need a long-term follow-up, even if they tested negative at birth.. · Specific guidelines for the long-term follow-up of newborns to mothers with COVID-19 in pregnancy are needed..","Buonsenso, Danilo; Costa, Simonetta; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Cattani, Paola; Posteraro, Brunella; Marchetti, Simona; Carducci, Brigida; Lanzone, Antonio; Tamburrini, Enrica; Vento, Giovanni; Valentini, Piero",Am J Perinatol,654,16

Though all nations of the world have been affected by this disease, there have been marked cross-national variations in prevalence, severity and mortality rates. Various explanations, based on demographic, social and climatic factors, have been suggested to account for this variability, but these remain unverified to date. Based on recent research findings suggesting that human enterocytes may serve as a point of entry for SARS-CoV-2, leading to intestinal viral replication, this paper puts forward the hypothesis that prior intestinal infection with coronaviruses, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, may moderate this process and minimize the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by evidence on the gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and related infections, on the geographical patterns observed in the variability of COVID-19 mortality, and on the occurrence and geographical distribution of outbreaks of diarrheal disease, as well as asymptomatic infection, with human coronaviruses as verified by direct or serological testing. Preliminary supporting evidence based on national and international health statistics is presented, along with suggestions on more robust methods by which this hypothesis may be tested. If the proposal put forth in this paper can be confirmed either wholly or in part, it would have significant implications in terms of strategies aimed at minimizing the severity of COVID-19 in a clinical setting.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Med Hypotheses,654,1

By July 1st, the pandemic's effects on global emissions diminished as lockdown restrictions relaxed and some economic activities restarted, especially in China and several European countries, but substantial differences persist between countries, with continuing emission declines in the U.S. where coronavirus cases are still increasing substantially.","Liu, Zhu; Ciais, Philippe; Deng, Zhu; Lei, Ruixue; Davis, Steven J; Feng, Sha; Zheng, Bo; Cui, Duo; Dou, Xinyu; Zhu, Biqing; Guo, Rui; Ke, Piyu; Sun, Taochun; Lu, Chenxi; He, Pan; Wang, Yuan; Yue, Xu; Wang, Yilong; Lei, Yadong; Zhou, Hao; Cai, Zhaonan; Wu, Yuhui; Guo, Runtao; Han, Tingxuan; Xue, Jinjun; Boucher, Olivier; Boucher, Eulalie; Chevallier, Frédéric; Tanaka, Katsumasa; Wei, Yiming; Zhong, Haiwang; Kang, Chongqing; Zhang, Ning; Chen, Bin; Xi, Fengming; Liu, Miaomiao; Bréon, François-Marie; Lu, Yonglong; Zhang, Qiang; Guan, Dabo; Gong, Peng; Kammen, Daniel M; He, Kebin; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim",Nat Commun,654,21

OBJECTIVE: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. SETTING: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. METHODS: Regression was used to find the relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2 = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature is on SARS-CoV-2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase is associated with a 1% decrease-and a one degree decrease could be associated with a 3.7% increase-in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. This model of the effect of decreasing temperatures can only be verified over time as the pandemic proceeds through colder months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.","Kaplin, Adam; Junker, Caesar; Kumar, Anupama; Ribeiro, Mary Anne; Yu, Eileen; Wang, Michael; Smith, Ted; Rai, Shesh N; Bhatnagar, Aruni",PLoS One,654,20

The primary aim of CEST was to produce and sustain the best available COVID‐19 evidence to facilitate decision‐making in Saskatchewan, Canada. To achieve this objective, four provincial organizations partnered to establish a single, data‐driven system.The CEST partnership was driven by COVID‐19 questions from Emergency Operational Committee (EOC) of the Saskatchewan Health Authority. CEST included three processes: (a) clarifying the nature and priority of COVID‐19 policy and clinical questions;(b) providing Rapid Reviews (RRR) and Evidence Search Reports (ESR);and (c) seeking the requestors' evaluation of the product. A web‐based repository, including a dashboard and database, was designed to house ESRs and RRRs and offered a common platform for clinicians, academics, leaders, and policymakers to find COVID‐19 evidence.In CEST's first year, 114 clinical and policy questions have been posed resulting in 135 ESRs and 108 RRRs. While most questions (41.3%) originated with the EOC, several other teams were assembled to address a myriad of questions related to areas such as long‐term care, public health and prevention, infectious diseases, personal protective equipment, vulnerable populations, and Indigenous health. Initial challenges were mobilization of diverse partners and teams, remote work, lack of public access, and quality of emerging COVID‐19 literature. Current challenges indicate the need for institutional commitment for CEST sustainability. Despite these challenges, the CEST provided the Saskatchewan LHS with a template for successful collaboration.The urgency of COVID‐19 pandemic and the implementation of the CEST served to catalyze collaboration between different levels of a Saskatchewan LHS.

Specifically, given a dataset of empirical measures, the likelihood of the first digit of any number being 1 is â¼30 %, â¼18 % for 2, 12.5 % for 3 and so on, with a decreasing probability all the way to number 9. If the digits were distributed uniformly, all the numbers 1 through 9 would have the same probability to appear as the first digit in any given empirical random measurement. However, this is not the case, as this law defies common sense and seems to apply seamlessly to large data. The use of omics technologies and, in particular, metabolomics has generated a wealth of big data in the field of transfusion medicine. In the present meta-analysis, we focused on previous big data from metabolomics studies of relevance to transfusion medicine: one on the quality of stored red blood cells, one on the phenotypes of transfusion recipients, i.e. trauma patients suffering from trauma and hemorrhage, and one of relevance to the 2020 SARS-COV-2 global pandemic. We show that metabolomics data follow a Benford's law distribution, an observation that could be relevant for future application of the ""law of anomalous numbers"" in the field of quality control processes in transfusion medicine.","D039,; Alessandro, Angelo",Transfus Apher Sci,654,26

We examined the degree to which care has moved to remote approaches, eliciting clinician and patient perspectives on what is appropriate for ongoing remote delivery. METHODS: Using an online research platform, we conducted a survey and consensus-building process involving clinicians and patients with COPD. RESULTS: Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52, 95%), reinforce smoking cessation (n=46, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%), providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%), reinforcing smoking cessation (81%), deciding whether patients should seek in-person care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%). CONCLUSION: Adoption of remote care delivery appears high, with many care activities partially or completely delivered remotely. Our work identifies strengths and limitations of remote care delivery.","Wu, Frances; Burt, Jenni; Chowdhury, Teena; Fitzpatrick, Raymond; Martin, Graham; van der Scheer, Jan W; Hurst, John R",,654,2

Adjusted crude CFR measures can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated the COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the SAARC countries. This study estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for these countries. Moreover, we assessed the crude CFR between genders and across age groups and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to October 9, we implemented a statistical method to remove the delay between disease onset and outcome bias, and due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%-50%) bias in crude CFR. We found that Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.708% to 0.290%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.767% to 0.296% and further underreporting adjusted CFR varied from 1.096% to 0.083%. Furthermore, the crude CFRs for men were significantly higher than that of women in Afghanistan (4.034% vs. 2.992%) and Bangladesh (1.739% vs. 1.337%) whereas the opposite was observed in Maldives (0.284% vs. 0.390%), Nepal (0.006% vs. 0.007%), and Pakistan (2.057% vs. 2.080%). Besides, older age groups had higher risks of death. Moreover, crude CFR increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR.","Shah, Md Rafil Tazir; Ahammed, Tanvir; Anjum, Aniqua; Chowdhury, Anisa Ahmed; Suchana, Afroza Jannat",,654,26

However, few studies have examined the effect of local face mask policies on the pandemic. In this study, we developed a dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in New York City (NYC), which was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. We used data on daily and cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to calibrate and validate our model.

Rescue PCI is generally thought to have worse outcomes than PPCI in STEMI. We aimed to determine short- and long-term outcomes of patients with rescue PCI versus PPCI for treatment of STEMI. Methods and results: Patients admitted with STEMI (excluding out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) within the Melbourne Interventional Group (MIG) registry between 2005 and 2018 treated with either rescue PCI or PPCI were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. Comparison of 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and long-term mortality between the two groups was performed. There were 558 patients (7.1%) with rescue PCI and 7271 with PPCI. 30-day all-cause mortality (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 5%, p = 0.47) and MACE (rescue PCI 10.3% vs. PPCI 8.9%, p = 0.26) rates were similar between the two groups. Rates of in-hospital major bleeding (rescue PCI 6% vs. PPCI 3.4%, p = 0.002) and 30-day stroke (rescue PCI 2.2% vs. PPCI 0.8%, p < 0.001) were higher following rescue PCI. The odds ratio for haemorrhagic stroke in the rescue PCI group was 10.3. Long-term mortality was not significantly different between the groups (rescue PCI 20% vs. PPCI 19%, p = 0.33). Conclusions: With contemporary interventional techniques and medical therapy, rescue PCI remains a valuable strategy for treating patients with failed fibrinolysis where PPCI is unavailable and it has been suggested in extenuating circumstances where alternative revascularisation strategies are considered.","Fernando, Himawan; Dinh, Diem; Duffy, Stephen J; Brennan, Angela; Sharma, Anand; Clark, David; Ajani, Andrew; Freeman, Melanie; Peter, Karlheinz; Stub, Dion; Hiew, Chin; Reid, Christopher M; Oqueli, Ernesto",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,654,20

It is possible that the housing conditions in which children and their families experienced the confinement, and the adoption of healthy behaviors, may have followed unequal patterns. The aim was to describe social inequalities in housing conditions and in health-related behaviors among children during the lockdown in Spain. This cross-sectional study was based on data from an online survey collecting information on the child population (3-12 years) living in Spain (n = 10,765). The outcome variables used were several housing conditions and health-related behaviors. The socioeconomic variables used were financial difficulties and parents' educational level. Crude prevalence and prevalence ratios estimated using Poisson models were calculated. During lockdown, children from families with low educational levels and financial difficulties not only tended to live in poor housing conditions, but were also exposed to negative health determinants such as noise and tobacco smoke; they took less physical exercise, had a poorer diet, spent more time in front of screens and had less social contact. A notable social gradient was found in most of the variables analyzed. The results point to the need to incorporate the perspective of equity in the adoption of policies in order to avoid the increase of pre-existing social inequalities in the context of a pandemic.","González-Rábago, Yolanda; Cabezas-Rodríguez, Andrea; Martín, Unai",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),654,3
379325,379325,379325,The Disproportional Impact of COVID-19 on African Americans,18.337648,4.3422585,2020,"During the on-going COVID-19 pandemic a number of key public health services have been severely impacted. These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID-19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID-19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID-19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in 'clean' sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale-up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase.

National Governments responded to the global crisis by implementing mobility restrictions to slow down the spread of the virus. To assess the impact of those policies on human mobility, we perform a massive comparative analysis on geolocalized data from 13 M Facebook users in France, Italy, and the UK. We find that lockdown generally affects national mobility efficiency and smallworldness-i.e., a substantial reduction of long-range connections in favor of local paths. The impact, however, differs among nations according to their mobility infrastructure. We find that mobility is more concentrated in France and UK and more distributed in Italy. In this paper we provide a framework to quantify the substantial impact of the mobility restrictions. We introduce a percolation model mimicking mobility network disruption and find that node persistence in the percolation process is significantly correlated with the economic and demographic characteristics of countries: areas showing higher resilience to mobility disruptions are those where Value Added per Capita and Population Density are high. Our methods and findings provide important insights to enhance preparedness for global critical events and to incorporate resilience as a relevant dimension to estimate the socio-economic consequences of mobility restriction policies.","Galeazzi, Alessandro; Cinelli, Matteo; Bonaccorsi, Giovanni; Pierri, Francesco; Schmidt, Ana Lucia; Scala, Antonio; Pammolli, Fabio; Quattrociocchi, Walter",Sci Rep,654,1

The better frontline personnel understand the customer, the better the service they can provide. As human emotions generate certain (unintentional) bodily reactions, such as increase in heart rate, sweating, dilation, blushing and paling, which are measurable, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can interpret these signals. Great progress has been made in recent years to automatically detect basic emotions like joy, anger etc. Complex emotions, consisting of multiple interdependent basic emotions, are more difficult to identify. One complex emotion which is of great interest to the service industry is difficult to detect: whether a customer is telling the truth or just a story. This research presents an AI-method for capturing and sensing emotional data. With an accuracy of around 98 %, the best trained model was able to detect whether a participant of a debating challenge was arguing for or against her/his conviction, using speech analysis. The data set was collected in an experimental setting with 40 participants. The findings are applicable to a wide range of service processes and specifically useful for all customer interactions that take place via telephone. The algorithm presented can be applied in any situation where it is helpful for the agent to know whether a customer is speaking to her/his conviction. This could, for example, lead to a reduction in doubtful insurance claims, or untruthful statements in job interviews. This would not only reduce operational losses for service companies, but also encourage customers to be more truthful.","Thaler, Fabian; Fausser, Stefan; Gewald, Heiko",,654,29

This study aims to model the interactions in the population by means of a complex network and to shed some light on the effectiveness of localised control measures in Italy in relation to the school opening in mid-September. The formulation of an epidemiological predictive model is given: the advantage of using this model lies in that it discriminates between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases of COVID-19 as the interactions with these two categories of infected individuals are captured separately, allowing for a study on the impact of asymptomatic cases. This model is then extended to a structured nonhomogeneous version by means of the Watts-Strogatz complex network, which is adopted widely to model societal interactions as it holds the small world property. Finally, a case study on the situation in Italy is given: first the homogeneous model is used to compare the official data with the data of the recent seroprevalence study from Istat; second, in view of the return to school in mid-September, a study at regional level is conducted. The results of this study highlight the importance of coordinating the deployment of appropriate control measures that take into account the role of asymptomatic infections, especially in younger individuals, and inter-regional connectivity in Italy.","Stella, Leonardo; Mart'inez, Alejandro Pinel; Bauso, Dario; Colaneri, Patrizio",,654,1

AIM OF THE STUDY: our retrospective study aimed to assess the widespread use of telemedicine in terms of feasibility and safety related to adverse events, a crucial experience which will make it possible to predict any effective use of such a method in patients with hematological disorders even after the end of the Covid-19 emergency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the Day Hospital clinic, from 8 March to 31 May 2020, an outpatient group received 3828 medical teleconsultations and 11,484 additional contacts following the first examination; each patient examined through the telematic method required an average of three supplementary contacts via e-mail or telephone. RESULTS: The follow-up lasted 145 days, and all the events that occurred were monitored. In total, we recorded 16 clinical adverse events, 5 of which classified as major events, and 11 as minor events. CONCLUSION: The 3828 telematic clinical examinations and the 11,484 additional contacts following the first examination carried out by the onco-haematology UOC of Tor Vergata Hospital, proved how telemedicine, albeit in its basic form, was a key tool in facing the sanitary emergency caused by the sudden spread of Covid-19. An experience that can be considered reliable enough to be replicated in possible post-Covid-19 emergencies. From a medical forensic point of view, the main issues to consider are informed consent, personal data management and professional responsibility profiles.","Postorino, Massimiliano; Treglia, Michele; Giammatteo, Jacopo; Pallocci, Margherita; Petroni, Giulia; Quintavalle, Giuseppe; Picchioni, Ombretta; Cantonetti, Maria; Marsella, Luigi Tonino",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),654,1

Background: The corona pandemic, caused by the novel viral disease COVID-19, has led to excessive strain in health professionals whose general occupational situation in itself is associated with high levels of stress. So far, there is no quantitative data on the stress experience caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in German health professionals and on the consequences of this experience for their commitment to work. METHOD: With a cross-sectional design, German health professionals were asked about their stress experience, health concerns and work commitment. The snapshot survey used self-developed questions plus items of a validated scale measuring work engagement. A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited through social media. The E-Survey reached 1168 valid cases, the majority of which were nurses (80.4 %, n = 855). RESULTS: The evaluation shows that health professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients show higher stress levels than participants with no contact and that their main concern is about the health of relatives, friends and family. In addition, it was found that the participants' work commitment decreased parallel to the increase in pandemic-related stress. DISCUSSION: The study shows significant correlations between work demands, stress experience and work engagement. In contrast to earlier studies, the results for work engagement in the sample are relatively low. There is a growing number of international recommendations for reducing work-related stress factors in a pandemic which should now be implemented in Germany on a large scale.

The snapshot survey used self-developed questions plus items of a validated scale measuring work engagement. A convenience sample of health professionals was recruited through social media. The E-Survey reached 1168 valid cases, the majority of which were nurses (80.4 %, n = 855). RESULTS: The evaluation shows that health professionals in direct contact with COVID-19 patients show higher stress levels than participants with no contact and that their main concern is about the health of relatives, friends and family. In addition, it was found that the participants' work commitment decreased parallel to the increase in pandemic-related stress. DISCUSSION: The study shows significant correlations between work demands, stress experience and work engagement. In contrast to earlier studies, the results for work engagement in the sample are relatively low. There is a growing number of international recommendations for reducing work-related stress factors in a pandemic which should now be implemented in Germany on a large scale. These include, amongst others, pandemic specific catalogues of prevention measures and the creation of a blame-free work environment.","Wildgruber, Domenika; Frey, Jana; Seer, Max; Pinther, Kristina; Koob, Clemens; Reuschenbach, Bernd",Pflege,654,26

METHODS: Chest CTs of 61 consecutive cases of COVID-19 disease that attended in our emergency department (ED) were reviewed. Three groups of patients classified according to the short-term follow-up were compared: (1) early-discharged from ED, (2) hospitalized on regular wards, and (3) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). CT findings were also correlated with clinical and laboratorial features associated with severe disease. RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (IQR 39-63) with male predominance (60.7%). Most of the patients that did not require hospitalization had parenchymal involvement of less than 25% on CT (84.6%). Among hospitalized patients, interlobular septal thickening and extensive lung disease (> 50% of parenchyma) were significantly more frequent in ICU-admitted patients (P = 0.018 and P = 0.043, respectively). Interlobular septal thickening also correlated with longer ICU stay (P = 0.018). Low oxygen saturation (SpO2 &#8804; 93%) was associated with septal thickening (P = 0.004), diffuse distribution (P = 0.016), and pleural effusion (P = 0.037) on CT. All patients with > 50% of parenchymal involvement showed SpO2 &#8804; 93%. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (> 5.0 mg/dL) correlated with consolidation (P = 0.002), septal thickening (P = 0.018), diffuse distribution (P = 0.020), and more extensive parenchymal involvement (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Interlobular septal thickening on CT was associated with ICU admission and longer stay on ICU. Diffuse distribution, septal thickening, and more extensive lung involvement correlated with lower SpO2 and higher CRP levels. Patients that needed hospitalization and ICU admission presented more extensive lung disease on CT.","Barbosa, Camila Silva; Chaves, Guilherme Wilson Otaviano Garcia; de Oliveira, Camila Vilela; Bachion, Guilherme Hipolito; Chi, Chang Kai; Cerri, Giovanni Guido; Lima, Thais Carneiro; Lee, Hye Ju",Emerg Radiol,654,16

We performed anticoronavirus immunoglobulin G profiling of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to better define their underlying humoral response. Design: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days to measure immunoglobulin G with a research multiplex assay against four severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 proteins/subunits and against all six additionally known human coronaviruses. Setting: Tertiary care ICU and academic laboratory. Subjects: ICU patients suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had blood collected until either polymerase chain reaction testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until death or discharge if the patient tested polymerase chain reaction positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). Interventions: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age- and sex-matched healthy controls and ICU patients who were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients had greater body mass indexes, presented with bilateral pneumonias more frequently, and suffered lower Pao2:Fio2 ratios, when compared with coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients (p < 0.05). Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients was 50%. On ICU days 1-3, anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G was significantly elevated in coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients, as compared to both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients (p < 0.001). Weak severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus immunoglobulin G serologic responses were also detected, but not other coronavirus subtypes. The four anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G were maximal by ICU day 3, with all four anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G providing excellent diagnostic potential (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike 1 protein immunoglobulin G, area under the curve 1.0, p < 0.0005; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor binding domain immunoglobulin G, area under the curve, 0.93-1.0; p &#8804; 0.0001; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Spike proteins immunoglobulin G, area under the curve, 1.0; p < 0.0001; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Nucleocapsid protein immunoglobulin G area under the curve, 0.90-0.95; p &#8804; 0.0003). Anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G increased and/or plateaued over 10 ICU days. Conclusions: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients exhibited anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulin G, whereas serologic responses to non-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigens were weak or absent. Detection of human coronavirus immunoglobulin G against the different immunogenic structural proteins/subunits with multiplex assays may be useful for pathogen identification, patient cohorting, and guiding convalescent plasma therapy.","Fraser, Douglas D; Cepinskas, Gediminas; Slessarev, Marat; Martin, Claudio M; Daley, Mark; Patel, Maitray A; Miller, Michael R; Patterson, Eric K; O039,; Gorman, David B; Gill, Sean E; Oehler, Susanne; Miholits, Markus; Webb, Brian",Crit Care Explor,654,12

In particular, urbanisation trends and the increasing demands of urban mobility place additional pressure on existing transportation infrastructure, and this creates new challenges for urban planners in terms of developing integrated and sustainable urban mobility policies. Here, we take a novel and holistic approach to analysing transformative pathways towards sustainable urban mobility, considering the complex dynamics in metropolitan regions. To achieve this, we develop a toolset to assess the impact of potential measures to be taken by decision makers. Our innovative approach is based on the introduction of a new system framework to link the interrelated sector parameters of mobility systems by considering the effects of innovative mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) on scenario development and evaluation on the basis of global trends at the macro scale and their specific influences on the mobility sector at the local scale. To this end, we used a participatory modelling approach to develop scenarios and evaluate them as integrated simulation runs via a comprehensive and holistic system dynamics (SD) model. Thus, we estimated dynamic interdependencies between all of the factors relating to the mobility sector and then assigned business decision-making criteria to the urban systems. Furthermore, we introduced a sustainable net present value framework to estimate the sustainability outcomes of government investment in urban mobility infrastructure. A case study relating to the Rhine-Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany was applied in order to simulate four scenarios co-created with stakeholders involved in our study, namely, Smart City, Sustainable/Healthy City, Deurbanisation and Business-as-Usual (BaU), which served as a solid basis from which to quantify path dependencies in terms of policy implementation. At the same time, recommendations were derived for sustainable mobility transformation within metropolitan regions.","Ani, Melkonyan; Jennifer, Koch; Fabian, Lohmar; Vasanth, Kamath; Munteanu, Victoria; Alexander Schmidt, J; Bleischwitz, Raimund",Sustain Cities Soc,654,32

The success of these measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance has not been complete. Detailed data is required on the factors aiding or hindering compliance with these measures. MethodsTo understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020. ResultsThe main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to ones self and ones family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved one, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family. ConclusionThe results demonstrate an array of factors contribute to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communications that emphasizes the potential risks of COVID-19 and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours.","Wright, Liam; Paul, Elise; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",,654,23

To reduce these risks, two different treatments are recommended - BCG or radical cystectomy (RC). The purpose of this study is to analyze cancer-specific survival of these two initial treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BladderBaSe links information from the SNRUBC from 1997 to 2014, with a number of national healthcare and demographic registers. BCG was used for 3,862 patients (399 had delayed RC), while 687 had initial RC. Propensity scores were used to match the patients treated with RC and with relevant variables such as age, gender, and tumor stage with the same number treated with BCG (673 each arm). In a further comparison, an instrumental variable analysis using hospital strategy as the instrument was used. RESULTS: The 5-year cancer-specific survival chance was higher for the BCG group than it was for the initial RC group, 87 vs 71%, respectively. In the population with propensity score matching, 78 died from cancer in the BCG group during follow-up and 162 in the RC group. In the instrumental variable analysis, the multivariate adjusted risk difference of cancer-specific death 2 years after diagnosis was 32 per 100 treated patients, in favor of the BCG group. CONCLUSIONS: BCG therapy had better cancer-specific survival than RC also when two different statistic methods were used to try to control for confounding. A prospective randomized trial will be necessary to rule out that selection is a major factor for the outcome.","Wang, Eugen Y-H; Larsson, Ulf; Gårdmark, Truls; Malmström, Per-Uno",Scand J Urol,654,16

To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated changes on the lateral radiograph and no study has evaluated changes in rotation of the fifth metatarsal head postoperatively. In percutaneous bunionette correction using a burr for osteotomy, shortening of the fifth metatarsal and elevation of the metatarsal head are inevitable.

We measured parameters on anteroposterior and lateral weightbearing radiographs in 18 feet pre- and postoperatively. Rotation of the fifth metatarsal head was graded according to the medial tubercle location. We also evaluated angular change of the fifth metatarsal on weightbearing lateral radiographs. Percutaneous bunionette correction without fixation could achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic results, with less complication, when compared with previously published outcomes of open and percutaneous surgery with fixation. In this surgical method, bunionette is corrected in 3 dimensions.

Countries in the Northern Hemisphere have been affected the most, including the United States and European countries. Contrary to the common knowledge that infectious diseases are more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, COVID-19 appears to affect wealthy countries more. This paper attempts to quantify the relationship between COVID-19 infections and levels of economic development with data from the U.S. and Europe. Methods: Public domain data on the confirmed COVID-19 cases during January 1 and May 31, 2020 by states and territories in the U.S. and by countries in Europe were included. Incidence rate was estimated using the 2019 total population. COVID-19 cases were associated with 2019 GDP using regression models after a logarithmic transformation of the data. The U.S. data and European data were analyzed separately, considering significant heterogeneity between the two. Results: A total of 2 451 691 COVID-19 cases during a 5-month period were analyzed, including 1 787 414 from 50 U.S. states and territories and 664 277 from 28 European countries. The overall incidence rate was 5.393/1000 for the U.S. and 1.411/1 000 for European countries with large variations. Lg (total cases) was significantly associated with lg (GDP) for U.S. states (= 1.2579, P < 0.001) and European countries (= 0.7156, P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a positive correlation between COVID-19 case incidence and GDP. Study findings suggest a potential role of high-level development in facilitating infectious disease spread, such as better domestic and international travel for businesses and leisure, more personal freedom and more group activities.

Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. METHODS: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. RESULTS: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at > 30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen's kappa varied between 0.86 and 0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM < 14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG &#8805; 14 days. CONCLUSION: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV < 14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.","Higgins, Victoria; Fabros, Anselmo; Wang, Xiao Yan; Bhandari, Maria; Daghfal, David J; Kulasingam, Vathany",Clin. biochem,654,23

The present study evaluated whether caregiver-directed improvements in family relations, youth prosocial peer relations, and youth academic performance during multisystemic therapy (MST) for serious and violent juvenile offenders had an impact on young adult involvement in criminal activity and sentencing 10.2 years following treatment. The results showed that improvements in family relations were associated with reduced odds of criminal outcomes a decade later for former MST participants. Furthermore, improvements in youth prosocial peer relations and academic performance were also related to lower odds of long-term criminal activity. These results are consistent with the underlying theory of change in family-based treatments and demonstrate that caregivers are critical to achieving and sustaining decreased antisocial behavior for youths with serious and violent criminal histories.","Sheerin, Kaitlin M; Borduin, Charles M; Brown, Cynthia E; Letourneau, Elizabeth J",J. marital fam. ther,654,10

However, the epidemiological features and outcomes of AKI among COVID-19 patients with ARDS are unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited consecutive adult COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed with ARDS according to Berlin definition from 13 designated intensive care units in the city of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors of AKI as well as the relation between AKI and in-hospital mortality were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 275 COVID-19 patients with ARDS were included in the study, and 49.5% of them developed AKI during their hospital stay. In comparison with patients without AKI, patients who developed AKI were older, tended to have chronic kidney disease, had higher Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score on day 1, and were more likely to receive invasive ventilation and develop acute organ dysfunction. Multivariate analysis showed that age, history of chronic kidney disease, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and albumin level were independently associated with the occurrence of AKI. Importantly, increasing AKI severity was associated with increased in-hospital mortality when adjusted for other potential variables: odds ratio of stage 1 = 5.374 (95% CI: 2.147-13.452; p < 0.001), stage 2 = 6.216 (95% CI: 2.011-19.210; p = 0.002), and stage 3 = 34.033 (95% CI: 9.723-119.129; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this multicenter retrospective study, we found that nearly half of COVID-19 patients with ARDS experienced AKI during their hospital stay. The coexistence of AKI significantly increased the mortality of these patients.","Wang, Feilong; Ran, Linyu; Qian, Chenchen; Hua, Jing; Luo, Zhibing; Ding, Min; Zhang, Xing; Guo, Wei; Gao, Shaoyong; Gao, Weibo; Li, Chaoping; Liu, Zhongmin; Li, Qiang; Ronco, Claudio",Blood Purif,654,16

However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)-Spike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBD-DK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2-RBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBD-DK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals' interaction in stabilizing the RBD-DK07 complex. Thus, DK07 may be developed as a potential inhibitor of the RBD-ACE2 interaction. However, these results warrant further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Aatif, Mohammad; Muteeb, Ghazala; Alsultan, Abdulrahman; Alshoaibi, Adil; Khelif, Bachir Yahia",Mar. drugs,654,29

However, the closed-ward environment and extreme shortage of onsite mental health workers have limited the use of traditional face-to-face diagnosis and psychological interventions. Aim To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. Methods In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the 'first-aid' to all patients. Conclusion This integrated onsite and online approach was effective and efficient in providing psychological interventions for inpatients during the crisis. Our model provides a realistic scheme for healthcare systems in or after the COVID-19 epidemic and also could be adopted in areas of the world with insufficient mental healthcare resources.","Cheng, Wenhong; Zhang, Fang; Hua, Yingqi; Yang, Zhi; Liu, Jun",General Psychiatry,654,10

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.Importance:The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","de Vries, Maren; Mohamed, Adil S; Prescott, Rachel A; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Desvignes, Ludovic; O039,; Connor, Rebecca; Steppan, Claire; Devlin, Joseph C; Ivanova, Ellie; Herrera, Alberto; Schinlever, Austin; Loose, Paige; Ruggles, Kelly; Koralov, Sergei B; Anderson, Annaliesa S; Binder, Joseph; Dittmann, Meike",J. virol,654,25

Needing an available and specific test strategy regarding SARS-CoV­2, our own test strategy strictly followed these testing criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a retrospective analysis, we verified if such a test strategy was an effective tool in the context of infection prevention control and as reliable SARS-CoV­2 detection. Therefore, we analysed our own test results of suspected SARS-CoV­2 cases between 26 February and 6 April 2020. Additionally, we used a geovisualisation tool to visualise test frequencies and positive test results within different districts of Mannheim based on people's addresses. RESULTS: There were on average 7% positive test results of SARS-CoV­2 within a population with typical symptoms of COVID-19 (nâ¯= 2808). There was no positive test result within an asymptomatic population (nâ¯= 448). However, one positive test result turned out to be a nosocomial infection. Finally, geovisualisation highlighted a shift of test frequencies and local positive rates for SARS-CoV­2 from one district of Mannheim to another. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, our test strategy strictly based on testing criteria suggested by the Robert Koch Institute resulted in a steady rate of positive tests and allowed us to increase test capacity without causing numbers of nosocomial infections of COVID-19. Geovisualisation tools can offer support in analysing an ongoing spread of transmissible diseases. In the future, they could be used as helpful tools for infection prevention control, for example in the context of vaccination programs.","Trimborn, Anna; Gerigk, Marlis; Heininger, Alexandra; Santhanam, Nandhini; Walter, Thomas; Lange, Bettina",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,654,16

Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri‐food SMEs, this study investigates differences in‐ and determinants of COVID‐19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID‐19. The findings of the study imply that the “just‐in‐time” approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri‐food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID‐19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri‐food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri‐food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks","Abu Hatab, A.; Lagerkvist, C.

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among patients with COVID-19 who were treated and discharged from a university hospital in Daegu, Korea. Methods: In total, 64 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and then hospitalized, treated and discharged from the university hospital between February and April 2020 participated in our study. We conducted telephone interviews with the participants and evaluated the presence of PTSD using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; score range: 0-80). If a score of &#8805;33 was obtained, then a diagnosis of PTSD was made. We analyzed the association between PTSD and demographic and clinical characteristics using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. Results: In total, 13 patients had a PCL-5 score of &#8805;33, which indicated that 20.3% (n = 64) of the patients had PTSD. No significant differences were observed in demographic characteristics, including, sex, age, hospitalization time and duration after discharge, between patients with PTSD and those without PTSD. Conclusions: The prevalence rate of PTSD was 20.3% in patients with COVID-19 who had been hospitalized, treated and discharged. Accordingly, clinicians should be aware of the high possibility of PTSD among COVID-19 patients.

There are many concerns about the rapid spread of this disease, and yet, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Several biological interventions have been under study recently to investigate efficient treatment for this viral disease. Besides, many efforts have been made to find a safe way to prevent and vaccinate people against COVID-19 disease. In severe cases, patients suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome usually associated with an increased level of inflammatory cytokines, called a cytokine storm. It seems that reequilibrating the hyperinflammatory response of the host immune system and regeneration of damaged cells could be the main way to manage the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recently under investigation in this regard, and the achieved clinical outcomes show promising evidence for stem cell-based therapy of COVID-19. MSCs are known for their potential for immunomodulation, defense against virus infection, and tissue regeneration. MSCs are a newly emerged platform for designing vaccines and show promising evidence in this area. In the present study, we provided a thorough research study on the most recent clinical studies based on stem cells in the treatment of COVID-19 while introducing stem cell exclusivities for use as an immune disorder or lung cell therapy and its potential application for protection and vaccination against COVID-19.

We aimed to describe management of FR-programmes across Europe in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: In June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional survey sent to OHCA registry representatives in 17 European countries with active FR-programmes. The survey was administered by e-mail and included questions regarding management of both citizen responder and FR-programmes. A follow-up question was conducted in October 2020 assessing management during a potential ""second wave"" of COVID-19. Results: All representatives responded (response rate = 100%). Fourteen regions dispatched citizen responders and 17 regions dispatched professional FRs (9 regions dispatched both). Responses were post-hoc divided into three categories: FR activation continued unchanged, FR activation continued with restrictions, or FR activation temporarily paused. For citizen responders, regions either temporarily paused activation (n = 7, 50.0%) or continued activation with restrictions (n = 7, 50.0%). The most common restriction was to omit rescue breaths and perform compression-only CPR. For professional FRs, nine regions continued activation with restrictions (52.9%) and five regions (29.4%) continued activation unchanged, but with personal protective equipment available for the professional FRs. In three regions (17.6%), activation of professional FRs temporarily paused. Conclusion: Most regions changed management of FR-programmes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies are needed to investigate the consequences of pausing or restricting FR-programmes for bystander CPR and AED use, and how this may impact patient outcome.","Andelius, Linn; Oving, Iris; Folke, Fredrik; de Graaf, Corina; Stieglis, Remy; Kjoelbye, Julie Samsoee; Hansen, Carolina Malta; Koster, Rudolph W; L Tan, Hanno; Blom, Marieke T",Resusc Plus,654,9

Recent work revealed that HBL binds to the mammalian surface receptors LITAF and CDIP1 and that both HBL and NHE induce potassium efflux and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to pyroptosis. These mammalian receptors, in part, contribute to inflammation and pathology. Other putative virulence factors of B. cereus include cytotoxin K, cereulide, metalloproteases, sphingomyelinase, and phospholipases.

Methanol poisoning is characterized by a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and can have a variety of central nervous system manifestations ranging from inebriation to coma and seizures, with afferent pupillary defect a sign of advanced methanol poisoning. Early recognition and treatment are key. Here we present a case of severe methanol toxicity secondary to hand sanitizer ingestion early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Case: A 54-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder presented to the Emergency Department after being found down and unresponsive near the front door of his home. Earlier that day he was “acting strange” according to his girlfriend. She left their home to get help, and upon her return found him in the front yard unresponsive and having seizure activity. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department he was afebrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic. He was unresponsive so he was emergently intubated. Physical exam was significant for asymmetric, dilated, and fixed pupils. Labs were significant for a bicarbonate of 5, potassium of 7.2, an anion gap of 28, and an osmolar gap of 177. His methanol level was 396. Despite dialysis he progressed to multi organ failure and his family decided to transition to comfort care, soon after which he expired. After further questioning it was discovered that he had been drinking hand sanitizer in an effort to get intoxicated as they were out of alcohol in the house. The bottle found in the home was reported to the FDA. Upon their review it was removed from store shelves due to methanol contamination and potential risk to others. It is believed that this brand of hand sanitizer was a new brand sold during the COVID-19 pandemic shortage and had a false ingredient label. Discussion: This patient had many of the characteristic signs and symptoms of methanol poisoning and was an unfortunate example of how devastating the outcome can be. However, it also highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic has had many unintentional medical consequences as a result of socioeconomic health disparities, the challenge of treating substance abuse disorder, and poorly regulated consumer products.","Calhoun, K.

Hence, the study aims to investigate and characterise the manifestations which appear after eradication of the coronavirus infection and its relation to disease severity. METHOD: About 287 survivors from COVID-19 were included in the study, each received a questionnaire divided into three main parts starting from subjects' demographic data, data about the COVID-19 status and other comorbidities of the subject, and finally data about post-COVID-19 manifestations. Response surface plots were produced to visualise the link between several factors. RESULTS: Only 10.8% of all subjects have no manifestation after recovery from the disease while a large percentage of subjects suffered from several symptoms and diseases. The most common symptom reported was fatigue (72.8%), more critical manifestations like stroke, renal failure, myocarditis and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by a few percent of the subjects. There was a relationship between the presence of other comorbidities and severity of the disease. Also, the severity of COVID-19 was related to the severity of post-COVID-19 manifestations. CONCLUSION: The post-COVID-19 manifestation is largely similar to the post-SARS syndrome. All subjects recovered from COVID-19 should undergo long-term monitoring for evaluation and treatment of symptoms and conditions that might be precipitated with the new coronavirus infection.","Kamal, Marwa; Abo Omirah, Marwa; Hussein, Amal; Saeed, Haitham",Int J Clin Pract,654,10

Differentiation between conductive versus sensorineural dysfunction has not been investigated. Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate auditory function using BAER and bone conduction (BC). Twenty-four alpacas: 15 females, 9 intact males (2-16 years of age) were included in a randomized clinical trial. BAER and BC were recorded using two derivations (vertex to mastoid and vertex to cranial aspect of second cervical vertebra). All alpacas underwent complete physical examinations and were sedated with xylazine hydrochloride at 0.6 mg/kg IM. Peaks, when present, were identified and latencies, amplitudes, and amplitude ratios were determined. Eleven alpacas had normal responses and 13 had auditory loss based on BAER. The latter consisted of complete absence of peaks bilaterally (n = 3), absence of peaks unilaterally (n = 1), delayed latencies bilaterally (n = 4), and delayed latencies unilaterally (n = 5). Distinct peaks on BC supported conductive auditory loss in 6 alpacas, difficult to interpret due to stimulus artifact and additional undefined peaks in 4, and absent peaks in 3 alpacas. The cause of auditory loss was presumed to be due to otitis in 6, aging in 4 (10-16 years old), and congenital sensorineural (absent peaks on BAER and BC) in 3 alpacas with unpigmented fiber and irises. BAER and BC are useful and non-invasive to perform techniques for the investigation of auditory loss in alpacas, and further characterization as conductive or sensorineural.","Aleman, M; Crowe, C; Dechant, J; Bellone, R R; Avila, F",Res Vet Sci,654,1

Pre-Tdap era data suggest that maternal pertussis antibodies in infants have a half-life of approximately 5-6â¯weeks. METHODS: 34 mother-infant pairs had blood collected before maternal Tdap vaccination, 4â¯weeks later, at delivery (maternal and cord), and at infant ages 3 and 6â¯weeks from June 2014-March 2015. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbrial proteins (FIM) and pertactin (PRN) was quantified by multiplex luminex assay (IU/ml). Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) and half-life of pertussis antibodies were calculated. RESULTS: Tdap was administered to 34 women (mean age 31.1â¯years) at mean gestation 30.7â¯weeks (28-32.7). Mean neonatal gestation was 39.1â¯weeks (36-41.1) and mean birthweight was 3379â¯g (2580-4584). Four weeks post-Tdap vaccination, maternal pertussis-specific IgG GMCs increased &#8805;4-fold in 59%, 41%, 29% and 44% of women for PT, FHA, FIM and PRN, respectively, and then waned. The transplacental transport ratio of pertussis antibodies was 1.35 for PT, 1.41 for FHA, 1.31 for FIM and 1.36 for PRN. Between birth and age 6â¯weeks, infant serum GMC for PT-specific IgG decreased from 55.1â¯IU/mL (38.6-78.6) to 21.1â¯IU/ml (14.7-30.2), and the proportion of infants with PT levels &#8805;10â¯IU/ml fell from 97% to 67%. Half-life of pertussis-specific IgG in infants in days was 29.4 (95% CI 27.3-31.7) for PT, 29.8 (95% CI 27.7-32.2) for FHA, 31.2 (95% CI 28.9-33.7) for PRN, and 35.8 (95% CI 30.1-44.3) for FIM. CONCLUSION: The half-life of pertussis-specific antibodies in infants induced by maternal Tdap vaccination (29-36â¯days) is shorter than previously reported. Understanding how the durability of passively-acquired antibodies impacts infant susceptibility to pertussis and response to primary vaccination is critical to refine prevention strategies.","Healy, C Mary; Rench, Marcia A; Swaim, Laurie S; Timmins, Audra; Vyas, Anuja; Sangi-Haghpeykar, Haleh; Ng, Nancy; Rajam, Gowrisankar; Havers, Fiona; Schiffer, Jarad; Baker, Carol J",Vaccine,654,16

Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).","Zheng, Mei; Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Du, Pengcheng; Li, Xinglin; Jiang, Dong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",Emerg Microbes Infect,654,26

METHODS: Four databases were searched to identify articles measuring patient empowerment in persons with chronic conditions, used a quantitative design and provided evidence on correlates of patient empowerment. Seventy-six articles were included and analyzed by descriptive statistics and summative content analysis. RESULTS: The articles used a range of definitions (n = 35) and instruments (n = 38), evaluating a range of correlates in four categories: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and patient-reported experiences. The most frequent associations were between patient empowerment and age (n = 21), sex (n = 15), educational level (n = 15) and quality of life (n = 18). However, they were not always significant. CONCLUSION: The broad variation of definitions and instruments highlights the lack of consensus on how to interpret and measure patient empowerment. Although several covariates have been evaluated, there are few studies assess the same relationships. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Consensus on a definition and measurement of patient empowerment is needed to improve the quality of future research and to provide a more cohesive body of knowledge.","Acuña Mora, Mariela; Sparud-Lundin, Carina; Moons, Philip; Bratt, Ewa-Lena",Patient educ. couns,654,1

The titers of IgG to the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) were measured by CLEIA. The nAb titer was determined using lentivirus-based pseudovirus or authentic virus. Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases ([~]30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility of reinfection to the variants of concerns (VOCs).

This study places these measures in light of the massive reform process based on the ""managerialism"" of healthcare, which started in the 1990s. These reforms, which were inspired by the ideas of 'New Public Management', introduced managerialism, regionalization and quasi-markets to the Italian National Health System. As a result, dramatic changes have been made in public healthcare, and the responsibility for healthcare was decentralized to regions, introducing a multi-level governance structure. The COVID-19 emergency has drawn the results of this approach into question. With the enactment of new decrees, the central government directly intervened in the management of the health system by introducing specific measures aiming to increase the number of hospital beds and personnel, which w previously downsized. We describe the main content of the new measures adopted to face the COVID-19 emergency and discuss how key points of the managerialization process in Italy are being questioned as a result of these measures. The COVID-19 emergency will likely redesign the trajectory of health reforms in Italy and other countries in Europe.","Mauro, Marianna; Giancotti, Monica",Health policy,654,16

After reviewing the medical records of 52 patients with a pathologically confirmed vestibular schwannoma, we included 50 patient's records in the study. Hearing preservation was regarded as positive if the postoperative hearing was within serviceable hearing (50/50 rule). The categorical variable included the surgical approach, and the continuous variable covered audiometric and vestibular function tests, and the largest diameter of the tumor. Four different algorithms were lined up for comparison of accuracy: support vector machine(SVM), gradient boosting machine(GBM), deep neural network(DNN), and diffuse random forest(DRF). The average accuracy of predicting hearing preservation ranged from 62% (SVM) to 90% (DNN). The current study is the first to incorporate machine learning methodology into a prediction of successful hearing preservation surgery.

Anti-RBD geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) progressively increased between months 1 (74.2 U/mL, 95%CI: 62.7-87.8), 3 (103.2 U/mL, 95%CI: 87.9-121.2;p &lt; 0.001), and 6 (123.3 U/mL, 95%CI: 103.4-147.0;p &lt; 0.001) in the whole cohort. Anti-N antibodies were detectable in &gt;97% at all times. Neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 99.5% of participants (195/196) at 6 months post infection. Their GMC progressively decreased between months 1 (20.1 AU/mL, 95%CI: 16.9-24.0), 3 (15.2 AU/mL, 95%CI: 13.2-17.6;p &lt; 0.001) and 6 (9.4 AU/mL, 95%CI: 7.7-11.4;p &lt; 0.001). RBD-ACE2-inhibiting antibody titres and anti-RBD antibody concentrations strongly correlated at each timepoint (all r &gt; 0.86, p &lt; 0.001). Disease severity was associated with higher initial anti-RBD and RBD-ACE2-inhibiting antibody titres, but not with their kinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Neutralizing antibodies persisted at 6 months in almost all participants, indicating more durability than initially feared. Anti-RBD antibodies persisted better and even increased over time, possibly related to the preferential detection of progressively higher-affinity antibodies.","L039,; Huillier, A.

Herein, we re-investigate the practice of using proper scoring rules to produce probabilistic forecasts that are `optimal' according to a given score, and assess when their out-of-sample accuracy is superior to alternative forecasts, according to that score. Particular attention is paid to relative predictive performance under misspecification of the predictive model. Using numerical illustrations, we document several novel findings within this paradigm that highlight the important interplay between the true data generating process, the assumed predictive model and the scoring rule. Notably, we show that only when a predictive model is sufficiently compatible with the true process to allow a particular score criterion to reward what it is designed to reward, will this approach to forecasting reap benefits. Subject to this compatibility however, the superiority of the optimal forecast will be greater, the greater is the degree of misspecification. We explore these issues under a range of different scenarios, and using both artificially simulated and empirical data.","Martin, Gael M.; Loaiza-Maya, Rub'en; Frazier, David T.; Maneesoonthorn, Worapree; Hassan, Andr'es Ram'irez",,654,1

This process, handover, requires focusing on specific, essential medical information while filtering out redundant and unnecessary details. OBJECTIVES: To create and implement a tool for handover that would be flexible enough to meet the unique needs of specific departments. METHODS: We used Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology to prospectively develop, implement, evaluate and reassess a new handover tool in a 900-bed teaching hospital in central Israel. Nurses from 35 departments participated in developing a tool that presents the staff's viewpoint regarding the most critical information needed for handover. RESULTS: A total of 78 nurse managers and 15 doctors (63.7%) completed the questionnaire. Based on exploratory factor analysis, 15 items explained 58.9% of the variance. Four key areas for handover were identified, in addition to basic patient identification: (i) updated clinical status, (ii) medical information, (iii) special clinical treatment and (iv) treatments not yet initiated. Subsequently, a Flexible Handover Structured Tool (FAST) was designed that identifies patients' needs and is flexible for the specific needs of departments. Revisions based on hands-on experience led to high nurse satisfaction with the new tool in most departments. The FAST format was adopted easily during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Implementing a new handover tool-FAST-was challenging, but rewarding. Using PDSA methodology enabled continuous monitoring, oversight and adaptive corrections for better implementation of this new handover reporting tool.","Magnezi, Racheli; Gazit, Inbal; Bass, Arie; Tal, Orna",Int. j. qual. health care,654,10

Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential mechanism of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19 employing network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The corresponding target genes of 45 main active ingredients in XBJ injection and COVID-19 were obtained by using multiple database retrieval and literature mining. 102 overlapping targets of them were screened as the core targets for analysis. Then built the PPI network, TCM-compound-target-disease, and disease-target-pathway networks with the help of Cytoscape 3.6.1 software. After that, utilized DAVID to perform gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict the action mechanism of overlapping targets. Finally, by applying molecular docking technology, all compounds were docked with COVID-19 3 CL protease(3CLpro), spike protein (S protein), and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). The results indicated that quercetin, luteolin, apigenin and other compounds in XBJ injection could affect TNF, MAPK1, IL6 and other overlapping targets. Meanwhile, anhydrosafflor yellow B (AHSYB), salvianolic acid B (SAB), and rutin could combine with COVID-19 crucial proteins, and then played the role of anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immune response to treat COVID-19. This study revealed the multiple active components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19, which provided a new perspective for the study of the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of COVID-19.","Xing, Yan; Hua, Ying-Rong; Shang, Jing; Ge, Wei-Hong; Liao, Jun",Chin J Nat Med,654,29

The extended lockdown has had significant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue' has likely set in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the most crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368 deaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going to be made on re-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented an agent-based city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread of the infection in large metropolises like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These include phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public transportation (modelling of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of containment zones on controlling infections, and the role of compliance with respect to various intervention measures including use of masks, case isolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is that a phased opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of 20 to 33\%, is a good way to restart economic activity while ensuring that the city's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle the possible rise in the number of COVID-19 patients in June and July.","Harsha, Prahladh; Juneja, Sandeep; Patil, Preetam; Rathod, Nihesh; Saptharishi, Ramprasad; Sarath, A.

Nutrition is an integral part of every person life care, and should also be mandatorily integrated to patient care under the Covid-19 pandemic. It is crucial to understand how the Covid-19 does develop and which risk factors are associated with negative outcomes and death. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have studies that respect the basic tenets of the scientific method in order to be trusted. The goal of this review is to discuss the deluge of scientific data and how it might influence clinical reasoning and practice. RECENT FINDINGS: A large number of scientific manuscripts are daily published worldwide, and the Covid-19 makes no exception. Up to now, data on Covid-19 have come from countries initially affected by the disease and mostly pertain either epidemiological observations or opinion papers. Many of them do not fulfil the essential principles characterizing the adequate scientific method.

The associated hardships during these times have highlighted the importance of being emotionally authentic, despite the potential difficulties of doing so at a distance. Even in normal times, a common requirement of workers is that they are expected to display certain emotions to customers, teammates, and supervisors, regardless of how they are actually feeling (e.g., ""service with a smile""). However, the risks of being perceived as surface acting-displaying inauthentic emotions even when required by the job-can be severe, as people react negatively to those who are perceived as inauthentic. Utilizing 2 experiments and a matched parent-teacher survey of international schools in Vietnam, I examine the interpersonal consequences of communication media choice on perceptions of emotional inauthenticity. I find that there are opposing mechanisms in this process: Less rich communication media (e.g., e-mail) are beneficial for masking emotional leakage, yet richer communication media (e.g., face-to-face) are perceived to be a more authentic means of expressing emotion. In line with these mechanisms, for those communicating authentic emotion (i.e., when cue leakage is not relevant), I find richer media to be optimal. Alternatively, for surface actors, across longer-term relationships, I find medium richness communication media are optimal: Using telephone/audio results in improved interactional outcomes for surface actors because this mode masks nonverbal leakage better than face-to-face/video interactions, yet appears higher effort (and thus more authentic) than messages received via e-mail.

While the commitment to address an urgent topic is to be appreciated, this article suggests that the combination of confidence in the applicability of one's tools and belief in the certainty of the available knowledge can be counter-productive in the face of a phenomenon that in significant respects is unprecedented. Starting out from the plurality of forms of knowledge that are mobilized to analyse COVID-19 and its consequences as well as the lack of any clearly hegemonic knowledge, the article tries to understand how a limited convergence in the politico-medical responses to the crisis emerged, and speculates on what would have happened if this had not been the case.

COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), ranging from asymptomatic to potentially fatal presentations. Predictors of VTE in COVID-19 are not fully defined, and the role of anticoagulation in these patients is debatable. Here we discuss two cases of COVID-19, who initially presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms and later with potentially fatal VTE within 30 days of initial presentation. The first case is of a 42-year-old gentleman with a history of sarcoidosis and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia who was in isolation at home and presented with syncope and worsening shortness of breath. He was hemodynamically unstable and resuscitated with fluid management in the emergency department. The chest angiogram imaging studies showed massive pulmonary embolism with right heart strain, which was confirmed with bedside point-ofcare ultrasound. The patient deteriorated clinically and received an intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency. He was discharged home under stable condition on oral anticoagulation. The second patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, sleep apnea, and a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, which was complicated with an ischemic stroke, who presented with worsening complaints of shortness of breath and palpitation. The chest angiogram imaging showed bilateral pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed mild right heart strain. The lower extremity duplex ultrasound showed bilateral deep vein thrombosis. The patient underwent catheterdirected thrombolysis and discharged on oral anticoagulation.

Taking Spain as a case study, the methodological approach included a deep analysis of the inputs and outputs of the Spanish food basket, the supply chain by means of a Material Flow Analysis, as well as an economic and comprehensive nutritional assessment, all under a life cycle thinking approach. The results reveal that during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no significant adjustment in overall FLW generation, but a partial reallocation from extra-domestic consumption to households occurred (12% increase in household FLW). Moreover, the economic impact (+11%), GHG emissions (+10%), and the nutritional content (-8%) complete the multivariable impact profile that the COVID-19 outbreak had on FLW generation and management. Accordingly, this study once again highlights that measures aimed at reducing FLW, particularly in the household sector, are critical to make better use of food surpluses and FLW prevention and control, allowing us to confront future unforeseen scenarios.","Aldaco, R; Hoehn, D; Laso, J; Margallo, M; Ruiz-Salmón, J; Cristobal, J; Kahhat, R; Villanueva-Rey, P; Bala, A; Batlle-Bayer, L; Fullana-I-Palmer, P; Irabien, A; Vazquez-Rowe, I",Sci Total Environ,654,29

COVID-19, which affects every aspect of life, has produced results that require re-evaluating the perspective on education. Distance learning, digital learning, e-learning has reshaped education in many ways. There can be a chance of the pandemic in the digital age to turn into an advantage for the education sector. In this period, it can be said that those who have high interest in technology move more easily in distance education and e-learning processes. In this context, expressing the best skills in the digital age, it was thought that the concept of digital citizenship would have positive effects on e-learning. This study is a relational survey and tested by establishing a relationship between digital citizenship and e-learning. The study was conducted among higher education students. It has been observed that there is a positive relationship between digital citizenship behaviors and e-learning attitudes. In addition, it has been observed that the negative anxiety of students due to the pandemic is reflected in their e-learning processes. However, overall results show that digital citizenship behavior digital learning process could be a positive response to COVID-19 closure period.","Akcil, Umut Bastas Mert",Contemporary Educational Technology,654,29

We aimed to assess the timeliness of contact tracing among airline passengers arriving in Vietnam on flights containing COVID-19 cases and investigated factors associated with timeliness of contact tracing. METHODS: We included data from 2228 passengers on 22 incoming flights between 2 and 19 March 2020. Contact tracing duration was assessed separately for the time between the date of index case confirmation and date of contact tracing initiation (interval I), and the date of contact tracing initiation and completion (interval II). We used log-rank tests and multivariable Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with timeliness. RESULTS: The median duration of interval I and interval II was one (IQR: 1-2) and 3 days (IQR: 2-5), respectively. The contact tracing duration was shorter for passengers from flights where the index case was identified through mandatory testing directly upon arrival (median = 4; IQR: 3-5) compared to flights with index case detection through self-presentation at health facilities after arrival (median = 7; IQR: 5-8) (p-value = 0.018). Cumulative hazards for successful tracing were higher for Vietnamese nationals compared to non-Vietnamese nationals (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Contact tracing among flight passengers in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam was timely though delays occurred on high workload days. Mandatory SARS-CoV-2 testing at arrival may reduce contact tracing duration and should be considered as an integrated screening tool for flight passengers from high-risk areas when entering low-transmission settings with limited contact tracing capacity. We recommend a standardized risk-based contact tracing approach for flight passengers during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.","Pham, Thai Quang; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh; Quach, Ha-Linh; Nguyen, Khanh Cong; Colquhoun, Samantha; Lambert, Stephen; Duong, Luong Huy; Tran, Quang Dai; Ha, Duc Anh; Phung, Dinh Cong; Ngu, Nghia Duy; Tran, Tu Anh; La, Quang Ngoc; Nguyen, Tai Trong; Le, Quynh Mai Thi; Tran, Duong Nhu; Vogt, Florian; Dang, Duc-Anh",BMC Infect Dis,654,1

Here we aimed to raise awareness about this SARS-CoV-2 related syndrome. METHODS: Children diagnosed with MIS-C and followed in Pediatric Clinic between November 2020 and January 2021, were included in study. Data about patients' demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were collected from medical records. RESULTS: The median age of 20 children with MIS-C was 80.5 months, 11 of them were male. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (100%), abdominal pain (70%), myalgia (50%), and rash (50%). Lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers and cardiac enzymes were their main laboratory findings. Cardiac involvement (90%) consisted of myopericarditis, valvulitis, left ventricular dysfunction, and coronary arteritis. Symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis and ileus were due to gastrointestinal involvement (50%). Macular rash on the trunk, erythema on upper eyelids were striking. Empiric antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin were used in all patients, glucocorticoids (90%), anti-thrombotic (65%) and vasoactive (45%) agents were used according to severity of disease. Response to IVIG treatment was poor, whereas glucocorticoids have dramatic affect. Seven patients (35%) were monitored in intensive care unit, none of them required intubation, mechanic ventilation or ECMO. The median recovery time, that is, the period when fever subside and inflammatory markers returned to normal was 9.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Glucocorticoids has critical role in treatment of MIS-C, early recognition and treatment may decrease need for intensive care by providing rapid recovery.","Öcal Demir, Sevliya; Tosun, Öykü; Öztürk, Kübra; Duyu, Muhterem; Bucak, Abdülmelik; Akkus, Gökhan; Bayraktar, Ali C; Demirel, Hande N; Arslanoglu, Sertaç; Ovali, Fahri",,654,13

The relationship with the transcendent or sacred has a strong influence on a people's beliefs, attitudes, emotions and behaviour. Populations, communities, families and individuals have always found solace through their religious or philosophical beliefs during times of personal adversity and widespread anxiety or disaster. Although spiritual care has always been a part of the domain of religious beliefs, a more contemporary perspective is that spiritual care forms part of the human psyche and thus forms part of human care, health and well-being for families, patients and healthcare workers.

The epidemic accelerated in Philadelphia, PA, in the spring of 2020, with the city experiencing a first peak of infections on 15 April, followed by a decline through midsummer. Here, we investigate spread of the epidemic in the first wave in Philadelphia using full-genome sequencing of 52 SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from 27 hospitalized patients collected between 30 March and 17 July 2020. Sequences most commonly resembled lineages circulating at earlier times in New York, suggesting transmission primarily from this location, though a minority of Philadelphia genomes matched sequences from other sites, suggesting additional introductions. Multiple genomes showed even closer matches to other Philadelphia isolates, suggestive of ongoing transmission within Philadelphia. We found that all of our isolates contained the D614G substitution in the viral spike and belong to lineages variously designated B.1, Nextstrain clade 20A or 20C, and GISAID clade G or GH. There were no viral sequence polymorphisms detectably associated with disease outcome. For some patients, genome sequences were determined longitudinally or concurrently from multiple body sites. In both cases, some comparisons showed reproducible polymorphisms, suggesting initial seeding with multiple variants and/or accumulation of polymorphisms after infection. These results thus provide data on the sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Philadelphia and begin to explore the dynamics within hospitalized patients.IMPORTANCE Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally and within infected individuals is critical to the development of mitigation strategies. We found that most lineages in Philadelphia had resembled sequences from New York, suggesting infection primarily but not exclusively from this location. Many genomes had even nearer neighbors within Philadelphia, indicating local spread. Multiple genome sequences were available for some subjects and in a subset of cases could be shown to differ between time points and body sites within an individual, indicating heterogeneous viral populations within individuals and raising questions on the mechanisms responsible. There was no evidence that different lineages were associated with different outcomes in patients, emphasizing the importance of individual-specific vulnerability.","Everett, John; Hokama, Pascha; Roche, Aoife M; Reddy, Shantan; Hwang, Young; Kessler, Lyanna; Glascock, Abigail; Li, Yize; Whelan, Jillian N; Weiss, Susan R; Sherrill-Mix, Scott; McCormick, Kevin; Whiteside, Samantha A; Graham-Wooten, Jevon; Khatib, Layla A; Fitzgerald, Ayannah S; Collman, Ronald G; Bushman, Frederic",mBio (Online),654,20

However, discrete pandemic effects may not be fully realized on the macro-scale. With this perspective, our goal is to visualize spread of the pandemic and measure county-level features which may portend vulnerability. METHODS: We accessed the New York Times GitHub repository COVID19 data and 2018 United States Census data for all United States Counties. The disparate datasets were merged and filtered to allow for visualization and assessments about case fatality rate (CFR%) and associated demographic, ethnic and economic features. RESULTS: Our results suggest that county-level COVID19 fatality rates are related to advanced population age (P < .001) and less diversity as evidenced by higher proportion of Caucasians in High CFR% counties (P < .001). Also, lower CFR% counties had a greater proportion of the population reporting has having 2 or more races (P < .001). We noted no significant differences between High and Low CFR% counties with respect to mean income or poverty rate. CONCLUSIONS: Unique COVID19 impacts are realized at the county level.

However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on T cell responses to common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed CD4+ T cell responses to spike peptides from SARS-CoV-2 and 3 CCCs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) before and after study participants received Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine recipients showed broad T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and we identified 23 distinct targeted peptides in 9 participants, including 1 peptide that was targeted in 6 individuals. Only 4 of these 23 targeted peptides would potentially be affected by mutations in the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) variants, and CD4+ T cells from vaccine recipients recognized the 2 variant spike proteins as effectively as they recognized the spike protein from the ancestral virus.

This move was disruptive and highlighted the need for future educational systems designed to bridge the gap between face-to-face (f2f) and online learning with minimal disruption. We present statistical evidence that learners in flippedf2f classes did not experience disruption when moved fully online. On the contrary, we found that our two measures of disruption, student satisfaction with learning and student engagement, improved when the flipped classes were moved fully online. This we attribute to the focus on student learning using computer-based materials that is part of flipped learning. While there are classes unsuitable for flipping, the pandemic has demonstrated that all classes can be taught online. This suggests that a greater emphasis on using computers for learning in traditional f2f classes will make them less vulnerable to future natural or man-made disasters that may force an unexpected transition to online learning.","MacLeod, Kenneth Swart William Wengrowicz Niva Paul Ravi",Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,654,10

Historically, orthopaedic practices in the United States have not widely utilized telemedicine for the delivery of orthopaedic care. As technology improves the adoption and utilization of telemedicine will likely grow, especially in light of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Our study aims to assess patient and surgeon satisfaction and efficacy of telemedicine during a rapid adoption due to the global pandemic. METHODS: All patients who completed a telemedicine encounter (telephone or video) with an orthopaedic surgeon were contacted. Patients were individually contacted after their visit, and a standardized validated post-visit satisfaction survey was completed. Orthopaedic surgeons completed a standardized post-encounter survey after each visit. Pre-COVID-19 patient satisfaction data was used for comparison. RESULTS: Orthopaedic surgeons completed 612 telehealth encounters either via phone or video consultation between April 6, 2020 and May 22, 2020. 95% of patients rated both surgeon sensitivity to their needs and response to their concerns as 'good' or 'very good.' 93% of patients reported they would participate in a telemedicine encounter again. Surgeons reported high satisfaction with telemedicine encounters (80%, 86% phone and video respectively), and that 78.4% of the time a telemedicine encounter was successful in replacing an in-person visit. CONCLUSION: Patients and orthopaedic surgeons documented high levels of satisfaction with telehealth encounters during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Telemedicine does not appear to be a replacement for all in-person clinic encounters, however, when used in the appropriate context demonstrated favourable results.

This would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into ß cells via co-expression of its canonical cell entry factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); however, their expression in human pancreas has not been clearly defined. We analyzed six transcriptional datasets of primary human islet cells and found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not co-expressed in single ß cells. In pancreatic sections, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein was not detected in ß cells from donors with and without diabetes. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. These findings reduce the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects ß cells in vivo through ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Coate, Katie C; Cha, Jeeyeon; Shrestha, Shristi; Wang, Wenliang; Gonçalves, Luciana Mateus; Almaça, Joana; Kapp, Meghan E; Fasolino, Maria; Morgan, Ashleigh; Dai, Chunhua; Saunders, Diane C; Bottino, Rita; Aramandla, Radhika; Jenkins, Regina; Stein, Roland; Kaestner, Klaus H; Vahedi, Golnaz; Brissova, Marcela; Powers, Alvin C",Cell Metab,654,24

Its causes are capillary endothelial cell dysfunction, associated carditis, low oxygenization, and increased sympathetic tone, which all worsen myocardial stiffness and microvascular dysfunction (MD). They lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and a significant rise in death cases. During COVID-19, no specific cardiological treatment is started. As adjuvant therapy, anxiolytics in COVID-19 are widely used, but not in all anxious patients who had been infected with coronavirus. Anxiolytics can be useful to moderate MD and immunosuppressive effect of anxiety. The favorable effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the treatment of myocardial ischemia and heart failure had previously been proven, and also their anti-inflammatory effects had been suspected; however, they have not yet been used in COVID-19 cases. TMZ promotes glucose-mediated ATP production, which requires less oxygen, which explains its advantageous cardiac effects. Since it lowers serum and myocardial tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels and inhibits myocardial macrophage infiltration, it was suspected that TMZ might represent a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and treat sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CoQ10 plays an important role in cellular ATP production; however, its concentration is decreased in cardiovascular diseases and in influenza patients. Due to its anti-inflammatory effect, CoQ10 has been suspected to have a key therapeutic target in influenza infection.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 44 patients with established hematologic malignancies admitted for chemotherapy from January 23 to March 27, 2020 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. Every patient and their caregivers were well educated on personal protection and put it into effect at home and in hospital. Screening for COVID-19 of all the patients and caregivers before admission was performed. Both clinical features and screening results including chest computerized tomography (CT); nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or anal swabs; and quantitative antibodies (IgM and IgG) detecting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) of these patients were described. RESULTS: The results of nucleic acid and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing of all the 44 inpatients and their caregivers were negative. Abnormal chest CT images were observed in six symptomatic patients, while chest CT images of their caregivers did not show the changes related to viral pneumonia.

To address public concerns, we measured the baseline incidence rates of major conditions potentially related to vaccine-related adverse events (VAEs). We aimed to provide a basis for evaluating VAEs and verifying causality. METHODS: Conditions of interest were selected from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Table of Reportable Events and a recent report from a European consortium on vaccine surveillance. We used the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea to identify the monthly numbers of cases with these conditions. Data from January 2006 to June 2020 were included.

To limit the rapid spread locally and nationwide, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan city on January 23 and began implementing nationwide intensive community screening on February 16. METHOD: To assess the effectiveness of city lockdown and intensive community screening, we built a modified SIR model by introducing an &#945; value into the classic SIR model. The &#945; value represents the proportion of infected individuals who are not effectively isolated from susceptible individuals at a given time point. RESULTS: The accuracy of the modified SIR model was validated using data from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The lockdown of Wuhan city substantially reduced the &#945; value for the rest of China excluding Hubei province, while only slightly reducing the &#945; value for the city itself. Intensive community screening rapidly reduced the &#945; value for Wuhan. CONCLUSION: City lockdown was efficient in controlling the spread of the epidemic from Wuhan to the rest of the country. Nationwide intensive community screening was extremely effective in suppressing the spread locally within Wuhan city. These experiences should urgently be shared with other countries to help halt the progressing worldwide pandemic.","Peng, Tailai; Liu, Xinhao; Ni, Hefeng; Cui, Zhe; Du, Lei",PLoS One,654,6

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-protection induced by prior measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations against COVID-19. METHODS: The antibody responses to MMR and tetanus vaccines were determined in 53 patients affected with SARS-CoV2 infection and 52 age-matched healthy subjects. Serum levels of antibodies specific for NP and RBD of SARS-CoV2 were also determined in both groups of subjects with ELISA. RESULTS: Our results revealed significant differences in anti-NP (P<0.0001) and anti-RBD (P<0.0001) IgG levels between patients and healthy controls. While the levels of rubella- and mumps specific IgG were not different in the two groups of subjects, measles-specific IgG was significantly higher in patients (P<0.01). The serum titer of anti-tetanus antibody, however, was significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that measles vaccination triggers those B cells cross-reactive with SARS-CoV2 antigens leading to the production of increased levels of measles-specific antibody.","Hassani, Danesh; Amiri, Mohammad Mehdi; Maghsood, Faezeh; Salimi, Vahid; Kardar, Gholam Ali; Barati, Omid; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood; Zarnani, Amir-Hassan; Shokri, Fazel",Iran J Immunol,654,16

Here, we discuss the presentation and outcomes of COVID in an ambulatory setting along with distribution of positive cases amongst healthcare workers (HCWs). METHOD: Patients who visited the COVID clinic between 03/11/2020 and 06/14/2020 were tested based on the CDC guidelines at the time using PCR-detection methods. Medical records were reviewed and captured on a RedCap database. Statistical analysis was performed using both univariate and bivariate analysis using Fischer's exact test with 2-sided P values. RESULTS: Of the 2471 evaluated patients, 846 (34.2%) tested positive for COVID. Mean age of positivity was 43.4 years (SD ± 15.4), 60.1% were female and 49% were Black. 58.7% of people tested had a known exposure, and amongst those with exposure, 57.3% tested positive. Ninety-four patients were hospitalized (11.1%), of which 22 patients (23.4%) required ICU admission and 10 patients died. The overall death rate of patients presenting to clinic was 0.4%, or 1.2% amongst positive patients. Median length of hospital stay was 6 days (range 1-51). Symptoms significantly associated with COVID included: anosmia, fever, change in taste, anorexia, myalgias, cough, chills, and fatigue. Increased risk of COVID occurred with diabetes, whereas individuals with lung disease or malignancy were not associated with increased risk of COVID. Amongst COVID positive HCWs, the majority were registered nurses (23.4%), most working in general medicine (39.8%) followed by critical care units (14.3%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Blacks and females had the highest infection rates. There was a broad range in presentation from those who are very ill and require hospitalization and those who remain ambulatory. The above data could assist health care professionals perform a targeted review of systems and co-morbidities, allowing for appropriate patient triage.","Barbhaya, Dweep; Franco, Stephanie; Gandhi, Kejal; Arya, Radhika; Neupane, Rabin; Foroughi, Negar; Oluigbo, Nnenna; Fishbein, Dawn; Tran, Jennifer",J Prim Care Community Health,654,16

To limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through congregate settings, universal testing may be necessary. We aimed to determine the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a residential treatment program setting and to understand the unique challenges of Covid-19 transmission in this setting. METHODS: We performed a case series of SARS-CoV-2 rT-PCR testing via nasopharyngeal in a residential substance use treatment program for women in Boston. Staff and residents of the treatment program were tested for SARS-CoV-2. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 test result. RESULTS: A total of 31 residents and staff were tested. Twenty-seven percent (6/22) of the residents and 44% (4/9) of staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All of the SARS-CoV-2 positive residents resided in the same residential unit. Two positive cases resided together with two negative cases in a 4-person room. Two other positive cases resided together in a 2-person room. One positive case resided with two negative cases in a 3-person room. One positive case resided with a negative case in a 2-person room.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the most common reasons for patient presentations in the VC, the proportion of re-presentations in the practice despite VC, practical challenges associated with the introduction of VC and patient satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with a recent acute visual deterioration and severe eye pain were excluded from the VC. The VC were carried out by a trained specialist in ophthalmology. A questionnaire with eight questions was completed after the VC appointment in order to evaluate the proportion of completed VC and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: We included 29 (13 male, Ø 52.6 years, 16 female, Ø 64.7 years) patients in this analysis. The VC could be performed with 68.97% of the participants who rated their overall experience with an average grade of 1.6 (1 very good to 6 insufficient) and all of them indicated that they would recommend the VC. Of presentations in VC 70% were related to the symptoms of the anterior eye segment. In 70% of the cases no re-presentations took place in the unit. CONCLUSION: Our study represents a significant practical application of VC for the management of non-urgent ocular conditions with maximum infection prophylaxis.

Breeding of resistant/tolerant tomato cultivars could be an effective strategy for T. absoluta management but, despite the economic importance of tomato, very limited information is available about its response to this treat. To elucidate the defense mechanisms to herbivore feeding a comparative analysis was performed between a tolerant and susceptible cultivated tomato at both morphological and transcriptome level to highlight constitutive leaf barriers, molecular and biochemical mechanisms to counter the effect of T. absoluta attack. RESULTS: The tolerant genotype showed an enhanced constitutive barrier possibly as result of the higher density of trichomes and increased inducible reactions upon mild infestation thanks to the activation/repression of key transcription factors regulating genes involved in cuticle formation and cell wall strength as well as of antinutritive enzymes, and genes involved in the production of chemical toxins and bioactive secondary metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that tomato resilience to the South America pinworm is achieved by a combined strategy between constitutive and induced defense system. A well-orchestrated modulation of plant transcription regulation could ensure a trade-off between defense needs and fitness costs. Our finding can be further exploited for developing T. absoluta tolerant cultivars, acting as important component of integrated pest management strategy for more sustainable production.","D039,; Esposito, Daniela; Manzo, Daniele; Ricciardi, Alessandro; Garonna, Antonio Pietro; De Natale, Antonino; Frusciante, Luigi; Pennacchio, Francesco; Ercolano, Maria Raffaella",BMC Plant Biol,654,24

Here, two different phage libraries are used to identify immunogenic epitopes across the spike protein and monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients. Three peptides are further characterized in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and measured their antibody levels in COVID-19 patients, from which one identifies one most immunodominant epitope with the highest antibody response in COVID-19 patients and in immunized mice. More importantly, monoclonal antibodies specifically binding to this peptide isolated from COVID-19 patients have therapeutic potential to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the approaches to systemically identify immunogenic peptides and directly identify human monoclonal antibodies from patients will provide useful diagnostic and therapeutic tools for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases.","Li, Lili Gao Meiling Li Jie Zu Shulong Wang Yanan Chen Chunfeng Wan Dingyi Duan Jing Aliyari Roghiyh Wang Jingfeng Zhang Jicai Jin Yujie Huang Weijin Jin Xiaoxia Shi Minxin Wang Youchun Qin Cheng-Feng Yang Heng Cheng Genhong",Small Methods,654,16

Molecular docking was performed on 2,845 phytochemicals to estimate the spatial affinity for the active sites of the enzyme. The ADMET screening was used for the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the hit compounds. Nelfinavir and Lopinavir were used as control for binding energy comparison. The top 10 hits, based on the binding energy (Kcal/mol), were Ginkgolide M (-11.2), Mezerein (-11), Tubocurarine (-10.9), Gnidicin (-10.4), Glycobismine A (-10.4), Sciadopitysin Z-10.2), Gnididin (-9.2), Glycobismine A (-10.4), Sciadopitysin (-10.2), Gnididin (-9.20, Emetine (-8.7), Vitexin (-8.3), Calophyllolide (-8.3), and 6-(3,3-Dimethylallyl)galangin (-7.9).

The coastal environment, under increasing anthropogenic pressure, is subjected to contamination by a large number of human viruses from sewage, most of them being non-enveloped viruses like norovirus. When reaching coastal waters, they can be bio-accumulated by filter-feeding shellfish species such as oysters. Methods to detect this viral contamination were set up for the detection of non-enveloped enteric viruses, and may need optimization to accommodate enveloped viruses like coronaviruses (CoV). Here, we aimed at assessing methods for the detection of CoV, including SARS-CoV-2, in the coastal environment and testing the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can contaminate oysters, to monitor the contamination of French shores by SARS-CoV-2 using both seawater and shellfish. Using the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a CoV, as surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and Tulane virus, as surrogate for non-enveloped viruses such as norovirus, we assessed and selected methods to detect CoV in seawater and shellfish. Seawater-based methods showed variable and low yields for PEDV. In shellfish, the current norm for norovirus detection was applicable to CoV detection. Both PEDV and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 could contaminate oysters in laboratory settings, with a lower efficiency than a calicivirus used as control. Finally, we applied our methods to seawater and shellfish samples collected from April to August 2020 in France, where we could detect the presence of human norovirus, a marker of human fecal contamination, but not SARS-CoV-2. Together, our results validate methods for the detection of CoV in the coastal environment, including the use of shellfish as sentinels of the microbial quality of their environment, and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 did not contaminate the French shores during the summer season.","Desdouits, Marion; Piquet, Jean-Côme; Wacrenier, Candice; Le Mennec, Cécile; Parnaudeau, Sylvain; Jousse, Sarah; Rocq, Sophie; Bigault, Lionel; Contrant, Maud; Garry, Pascal; Chavanon, Fabienne; Gabellec, Raoul; Lamort, Laure; Lebrun, Luc; Le Gall, Patrik; Meteigner, Claire; Schmitt, Anne; Seugnet, Jean Luc; Serais, Ophélie; Peltier, Cécile; Bressolette-Bodin, Céline; Blanchard, Yannick; Le Guyader, Françoise S",Sci Total Environ,654,21

Two blockage correction equations were applied to the water channel tests that were performed under blockage values ranging from 0.2 to 0.35 to estimate the operational behavior in open water. Finally, it has been demonstrated that, with the condition of maintaining the Reynolds number between experiments in the wind tunnel and water flume, the turbine wind characteristics represents the its operation in open-water conditions.","Gharib-Yosry, Ahmed Blanco-Marigorta Eduardo Fernández-Jiménez Aitor Espina-Valdés Rodolfo Álvarez-Álvarez Eduardo",Sustainability,654,24

One possible drug target is the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus' spike protein, which recognizes the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Our in silico study discusses crucial structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions involving RBDs from the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the hACE2. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations explain why the chemical affinity of the new SARS-CoV-2 for hACE2 is much higher than in the case of SARS-CoV, revealing an intricate pattern of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions and estimating a free energy of binding, which is consistently much more negative in the case of SARS-CoV-2. This work presents a chemical reason for the difficulty in treating the SARS-CoV-2 virus with drugs targeting its spike protein and helps to explain its infectiousness.","de Andrade, Jones; Gonçalves, Paulo Fernando Bruno; Netz, Paulo Augusto",Chembiochem,654,6

This study investigated the utilization of emergency dental services and clinical practical attitudes of dental residents in this period. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart data from 13th November 2019 to 31st March 2020 in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Taiwan were used. We obtained electronic medical records to review data from 515 patients who visited the emergency department with dental complaints and we contacted the 26 residents assigned to act as primary care providers to participate in this study. Results: After the COVID-19 outbreak, 17% fewer patients had dental emergency utilization at a hospital emergency center relative to the previous period. A survey of residents also showed a decline in the number of patients. There were no significant differences of patients' problems and diagnoses between the two periods. After the COVID-19 outbreak, 61.5% of the residents were afraid of being infected by a patient's disease and the proportions of dentists wearing waterproof gowns, face shields, and surgical hair caps were 76.9%, 88.5%, and 76.3%, respectively. These variables increased significantly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite the trend of a decreased number of patients, their utilization of dental emergency services seems to be similar before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, possibly related to strict hospital infection control policies and the relatively low number of COVID-19 confirmed patients internationally at that time.","Wu, Ju-Hui; Lee, Min-Kang; Lee, Chen-Yi; Chen, Nien-Hsiang; Lin, Ying-Chun; Chen, Ker-Kong; Lee, Kun-Tsung; Du, Je-Kang",,654,29

Living in rural areas may be associated with poor KAP towards COVID-19. This study compares the KAP regarding COVID-19 of people living in rural and urban areas in Cameroon. Methods: this was a comparative cross-sectional study, using data obtained through an online survey of 1,345 Cameroonians amongst which were 828 urban and 517 rural dwellers. The survey questionnaire consisted of; demographic characteristics, 10 questions on Knowledge, 4 on attitudes and 3 on practices. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: overall, about two-thirds of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for urban dwellers was about twice that of rural dwellers (15.77 ± 5.25 vs 8.86 ± 7.24 respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to people who live in urban areas, rural inhabitants are less optimistic about COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon (OR = 3.43, P<0.001), less likely to accept a trial vaccine for COVID-19 (OR = 1.14, P<0.05), less likely to avoid going to crowded places (OR = 7.42, P<0.01), less likely to wear face mask outdoor (OR = 11.84, P<0,001), and less likely to practice hand hygiene (OR = 1.13, P<0.05). Conclusion: our findings suggest a big gap in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and practices between rural and urban inhabitants in Cameroon. This highlights the need for increase sensitization of Cameroonians, especially rural dwellers on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and appropriate practices.","Njingu, Atabong Emmanuel; Jabbossung, Fombo Enjeh; Ndip-Agbor, Tambe Emilia; Dedino, Ankwatia Guisilla",Pan Afr Med J,654,15

To date, few studies focused on the interactions of micro- and nanoplastics with freshwater Decapoda. The red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Girard, 1852) is an invasive species able to tolerate highly perturbed environments. As a benthic opportunistic feeder, this species may be susceptible to plastic ingestion. In this study, adult P. clarkii, at intermolt stage, were exposed to 100 µg of 100 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) through diet in a 72 h acute toxicity test. An integrated approach was conceived to assess the biological effects of PS NPs, by analyzing both transcriptomic and physiological responses. Total hemocyte counts, basal and total phenoloxidase activities, glycemia and total protein concentration were investigated in crayfish hemolymph at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h from PS NPs administration to evaluate general stress response over time. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hemocytes and hepatopancreas were analyzed to ascertain the response of crayfish to PS NP challenge after 72 h. At a physiological level, crayfish were able to compensate for the induced stress, not exceeding generic stress thresholds. The RNA-Sequencing analysis revealed the altered expression of few genes involved in immune response, oxidative stress, gene transcription and translation, protein degradation, lipid metabolism, oxygen demand, and reproduction after PS NPs exposure. This study suggests that a low concentration of PS NPs may induce mild stress in crayfish, and sheds light on molecular pathways possibly involved in nanoplastic toxicity.","Capanni, Francesca; Greco, Samuele; Tomasi, Noemi; Giulianini, Piero G; Manfrin, Chiara",Sci Total Environ,654,20

I will begin by considering the trauma of isolation with unknown time-horizons, and argue that it not only damages our experiences as social selves, but its languages of overwhelming grief rob us of hope of self-restoration. Second, I will examine some reasons for the ""why us""-type of trauma experienced by so many in the Global North, and suggest that such laments are predicated on the misalignment among our socio-historical awareness, disaster-imagination, and our sense of ourselves as uniquely unfortunate.

Moods are consciously accessible affective states that extend over time that are characterized by their valence and arousal. They also likely have a long evolutionary heritage and serve as an important adaptive affective mechanism. When they become maladaptive or overly biased, pathological affective states such as depression can emerge. Despite the importance of moods for human experience, little is known about their causal neurobiological mechanisms. In humans, methodological and interpretational limitations prevent causal investigations into the origins of mood, highlighting the importance of animal models. Nonhuman primates that share key neuroanatomical, affective, and social features with humans will be essential to uncovering their foundation. Identifying and validating mood-like states in animals is, however, challenging not least because mood is a human construct requiring verbal communication. Here we outline a theoretical framework for animal models of human mood, drawing upon established psychological literature where it exists before reviewing the extant studies of non-human primate models of mood-like states.","Bliss-Moreau, Eliza; Rudebeck, Peter H",Neurosci. biobehav. rev,654,6

These cities experienced strong growth due to internationalisation and a dedicated politics of extraversion. Our argument is that such places are unusually affected by the current lock-down, illustrated by two empirical cases, the cities of Dublin, Ireland, and Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. Both have experienced striking growth rates recently, but now suffer from disruption. Their development trajectories remain unclear, since a return to the 'old normal' seems unlikely, and the emergent 'new normal' calls for adaptation towards more state involvement in areas hitherto governed by the market.

METHODS: Data on open surgical revascularisation and peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) of symptomatic PAOD from 2010 to 2017 were collected from population based administrative and registry data from 11 countries. Differences in age, sex, indication, and invasive treatment modality were analysed. RESULTS: Data from 11 countries covering 671 million inhabitants and 1 164 497 hospitalisations (40% women, mean age 72 years, 49% with intermittent claudication, 54% treated with PVI) in Europe (including Russia), North America, Australia, and New Zealand were included. Patient selection and treatment modality varied widely for the proportion of female patients (23% in Portugal and 46% in Sweden), the proportion of patients with claudication (6% in Italy and 69% in Russia), patients' mean age (70 years in the USA and 76 years in Italy), the proportion of octogenarians (8% in Russia and 33% in Sweden), and the proportion of PVI (24% in Russia and 88% in Italy). Numerous differences between females and males were observed in regard to patient age (72 vs. 70 years), the proportion of octogenarians (28% vs. 15%), proportion of patients with claudication (45% vs. 51%), proportion of PVI (57% vs. 51%), and length of hospital stay (7 days vs. 6 days). CONCLUSION: Remarkable differences regarding the proportion of peripheral vascular interventions, patients with claudication, and octogenarians were seen across countries and sexes. Future studies should address the underlying reasons for this, including the impact of national societal guidelines, reimbursement, and differences in health maintenance.","Behrendt, Christian-Alexander; Sigvant, Birgitta; Kuchenbecker, Jenny; Grima, Matthew J; Schermerhorn, Marc; Thomson, Ian A; Altreuther, Martin; Setacci, Carlo; Svetlikov, Alexei; Laxdal, Elin H; Goncalves, Frederico Bastos; Secemsky, Eric A; Debus, E Sebastian; Cassar, Kevin; Beiles, Barry; Beck, Adam W; Mani, Kevin; Bertges, Daniel",Eur. j. vasc. endovasc. surg,654,33

Biomedical waste generated during COVID-19 patient isolation, testing and care needs special consideration as it challenges the previous notion that only 15-20% of waste can be considered infectious. With establishment of new home quarantine facility, isolation/quarantine centres the chances of general waste getting contaminated with biomedical waste has increased exponentially. Through this systematic review the authors searched for all possible queries raised by different researchers on COVID19 waste management on Pubmed. A summary of all the different issues unique to COVID19 waste was prepared. Guidelines, rules and recommendation given by national and international agencies published till date were taken into account while trying to answer all the above questions raised by different studies. The key step in COVID19 waste management is segregation of biomedical waste from solid waste. Waste generated from COVID19 patients is like any other infectious waste, therefore creating public awareness about the COVID19 waste hazards and segregation at source is highlighted in all guidelines as a recommendation. These guidelines for management of waste generated during diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients, are required to be followed in addition to existing practices under regulation.

Anticoagulation is now recommended to reduce the thrombotic risk. Ilio-psoas haematoma (IPH) is a potentially lethal condition that can arise during the hospitalization, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) and frequently reported as a complication of anticoagulation treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a case series of seven subjects with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia complicated by Ilio-psoas haematomas (IPHs) at our COVID-Hospital in Rome, Italy. RESULTS: Over the observation period, 925 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our COVID-hospital. Among them, we found seven spontaneous IPHs with an incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 hospitalization. All the reported cases had a severe manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, with at least one comorbidity and 5/7 were on treatment with low weight molecular heparin for micro or macro pulmonary thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Given the indications to prescribe anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 and the lack of solid evidences on the optimal dose and duration, it is important to be aware of the iliopsoas haematoma as a potentially serious complication in COVID-19 inpatients. KEY MESSAGE Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of hypercoagulability state and anticoagulation therapy is recommended. Ilio-psoas haematoma (IPH) is found to be a complication of anticoagulation regimen especially in severe COVID-19 cases. An incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 admission of IPHs was reported.

This process occurs when a large number of innate and adaptive immune cells activate and start producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. It is one of the factors contributing to the mortality observed with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) for a subgroup of patients. CRS is not unique to the SARS-CoV-2 infection; it was prevalent in most of the major human coronavirus and influenza A subtype outbreaks of the past two decades (H5N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H7N9). With a comprehensive literature search, we collected changing the cytokine levels from patients upon infection with the viral pathogens mentioned above. We analyzed published patient data to highlight the conserved and unique cytokine responses caused by these viruses. Our curation indicates that the cytokine response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is different compared to other CRS-causing respiratory viruses, as SARS-CoV-2 does not always induce specific cytokines like other coronaviruses or influenza do, such as IL-2, IL-10, IL-4, or IL-5. Comparing the collated cytokine responses caused by the analyzed viruses highlights a SARS-CoV-2-specific dysregulation of the type-I interferon (IFN) response and its downstream cytokine signatures. The map of responses gathered in this study could help specialists identify interventions that alleviate CRS in different diseases and evaluate whether they could be used in the COVID-19 cases.","Olbei, Marton; Hautefort, Isabelle; Modos, Dezso; Treveil, Agatha; Poletti, Martina; Gul, Lejla; Shannon-Lowe, Claire D; Korcsmaros, Tamas",Front Immunol,654,16

Accessing food-security programs has been especially challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media can play an important role in reducing some communication barriers. We examined interest in receiving nutrition information via social media among adults participating in food-security programs in Washington, DC. METHODS: We developed and administered a 22-item survey to adults participating in food-security programs (N = 375). Participants were recruited at Martha's Table, in Washington, DC, from January through March 2020. We performed bivariate analyses and multinomial logistic regressions to examine predictors of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of participants reported using social media, and 49% expressed interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. Higher levels of self-efficacy and belief in the value of digital technology were associated with greater likelihood of interest in receiving nutrition information via social media (&#967;2 6 = 139.0; Nagelkerke R2 = 0.35; P < .001). We found no differences by sex or digital technology access in interest in receiving nutrition information via social media. CONCLUSION: Social media is a widely used and a feasible method to reach food-security program participants. Understanding program participants' interest in receiving health information via social media may help food-security programs plan effective communication strategies to improve food security, especially when in-person participation is limited, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertrand, Adrian; Hawkins, Melissa; Cotter, Elizabeth W; Banzon, Donna; Snelling, Anastasia",Prev Chronic Dis,654,13

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to summarize the clinical practices of nonsevere patients with COVID-19 receiving the standard care, LPV/r or chloroquine in Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 20 to March 26, 2020. The main outcome measurements include the changes of cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay from day 1 to 7 after admission for patients receiving standard care or after treatment being initiated for patients receiving either LPV/r or chloroquine. The proportion of developing severe illness, fever duration and the time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of nucleic acid were compared. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients included in the study, 59 received the standard care, 51 received LPV/r, and 19 received chloroquine. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. The median duration of fever, median time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of the nucleic acid were similar among the 3 groups. The median increase in cycle threshold values of N and ORF1ab gene for patients receiving LPV/r or chloroquine or the standard care during the treatment course was 7.0 and 8.5, 8.0, and 7.6, 5.0, and 4.0, respectively. These figures were not found significantly different among the 3 groups.

Considering multi-organ disabilities, a comprehensive rehabilitation provided in sub-acute phase could be considered a suitable setting for these patients. AIM: Objective of this article is to report the features and rehabilitative outcomes of patients requiring rehabilitation due to disabilities related to severe Covid -19 infection. DESIGN: Longitudinal Observational Study. SETTING: Rehabilitation Department in General Hospital. POPULATION: Patients showing multiple disabilities due to severe Covid 19 infection. METHODS: 39 consecutive patients were admitted to a rehabilitation ward transferred from ICU or Medical wards. Barthel Index and Functional Ambulation Categories were scored as disabilities measures. Data regarding comorbidity, rehabilitation course; swabs; procedures in acute phase; nonrespiratory manifestations; dysphagia, mental confusion; PaO2/FiO2; oxygen supplementation have been collected to admission and discharge. For all patients a comprehensive rehabilitation treatment, have been provided. RESULTS: Functional outcome is good with a statistical significant improvements in BI and FAC scores. 38 were discharged at their home. Mean LOS in acute wards was 46 days. Mean LOS in rehabilitation was 20 day. 11 patients still had tracheostomy at admission, none at discharge and all dysphagic patients recovered a normal oral feeding. The change in PaO2/FiO2 and the reduction of the oxygen supplementation testify a good recovery of pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a consistent recovery with little caregiver burden at discharge. Fast relocation from ICU makes beds available which are very valuable during pandemic. Comprehensive rehabilitation treatment provided in sub-acute phase for patients still positive for SARS-CoV-2, would be desiderable as it seem to be an effective setting.

METHOD: based on the theory of grief, the corpus of this study was composed of documents published in digital media containing personal writings and reports of experiences freely and easily available to the public. Two researchers with expertise in the field used inductive thematic analysis to interpret data. RESULTS: the experiences shared in the reports reflect the suffering experienced by the sudden death of a significant person, which is amplified by the absence or impediment to performing familial farewell rituals. The suppression or abbreviation of funeral rituals is a traumatic experience because family members are prevented from fulfilling their last homage to the loved one who has suddenly passed away, causing feelings of disbelief and indignation. CONCLUSION: alternatives and new ways to celebrate passage rituals in emergencies of strong social commotion such as a pandemic are needed to provide support and comfort to family members, friends, and relatives. These rituals help survivors to overcome the critical moment, decreasing the risk of developing complicated grief.","Cardoso, Érika Arantes de Oliveira; Silva, Breno César de Almeida da; Santos, Jorge Henrique Dos; Lotério, Lucas Dos Santos; Accoroni, Aline Guerrieri; Santos, Manoel Antônio Dos",Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,654,23

Padua prediction score (PPS) is a validated tools for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment. However, its clinical value in COVID-19 patients' evaluation was unclear. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the VTE risk of COVID-19 patients using PPS. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Association of PPS with 28-day mortality was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-four continuous patients were enrolled, with total mortality of 17.2%. Patients in high PPS group, with significantly abnormal coagulation, have a higher levels of interleukin 6 (25.27 vs. 2.55 pg/ml, P < 0.001), prophylactic anticoagulation rate (60.7% vs. 6.5%, P < 0.001) and mortality (40.5% vs. 5.9%, P < 0.001) when compared with that in low PPS group. Critical patients showed higher PPS (6 vs. 2 score, P < 0.001) than that in severe patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed the independent risk factors of in-hospital mortality included high PPS [odds ratio (OR): 7.35, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.08-16.01], increased interleukin-6 (OR: 11.79, 95% CI: 5.45-26.20) and elevated d-dimer (OR: 4.65, 95% CI: 1.15-12.15). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated patients with higher PPS had a significant survival disadvantage. Prophylactic anticoagulation in higher PPS patients shows a mild advantage of mortality but without statistical significance (37.1% vs. 45.7%, P = 0.42). CONCLUSION: Higher PPS associated with in-hospital poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. Prophylactic anticoagulation showed a mild advantage of mortality in COVID-19 patients with higher PPS, but it remain to need further investigation.","Zeng, D X; Xu, J L; Mao, Q X; Liu, R; Zhang, W Y; Qian, H Y; Xu, L",QJM,654,33

MethodsWe used data for all inpatient hospital admissions in England in CYP aged 0-17 between March 1st 2015 to Feb 28th 2021, linked to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and mortality data. We examined associations between PICU admission and death by sociodemographic factors and comorbidities within COVID-19 and PIMS-TS admissions. We calculated odds ratios and predicted probability of PICU admission using generalized estimation equations, and compared these between COVID-19, PIMS-TS, other admissions in 2020/21, all admissions in 2019/20, and admissions due to influenza in 20219/20. Analyses of deaths were descriptive due to low numbers. FindingsWithin COVID-19, there were 6,338 hospital admissions, 259 PICU admissions and 8 deaths. Within PIMS-TS there were 712 hospital admissions 312 PICU admissions and <5 deaths. Males were 52.8% of COVID-19 admissions (similar to other causes of admission), but were 63.5% of PIMS-TS admissions. CYP aged 10-17 were 35.6 and 29% of COVID-19 and PIMS-TS admissions respectively, higher than in all admission and influenza admissions in 2019/20. In multivariable models, odds of PICU admission were: increased amongst neonates and decreased amongst 15-17 compared with 1-4 year olds with COVID-19, increased in older CYP and females with PIMS-TS, and increased for Black compared with White ethnicity in COVID-19 and PIMS-TS. Odds of PICU admission with COVID-19 were increased for CYP with any comorbidity and were highest for CYP with multiple medical problems. Increases in risk of PICU admission associated with comorbidities showed similar patterns for COVID-19 and all admissions in 2019/20 and influenza admissions in 2019/20, but were greater for COVID-19. Interpreting associations with comorbidities within PIMS-TS was complex due to the multisystem nature of the disease. InterpretationCYP were at very low risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19 or PIMS-TS. PICU admission due to PIMS-TS was associated with older non-white CYP. Patterns of vulnerability for severe COVID-19 appear to magnify background risk factors for serious illness in CYP. Evidence before this studyWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating risk factors associated with severe disease among children and young people admitted with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS, [Harwood, R et al. 2021 (submission to the Lancet linked with this paper)]. We identified 81 studies. Infants were found to have increased odds of PICU admission compared with 1-4, but there were no associations by sex. Other factors associated with PICU admission included number of co-morbid conditions, with neurological, cardiac and gastrointestinal associated with the greatest risk. Low numbers of serious SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths amongst CYP limit these analyses, yet national studies of CYP have not yet been published. Importantly, we found these studies did not take into account background risks for severe illness in CYP who are known to be vulnerable before the pandemic. What this study addsThis is the first population base study of risk factors for severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in CYP in England. We analyse all admissions to hospital amongst 0-17 year olds nationally between 2015-2021 linked to multiple other health datasets. We explore how socioeconomic factors and co-morbidities are associated with Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission and death amongst CYP admitted with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS, and compare this with other causes for admission during the pandemic and in the year prior. As CYP with PIMS-TS are highly likely to require hospitalization, we were able to analyse total national cases of the condition during 2020/21. We found extremely low numbers of CYP required PICU or died as a result of SARS-CoV-2 in the first pandemic year. CYP admitted due to COVID-19 disease were older and more likely to be non-white with pre-existing conditions, similar to patterns seen in adults. Patterns of associations between comorbidities and risk of PICU admission amongst COVID-19 were similar to those seen for all admissions and influenza admissions in the year prior to the pandemic. However, the increase in risk associated with comorbidities for COVID-19 admissions were greater than in these cohorts. We found most cases of PIMS-TS were amongst non-white male adolescents without previous hospital admissions. Interpreting associations between comorbidities and PICU admission for PIMS-TS was complicated by the multi-system nature of the disease. Implications of all the available evidenceCYP with most vulnerable to COVID-19 were also those most at risk of prior to the pandemic due to other illnesses such as influenza, although COVID-19 appears to amplify this risk profile. It is important to consider this context when advising parents and carers regarding the risk posed by COVID-19, considering potential harms to CYP as a result of shielding precautions.","Ward, Joseph; Harwood, Rachel; Smith, Clare; Kenny, Simon E; Clark, Matthew; Davis, Peter J; Draper, Elizabeth S; Hargreaves, Dougal; Ladhani, Shamez N; Linney, Michael; Luyt, Karen; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Fraser, Lorna K; Viner, Russell M",,654,24

We evaluate whether this is the case in COVID-19 patients. Objective To determine whether there is an association between hypothermia and worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit. Methods Retrospective study of a cohort of patients (n = 57) admitted to the intensive care unit of a community hospital with a positive test for COVID-19. Measurements Data relating to mortality, comorbidities and length of stay was recorded from electronic medical records for each patient. Hypothermia was defined as =2 recorded body temperatures of less than 96.5 degrees F (35.83 degrees C) at the time of admission. Main results Of the 57 patients enrolled in the study, 21 developed hypothermia during their stay and 36 did not. Our results show that patients who have hypothermia at the time of admission spend a longer time intubated (p &lt; 0.01) and go through longer ICU stays (p &lt; 0.01). These patients are also 2.18 times more likely to suffer a fatal outcome compared to patients that did not develop hypothermia while in the intensive care unit (Chisquared = 8.6209, p &lt; 0.01, RR = 2.18). Conclusions Hypothermia in patients with severe COVID-19 at the time of admission to the ICU is associated with poorer outcomes for patients. This manifests as a longer period of intubation, longer ICU stay, and increased risk of mortality.","Maait, Y.; El Khoury, M.; McKinley, L.; El Khoury, A.",Cureus,654,24

In this mixed-methods study we examine changes in older adults' loneliness due to social distancing, explore variability in perceptions, and identify whether such changes differ by rurality. METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70-97 (mean age = 82;74% female;95% White;39% rural) completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing. Participants completed retrospective and current assessments of loneliness, including providing explanations of their responses. RESULTS: On average, loneliness increased during early social distancing, yet variability was evident. Those experiencing increased loneliness described a feeling of loss or lack of control, whereas those experiencing stability in loneliness identified adaptability in social connection modes or feeling accustomed to social isolation. Rural older adults experienced a significantly smaller increase in loneliness than their nonrural counterparts. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest nuanced experiences among older adults, but generally negative implications for loneliness. Interventions to address older adults' social isolation and loneliness during COVID-19 are warranted.","Fuller, H.

Carbyne, often called linear carbon, has a higher predicted gravimetric modulus and gravimetric strength than any other form of carbon, but possibly reacts under near-ambient conditions because of the extended sp1 hybridization. The successful fabrication of carbon nanotube wrapped single carbyne chain (Shi et al. Nat. Mater. 2016, 15, 634) suggests the possibility of carbyne's bulk production. Herein, we designed a type of carbon assembly that includes a possibly large array of carbyne chains confined within a single-walled nanotube sheath (nanotube wrapped carbynes, NTWCs), in which carbyne chains act as reinforcing building blocks, and the carbon nanotube sheath protects the multiple carbyne chains against chemical or topochemical reaction. We showed that NTWCs exhibit confinement-enhanced stabilities, even when they contain multiple neighboring carbyne chains. We developed a mechanics model for exploring the mechanical properties of NTWCs. On the basis of this model, the gravimetric modulus (and strength) of NTWCs was predicted to increase from 356.4 (50.25) to 977.2 GPa·g-1·cm3 (71.20 GPa·g-1·cm3) as the mass ratio of carbyne carbons to sheath carbons increases, which is supported by atomistic simulations. The highest calculated gravimetric modulus and strength of NTWCs are 174.2% and 41.7%, respectively, higher than those of either graphene or carbon nanotubes. The corresponding highest values of engineering modulus and strength of NTWCs with a density of 1.54 g·cm-3 are 1505 and 109.6 GPa, respectively. Hence, NTWCs are promising for uses in high-modulus, high-strength, lightweight composites.","Gao, Enlai; Li, Ruishan; Baughman, Ray H",ACS nano,654,18

The pandemic has the potential to differentially disadvantage chronically ill patients, including those with Parkinson's disease (PD). The first health care reaction has been to limit access to clinics and neurology wards to preserve fragile patients with PD from being infected. In some regions, the shortage of medical staff has also forced movement disorders neurologists to provide care for patients with COVID-19. Objective: To share the experience of various movement disorder neurologists operating in different world regions and provide a common approach to patients with PD, with a focus on those already on advanced therapies, which may serve as guidance in the current pandemic and for emergency situations that we may face in the future. Conclusion: Most of us were unprepared to deal with this condition given that in many health care systems, telemedicine has been only marginally available or only limited to email or telephone contacts. In addition, to ensure sufficient access to intensive care unit beds, most elective procedures (including deep brain stimulation or the initiation of infusion therapies) have been postponed. We all hope there will soon be a time when we will return to more regular hospital schedules. However, we should consider this crisis as an opportunity to change our approach and encourage our hospitals and health care systems to facilitate the remote management of chronic neurological patients, including those with advanced PD.","Fasano, Alfonso; Antonini, Angelo; Katzenschlager, Regina; Krack, Paul; Odin, Per; Evans, Andrew H.; Foltynie, Thomas; Volkmann, Jens; Merello, Marcelo",Mov.

Concerns include potential side effects caused by the antigen itself and safety of viral DNA and RNA delivery vectors. The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which might cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine complemented with VSV G, VSV&#916;G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients, and protected transgenic K18-hACE2 mice from COVID-19-like disease. Homologous boost immunization further enhanced virus neutralizing activity. The results demonstrate that non-spreading rhabdovirus RNA replicons expressing minispike proteins represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen.","Hennrich, Alexandru A; Sawatsky, Bevan; Santos-Mandujano, Rosalía; Banda, Dominic H; Oberhuber, Martina; Schopf, Anika; Pfaffinger, Verena; Wittwer, Kevin; Riedel, Christiane; Pfaller, Christian K; Conzelmann, Karl-Klaus",PLoS Pathog,654,16

In particular, questions regarding their role in the modulation of immunity have re-surfaced, in view of possible epidemiological links observed between COVID-19 and vitamin D levels in selected populations.

This has implications for the acceptance and coverage of a potential vaccine against COVID-19. In the United States, the number of children exempt from vaccination for ""philosophical belief-based"" non-medical reasons increased in 12 of the 18 states that allowed this policy from 2009 to 2017 (1). Meanwhile, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, especially in young children, have led to increasing rates of drug resistance that threaten our ability to treat infectious diseases. Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse exist side-by-side in the same population of young children, and it is unclear why one modality (antibiotics) is universally seen as safe and effective, while the other (vaccines) is seen as potentially hazardous by some. In this review, we consider the drivers shaping the use of vaccines and antibiotics in the context of three factors: individual incentives, risk perceptions, and social norms and group dynamics. We illustrate how these factors contribute to the societal and individual costs of vaccine underuse and antimicrobial overuse. Ultimately, we seek to understand these factors that are at the nexus of infectious disease epidemiology and social science to inform policy-making.","Wagner, Caroline E; Prentice, Joseph A; Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Yang, Luojun; Grenfell, Bryan T; Levin, Simon A; Laxminarayan, Ramanan",Front Public Health,654,1

METHODS: We identified 197 patients with COVID-19 referred for cEEG at 9 participating centers. Medical records and EEG reports were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of and clinical risk factors for seizures and other epileptiform patterns. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis assessed the relationship between EEG patterns and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Electrographic seizures were detected in 19 (9.6%) patients, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in 11 (5.6%). Epileptiform abnormalities (either ictal or interictal) were present in 96 (48.7%). Preceding clinical seizures during hospitalization were associated with both electrographic seizures (36.4% in those with vs 8.1% in those without prior clinical seizures, odds ratio [OR] 6.51, p = 0.01) and NCSE (27.3% vs 4.3%, OR 8.34, p = 0.01). A pre-existing intracranial lesion on neuroimaging was associated with NCSE (14.3% vs 3.7%; OR 4.33, p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis of outcomes, electrographic seizures were an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 4.07 [1.44-11.51], p < 0.01). In competing risks analysis, hospital length of stay increased in the presence of NCSE (30 day proportion discharged with vs without NCSE: HR 0.21 [0.03-0.33] vs 0.43 [0.36-0.49]). INTERPRETATION: This multicenter retrospective cohort study demonstrates that seizures and other epileptiform abnormalities are common in patients with COVID-19 undergoing clinically indicated cEEG and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

However, gamification has been less applied into enhancing scientific process and science communication themselves. As a case in point, in this paper we demonstrate how an international gamification conference was gamified through Etsija's Call, a mysterious Alternate Reality Conference Game, to enhance conference engagement, create a positive mood for livelier communication and networking as well as to build a communal spirit among participants. The international GamiFIN conference 2020 was held online due to COVID-19. Therefore, the present paper also contributes to the growing literature on remote work and online research and dissemination practices. In this research effort, we employ both design science and mixed-method empirical work (N=47). First, we outline the process and materials involved in the ideation, design and implementation of the game, secondly, we outline the thematic analysis (n=17) of materials gathered throughout the conference from interaction with the game, and thirdly, we report preliminary results of the adapted Gameful Experience Questionnaire (GAMEFULQUEST) based on the participants' experience (n=6) and the game's probable influence on the conference experience (n=13). Our preliminary analyses show that conference participants had a meaningful interaction with the game which further enabled them to engage with several conference facets, situations and participants as indicated by the qualitative analysis of participants' interactions with the game. Moreover, the preliminary quantitative analyses based on the responses on the GAMEFULQUEST indicate that respondents had had a positive gameful experience as a consequence of interacting with Etsija's Call While the present study was preliminary and a first pilot of the conference game, future research on Etsija's Call and other similar implementations should attempt to increase the volume of the investigation in terms of participants.

In humans, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome which presents edema, hemorrhage, intra-alveolar fibrin deposition, and vascular changes characterized by thrombus formation, micro-angiopathy and thrombosis. These clinical signs are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. In recent studies it has been noted that COVID-19 pandemic can affect patients of all ages, including children (even if less severely) who were initially thought to be immune. Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune acute febrile inflammatory condition, which primarily affects young children. The disease can present immunodeficiency with the inability of the immune system to fight inflammatory pathogens and leads to fever, rash, alterations of the mucous membranes, conjunctiva infection, pharyngeal erythema, adenopathy, and inflammation. In the COVID-19 period, virus infection aggravates the condition of Kawasaki disease, but it has also been noted that children affected by SARS-V-2 may develop a disease similar to Kawasaki's illness. However, it is uncertain whether the virus alone can give Kawasaki disease-like forms. As in COVID-19, Kawasaki disease and its similar forms are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immunity cells such as macrophages and mast cells (MCs). In light of the above, it is therefore pertinent to think that by blocking pro-inflammatory cytokines with new anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-37 and IL-38, it is possible to alleviate the symptoms of the disease and have a new available therapeutic tool. However, since Kawasaki and Kawasaki-like diseases present immunodeficiency, treatment with anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant molecules must be applied very carefully.","Ronconi, G; Teté, G; Kritas, S K; Gallenga, C E; Caraffa, Al; Ross, R; Conti, P",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,654,1

Methods: We utilize a deterministic susceptible exposed infectious resistant (SEIR) model designed to fit observed fatalities, hospitalizations, and ICU beds for the state of Oklahoma with a particular focus on the role of the rural/urban nature of the state and the impact that COVID-19 cases in LTCFs played in the outbreak. Results: The model provides a reasonable fit for the observed data on new cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Moreover, removing LTCF cases from the analysis sharpens the analysis of the population in general, showing a more gradual increase in cases at the start of the pandemic and a steeper increase when the second surge occurred. Conclusions: We anticipate that this procedure could be helpful to policymakers in other states or municipalities now and in the future.","Taylor, Jared; McCann, Melinda; Chakraborty, Goutam; Krutz, Glen; Dvorak, Justin; Wendelboe, Aaron",Social science quarterly,654,25

However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the central nervous system remains unclear. Brain organoid models derived from human pluripotent stem cells are potentially useful for the study of complex physiological and pathological processes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as they recapitulate cellular heterogeneity and function of individual tissues. We identified brain organoid studies that provided insight into the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2. While SARS-CoV-2 was able to infect neurons, the extent of neurotropism was relatively limited. Conversely, choroidal epithelial cells consistently showed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain organoid studies also elucidated potential mechanism for cellular entry, demonstrated viral replication, and highlighted downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, they suggest that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 may be contributed by both direct neuronal invasion and indirect consequences of neuroinflammation. The use of high throughput evaluation, patient-derived organoids, and advent of ""assembloids"" will provide a better understanding and functional characterization of the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. With advancement of organoid technology, brain organoids offer a promising tool for unravelling pathophysiologic clues and potential therapeutic options for neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19.","Ng, Jing-Han; Sun, Alfred; Je, Hyunsoo Shawn; Tan, Eng-King",Neuroscientist,654,24

Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italy's Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model.

METHODS: Patients in a multistate community rheumatology practice network completed surveys from April 2020 to May 2020. Adults with common ARD (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus) or non-ARD (gout, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis) were evaluated. Concerns about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing, health care disruptions, and telemedicine use were compared in patients with ARD versus non-ARD, adjusting for demographics, rural residence, and zipcode-based measures of socioeconomic status and COVID-19 activity. Factors associated with medication interruptions were assessed in patients with ARD. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 2319/36 193 (6.4%) patients with non-ARD and 6885/64 303 (10.7%) with ARD. Concerns about COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors were similar in both groups, although patients receiving a biologic or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor reported greater concerns and were more likely to avoid friends/family, stores, or leaving the house. Patients with ARD were less likely to avoid office visits (45.2% vs. 51.0%, odds ratio [OR] 0.79 [0.70-0.89]) with similar telemedicine use. Immunomodulatory medications were stopped in 9.7% of patients with ARD, usually (86.9%) without a physician recommendation. Compared with patients with an office visit, the likelihood of stopping medication was higher for patients with a telemedicine visit (OR 1.54 [1.19-1.99]) but highest for patients with no visits (OR 2.26 [1.79-2.86]). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARD and non-ARD reported similar concerns about COVID-19 and similar social distancing behaviors. Missed office visits were strongly associated with interruptions in immunomodulatory medication.","George, Michael D; Baker, Joshua F; Banerjee, Shubhasree; Busch, Howard; Curtis, David; Danila, Maria I; Gavigan, Kelly; Kirby, Daniel; Merkel, Peter A; Munoz, George; Nowell, William Benjamin; Stewart, Patrick; Sunshine, William; Venkatachalam, Shilpa; Xie, Fenglong; Curtis, Jeffrey R",,654,22

However, the mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells remains poorly understood. Here we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to infect human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressing HEK293T cells and evaluated virus infection. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 entry was dependent on ACE2 and sensitive to pH of endosome/lysosome in HEK293T cells. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses is independent of dynamin, clathrin, caveolin and endophilin A2, as well as macropinocytosis. Instead, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses was cholesterol-rich lipid raft dependent. Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl-ß-cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation. Together, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and endosomal acidification, are key steps of SARS-CoV-2 required for infection of host cells. Therefore, our finding expands the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism and provides a new anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy.","Li, Xiaowei; Zhu, Wenhua; Fan, Meiyang; Zhang, Jing; Peng, Yizhao; Huang, Fumeng; Wang, Nan; He, Langchong; Zhang, Lei; Holmdahl, Rikard; Meng, Liesu; Lu, Shemin",,654,22

Two strict control measures, i.e., putting Wuhan on lockdown and taking strict quarantine rule, were carried out to contain the spread of COVID-19. Based on the different control measures, we divided the transmission process of COVID-19 into three stages. An SEIHR model was established to describe the transmission dynamics and was applied to fit the published data on the confirmed cases of Wuhan city from December 31, 2019 to March 25, 2020 to deduce the time when the first patient with COVID-19 appeared. The basic reproduction number was estimated in the first stage to demonstrate the number of secondary infectious cases generated by an average infectious case in the absence of policy intervention. The effective reproduction numbers in second and third stages were estimated to evaluate the effects of the two strict control measures. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number according to model parameters was executed to demonstrate the effect of the control measures for containing the spread of COVID-19. Finally, the numerical calculation method was applied to investigate the influence of the different control measures on the spread of COVID-19. The results indicated that following the strict quarantine rule was very effective, and reducing the effective contact rates and improving the diagnosis rate were crucial in reducing the effective reproduction number, and taking control measures as soon as possible can effectively contain a larger outbreak of COVID-19. But a bigger challenge for us to contain the spread of COVID-19 was the transmission from the asymptomatic carriers, which required to raising the public awareness of self-protection and keeping a good physical protection.","Pang, Liuyong; Liu, Sanhong; Zhang, Xinan; Tian, Tianhai; Zhao, Zhong",J.

The difference in testing makes it difficult to compare the effect of different containment strategies. This study proposes methods to allow a direct comparison and presents the results. DESIGN: Publicly available data on the numbers of reported COVID-19-related deaths between 01 January and 17 April 2020 were compared between countries. RESULTS: The numbers of cases or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants gave severely biased comparisons between countries. Only the number of deaths expressed as a percentage of the number of deaths on day 25 after the first reported COVID-19-related death allowed a direct comparison between countries. From this comparison clear differences were observed between countries, associated with the timing of the implementation of containment measures. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between countries are only possible when simultaneously taking into account that the virus does not arrive in all countries simultaneously, absolute numbers are incomparable due to different population sizes, rates per 100,000 of the population are incomparable because not all countries are affected homogeneously, susceptibility to death by COVID-19 can differ between populations, and a death is only reported as a COVID-19-related death if the patient was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. With the current methods, all these factors were accounted for and an unbiased direct comparison between countries was established. This comparison confirmed that early adoption of containment strategies is key in flattening the curve of the epidemic.","Middelburg, Rutger A; Rosendaal, Frits R",Int J Infect Dis,654,16

Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest level across the period from 2016 to 2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019 rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates. There is little indication that the COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate influence on divorce dynamics, although the filing rate was more depressed during lockdown periods. © The Author(s) 2021.","Fallesen, P.",Socius,654,1

We report on a case of a 35-year-old renal transplant recipient who suffered from a severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by extreme overexposure to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus, following coadministration of chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based COVID-19 therapy and concurrent pressure for exploration of experimental pharmacological treatment options. However, the risk-benefit balance of experimental or off-label therapy may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients than in otherwise healthy COVID-19 patients, owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy. With this case report, we aimed to achieve increased awareness and improved management of drug-drug interactions associated with the various treatment options for COVID-19 in renal transplant patients.","Meziyerh, Soufian; Zwart, Tom C; van Etten, Ronald W; Janson, Jeroen A; van Gelder, Teun; Alwayn, Ian P J; de Fijter, Johan W; Reinders, Marlies E J; Moes, Dirk J A R; de Vries, Aiko P J",Am J Transplant,654,20

In this report, we focus our attention on the Veneto Region, in the North-East of Italy, which is one of the areas that were first affected by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aim to evaluate the trend of all-cause mortality and to give a description of the characteristics of the studied population. METHODS: Data used in the analyses were released by the majority of municipalities and cover the 93% of the total population living in the Veneto Region. We evaluated the trend of overall mortality from Jan.01 to Jun.30. 2020. Moreover we compared the COVID-19-related deaths to the overall deaths. RESULTS: From March 2020, the overall mortality rate increased exponentially, affecting males and people aged > 76 the most. The confirmed COVID-19-related death rate in the Veneto region between Mar.01 and Apr.302020 is 30 per 100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the all-cause mortality increase registered in the same months in the municipalities included in the study is 219 per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a primary role in the increase in mortality but does not entirely explain such a high number of deaths. Strategies need to be developed to reduce this gap in case of future waves of the pandemic.","Gallo, Elisa; Prosepe, Ilaria; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Acar, Aslihan Sentürk; Lanera, Corrado; Berchialla, Paola; Azzolina, Danila; Gregori, Dario",BMC Public Health,654,24

We analysed 3 classes of variables; demographic, clinical, and comorbid factors, in a two-tiered analysis that included traditional regression strategies and machine learning. COVID-19 mortality was 12.7%. Logistic regression identified older age (OR, 1.69 [95% CI 1.66-1.92]), male sex (OR, 1.57 [95% CI 1.30-1.90]), higher BMI (OR, 1.03 [95% CI 1.102-1.05]), higher heart rate (OR, 1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.01]), higher respiratory rate (OR, 1.05 [95% CI 1.03-1.07]), lower oxygen saturation (OR, 0.94 [95% CI 0.93-0.96]), and chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.53 [95% CI 1.20-1.95]) were associated with COVID-19 mortality. Using gradient-boosting machine learning, these factors predicted COVID-19 related mortality (AUC = 0.86) following cross-validation in a training set.

There are many reports about the relationship between COVID-19 and facial paralysis but there is no prospective study. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies increase in COVID-19. Our purpose is to investigate SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM antibody in the Bell's palsy. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study was planned. Patients with acute peripheral facial paralysis with no reason and diagnosed as Bell's palsy was included in the study. In order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 in the etiologies of these patients, SARS-CoV-2 IgM + IgG (total) test was studied. SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM was measured by using the ADVIA Centaur® test kit. Test reports result in index values and as nonreactive or reactive. The results were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the study. The average age of the patients was 41,7. 17 (41,4%) were female and 24 (58,6%) were male. 21 patients had left-sided; 20 had right-sided paralysis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG + IgM values were measured two times of the patients. First control was in the first week of facial paralysis, 10 (24,3%) positivity was found. The average index of the positive patients were 6,74 (min.1,39-max.10) in the first control and 9,585 in the second control (min.8,7-max. 10). CONCLUSION: We found that the SARS-CoV-2 IgM + IgG antibody test was positive in 24.3% of the patients with Bell's palsy. The results are higher than the seroprevalence studies conducted in asymptomatic individuals. Facial paralysis could be the only symptom of COVID-19 but further studies must be done.","Islamoglu, Yuce; Celik, Burak; Kiris, Muzaffer",Am J Otolaryngol,654,5

Surgical treatment of non-COVID-19 related disease during this period, however, still remains necessary. The decision to proceed with medically necessary, time-sensitive (MeNTS) procedures in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic requires incorporation of factors (resource limitations, COVID-19 transmission risk to providers and patients) heretofore not overtly considered by surgeons in the already complicated processes of clinical judgment and shared decision-making. We describe a scoring system that systematically integrates these factors to facilitate decision-making and triage for MeNTS procedures, and appropriately weighs individual patient risks with the ethical necessity of optimizing public health concerns. This approach is applicable across a broad range of hospital settings (academic and community, urban and rural) in the midst of the pandemic and may be able to inform case triage as operating room capacity resumes once the acute phase of the pandemic subsides.","Prachand, Vivek N; Milner, Ross; Angelos, Peter; Posner, Mitchell C; Fung, John J; Agrawal, Nishant; Jeevanandam, Valluvan; Matthews, Jeffrey B",J Am Coll Surg,654,24

Unfortunately, no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which makes it more deadly. A vaccine-informatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides [including thymus cells (T-cells) and bone marrow or bursa-derived cells] in the surface glycoprotein (SG) of SARS-CoV-2 which is nontoxic and nonallergenic in nature, nonallergenic, highly antigenic and non-mutated in other SARS-CoV-2 virus strains. The population coverage analysis has found that cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) peptides in the 16 different geographical regions of the world. We identified 12 peptides ((LTDEMIAQY, WTAGAAAYY, WMESEFRVY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQI, YGFQPTNGVGYQ, LPDPSKPSKR, QTQTNSPRRARS and VITPGTNTSN) that are $80hbox{--} 90%$ identical with experimentally determined epitopes of SARS-CoV, and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design. Moreover, docking analysis suggested that the identified peptides are tightly bound in the groove of human leukocyte antigen molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall, this study allows us to determine potent peptide antigen targets in the SG on intuitive grounds, which opens up a new horizon in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in vivo.","Alam, Aftab; Khan, Arbaaz; Imam, Nikhat; Siddiqui, Mohd Faizan; Waseem, Mohd; Malik, Md Zubbair; Ishrat, Romana",Brief. bioinform,654,25

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, an even greater need for remote monitoring exists. Mobile tools enhance the ability to monitor patients virtually by enabling remote monitoring of VA and Amsler grid findings. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter reliability analysis. METHODS: Participants: Patients (N = 108) with near corrected VA better than 20/200 and a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or healthy patients without retinal disease (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] of 20/32 or better). INTERVENTION: participants were tested using the Checkup, reference VA, and Amsler tests, with the order of testing (Checkup or reference) randomized. Patients monitored their vision using Checkup at least twice a week at home between office visits. Main outcome measurements were near corrected VA and Amsler grid test results. RESULTS: Agreement was strong between Checkup and reference tests for VA (r = 0.86) and Amsler grid (sensitivity: 93%; specificity: 92%). Home versus clinic testing showed excellent agreement (r = 0.96). Patients reported successful home use. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations. Patients rated the usability of Checkup to be excellent. CONCLUSIONS: There was good agreement between Checkup and in-clinic test results for VA and Amsler grid. The low variance of Checkup testing, agreement between in-clinic and home results, and excellent usability support Checkup as a reliable method for monitoring retinal pathology in clinic and home settings.","Khurana, Rahul N; Hoang, Carol; Khanani, Arshad M; Steklov, Nikolai; Singerman, Lawrence J",Am J Ophthalmol,654,22

Our goal was to synthesize peer-reviewed literature and association guidelines from around the world regarding dysphagia assessment and management for this specific population. Method A review of publications available in the PubMed database and official guidelines of international groups was performed on May 23, 2020. The information was synthesized and categorized into three content areas for swallowing: clinical evaluation, instrumental assessment, and rehabilitation. Results Five publications were identified in the PubMed database. Following title, abstract, and full-text review, only three publications met inclusion criteria: two reviews and one narrative report. Additionally, 19 international guidelines were reviewed. To assess swallowing, a modified clinical evaluation was recommended and only following a risk assessment. Instrumental assessments were often considered aerosol generating, especially transnasal procedures such as endoscopy and manometry. For this reason, many associations recommended that these examinations be performed only when essential and with appropriate personal protective equipment. Guidelines recommended that intervention should focus on compensatory strategies, including bolus modification, maneuvers/postural changes, and therapeutic exercises that can be conducted with physical distancing. Respiratory training devices were not recommended during rehabilitation. Conclusions International associations have provided extensive guidance regarding the level of risk related to the management of dysphagia in this population. To date, there are no scientific papers offering disease and/or recovery profiling for patients with dysphagia and coronavirus disease 2019. As a result, research in this area is urgently needed.","Vergara, José; Skoretz, Stacey A; Brodsky, Martin B; Miles, Anna; Langmore, Susan E; Wallace, Sarah; Seedat, Jaishika; Starmer, Heather M; Bolton, Lee; Clavé, Pere; Freitas, Susana Vaz; Bogaardt, Hans; Matsuo, Koichiro; de Souza, Cinthia Madeira; Mourão, Lucia Figueiredo",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,654,1

What prevents this highly contagious virus from reaching the fetus? Is it only the presence of a strong placental barrier, or is it the natural absence of the some receptor that the viruses use for transmission? We, therefore, need to comprehensively understand the mechanism of action of the mammalian epithelial barriers located in two different organs with functional similarity. The barriers selected as potential targets by SARS-CoV-2 are the alveolo-capillary barrier (ACB), and the syncytio-capillary barrier (SCB). Caveolae are omega-shaped structures located on the cell membrane. They consist of caveolin-1 protein (Cav-1) and are involved in the internalisation of some viruses. By activating leukocytes and nuclear factor-&#954;B, Cav-1 initiates inflammatory reactions. The presence of more than one Cav-1 binding sites on coronavirus is an important finding supporting the possible relationship between SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung injury. While the ACB cells express Cav-1 there is no caveolin expression in syncytiotrophoblasts. In this short review, we will try to explain our hypothesis that the lack of caveolin expression in the SCB is one of the most important physiological mechanisms that prevents vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Since the physiological Cav-1 deficiency appears to prevent acute cell damage treatment algorithms could potentially be developed to block this pathway in the non-pregnant population affected by SARS-CoV-2.","Celik, Onder; Saglam, Aylin; Baysal, Bora; Derwig, Iris E; Celik, Nilufer; Ak, Mehmet; Aslan, Selma N; Ulas, Mustafa; Ersahin, Aynur; Tayyar, Ahter T; Duran, Bulent; Aydin, Suleyman",Placenta,654,33

New patients presenting to subspecialty clinics over a 2‐month pre‐COVID‐19 period completed a pre‐procedure survey about their priorities, then were asked to choose between topical oxymetazoline/lidocaine spray or none. A post‐procedure outcome survey followed.Of 151 patients, 90.1% patients elected to have topical anesthesia. Top patient priorities were “I want the scope to be easy for the doctor” and “I want to be as comfortable as possible.” Patients who strongly wanted to avoid medication (P = .002) and bad taste (P = .003) were more likely to select no spray, whereas those who wanted to avoid pain received anesthetic (P = .011). According to the post‐procedure assessment, 95.4% of patients were satisfied or strongly satisfied their choice, and this did not correlate with anesthetic vs none.Patient preferences are easily elicited and correlate with treatment choices. Most patients chose to have topical anesthetic and were willing to tolerate side effects;however, both patients with and without topical anesthetic were satisfied with their choices. This decision aid can be used to optimize shared decision making in the otolaryngology clinic. Given the aerosolizing potential of both spray and no spray conditions, this insight may be consequential when devising office protocols for post‐COVID‐19 practice.II.

Moreover, elevated D-dimer levels have been identified as an important prognostic marker in COVID-19 directly associated with disease severity and progression. Prophylactic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients might not be enough to prevent thrombotic events; therefore, therapeutic anticoagulation regimens deserve clinical investigation. DESIGN: ACTION is an academic-led, pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase IV clinical trial that aims to enroll around 600 patients at 40 sites participating in the Coalition COVID-19 Brazil initiative. Eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms up to 14 days and elevated D-dimer levels will be randomized to a strategy of full-dose anticoagulation for 30 days with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or full-dose heparin if oral administration is not feasible) vs standard of care with any approved venous thromboembolism prophylaxis regimen during hospitalization. A confirmation of COVID-19 was mandatory for study entry, based on specific tests used in clinical practice (RT-PCR, antigen test, IgM test) collected before randomization, regardless of in the outpatient setting or not. Randomization will be stratified by clinical stability at presentation. The primary outcome is a hierarchical analysis of mortality, length of hospital stay, or duration of oxygen therapy at the end of 30 days. Secondary outcomes include the World Health Organization's 8-point ordinal scale at 30 days and the following efficacy outcomes: incidence of venous thromboembolism , acute myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, major adverse limb events, duration of oxygen therapy, disease progression, and biomarkers. The primary safety outcomes are major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. SUMMARY: The ACTION trial will evaluate whether in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for stable patients, or enoxaparin for unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban through 30 days compared with standard prophylactic anticoagulation improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels.","Lopes, Renato D; de Barros E Silva, Pedro Gabriel Melo; Furtado, Remo H M; Macedo, Ariane Vieira Scarlatelli; Ramacciotti, Eduardo; Damini, Lucas Petri; Bronhara, Bruna; Cavalcanti, Alexandre B; Rosa, Regis G; Azevedo, Luciano C P; Veiga, Viviane C; Machado, Flávia R; Ritt, Luiz Eduardo; Martins, Priscilla de Aquino; Alexander, John H; Avezum, Alvaro; Berwanger, Otavio",Am Heart J,654,10

Both the AgNCs and the recognition elements are tunable, which is promising for the analysis of new viruses. Considering that a new virus such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently requires a facile sensing strategy, various virus detection strategies based on AgNCs including fluorescence enhancement, color change, quenching, and recovery are summarized. Particular emphasis is placed on the molecular analysis of viruses using DNA stabilized AgNCs (DNA-AgNCs), which detect the virus's genetic material. The more widespread applications of AgNCs for general virus detection are also discussed.

Viruses are submicroscopic infectious agents that replicate inside the living cells of different organisms. These viruses use nucleic acids (both DNA and RNA) for further replication and maturity inside the cells. Some of the viruses responsible for various human and plant diseases belong to the classes of Picornaviridae, Retroviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Pneumoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Hepadnaviridae, and their treatment options are limited or non-existent. The consistent reemergence and resistance development in the viral strains demands the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs possessing better efficacy. Bio-active compounds isolated from fungi can be the source of new compounds with enhanced potency and new mechanisms of action. Fungi are known to produce a diverse lot of secondary metabolites due to their existence in harsh climates which are often inhabitable for many organisms. Due to these unique environments, fungi produce a variety of secondary metabolites of different chemical classes like alkaloids, quinones, furanone, pyrones, benzopyranoids, xanthones, terpenes, steroids, peptides, and many acyclic compounds. Fungal metabolites are known to display a wide range of bioactive attributes, i.e., anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-Alzheimer's, along with antiviral properties. In this review article, we report over 300 antiviral compounds from fungal sources during the period of 2009 to 2019. The source of these compounds is marine and endophytic fungi and they are arranged based on their antiviral action against different viral families. These compounds are promising in their use and development as future antiviral drugs.","Deshmukh, Sunil K; Agrawal, Shivankar; Gupta, Manish Kumar; Patidar, Rajesh K; Ranjan, Nihar",Curr pharm. biotechnol,654,16

Despite the pandemic is raging in most parts of the world, in a few countries COVID-19 epidemics subsided due to successful implementations of intervention measures. A unifying perspective of the beginnings, middle stages, and endings of such completed COVID-19 epidemics is developed based on the order parameter and eigenvalue concepts of nonlinear physics, in general, and synergetics, in particular. To this end, a standard susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is used. It is shown that COVID-19 epidemic outbreaks follow a suitably defined SEIR order parameter. Intervention measures switch the eigenvalue of the order parameter from a positive to a negative value, and in doing so, stabilize the COVID-19 disease-free state. The subsiding of COVID-19 epidemics eventually follows the remnant of the order parameter of the infection dynamical system. These considerations are illustrated for the COVID-19 epidemic in Thailand from January to May 2020. The decay of effective contact rates throughout the three epidemic stages is demonstrated. Evidence for the sign-switching of the dominant eigenvalue is given and the order parameter and its stage-3 remnant are identified. The presumed impacts of interventions measures implemented in Thailand are discussed in this context.","Frank, T D; Chiangga, S",Phys. biol,654,28

A New Look Into The Association Between Depression and Cytokines -Two Case Reports,18.406616,7.407534,2020,"Background and aims: The outbreak of COVID-19 is currently a major concern, and timely understanding of people's mental health status in the workplace has become an important issue Physical-psychological parameters such as mental workload and job stress are among the most important components in determining the job performance of employees in work environments This study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on job stress and mental workload of employees in a chemical industry Methods: This longitudinal study was conducted in two stages (before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran) from December 2019 to May 2020 in a chemical industry in Bushehr province It should be noted that the first phase of this study was conducted before the outbreak of coronavirus in the form of a cross-sectional study However, after the outbreak of coronavirus and in order to investigate the changing trend in the parameters of mental workload and job stress among participants, this study was performed in two stages in the form of a longitudinal study The statistical population included all employees working in a chemical industry The sample size was calculated using Cochran's formula with an error level of 0 05 and included 182 workers who were selected by simple random sampling method The inclusion criterion was having at least one year of work experience and exclusion criteria were the presence of chronic mental illness, the use of sedatives, and insufficient willingness to participate in the study Participants were able to drop out of the study at any stage if they were unwilling Before starting the study and completing the questionnaires, all the necessary information about how to complete the questionnaires was explained to the staff and they expressed their willingness to take part in the study However, to prevent a decrease in the number of participants in the study, the number of employees who entered the study included 200 people (182 people + 10% of the total sample size (18 workers)) The NASA-TLX mental workload questionnaire and the HSE job stress questionnaire were used to evaluate mental workload and job stress, respectively The data collected during the present study were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistical software version 25 The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the normality of data distribution The findings of this statistical test showed that the distribution of data was normal in all cases (p &gt;0 05) Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency) were reported and statistical analysis was performed using paired sample t-test (to compare the mean of characteristics of the two psychological components of mental workload and job stress before and during the outbreak of coronavirus) as well as Chi-Square / Fisher's exact test All tests were performed at a significance level of 0 05 Results: The means of age and work experience of the subjects were 32 88±9 53 and 9 45±4 23 years, respectively The results of mental workload assessment based on the NASA-TLX index showed that the mean score of mental workload before and during the prevalence of coronavirus disease was 56 32± 9 58 and 66 45±11 82, respectively, and that there was a significant relationship between these values (p &lt;0 05) Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between the mean score of the dimensions of mental demand, overall performance, and frustration level before and during the outbreak of coronavirus It was also found that the average score of all aspects of mental workload, except for temporal demand and overall performance, increased during the outbreak of coronavirus The greatest increase was observed in the values of mental demand components and frustration level (Table 2) The results of the job stress assessment showed that the mean score of job stress before and during the outbreak of coronavirus disease was 80 78±18/29 and 68 88±12 74, respectively Moreover, it was found that the prevalence of coronavirus disease significantly increased the job stress level of employees (p 0 05) Ultimately, these findings showed a significant relationship between the values of mental workload and job stress in employees before and during the coronavirus disease (p&lt;0 05) Conclusion: An examination of people's mental workload based on the NASA-TLX index revealed that the prevalence of COVID-19 significantly increased the mental workload of the studied staff It was found that the mean values of the dimensions of mental demand and the frustration level were significantly increased at the time of the outbreak of COVID-19 The findings revealed that the prevalence of COVID-19 had increased the level of mental workload imposed on employees, as well as the level of frustration, insecurity, and stress of employees when performing their duties It was also found that the COVID-19 epidemic significantly reduced employee performance, making staff less satisfied with their overall performance in the workplace Previous studies have also shown that the spread of viral diseases can increase a person's workload, which is consistent with the results of the present study The study revealed that occupational stress levels increased during the outbreak of coronavirus Previous studies have shown that the spread of viral diseases such as Mers and COVID-19 increases the level of anxiety, stress, insomnia, and depression among people A study by Kim et al revealed that after the outbreak of viral diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV), a person's level of burnout and stress increased, which could severely affect a one’s job performance, which is in tandem with the results of the present study The present study was conducted for the first time to investigate the effect of coronavirus outbreak on physical-psychological components in the industrial sector in Iran Therefore, the results of the present study can provide a novel insight into the impact of coronavirus epidemic on the components of mental workload and job stress in different work environments The findings of the present study revealed that the prevalence of coronavirus disease has been able to affect different physical and psychological dimensions of personnel in the workplace Therefore, psychological intervention is essential to improve the mental health of employees during and

With COVID-19 halting hundreds of federal trials involving non-COVID-19 research, mentors and mentees must also consider the broader moral calling of contributing to COVID-19 research. At the time of writing, the National Institutes of Health had responded to the pandemic with significant funding for COVID-19 research. However, because this pandemic is a new phenomenon, few mentors have expertise in the disease and relevant established resources. As a result, many mentors are unable to provide insight on COVID-19 research to early career investigators considering a pivot toward research related to this disease. The authors suggest 4 ways for mentees and mentors to respond to the changes the pandemic has brought to research funding and opportunities: (1) include COVID-19 research in existing portfolios to diversify intellectual opportunities and reduce funding risks; (2) negotiate the mentor-mentee relationship and roles and expectations early in project discussions-considering, as relevant, the disproportionate burden of home responsibilities often borne by early career faculty members who are women and/or from a minority group; (3) address any mentor limitations in content expertise; and (4) if the decision is to pivot to COVID-19 research, select projects with implications generalizable beyond this pandemic to other infectious outbreaks or to the redesign of health care delivery. Mentors and mentees must weigh the relevance of COVID-19 research projects to the postpandemic world and the amount of available funding against the developing interests of early career investigators. Academic medical centers nationwide must enable seasoned and early career researchers to contribute meaningfully to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 research.","Gettel, Cameron J; Venkatesh, Arjun K",Acad Med,654,3

This study aimed to estimate the long-term impacts of the pandemic on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada using a mathematical model. MethodsWe developed a stochastic microsimulation model to estimate the cancer care disruptions and its long-term impact on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada. The model reproduces cancer incidence, survival, and epidemiology in Canada, by using cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis and survival data from the Canadian Cancer Registries. We modeled reported declines in cancer diagnoses and treatments recorded in provincial administrative datasets from March 2020-June 2021. We assumed that diagnostic and treatment delays lead to an increased rate of death. Based on the literature, we assumed each 4-week delay in diagnosis and treatment would lead to a 6% to 50% higher rate of cancer death. Results are the median predictions of 10 stochastic simulations. FindingsThe model predicts that cancer care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 21,247 (2{middle dot}0%) more cancer deaths in Canada in 2020-2030, assuming treatment capacity is recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels in 2021. This represents 355,172 life years lost expected due to pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays. The highest absolute expected excess cancer mortality was predicted in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, and in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Diagnostic and treatment capacity in 2021 onwards highly influenced the number of predicted cancer deaths over the next decade. InterpretationCancer care disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to significant life loss; however, most of these could be mitigated by increasing diagnostic and treatment capacity in the post-pandemic era to address the service backlog. FundingCanadian Institutes of Health Research Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe performed a review of modeling studies predicting the impact of pandemic-induced disruptions to cancer care on cancer survival outcomes. We searched MEDLINE on 2 July 2021 for records published from 1 January 2020 with no language restrictions. Our search consisted of index keywords [Cancer AND COVID-19 AND [(delay AND diagnosis) OR (delay AND screening) OR (delay AND treatment)] AND outcomes AND modelling study]. We identified 14 studies that model the long-term effect of disruptions to cancer screening programs, diagnostic intervals, and to treatment intervals for common cancers. Most studies (9/14) assessed the impact of cancer screening disruptions but did not assume any treatment disruptions. Disruptions to cancer screening services in high income health systems were estimated to lead to small increases in cancer incidence and mortality, even with immediate resumption of screening to services after disruption periods. Fewer studies examined the impact of diagnostic referral and treatment disruptions; these are similarly predicted to lead to increases in cancer incidence and mortality, with varying impacts depending on cancer site. Due to difficulties in obtaining real-time healthcare data, previous studies have relied on assumptions regarding the duration of health care disruptions (1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, to 24-months) rather than on empirical data. All studies restricted their analysis to the impact on a single or a few cancer sites. Added value of this studyOur stochastic microsimulation model is the first to assess the population-level impact of diagnostic and treatment disruptions on overall cancer mortality across all sites. Using Canadian cancer statistics and expert validation of treatment modalities, we constructed a model that reproduced pre-pandemic cancer mortality data. An important added value of this analysis compared to previous studies was that we were able to integrate empirical data on cancer-related procedures during the pandemic era to model disruptions to cancer care. Implications of all the available evidenceWe estimate there could be a 2{middle dot}0% increase over expected cancer mortality between 2020-2030 in Canada due to pandemic-related disruptions to diagnostic and treatment intervals. Our results identified that a 10-20% increase in cancer care service capacity over pre-pandemic levels could prevent a considerable amount of the predicted excess cancer-related deaths by reducing diagnostic and treatment backlogs. By stratifying our reported outcomes by sex, age, province, and cancer site, we provide a long-term perspective that can inform post-pandemic public health policy or aid in prioritization of patients in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19. While our model is specific to Canada, it could be applied to countries that have experienced comparable COVID-19-related healthcare disruptions.","Malagón, Talía; Yong, Jean Hai Ein; Tope, Parker; Miller, Wilson H.; Franco, Eduardo L.; Care, - McGill Task Force on the Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Control and",,654,24

Events before a quarantine, implemented on March 16th, 2020, and events from 2018 to 19 were used for reference. Encounters were characterized by injuries, services, procedures, and disposition. Categorical variables were analyzed by the &#967;2 test, proportions of variables by z-score test, and non-parametric variables by Fisher's exact test. A total of 1,336 traumas were identified, with 31% from the academic center and 69% from the community center. During the post-policy period, relative to matching periods in years prior, there was a decrease in number of TBI and spinal fractures (24% versus 41%, p < 0.001) and neurosurgical consults (27% versus 39%, p < 0.003), but not in number of neurosurgical admissions or procedures. There were no changes in frequency of neurosurgery consults among total traumas, patients triaged to critical care services, or patients discharged to temporary rehabilitation services. Neurosurgical services were similarly rendered between the academic and community hospitals. This study describes neurosurgical trauma management in a suburban healthcare network immediately following restrictive quarantine during a moderate COVID-19 outbreak.

When the available real-life data are visualized for a number of European countries, they reveal the commonly seen exponential increase, though with different absolute rates, and over time different periods. More interesting information is obtained upon inspection of the daily increments in deaths. These curves look very similar to those for China, and seem to indicate that in European countries that have imposed more strict human-human contact measures, in particular Italy and Spain, where we have seen a decrease in daily deaths since early April, it is to be expected it will take 40-50 days from the end of March until this number has fallen to negligible levels. Taking the initial increase in the number of deaths for Germany, and combining this with typical values for the mortality reported in the literature and the published number of daily contacts for the working population, we calculated an initial increase in infections of 20 per day by a single infected person with an average human-human contact number of 22, decreasing to 5.5 after the first 10 days.

While a bacterial invader may initially act as a parasite or pathogen, a subsequent mutualistic relationship can emerge in which the endosymbiotic bacteria and their host share metabolites. While the environment of the host cell provides improved stability when compared to an extracellular environment, the endosymbiont population must still cope with changing conditions, including variable nutrient concentrations, the host cell cycle, host developmental programs, and host genetic variation. Furthermore, the eukaryotic host can deploy mechanisms actively preventing a bacterial return to a pathogenic state.

We suggest that studying TCS maintenance or loss may be informative about the evolutionary pathway taken toward endosymbiosis, or even toward endosymbiont-to-organelle conversion.","Dunn, Cory D; Somborac, Tamara; Akpinar, Bala Ani",Results Probl Cell Differ,654,20

Continuous, unresolved dyspnea often indicates the progression of lung lesions. The mechanism that underlies the chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19 is still unclear. Chest CT has a higher sensitivity and can play an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. However, our clinical observations showed that although some patients had significant chest distress and dyspnea, the lesions that were observed in the lungs during computed tomography were milder and not completely consistent with clinical symptoms. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, and imaging findings of these patients. We found that extensive inflammation of the bilateral and respiratory bronchioles in patients with COVID-19 due to excessive activation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic aggregation of T-lymphocytes at the site of inflammation are possible mechanisms underlying chest distress and dyspnea in patients with COVID-19. Short-time and lose-dose use of corticosteroid may be helpful to treat chest tightness and dyspnea in mild COVID-19 patients. Through this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Nie, Shuke; Han, Shoumeng; Ouyang, Huangqing; Zhang, Zhan",Respir Med,654,26

METHODS: A prospective de-identified electronic survey was distributed to adults with self-reported facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), myotonic dystrophy (DM), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) enrolled in national registries or with patient advocacy groups. The COVID-19 Impact Survey was developed by muscular dystrophy experts in association with patient collaborators and advocacy groups. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 774: 56% FSHD; 35% DM, and 9% LGMD) were mostly women and middle-aged (range 19-87 y). Rates of COVID-19 infections were low (<1%), compliance with local social distancing guidelines and policies high (98%). Major challenges reported during the pandemic included: obtaining treatment (40%), managing stress (37%), social distancing (36%), and obtaining essentials (34%). The majority reported a slight worsening in their disease state. Respondents reported moderate stress levels (stress score = 15.4; range = 0-35), with higher stress levels reported by women and those under age 30 y. Three-quarters of participants who participated in telemedicine visits were satisfied with the encounters; however, most reported a preference for in-person visits. DISCUSSION: People with muscular dystrophy reported moderate stress and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions such as exercise and stress-coping strategies, including strategies specific to women or individuals <30 y, may be important. Further investigation is needed into the role of telemedicine in the care of individuals with muscular dystrophy.","Eichinger, Katy; Lewis, Leann; Dilek, Nuran; Higgs, Kiley; Walker, Michaela; Palmer, David; Cooley, John M; Johnson, Nicholas; Tawil, Rabi; Statland, Jeffrey",Muscle nerve,654,1

Anova Health Institute (Anova) is the PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) District Support Partner for the Johannesburg, Cape Town, Sedibeng, Capricorn and Mopani districts in South Africa, operating in public sector primary healthcare facilities. At the time of the emergence of COVID-19, Anova employed close to 4 000 people: 41% community health workers (CHWs), 23% data staff, 20% nurses and doctors, 12% management/support and 5% allied HCWs. OBJECTIVES: To describe rates of COVID-19 diagnosis in Anova-employed HCWs in five districts. METHODS: Employees exposed to, tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 were required to report the event. These reports were compiled into a database to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce. We kept a timeline of key events occurring at national and district level, including Anova's policies and their implementation, that was used to describe organisational response. We described the number of confirmed cases, cumulative incidence rates and testing rates, broken down by district and job category. We estimated expected deaths and the effect on time off work. RESULTS: Of Anova employees, 14% (n=562) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the end of September 2020. Cumulative incidence was highest in Sedibeng (29%) and lowest in Mopani (5%). All HCWs experienced high incidences: data staff 17%, allied HCWs 16%, CHWs 14%, nurses and doctors 13%, and management/support 11%. At the peak of the epidemic, for 5 weeks, &gt;5% of employees were unable to work owing to exposure or infection, significantly disrupting service delivery. The additional administrative burden on managers was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: It is critical that all cadres of HCWs are protected in the workplace, including in primary care settings, where better structuresare needed to perform risk assessments and conduct outbreak investigations. CHWs and data staff may be at higher risk owing to poor infrastructure, limited power to negotiate working conditions, and limited experience of infection prevention and control. Their working conditions must be improved to reduce their risk.","Rees, K; Dunlop, J L; Patel-Abrahams, S; Struthers, H; McIntyre, J A",S Afr Med J,654,25

The S protein was incorporated into the recovered rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 particles, which could be neutralized by sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 also displayed entry characteristics similar to the wild type virus, such as cell tropism and pH-dependence. The neutralizing titers of antibodies and sera measured by rVSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 were highly correlated with those measured by wild-type viruses or pseudoviruses. Therefore, this is a safe and convenient screening tool for SARS-CoV-2, and it may promote the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.","Li, Hongyue; Zhao, Chaoyue; Zhang, Yuhang; Yuan, Fei; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Xuanling; Zhang, Linqi; Qin, Chengfeng; Zheng, Aihua",Emerg Microbes Infect,654,24

We aimed to investigate what changes the COVID-19 pandemic can cause in patients with epilepsy on drug compliance and stigmatization. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Modified Morisky Scale (MMS) and stigmatization scales were used between October and November 2019 to assess drug compliance and stigmatization in epilepsy patients. These scales were renewed in June and July 2020 in the same patient group to assess the impact of the epidemic on drug compliance and stigmatization in patients with epilepsy. Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were recorded in SPSS. The interviews were conducted during the interictal period. Paired-samples t-test was used to compare the stigma scale results of epilepsy patients before and during COVID-19. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare MMS groups before and during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were included in the study. There was no significant difference between the pre-pandemic and pandemic period in epilepsy stigma scale used to evaluate stigmatization levels in patients. During the pandemic period, it was observed that patients had higher motivation and higher knowledge than before the pandemic (pâ¯=â¯0.048). There were seven patients (6.4%) whose seizure frequency increased during the pandemic period. There were two patients (1.8%) who had difficulty in accessing drugs during the pandemic period. In multivariate analysis, only parameter that predicted an increase in seizure frequency was the number of drugs used In the of COVID-19 period. In correlation analysis, a negative correlation was found between the stigma total score during COVID-19 period and education level. CONCLUSION: A slight increase in the frequency of seizures was observed in our patients during the pandemic period, and no significant problem was experienced in accessing drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic made patients more motivated and informed in drug compliance in the patient group and had no effect on stigmatization.","Gul, Zeynep Bastug; Atakli, Hayrunisa Dilek",Epilepsy Behav,654,1

In the light of challenging economic and political circumstances, putting their community wellbeing as a priority, and abiding by quarantine and strict infection control measures, health care professionals risk both their physical and mental wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the psychosocial effects of being quarantined following exposure to COVID-19 among Lebanese health care professionals. METHOD: An exploratory qualitative research design was employed, where semi-structured interviews were carried out involving a sample of 13 Lebanese health care providers working at various COVID-19 units. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis has revealed four themes namely 'Fears of contracting and spreading the virus', 'Conflict between professional duty and family obligation', 'Stigma of being infected', and 'Inadequate or inaccurate information'. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 quarantine has been posing intense psychological challenges among Lebanese health care workers which are worsened at times by the economic instability; thus, health care policymakers are urged to take proper action nationwide to alleviate longlisting implications and support the health care providers in fulfilling their mission.","Fawaz, Mirna; Samaha, Ali",Int J Soc Psychiatry,654,10

Despite these fundamental advantages, the power and impact of protein-based agents are substantially undermined, only acting on a limited number of extracellular targets because macrobiomolecules cannot spontaneously cross the cell membrane. Conventional protein delivery techniques fail to address this fundamental problem in that protein cargos are predominantly delivered inside cells via endocytosis, a remarkably effective cell defense mechanism developed by Mother Nature to prevent intact biomolecules from entering the cytoplasm. Here, we report a unique concept, noncovalent cholesterol tagging, enabling virtually any compact proteins to permeate through the cell membrane, completely bypassing endocytosis.

We analyzed the impact of this triage plan on the only academic neurosurgery center in San Diego County, California, USA. METHODS: We conducted a de-identified retrospective review of all operative cases and procedures performed by the Department of Neurosurgery from November 24, 2019, through July 6, 2020, a 226-day period. Statistical analysis involved 2-sample z tests assessing daily case totals over the 113-day periods before and after implementation of the OR triage plan on March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The neurosurgical service performed 1429 surgical and interventional radiologic procedures over the study period.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents an overview of massive market disturbances that is observed across multiple service sectors based on current news reports. It then develops themes for timely and actionable research for service scholars. Findings: The outbreak of COVID-19 demonstrates that both service industries and the service research community face a new reality, something that we are not well-prepared to handle. A new framework is needed to understand the impact of such virus outbreaks, and current service marketing concepts need to be re-investigated from a new perspective.

This paper examines the applicability of the logistic growth model, with implications for the study of the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases. METHODS: An NLS (Non-Linear Least Squares) method was employed to estimate the parameters of a differentiated logistic growth function using new daily COVID-19 cases in multiple regions in China and in other selected countries. The estimation was based upon training data from January 20, 2020 to March 13, 2020. A restriction test was subsequently implemented to examine whether a designated parameter was identical among regions or countries, and the diagnosis of residuals was also conducted. The model's goodness of fit was checked using testing data from March 14, 2020 to April 18, 2020. RESULTS: The model presented in this paper fitted time-series data exceedingly well for the whole of China, its eleven selected provinces and municipalities, and two other countries - South Korea and Iran - and provided estimates of key parameters. This study rejected the null hypothesis that the growth rates of outbreaks were the same among ten selected non-Hubei provinces in China, as well as between South Korea and Iran. The study found that the model did not provide reliable estimates for countries that were in the early stages of outbreaks. Furthermore, this study concured that the R2 values might vary and mislead when compared between different portions of the same non-linear curve. In addition, the study identified the existence of heteroskedasticity and positive serial correlation within residuals in some provinces and countries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that there is potential for this model to contribute to better public health policy in combatting COVID-19. The model does so by providing a simple logistic framework for retrospectively analyzing outbreaks in regions that have already experienced a maximal proliferation in cases. Based upon statistical findings, this study also outlines certain challenges in modelling and their implications for the results.","Shen, Christopher Y",Int J Infect Dis,654,26

However, a minority feel that they have received adequate instruction in medical school. This novel supplemental reproductive and sexual health curriculum at a large academic medical center aimed to address this gap and to improve attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about sexual and reproductive health topics among learners. METHODS: Students participated in a series of sexual and reproductive health workshops taught by interdisciplinary health care workers, with the first cohort in a classroom setting and the second cohort using a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered a novel pre- and postcourse survey to assess attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about the topics. We performed unpaired 1-tailed t tests and &#967;2 tests to compare the scores on the pre- and postcourse surveys. RESULTS: Sample size was 12 students for the first cohort and 23 students for the second cohort. Reported levels of comfort with taking sexual histories in different age groups and discussing reproductive and sexual health topics increased significantly: 0.92 for the classroom setting, and 0.50 for the virtual setting, with an average increase of 0.65 points on a 4-point Likert scale. There were no significant changes in student attitudes toward or knowledge of reproductive and sexual health. CONCLUSION: This course elaborated on topics to which medical students traditionally lack adequate exposure, with significant improvement in comfort counseling patients.

The current meta-analysis aimed to find risk factors for the COVID-19-related death, helping to enhance the efficacy and reduce the mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and Cochrane Library for articles published between January 1, 2020, and April 13, 2020. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of the COVID-19 deceased with meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2401 patients in 15 articles were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that 66.6% of COVID-19 deceased were male, with a median age of 69.9 years. Common symptoms of deceased included fever (70.6-100%), dyspnea (38.89-85.7%), cough (22.4-78%), and fatigue (22-61.9%). The incidence of hypertension, chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic cerebrovascular disease among the COVID-19 deceased were 38.56% (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.84 ~ 52.12%), 17.54% (95% CI 13.38 ~ 21.69%), 22.2% (95% CI 19.30 ~ 25.10%), and 15.58% (95% CI 10.05 ~ 21.12%), respectively. Compared with the surviving COVID-19 patients, the deceased had lower platelet levels (mean difference (MD) = - 39.35, 95% CI - 55.78 ~ - 22.93) and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD = 80.85, 95% CI 62.53 ~ 99.18) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (MD = 246.65, 95% CI 157.43 ~ 335.88) at admission. The most common complications of the deceased were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 100.36, 95% CI 64.44 ~ 156.32) and shock (OR = 96.60, 95% CI 23.80 ~ 392.14). CONCLUSION: Most of the COVID-19 deceased were elderly males. Fever, dyspnea, dry cough, fatigue, hypertension, chronic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and laboratory examinations showed low levels of platelet content, increased CRP and LDH were associated with the risk of dying. ARDS and shock were risk factors for death in COVID-19 patients.","Qiu, Peishan; Zhou, Yunjiao; Wang, Fan; Wang, Haizhou; Zhang, Meng; Pan, Xingfei; Zhao, Qiu; Liu, Jing",Aging Clin Exp Res,654,20

This virus is transmitted directly or indirectly through the upper aerodigestive tract. As it is evident from the recent studies that SARS-CoV-2 requires host enzyme Furin to activate receptor binding domain of its S protein and host Angiotensin Convertase Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required as binding receptor, facilitating the entry of virus into the host cell. Evidence from literature shows that oral cancer tissues as well as paracarcinoma tissue exhibit higher expression of both Furin and ACE2, giving rise to the hypothesis that patients with oral cancer have higher chances of SARS CoV2 infection. It is also hypothesised that there will be increased severity of disease due to facilitated entry of the virus into the cells. Therefore, we suggest oral cancer patients require extra attention during COVID-19 pandemic and re-evaluation of current treatment paradigms in oral oncology is also needed.","Chauhan, Anshika; Ghoshal, Sushmita; Pal, Arnab",Med Hypotheses,654,21

In a survey, we investigated the influence of COVID-19 on the care of NET patients in the German speaking countries Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The multidisciplinarity of all treating physicians in the outpatient and inpatient sector was reflected in our survey. Furthermore, we were able to present findings pertaining to the university and non-university medical care. Overall, only a minority of appointments were cancelled, mostly as a result of medical prioritization and less for fear of infection by patients. In the university sector, longer delays for diagnostic measures were observed in comparison to non-university care. During the COVID-19 crisis, NET patients rarely changed their current therapy, but the pandemic impacted the assessment of the different treatment modalities at risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. This survey provides the first real-world data on the treatment of NET patients from the physicians' perspective during the COVID-19 crisis.

But, in contrast with acute settings, relatively little attention has been given to those who work in mental health settings. We aimed to characterise the experiences of those working in English NHS secondary mental health services during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: The design was a qualitative interview-based study. We conducted semi-structured, remote (telephone or online) interviews with 35 members of staff from NHS secondary (inpatient and community) mental health services in England. Analysis was based on the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Participants reported wide-ranging changes in the organisation of secondary mental health care and the nature of work in response to the pandemic, including pausing of all services deemed to be ""non-essential"", deployment of staff across services to new and unfamiliar roles, and moves to remote working. The quality of participants' working life was impaired by increasing levels of daily challenge associated with trying to provide care in trying and constrained circumstances, the problems of forging new ways of working remotely, and constraints on ability to access informal support. Participants were confronted with difficult dilemmas relating to clinical decision-making, prioritisation of care, and compromises in ability to perform the therapeutic function of their roles. Other dilemmas centred on trying to balance the risks of controlling infection with the need for human contact. Many reported features of moral injury linked to their perceived failures in providing the quality or level of care that they felt service users needed. They sometimes sought to compensate for deficits in care through increased advocacy, taking on additional tasks, or making exceptions, but this led to further personal strain. Many experienced feelings of grief, helplessness, isolation, distress, and burnout. These problems were compounded by sometimes poor communication about service changes and by staff feeling that they could not take time off because of the potential impact on others. Some reported feeling poorly supported by organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health workers faced multiple adversities during the pandemic that were highly consequential for their wellbeing. These findings can help in identifying targets for support.","Liberati, Elisa; Richards, Natalie; Willars, Janet; Scott, David; Boydell, Nicola; Parker, Jennie; Pinfold, Vanessa; Martin, Graham; Dixon-Woods, Mary; Jones, Peter B",BMC Psychiatry,654,5

METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7-100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7-97.8) and 100% (96.1-100). Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% (79.8-89.0) and 81.1% (76.6-85.7), p < 0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the three IgG anti-N assays (Abbott, Mikrogen, Euroimmun) than for the two IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin, Euroimmun) (&#8805;50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12 and p < 0.05 for percent seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. DISCUSSION: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population.","Van Elslande, Jan; Decru, Bram; Jonckheere, Stijn; Van Wijngaerden, Eric; Houben, Els; Vandecandelaere, Patricia; Indevuyst, Christophe; Depypere, Melissa; Desmet, Stefanie; André, Emmanuel; Van Ranst, Marc; Lagrou, Katrien; Vermeersch, Pieter",Clin Microbiol Infect,654,26

The spine surgery department took measures to manage the patients, medical staff and wards to avoid the cross-infection within hospital. During the outbreak, no patients or healthcare workers were infected, and no treatment was delayed due to these measures. The prevention and control measures effectively reduced the risk of nosocomial transmission between health workers and patients while providing optimum care.

METHODS: A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across five acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand five hundred eighty-four blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst all CoNS BSI were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p = 0.013), CoNS central line associated BSIs (CLABSI) (p < 0.01) and CoNS non-CLABSI (p < 0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation. S. pneumoniae (p = 0.631) and S. aureus (p = 0.617) BSI did not vary significant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer than expected Enterobacterales BSI occurred during the UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic; identifying potential causes, including potential unintended consequences of national self-isolation public health messaging, is essential. High rates of CoNS BSI, with evidence of increased CLABSI, but also likely contamination associated with increased use of personal protective equipment, may result in inappropriate antimicrobial use and indicates a clear area for intervention during further waves.","Denny, Sarah; Rawson, Timothy M; Hart, Peter; Satta, Giovanni; Abdulaal, Ahmed; Hughes, Stephen; Gilchrist, Mark; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke S P",BMC Infect Dis,654,26

Odds ratios and hazard ratios were calculated using multilevel, mixed-effects logistic regression and Cox regression, adjusting for repeated measures within individual patients.

Comparing patients having and lacking a regular source of medical care and other ED patient characteristics, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for not wanting the vaccine, perceived access to vaccine sites, and willingness to get the vaccine as part of ED care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted from December 10, 2020, to March 7, 2021, at 15 safety net US EDs. Primary outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and sites (including EDs) for potential COVID-19 vaccine receipt. RESULTS: Of 2,575 patients approached, 2,301 (89.4%) participated. Of the 18.4% of respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care, 65% used the ED as their usual source of health care. The overall rate of vaccine hesitancy was 39%; the range among the 15 sites was 28% to 58%. Respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care were more commonly vaccine hesitant than those who had a regular source of medical care (47% versus 38%, 9% difference, 95% confidence interval 4% to 14%). Other characteristics associated with greater vaccine hesitancy were younger age, female sex, Black race, Latinx ethnicity, and not having received an influenza vaccine in the past 5 years. Of the 61% who would accept a COVID-19 vaccine, 21% stated that they lacked a primary physician or clinic at which to receive it; the vast majority (95%) of these respondents would accept the COVID-19 vaccine as part of their care in the ED. CONCLUSION: ED patients who lack a regular source of medical care are particularly hesitant regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Most COVID-19 vaccine acceptors would accept it as part of their care in the ED. EDs may play pivotal roles in COVID-19 vaccine messaging and delivery to highly vulnerable populations.","Rodriguez, Robert M; Torres, Jesus R; Chang, Anna Marie; Haggins, Adrianne N; Eucker, Stephanie A; O039,; Laughlin, Kelli N; Anderson, Erik; Miller, Daniel G; Wilkerson, R Gentry; Caldwell, Martina; Lim, Stephen C; Raja, Ali S; Baumann, Brigitte M; Graterol, Joseph; Eswaran, Vidya; Chinnock, Brian",Ann. emerg. med,654,24

Guided by dual-process theories of information processing, we establish how the two different information processing modes (system 1: heuristic processing; system 2: systematic processing) are influenced by individuals' responsibility attribution, discrete negative emotions, and risk perception. In an experiment, participants were exposed to a news article that either blames China (n = 445) or does not blame China (n = 498) for the pandemic. Results reveal that exposure to the responsibility attribution frame led individuals to engage in more heuristic processing, but it did not influence systematic processing. Discrete negative emotions and risk perception mediated the relationship between responsibility attribution and information processing. The indirect relationships suggest a more intricate process underlying heuristic processing and systematic processing. In particular, information processing styles seem to be determined by social judgment surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.","Wong, Jody Chin Sing; Yang, Janet Zheng; Liu, Zhuling; Lee, David; Yue, Zhiying",Risk anal,654,16

Furthermore, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for 2 subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, whereas the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the men who have sex with men and non-Japanese subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS. Continuously monitoring the situation and securing sufficient test resources by use of self-testing is essential to understand the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Yamamoto, Nao; Rosenberg, Molly; Ludema, Christina; Bento, Ana I; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Ichikawa, Seiichi; Mizushima, Daisuke; Iwami, Shingo",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,654,15

Documenting the benefits can help drive more ambitious and health-protective climate change mitigation actions; however, documenting the adverse health effects can help to avoid them. Estimating the health effects of mitigation (HEM) actions can help policy makers prioritize investments based not only on mitigation potential but also on expected health benefits. To date, however, the wide range of incompatible approaches taken to developing and reporting HEM estimates has limited their comparability and usefulness to policymakers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort was to generate guidance for modeling studies on scoping, estimating, and reporting population health effects from climate change mitigation actions. METHODS: An expert panel of HEM researchers was recruited to participate in developing guidance for conducting HEM studies. The primary literature and a synthesis of HEM studies were provided to the panel. Panel members then participated in a modified Delphi exercise to identify areas of consensus regarding HEM estimation. Finally, the panel met to review and discuss consensus findings, resolve remaining differences, and generate guidance regarding conducting HEM studies. RESULTS: The panel generated a checklist of recommendations regarding stakeholder engagement: HEM modeling, including model structure, scope and scale, demographics, time horizons, counterfactuals, health response functions, and metrics; parameterization and reporting; approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; accounting for policy uptake; and discounting. DISCUSSION: This checklist provides guidance for conducting and reporting HEM estimates to make them more comparable and useful for policymakers. Harmonization of HEM estimates has the potential to lead to advances in and improved synthesis of policy-relevant research that can inform evidence-based decision making and practice. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6745.","Hess, Jeremy J; Ranadive, Nikhil; Boyer, Chris; Aleksandrowicz, Lukasz; Anenberg, Susan C; Aunan, Kristin; Belesova, Kristine; Bell, Michelle L; Bickersteth, Sam; Bowen, Kathryn; Burden, Marci; Campbell-Lendrum, Diarmid; Carlton, Elizabeth; Cissé, Guéladio; Cohen, Francois; Dai, Hancheng; Dangour, Alan David; Dasgupta, Purnamita; Frumkin, Howard; Gong, Peng; Gould, Robert J; Haines, Andy; Hales, Simon; Hamilton, Ian; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Hashizume, Masahiro; Honda, Yasushi; Horton, Daniel E; Karambelas, Alexandra; Kim, Ho; Kim, Satbyul Estella; Kinney, Patrick L; Kone, Inza; Knowlton, Kim; Lelieveld, Jos; Limaye, Vijay S; Liu, Qiyong; Madaniyazi, Lina; Martinez, Micaela Elvira; Mauzerall, Denise L; Milner, James; Neville, Tara; Nieuwenhuijsen, Mark; Pachauri, Shonali; Perera, Frederica; Pineo, Helen; Remais, Justin V; Saari, Rebecca K; Sampedro, Jon; Scheelbeek, Pauline",Environ Health Perspect,654,1

Increased risk of pulmonary embolism and thrombosis has been identified in COVID-19 patients, alongside accompanying elevations in potential prognostic biomarkers, including D-dimer, IL-6 and cardiac specific troponins. Our aim was to provide a scoping review of the available literature regarding thrombosis risk, other cardiovascular implications, and their biomarkers in COVID-19 to highlight potential disease mechanisms. METHODS: Authors conducted a literature search in PubMed using MeSH headings ""disseminated intravascular coagulation"", ""pulmonary embolism"", ""thromb*"", ""stroke"", ""myocardial infarction"" and ""acute lung injury"", as well as terms ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"" and ""2019-nCoV"". RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 disease is characterised by the interactions between hyperactive coagulation and complement systems - induced by hyper-inflammatory conditions, resulting in a pro-thrombotic state and diffuse tissue injury. There are several promising prognostic markers of disease severity, with D-dimer the most significant. The presence of thrombocytopenia appears to be a key indicator of patient deterioration. Further research is required to understand the underlying pathophysiology in COVID-19 and its implications in disease progression and patient management. Randomised trials are urgently needed to determine the safety of proposed therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and the role for anti-platelet agents, such as Ticagrelor, in patient management.","Page, Eden M; Ariëns, Robert A S",Thromb Res,654,1

Using Brexit and the corona pandemic as examples of shocks, the heterogeneity of regional and sectoral impacts on firms is shown. Although exposures to and potentials of shocks can be identified for regions (speculatively, as both shocks have not materialized fully yet), translation of these into policy measures that address firms’ selective competitive needs is challenging. Many impacts are generated and distributed along market and competition relations, which are not always sensitive to (the same) place-based policies. A discussion on policies that link to a broader interpretation of resilience (of both repair and renewal) is presented, and a research agenda is adhered that more extensively explores how local policies can be implemented in the multilevel network-region-firm structure of impacts. © Società editrice il Mulino.","van Oort, F.; Thissen, M.",Scienze Regionali,654,2

A model is said to be structurally unidentifiable, if different quantitative sets of parameters provide the same observable outcome. This is typical (but not exclusive) of partially observed problems in which only a few variables can be experimentally measured. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature.","Castro, Mario; de Boer, Rob J",PLoS Comput Biol,654,1

In this study, we examine if 360° videos can promote increased engagement over standard two-dimensional (2D) videos among medical students learning anatomy. We enrolled 39 fourth-year medical students to watch two four-minute videos of anatomy lab exercises in a 360° three-dimensional format using an immersive headset or in a 2D format on a laptop computer. Every two minutes, students were asked to rate their engagement from 0-100. Following the videos, they reported their degree of agreement with 14 statements related to engagement, practicality, and interest in the technology. While watching the videos, the average engagement reported by the 360° video group was higher at each time point than the engagement reported by the two-dimensional group. Further, the engagement remained high in the 360° group through the six- and eight-minute timepoints. In the post-video survey, the 360° group reported a statistically significantly higher average engagement in seven of eight measures on the assessment. A 360° video was rated as more practical and interesting than a two-dimensional video. No significant difference existed in the perceived ease of learning. Overall, the use of 360° video may improve engagement for short videos used in medical education. However, developing a better understanding of its impact on learning outcomes will be critical for determining the overall value and effectiveness of this tool.","Chan, V.; Larson, N. D.; Moody, D.

Identifying the factors that affect high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I may indicate the cause of cardiac injury in elderly patients, and this could hopefully assist in protecting heart function in this patient population. METHODS: One hundred and eighty inpatients who were admitted for COVID-19 were screened. Patients older than 60 years were included in this study, and the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of the cohort were analyzed. The correlation between cardiac injury and clinical/laboratory variables was statistically analyzed, and further logistic regression was performed to determine how these variables influence cardiac injury in geriatric patients. RESULTS: Age (p < 0.001) significantly correlated with cardiac injury, whereas sex (p = 0.372) and coexisting diseases did not.

STUDY DESIGN: We estimated the number of clinical visits and clinical contacts (any worker a patient may come into physical contact with during their visit) under the current policy landscape, compared to the number of visits and contacts if the following regulations were repealed: (1) State mandatory in-person counseling visit laws that necessitate two visits for abortion, (2) State mandatory-ultrasound laws, (3) State mandates requiring the prescribing clinician be present during mifepristone administration, (4) Federal Food and Drug Administration Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone. If these laws were repealed, ""no-test"" telemedicine abortion would be possible for some patients. We modeled the number of visits averted if a minimum of 15 percent or a maximum of 70 percent of medication abortion patients had a ""no-test"" telemedicine abortion. RESULTS: We estimate that 12,742 in-person clinic visits (50,978 clinical contacts) would be averted each month if counseling visit laws alone were repealed, and 31,132 visits (142,910 clinical contacts) would be averted if all four policies were repealed and 70 percent of medication abortion patients received no-test telemedicine abortions. Over 2 million clinical contacts could be averted over the projected 18-month COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Medically unnecessary abortion regulations result in a large number of excess clinical visits and contacts. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Repeal of medically unnecessary state and federal abortion restrictions in the United States would allow for evidence-based telemedicine abortion care, thereby lowering risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Fulcher, Isabel R; Neill, Sara; Bharadwa, Sonya; Goldberg, Alisa B; Janiak, Elizabeth",Contraception,654,16

Among these challenges are the possible negative implications for the mental health and well-being of older persons that ongoing social distancing measures may cause. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing body of literature explored the associations between grandchild caregiving, loneliness and social isolation. We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, a longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field. Further research is of particular relevance given the drastic changes to the way families and older people interact socially, brought about by the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Quirke, Eleanor; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André",Z.

Faced with COVID-19, we took the opportunity to digitalise CGA documentation to preserve these benefits for patients whilst facing greater acuity, staffing and time pressures. An electronic solution was adopted to reduce paper-usage in COVID-receiving areas. Prior to COVID-19, CGA was recorded within case-notes, presenting challenges when patients were readmitted out-of-hours as these were stored off-site and not accessible out-of-hours. Method Trakcare is the patient-management system in many Scottish hospitals. The Electronic Patient Record (EPR) was used to record pro-forma against admissions which were accessible and updatable for any patient 24–7-365. Patients meeting the Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) Frailty criteria were considered “frailty-positive”, with an e-alert added- reappearing on any re-admission. Providing no HIS-exclusion criteria, an electronic-CGA (e-CGA) was recorded or updated. The pro-forma designed contained information not immediately available to clerking practitioners. This evolved following discussion amongst the FIT to include information such as escalation-status, medication-arrangements and baseline cognition. Results Over 13 weeks, 116 EPRs were reviewed. During weeks 1–3 (n = 8, 12, 7 respectively), e-CGA completion averaged 31%. Following FIT collaboration, this rose to 82% (n = 9) by week 12. Qualitative feedback from the MDT indicated that FIT, downstream wards and night-staff felt that having access to previous escalation-plans made immediate-management easier to determine, and discussions with families more productive for patients. Conclusions Development of the FVRH e-CGA is ongoing, with an electronic frailty-screening tool being implemented to improve frailty-identification on admission to ensure correct streaming of patients to the FIT. We have demonstrated a cost-neutral method for improving access to CGA for patients using existing IT systems whilst protecting staff time, preserving patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rodgerson, M.

Routinely used interventions in physiotherapy imply a very high risk for physiotherapists because the duration of direct contact with patients is quite long. Physiotherapy may need to be administered by weighing the benefit-risk ratio. Therefore, there is a critical and urgent need to adopt alternatives or modified forms of physiotherapy interventions. As the situation for management of COVID-19 in low-resource contexts could differ from that in high resource context, interventions need to be adapted to the available resources and technology in various settings. Tele-physiotherapy could be a viable option for patients who are in acute care in the hospital, in rehabilitation unit or under quarantine at home due to confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Modification in physiotherapy interventions and adjustment in intervention parameters may serve as an alternative strategy.

In the process of managing COVID-19 projects, managers try to model creative behavior and are based on creative technologies. Emotional behavior is considered as a social and psychological mechanism of transferring the mental mood of the manager to other stakeholders of the COVID-19 projects, emotional impact in the face of direct contact, and the inclusion of the individual in certain mental states that affect the effectiveness of management. The main object of modeling is to simulate managers- behaviors, educate and create new behavior in panicdemic, deadly and aggressive external conditions. In times of crisis, the emotional behavior of the project manager and his infection with the project team is exacerbated by external uncertainty. The stakeholder infection model is based on an understanding of the life cycle of the project manager, which is presented as a curve for personal changes of the manager of innovative projects and programs. Emotions are considered in content, reflecting the various aspects and meanings that caused them. To apply the psychophysiological formula for assessing the impact of the emotional state of the stakeholders of innovative projects, these influences have been transformed into a competent model “Infodemic vs. Panicdemic vs. Pandemic” COVID-19 for managing health projects. Examples of changes in the competence of the manager and the project team in the case of a wall and asthenic emotions are given. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Bushuyev, S.; Babayev, I.; Bushuiev, D.; Bushuyeva, N.; Babayev, J.",CEUR Workshop Proc.,654,9

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the impact of IL-6 inhibition on mortality from COVID-19, utilising meta-regression to explore differences in study results. METHODS: Systematic database searches were performed to identify RCTs comparing IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) to placebo or standard of care in adults with COVID-19. Meta-analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 28 days between arms, expressed as a risk ratio. Within-study mortality rates were compared, and meta-regression was used to investigate treatment effect modification. RESULTS: Data from nine RCTs were included. The combined mortality rate across studies was 19% (95% CI: 18, 20%), ranging from 2% to 31%. The overall risk ratio for 28-day mortality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.99), in favour of benefit for IL-6 inhibition over placebo or standard of care, with low treatment effect heterogeneity: I2 0% (95% CI: 0, 53%). Meta-regression showed no evidence of treatment effect modification by patient characteristics. Trial-specific mortality rates were explained by known patient-level predictors of COVID-19 outcome (male sex, CRP, hypertension), and country-level COVID-19 incidence. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 inhibition is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes for patients admitted with COVID-19.

Although appropriate to proceed with an abundance of caution to prevent viral spread, there will be detrimental consequences for patients with SUDs if clinical trials research cannot adapt and continue uninterrupted. The field of digital health has strong evidence for its feasibility and effectiveness and offers tools that can facilitate the continuation of SUD clinical trials research remotely in accordance with Covid-19 precautions. Some digital tools have been used as components of SUD research in the past; however, no published clinical trial in SUDs to-date has been entirely virtual. This has important implications for disrupted clinical care, as providers seek guidelines for best digital practices. This paper provides a roadmap for integrating the fields of digital health and SUD clinical trials by proposing methods to complete recruitment, screening, informed consent, other study procedures, and internal lab operations digitally. The immediate future of SUD research depends on the ability to comply with social distancing. Investment in research of digital clinical trials for SUDs provides an opportunity to cultivate benefits for research and clinical care long-term as we can (1) define regulatory requirements for the implementation of digital systems, (2) develop consensus on system-wide standards and protocols in the appropriate use of technology, and (3) gain experience that can translate to the treatment of patients with SUDs through telehealth in the community.","Brezing, Christina A; Luo, Sean X; Mariani, John J; Levin, Frances R",J Addict Med,654,25

The pandemic has posed a global mental health crisis, and correct information is indispensable to dispel uncertainty, fear, and mental stress to unify global communities in collective combat against COVID-19 disease worldwide. Mounting studies specified that manifestly endless coronavirus-related newsfeeds and death numbers considerably increased the risk of global mental health issues. Social media provided positive and negative data, and the COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide infodemic. It has eroded public trust and impeded virus restraint, which outlived the coronavirus pandemic itself. Methods: The study incorporated the narrative review analysis based on the existing literature related to mental health problems using the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) approach to minimize the COVID-19 adverse consequences on global mental health. The study performed a search of the electronic databases available at PsycINFO, PubMed, and LISTA. This research incorporates the statistical data related to the COVID-19 provided by the WHO, John Hopkins University, and Pakistani Ministry of Health. Results: Pakistan reported the second-highest COVID-19 cases within South Asia, the fifth-highest number of cases in Asia after Iran, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the 14th highest recorded cases, as of October 14, 2020. Pakistan effectively managed the COVID-19 pandemic in the second wave. It stands at the eighth-highest number of confirmed cases in Asia, the 3rd-highest in South Asia, and the 28th-highest number of established patients globally, as of February20, 2021. Conclusion: The COVID-19 has resulted in over 108.16 million confirmed cases, deaths over 2.374 million, and a recovery of 80.16 million people worldwide, as of February 12, 2021. This study focused on exploring the COVID-19 pandemic’s adverse effects on global public health and the indispensable role of social media to provide the correct information in the COVID-19 health crisis. The findings’ generalizability offers helpful insight for crisis management and contributes to the scientific literature. The results might provide a stepping-stone for conduct future empirical studies by including other factors to conclude exciting developments.","Jaffar, Abbas Dake Wang Su Zhaohui Ziapour Arash",Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,654,16

Stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells retaining self-renewal potential, excessive proliferation and differentiation capacity into offspring or daughter cells that form different lineage cells of an organism, are considered as an important part of the RM approaches. They have been widely investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for therapeutic purposes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the vital mediators that regulate the therapeutic effects of stem cells. Besides, they carry various types of cargo between cells which make them a significant contributor of intercellular communication. Given their role in physiological and pathological conditions in living cells, EVs are considered as a new therapeutic alternative solution for a variety of diseases in which there is a high unmet clinical need. This review aims to summarize and identify therapeutic potential of stem cells and EVs in diseases requiring acute emergency care such as trauma, heart diseases, stroke, acute respiratory distress syndrome and burn injury. Diseases that affect militaries or societies including acute radiation syndrome, sepsis and viral pandemics such as novel coronavirus disease 2019 are also discussed. Additionally, featuring and problematic issues that hamper clinical translation of stem cells and EVs are debated in a comparative manner with a futuristic perspective.

However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula. METHODS: In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students. DISCUSSION: Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning.","Roopnarine, Rohini; Regan, Julie-Anne",J Contin Educ Health Prof,654,1

This acute infection caused pneumonia-like symptoms and other respiratory tract illness. Its higher transmission and infection rate has successfully enabled it to have a global spread over a matter of small time. One of the major concerns involving the SARS-COV-2 is the mutation rate, which enhances the virus evolution and genome variability, thereby making the design of therapeutics difficult. In this study, we identified the most common haplotypes from the haplotype network. The conserved genes and population level variants were analysed. Non-Structural Protein 10 (NSP10), Nucleoprotein, Papain-like protease (Plpro or NSP3) and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro or NSP5), which were conserved at the highest threshold, were used as drug targets for molecular dynamics simulations.

We tested the hypothesis that the maximum weight capacity that leaves can support limits the maximum social group size of bats that roost in them. We conducted research in the Tirimbina Biological Reserve (TBR), Sarapiquí, Costa Rica, between March and April 2012. We added weight incrementally to new leaves of three plant species until the angle of the leaves fell below that which bats naturally use. Philodendron fragrantissimum and Heliconia imbricata support one-third more weight than Asterogyne martiana. This study demonstrates that the maximum weight that the leaves can support is similar to the mean social group weight of D. watsoni and Ectophylla alba reported in the literature for these plant species and lower than the maximum reported social group weights.

While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19.IMPORTANCEIn order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.","Alfi, Or; Yakirevitch, Arkadi; Wald, Ori; Wandel, Ori; Izhar, Uzi; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Nevo, Yuval; Elgavish, Sharona; Dagan, Elad; Madgar, Ory; Feinmesser, Gilad; Pikarsky, Eli; Bronstein, Michal; Vorontsov, Olesya; Jonas, Wayne; Ives, John; Walter, Joan; Zakay-Rones, Zichria; Oberbaum, Menachem; Panet, Amos; Wolf, Dana G",J. virol,654,1

Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience. OBJECTIVE: To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. METHODS: We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS: Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients. CONCLUSION: Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow. In addition, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these nurses created a new strategy in virtual health care to be implemented during a crisis.","Arneson, Sandy L; Tucker, Sara J; Mercier, Marie; Singh, Jaspal",Crit Care Nurse,654,16

Therefore, it is important to understand the physical properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures for their applications in next-generation electronic devices. However, the conventional synthesis process of TMD-TMD heterostructures has some critical limitations, such as nonreproducibility and low yield. In this paper, we synthesize wafer-scale MoS2-WS2 vertical heterostructures (MWVHs) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) via penetrative single-step sulfurization discovered by time-dependent analysis. This method is available for fabricating uniform large-area vertical heterostructures (4 in.) at a low temperature (300 °C). MWVHs were characterized using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, which revealed their uniform nanoscale polycrystallinity and the presence of vertical layers of MoS2 and WS2. In addition, wafer-scale MWVHs diodes were fabricated and demonstrated uniform performance by current mapping. Furthermore, mode I fracture tests were performed using large double cantilever beam specimens to confirm the separation of the MWVHs from the SiO2/Si substrate. Therefore, this study proposes a synthesis mechanism for TMD-TMD heterostructures and provides a fundamental understanding of the interfacial properties of TMD-TMD vertical heterostructures.","Seok, Hyunho; Megra, Yonas Tsegaye; Kanade, Chaitanya K; Cho, Jinill; Kanade, Vinit K; Kim, Minjun; Lee, Inkoo; Yoo, Pil J; Kim, Hyeong-U; Suk, Ji Won; Kim, Taesung",ACS nano,654,1

Accordingly, there is a need for new treatments that can limit the generation of new waves T cell autoreactivity that drive disease progression. Notably, immune cells express GABAA-receptors (GABAA-Rs) whose activation has anti-inflammatory effects such that GABA administration can ameliorate disease in models of type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Here, we show that oral GABA, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), does not affect the course of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In contrast, oral administration of the BBB-permeable GABAA-R-specific agonist homotaurine ameliorates monophasic EAE, as well as advanced-stage relapsing-remitting EAE (RR-EAE). Homotaurine treatment beginning after the first peak of paralysis reduced the spreading of Th17 and Th1 responses from the priming immunogen to a new myelin T cell epitope within the CNS. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) isolated from homotaurine-treated mice displayed an attenuated ability to promote autoantigen-specific T cell proliferation. The ability of homotaurine treatment to limit epitope spreading within the CNS, along with its safety record, makes it an excellent candidate to help treat MS and other inflammatory disorders of the CNS.","Tian, Jide; Song, Min; Kaufman, Daniel L",Sci Rep,654,29

In comparison to bloodborne pathogens, the prevalence of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2 and how that relates with other variables, such as drug usage and trauma type, is currently unknown in trauma populations. Here, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and antibody isotype profile in 2,542 trauma patients from six Level-1 trauma centers between April and October of 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that the seroprevalence in trauma victims 18-44 years old (9.79%, 95% confidence interval/CI: 8.33 11.47) was much higher in comparison to older patients (45-69 years old: 6.03%, 4.59-5.88; 70+ years old: 4.33%, 2.54 - 7.20).

Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students' perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 ± 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 ± 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students' psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A; Hasan, Gamal M; Al-Zamil, Fahad; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Alsohime, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Saadi, Basma; Somily, Ali Mohammed",J Infect Public Health,654,33

In this study, we evaluated the capacity of Ilex paraguariensis to accumulate Mn and the effect of excessive concentrations on plant growth and nutrition. For this, a container experiment was conducted using soils from different parent materials (basalt and sandstone), with and without liming, and at six doses of applied Mn (0, 30, 90, 270, 540 and 1,080 mg kg-1). Clonal plants grown for 203 days were harvested to evaluate yield, and leaf tissue samples were evaluated for Mn and other elements. Without liming and with high Mn doses, leaf Mn concentrations reached 13,452 and 12,127 mg kg-1 in sandstone and basalt soils, respectively; concentrations in excess of 10,000 mg kg-1 are characteristic of hyperaccumulating plants. Liming reduced these values to 7203 and 8030 mg kg-1. More plant growth accompanied increased Mn leaf concentrations, with a growth reduction noted at the highest dose in unlimed soils. Elemental distribution showed Mn presence in the mesophyll, primarily in vascular bundles, without high Mn precipitates. Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves associated with high Mn concentration and lower Fe concentrations was observed, especially in sandstone soil without liming.

The limit of detection (LOD) of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG by the MCIA measurement are 0.06 mg/L and 0.10 mg/L, respectively. The 10 microL sample consumption, 30 min assay time and the compact setup make this technique suitable for POC quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Qu, J.; Chenier, M.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, C.

Objective: In order to increase the possibility for employees to maintain their employability and to keep working in an extended working life this intervention project tested a distance education as a technique to integrate a theoretical model for a sustainable working life for all ages (the swAge-model) as a practical management tool in fourteen municipality managers’ ordinary work situation. Results: Most of the participating managers had difficulty completing the entire training program in this intervention project due to external circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and re-organisations, and because no extra time during working hours had been allocated to the managers to participate in the intervention project. Despite this, all participating managers appreciated being given the opportunity to participate and take part in the content of the intervention. Everyone considered the theoretical model, the wage model, on which the intervention project was based, to be very useful and to have given them new insights into their managerial duties. Conclusions: If society and organisations want a larger amount of employees to participate in working life until an older age, they also need to allocate working hours for managers to acquire new knowledge on how to create healthy and sustainable workplaces for all ages, as well as to implement these tools, measures and working methods permanently in the daily organisational work. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nilsson, K.; Nilsson, E.","21st Congress of the International Ergonomics Association, IEA 2021",654,6

We addressed our preparation to face COVID-19 pandemic in a Hematological and Stem Cell Transplant Unit in Brazil during the first two months of COVID-19 pandemic and described COVID-19 cases in patients and health care workers (HCW). Modifications in daily routines included a separation of area and professionals, SARS-CoV-2 screening protocols, and others. A total of 47 patients and 54 HCW were tested for COVID-19, by PCR-SARS-CoV-2. We report 11 cases of COVID-19 in hematological patients (including 2 post stem cell transplant) and 28 cases in HCW. Hematological cases were most severe or moderate and presented with several poor risk factors. Among HCW, COVID-19 were mostly mild, and all recovered without hospitalization. A cluster was observed among HCW. Despite a decrease in the number of procedures, the Transplant Program performed 8 autologous and 4 allogeneic SCT during the period, and 49 onco-hematological patients were admitted to continuing their treatments. Although we observed a high frequency of COVID-19 among patients and HCW, showing that SARS-CoV-2 is disseminated in Brazil, hematological patients were safely treated during pandemic times.","Garnica, Marcia; Valetim, Marcia Rejane; Furtado, Paulo; Moreira, Maria Claudia; Bigni, Ricardo; Vinhas, Simone; Dias, Paulo Cesar; Fellows, Ilza; Martins, Wolney","Hematol., Transfus.

The intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity is an important consideration in the response to the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of maintaining or expanding a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity in Germany. METHODS: This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g. information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. RESULTS: The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of the last bed added to the existing ICU capacity is 21,958 per life-year gained assuming full bed utilization. The NMB decreases with an additional expansion but remains positive for utilization rates as low as 2%. In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates the applicability of cost-effectiveness analysis to policies of hospital pandemic preparedness and response capacity strengthening. In Germany, the provision of a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity appears to be cost-effective even for a low probability of bed utilization.","Gandjour, Afschin",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,654,16

This may limit the ability of antibody tests to identify previous SARS CoV-2 infection at later time points. To examine if the sensitivity of antibody tests falls off, we compared the sensitivity of two nucleoprotein-based antibody tests, the Roche Elecsis II Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and three glycoprotein-based tests, the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, Siemens Atellica IM COV2T and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 assay with 56 sera obtained 6-8 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity of the Roche, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and Siemens antibody assays was 94.6 % (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.1-98.9 %), 98.2 % (95% CI: 90.4-99.9 %) and 100 % (95% CI: 93.6-100 %). The sensitivity of the N-based Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the glycoprotein-based Euroimmun ELISA was 48.2 % (95% CI: 34.7-62.0 %) and 83.9 % (95% CI: 71.7-92.4 %). The nucleoprotein-based Roche and the glycoprotein-based Abbott RBD and Siemens tests were more sensitive than the N-based Abbott and the Euroimmun antibody tests (p=0.0001 to p=0.039). The N-based Abbott antibody test was less sensitive 6-8 months than 4-10 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.0002). The findings show that most SARS CoV-2 antibody assays correctly identified previous infection 6-8 months after infection. The sensitivity of pan-Ig antibody tests was not reduced at 6-8 months when IgM antibodies have usually disappeared.

This investigative study asks whether domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) are also susceptible to sitting in enclosures that are illusory in nature, utilizing cats’ attraction to box-like spaces to assess their perception of the Kanizsa square visual illusion. Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats’ behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study's trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition;a formal examination into cats’ attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures;and study into cats’ susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Smith, G.

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study using data extracted from the centralized disease notification system comprising individuals confirmed with COVID-19 in Singapore between 23 January and 17 April 2020. Occupation of HCWs was categorized into six categories. Their job nature was classified into ""frontline"" or ""back-end"" based on the frequency of direct patient contact, and source of exposure was classified as family/household, social interaction or workplace. Chi-square and median tests were used to identify differences between categorical groups and sample medians, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 88 (1.7%) HCWs were identified from 5,050 cases. Their median age was 35 years. Chinese and Indians constituted 42.0% and 31.8%, respectively, and 43.2% were foreigners. The majority (63.6%) was serving at frontlines handling patient-facing duties, 15.9% were doctors, 11.4% were nurses and 44.3% were ancillary staff. About 81.8% acquired the infection locally, of which 40.3% did not have a clearly identifiable source of exposure. Exposure from the family/household was most common (27.8%), followed by workplace (16.7%) and social interaction (15.3%). All HCWs were discharged well with no mortality; three (3.4%) were ever admitted to intensive care unit and required increased care. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers accounted for a small proportion of COVID-19 cases in Singapore with favourable outcomes. The possibility of transmission resulting from family/household exposure and social interactions highlights the need to maintain strict vigilance and precautionary measures at all times beyond the workplace.","Wong, Lai Yin; Tan, Aidan Lyanzhiang; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lee, Vernon Jian Ming; Toh, Matthias Paul Han Sim",Influenza other respir. viruses,654,21

We observe formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant change in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within macromolecular condensates.","Zhao, Huaying; Wu, Di; Nguyen, Ai; Li, Yan; Adão, Regina C; Valkov, Eugene; Patterson, George H; Piszczek, Grzegorz; Schuck, Peter",iScience,654,21

Although telemedicine precludes the physical examination of a patient, it allows collection of a range of information prior to a patient's admission, and may therefore be used in preoperative assessment. This new tool can be used to evaluate the severity and progression of the main disease, other comorbidities, and the urgency of the surgical treatment as well as preferencing anesthetic procedures.

Differently from players, no health and physical fitness maintenance guidelines were published for match officials. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to guide a safe and successful return to play for match officials. Research methods: Before the return to structured conditioning and officiating, match officials must perform a medical assessment, as well as systematic COVID-19 testing and detailed pulmonary function evaluation. The hygienic-sanitary prevention strategies for virus transmission must be strictly followed. Results and findings: In the remaining part of the present season, alterations of the game rules, namely halves of 30-40 min and no allowance for lost time, aiming to reduce the match officials physiological load may result as a safer option. Nonetheless, match officials' cognitive and physical demands, will probably be exacerbated by the increased number of substitutions per game, proposed to reduce players' match load.

We sought to demonstrate the reduction in hospital room utilization after implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS: We included all minimally invasive reconstructive surgical procedures in this retrospective cohort study within a large managed care organization of 4.5 million members (2008-2018). We queried the system-wide medical record for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for all included procedures and patient perioperative data. Categorical variables were compared using &#967;2 test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the 13,445 patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, 5,506 were discharged the same day, whereas 7,939 were discharged the next day. Over the 10-year period, patients without hysterectomy had outpatient surgery rates increase from 31.2% to 76.4% (+45.2%), whereas those with hysterectomy increased from 3% to 56.4% (+53.4%). Hospital room utilization decreased by 45,200 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures without hysterectomy and 53,400 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures with hysterectomy. When compared to 2008, in 2018 after more widespread adoption of outpatient elective surgery, for the 738 patients undergoing surgery without hysterectomy, 334 less room days were used, whereas 335 less room days were used among the 640 patients who had a surgical procedure with hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive procedures leads to a significant reduction in hospital room utilization. Same-day discharge decreases hospital resource utilization, therefore improving hospital access, which may be essential for the delivery of routine care during times of resource scarcity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Berger, Alexander A; Tan-Kim, Jasmine; Menefee, Shawn A",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

Our study comprises three steps: atom-by-atom generation of new molecules around a receptor, structural similarity mapping to existing approved and investigational drugs, and validation of their binding strengths to the viral spike proteins based on rigorous all-atom, explicit-water well-tempered metadynamics free energy calculations. By choosing the receptor binding domain of the viral spike protein, we showed that some of our new molecules and some of the repurposable drugs have stronger binding to RBD than hACE2. To validate our approach, we also calculated the free energy of hACE2 and RBD, and found it to be in an excellent agreement with experiments.

In addition, teachers with high teaching efficacy beliefs create classroom environments where students can be more successful. In the light of this information, the importance of understanding mathematics teachers' beliefs about their competence has to be considered in mathematics teaching. In this study, a relational survey model was used to examine secondary mathematics teachers' efficacy beliefs about teaching mathematics in terms of some variables. The sample of the study consists of 165 mathematics teachers selected with the stratified sampling method. In this study, Mathematics Teaching Efficacy Belief Scale, developed by Enochs, Smith, and Huinker (2000) and adapted to Turkish by Takunyaci and Aydin (2013) was used. The first finding of our study is mathematics teachers' beliefs about mathematics teaching were medium level. The second finding of our study is the personal mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of male teachers were significantly higher than female teachers, while female teachers' efficacy beliefs about outcome expectations in mathematics teaching were significantly higher than male teachers. The third finding of our study is efficacy beliefs of mathematics teachers working in private high schools about the outcome expectation in mathematics teaching were significantly higher than the mathematics teachers working in public high schools. In the last finding of our study, it was found that the personal mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of mathematics teachers with professional seniority of 11 years or more were significantly higher than teachers with professional seniority of 0-5 years.","Takunyaci, Mithat",Education Quarterly Reviews,654,29

DESIGN: A mixed methods survey including questions about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation service provision, programme diversity, patient complexity, technology use, barriers to using technology, and safety. SETTING: International survey of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals working in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of programmes that continued providing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and which technologies had been used to deliver home-based cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty eligible responses were received; 89.7% were from the UK. Approximately half (49.3%) of respondents reported that cardiac rehabilitation programmes were suspended due to COVID-19. Of programmes that continued, 25.8% used technology before the COVID-19 pandemic. Programmes typically started using technology within 19 days of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic. 48.8% did not provide cardiac rehabilitation to high-risk patients, telephone was most commonly used to deliver cardiac rehabilitation, and some centres used sophisticated technology such as teleconferencing. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid adoption of technology into standard practice is promising and may improve access to, and participation in, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation beyond COVID-19. However, the exclusion of certain patient groups and programme suspension could worsen clinical symptoms and well-being, and increase hospital admissions. Refinement of current practices, with a focus on improving inclusivity and addressing safety concerns around exercise support to high-risk patients, may be needed.","O039,; Doherty, Alasdair F; Humphreys, Helen; Dawkes, Susan; Cowie, Aynsley; Hinton, Sally; Brubaker, Peter H; Butler, Tom; Nichols, Simon",BMJ Open,654,5

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of postmarketing (spontaneous) case reports of erenumab-associated elevated BP submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System from May 17, 2018 through April 30, 2020. A case of elevated BP was defined as (a) an initiation of a pharmacological intervention or emergency department visit or hospitalization for emergent de novo or worsening of preexisting hypertension, or (b) BP measurement of &#8805;140 mm Hg systolic or &#8805;90 mm Hg diastolic with or without baseline BP measurement reported. Reports of elevated BP associated with erenumab use were analyzed for baseline and demographic information, latency, drug-event causal association, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Sixty-one cases of elevated BP were identified, 86% (49/57) were women and the median age was 56 [range 24-88] years. Forty-one cases were associated with a serious outcome per regulatory criteria, including seven that specified hospitalization. No case reported an outcome of death. The median systolic BP increase was 39 (interquartile range (IQR) 32, 59) mm Hg and median diastolic BP increase was 28 (IQR 18, 41) mm Hg. A total of 27/61 (44%) cases reported treatment for elevated BP (i.e., pharmacologic intervention or emergency department visit/hospitalization). Elevated BP occurred most frequently (28/61, 46%) within a week of the first dose of erenumab. Nineteen cases (19/61, 31%) reported a history of preexisting hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggest an association between elevated BP and use of erenumab. In light of our findings, the erenumab (Aimovig) prescribing information was amended to include hypertension in the Warnings and Precautions section.","Saely, Suprat; Croteau, David; Jawidzik, Laura; Brinker, Allen; Kortepeter, Cindy",Headache,654,20

It is found that as of 8 February 2021, Korea has recorded 15.8 patients per 10,000 people, and this is used to calculate ratio to compare with other countries. On average, the number of Coronavirus patients in the world is 136.2 that is 8.6 times more than in Korea. The number of Covid-19 patients recorded in Korea is relatively smaller than other countries. There was no clear evidence on the atmospheric transport of Coronaviruses over 1 km to cause infection to other people. The infection of Coronaviruses appeared to occur mainly by close contact with an infected person or by airborne droplets in confined indoor environments, as noted earlier (Lancet, Respir Med 8(12):1159, 2020). To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus and related infections, the wearing of a pollution filter (mask) covering the nose and mouth is mandatory for Coronavirus patients. For the general public, however, we have invented a filter which covers only the nose. When there is no need for conversation and deep breathing, the nose band would be sufficient to filter out Coronavirus and air pollutants. Meanwhile, air and sea port activities including ground transport continued and strict policy on people mingle was not tightly enforced, and control measures to reduce infection were not so effective. However, it is believed that consuming fermented Korean spicy Kimchee and hot peppery soup plus warm rice tea helps in washing Coronaviruses around the throat deep down to the stomach. We find that cleansing the mouth and throat deeply including pathway is better than doing shallow gargling. A possible mechanism for cleansing the mouth and throat of Coronaviruses is here explored. This could have contributed to the relatively small number of Coronavirus patients observed in Korea.","Chung, Y S",Air Qual Atmos Health,654,23

METHODS AND RESULTS: From February to April 2020, we prospectively studied a cohort of 96 participants comprising 47 consecutive patients with CAD and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (CAD + SARS-CoV-2), 19 CAD patients without infections, and 30 healthy controls. Clinical assessment included blood sampling, echocardiography, and electrocardiography within 12 h of admission. Respiratory failure was stratified by the Horovitz Index (HI) as moderately/severely impaired when HI &#8804;200 mmHg. The clinical endpoint (EP) was defined as HI &#8804;200 mmHg with subsequent mechanical ventilation within a follow-up of 30 days. The numbers of CD14dimCD16+ non-classical monocytes in peripheral blood were remarkably low in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 compared with CAD patients without infection and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.","Mueller, Karin Anne Lydia; Langnau, Carolin; Günter, Manina; Pöschel, Simone; Gekeler, Sarah; Petersen-Uribe, Álvaro; Kreisselmeier, Klaus-Peter; Klingel, Karin; Bösmüller, Hans; Li, Bo; Jaeger, Philippa; Castor, Tatsiana; Rath, Dominik; Gawaz, Meinrad Paul; Autenrieth, Stella E",Cardiovasc Res,654,32

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors affecting telehealth acceptance, including anxiety related to COVID-19, after the initial rapid spread of the disease in South Korea. METHODS: We proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) and performed a cross-sectional survey of individuals aged &#8805;30 years. In total, 471 usable responses were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the validity of measurements, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to investigate factors influencing telehealth acceptance and the impacts of COVID-19. RESULTS: PLS analysis showed that increased accessibility, enhanced care, and ease of telehealth use had positive effects on its perceived usefulness (P=.002, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). Furthermore, perceived usefulness, ease, and privacy/discomfort significantly impacted the acceptance of telehealth (P<.001, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). However, anxiety toward COVID-19 was not associated with telehealth acceptance (P=.112), and this insignificant relationship was consistent in the cluster (n=216, 46%) of respondents with chronic diseases (P=.185). CONCLUSIONS: Increased accessibility, enhanced care, usefulness, ease of use, and privacy/discomfort are decisive variables affecting telehealth acceptance in the Korean general population, whereas anxiety about COVID-19 is not. This study may lead to a tailored promotion of telehealth after the pandemic subsides.","An, Min Ho; You, Seng Chan; Park, Rae Woong; Lee, Seongwon",JMIR Med Inform,654,1

MethodsThis study used a mixed methods approach based on online survey and an embedded quantitative/qualitative design to explore perceptions and attitudes that were associated with intention to either accept or refuse offers of vaccination in different demographic groups during the early stages of the UKs mass COVID-19 vaccination programme (December 2020). Analysis used multivariate logistic regression, structural text modelling and anthropological assessments. ResultsOf 4,535 respondents, 85% (n=3,859) were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine. The rapidity of vaccine development and uncertainties about safety were common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. There was no evidence for the widespread influence of mis-information, although broader vaccine hesitancy was associated with intentions to refuse COVID-19 vaccines (OR 20.60, 95% CI 14.20-30.30, p<0.001). Low levels of trust in the decision-making (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.08, 2.48, p=0.021) and truthfulness (OR 8.76, 95% CI 4.15-19.90, p<0.001) of the UK government were independently associated with higher odds of refusing COVID-19 vaccines. Compared to political centrists, conservatives and liberals were respectively more (OR 2.05, 95%CI 1.51-2.80, p<0.001) and less (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22-0.41, p<0.001) likely to refuse offered vaccines. Those who were willing to be vaccinated cited both personal and public protection as reasons, with some alluding to having a sense of collective responsibility. ConclusionDominant narratives of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are misconceived as primarily being driven by misinformation. Key indicators of UK vaccine acceptance include prior behaviours, transparency of the scientific process of vaccine development, mistrust in science and leadership and individual political views. Vaccine programmes should leverage the sense of altruism, citizenship and collective responsibility that motivated many participants to get vaccinated.","Roberts, Chrissy h; Brindle, Hannah; Rogers, Nina Trivedy; Eggo, Rosalind M; Enria, Luisa; Lees, Shelley",,654,16

The etiologic agent responsible for this disease has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses as it shows similar genomic features to that of SARS-CoV which caused a pandemic in 2002. This disease first appeared in Hubei province of China and it follows human-to-human transmission but the path this virus took to set up human infection remains a mystery. By 17 April 2020, globally there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases with 139,378 deaths because of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shows several similarities with SARS?CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with its clinical presentations. This can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease and mortality. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) screening is considered as the standard laboratory test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. There is no proven antiviral agent against SARS-CoV-2 so the treatment for COVID-19 is symptomatic, aiming for the management of the symptoms and prevention of the complications. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of extraordinary public health measures throughout the world. Numerous antiviral compounds used to treat other infections are being clinically researched to find possible treatment. Similarly, the traditional public health outbreak response strategy of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment has been implemented in multiple countries and has played an important role in the prevention of new outbreaks.

Here, we propose a novel method that represents protein behavioral change upon ligand binding with a simple feature that can be used to predict protein-ligand affinity. From unbiased molecular simulation data, an unsupervised deep learning method measures the differences in protein dynamics at a ligand-binding site depending on the bound ligands. A dimension-reduction method extracts a dynamic feature that is strongly correlated to the binding affinities. Moreover, the residues that play important roles in protein-ligand interactions are specified based on their contribution to the differences.

The content largely draws attention on the guidance developed by the Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), and specific guidance on infection prevention and control measures from Public Health England. The key areas addressed are as follows: The chapter refers to some of the ways in which the guidance was translated in practice. The guidance was developed using a rapid analysis approach to emerging research and evidence, along with evidence from previous experiences of coronavirus combined with consensus expert opinion from all key professionals providing maternity care in the UK. WHAT IS KNOWN: The UK RCOG/RCM COVID-19 guidance was widely accepted across the UK maternity services and also worldwide as a reliable and credible source of information to shape care during the pandemic. WHAT IS NOT KNOWN: The full impact of the pandemic on the experiences and outcomes for babies and women of pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenting in the UK. The impact of the new approaches to intrapartum care on experiences and outcomes for women, babies, and families. The impact of the changes required to intrapartum care as a result of the pandemic on the professional care provided; in terms of pressure created by rapidly changing approaches to care and restrictions on the ability to provide normal levels of care.","Ross-Davie, Mary; Brodrick, Alison; Randall, Wendy; Kerrigan, Angela; McSherry, Maureen","Best pract. res., Clin. obstet. gynaecol",654,6

The severity of the disease is variable ranging from mild form of pneumonia to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that necessitates admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) requiring a maximal level of organ support. Failure of the maximum support through mechanical ventilation can lead to the consideration of a higher level of organ support through extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We present a case of an 8 years old girl, who presented with severe ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia for which a venovenous-ECMO (VV ECMO) was initiated. This was followed by the patient developing cardiac arrest, which was managed with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). The patient was also given thrombolytic therapy during the ECPR because of high clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Venovenous-arterial ECMO was then continued and the patient was successfully weaned off both VA and VV ECMO and discharged home with full neurologic recovery. This encouraging result will hopefully lead to more consideration of this lifesaving therapy for severe cardiac and respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 in pediatric patients.","Alfoudri, Huda; Shamsah, Mohammad; Yousuf, Beena; AlQuraini, Nasayem",ASAIO J,654,1

The objective of this study was to outline our organizational telehealth adaptations that enabled virtual counseling, peer support, groups, and provider care during COVID-19 in one community-based opioid treatment program. We utilized an observational study design during March to June 2020, during the initial peak of COVID-19 in the U.S. After we closed our facility for the first five business days, we rapidly enacted virtual care with telehealth for peer coaching, counseling, groups, and provider visits. While we lost patient volume during the initial weeks, we observed an overall increase in patient engagement over time. Future state and federal policy should focus on maintaining less stringent policies around the use of telehealth, prescribing, and in-person exams for medication for OUD.","Langabeer, James R; Yatsco, Andrea; Champagne-Langabeer, Tiffany",J Subst Abuse Treat,654,0

Breast cancer patients with COVID-19 are fragile and require particular clinical care. This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients with COVID-19 and the risks associated with anti-cancer treatment. METHODS: The medical records of breast cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected among 9559 COVID-19 patients from seven designated hospitals from 13th January to 18th March 2020 in Hubei, China. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess risk factors for COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Of the 45 breast cancer patients with COVID-19, 33 (73.3%) developed non-severe COVID-19, while 12 (26.7%) developed severe COVID-19, of which 3 (6.7%) patients died. The median age was 62 years, and 3 (6.7%) patients had stage IV breast cancer. Univariate analysis showed that age over 75 and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score were associated with COVID-19 disease severity (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that patients who received chemotherapy within 7 days had a significantly higher risk for severe COVID-19 (logistic regression model: RR = 13.886, 95% CI 1.014-190.243, P = 0.049; Cox proportional hazards model: HR = 13.909, 95% CI 1.086-178.150, P = 0.043), with more pronounced neutropenia and higher LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels than other patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our breast cancer cohort, the severity of COVID-19 could be associated with baseline factors such as age over 75 and ECOG scores. Chemotherapy within 7 days before symptom onset could be a risk factor for severe COVID-19, reflected by neutropenia and elevated LDH, CRP and procalcitonin levels.","Wei, Jielin; Wu, Mengjiao; Liu, Jing; Wang, Xu; Yang, Hua; Xia, Pengfei; Peng, Ling; Huang, Yu; Liu, Cuiwei; Xia, Zihan; Chen, Chuang; Zhao, Yanxia",Breast,654,7

It was first reported on in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model, describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and spatial scales of response in which to mitigate future epidemic threats.","Blasius, Bernd",,654,26

Although molecules are often thought of as 2D graphs, they in fact consist of an ensemble of inter-converting 3D structures called conformers. Molecular properties arise from the contribution of many conformers, and in the case of a drug binding a target, may be due mainly to a few distinct members. Molecular representations in machine learning are typically based on either one single 3D conformer or on a 2D graph that strips geometrical information. No reference datasets exist that connect these graph and point cloud ensemble representations. Here, we use first-principles simulations to annotate over 400,000 molecules with the ensemble of geometries they span. The Geometrical Embedding Of Molecules (GEOM) dataset contains over 33 million molecular conformers labeled with their relative energies and statistical probabilities at room temperature. This dataset will assist benchmarking and transfer learning in two classes of tasks: inferring 3D properties from 2D molecular graphs, and developing generative models to sample 3D conformations.","Axelrod, Simon; Gomez-Bombarelli, Rafael",,654,16

Alpha significant association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity and inpatient mortality from COVID-19 disease has recently been shown, while a recent study has claimed lower COVID-19 cases in European countries with a better vitamin D status. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] was identified as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and hospitalization, and administration of 0.532 mg (21280 IU) of calcifediol or 25(OH)D, followed by 0.266 mg on days 3 and 7 and then weekly until discharge or intensive care unit admission significantly reduced the need for intensive care unit treatment. AIM: To elucidate the role of vitamin D European population status in the COVID-19 pandemic, data from the Worldometer were analyzed. METHODS: Linear regression explored the correlation between published representative-standardized population vitamin D concentrations and the number of total cases/million (M), recovered/M, deaths/M and serious-critically ill/M from COVID-19 for 26 European countries populated &gt; 4 M (Worldometer). Life expectancy was analyzed with semi-parametric regression. Weighted analysis of variance/analysis of covariance evaluated serious-critical/M and deaths/M by the vitamin D population status: Deficient &lt; 50, insufficient: 50-62.5, mildly insufficient &gt; 62.5-75 and sufficient &gt; 75 nmol/L, while controlling for life expectancy for deaths/M. Statistical analyses were performed in XLSTAT LIFE SCIENCE and R (SemiPar Library). RESULTS: Linear regression found no correlation between population vitamin D concentrations and the total cases-recovered/M, but negative correlations predicting a reduction of 47%-64%-80% in serious-critical illnesses/M and of 61%-82%-102.4% in deaths/M further enhanced when adapting for life expectancy by 133-177-221% if 25(OH)D concentrations reach 100-125-150 nmol/L, sustained on August 15, 2020, indicating a truthful association. Weighted analysis of variance was performed to evaluate serious-critical/M (r 2 = 0.22) by the vitamin D population status and analysis of covariance the deaths/M (r 2 = 0.629) controlling for life expectancy (r 2 = 0.47). Serious-critical showed a decreasing trend (P &lt; 0.001) from population status deficient (P &lt; 0.001) to insufficient by 9.2% (P &lt; 0.001), to mildly insufficient by 47.6% (P &lt; 0.044) and to sufficient by 100% (reference, P &lt; 0.001). For deaths/M the respective decreasing trend (P &lt; 0.001) was 62.9% from deficient (P &lt; 0.001) to insufficient (P &lt; 0.001), 65.15% to mildly insufficient (P &lt; 0.001) and 78.8% to sufficient (P = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Achieving serum 25(OH)D 100-150 nmol/L (40-60 ng/mL) (upper tolerable daily doses followed by maintenance proposed doses not requiring medical supervision, Endocrine Society) may protect from serious-critical illness/death from COVID-19 disease.","Papadimitriou, D.

The International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) Farm Simulation Approach and Technology Impact Policy Impact Calculations (TIPICAL) model was used considering with Corona (WC) and without Corona (WOC). The Integrated Dairy Research Network (IDRN) database (January 2019 to July 2020) was used for simulation of IFCN two typical farms. The milk price is decreased by 17% and feed price is increased by 3.7% due to COVID-19 in March which was used as the base for farm simulation. This resulted in a decrease in milk yield by 7.9% and 8.9% for small household and family farms, respectively. The cost of milk production increased by 19.10% and 10.9% for household and family farms, respectively. This has an overall negative impact on farm income which accounted for national economic loss from dairy farms in Bangladesh to 4.43 million USD/day (36.84 crore BDT). This loss has been fluctuated from April onward and was higher in June (3.83 million USD/day) due to a combination of COVID-19, flood, and seasonality effect on lowering milk production. At the same time, the farmers' response to the resilience capacity (liquidity, operating profit margin, and financial performance) to combat COVID-19-induced situation has been declined substantially. Based on this, we conclude that the government might take a strategy to support farmers by providing financial support for increasing the operating capital and decreasing the cost of milk production. The outcome of this study is expected to be beneficial for policymakers, farmers, and processors in Bangladesh and similar other countries elsewhere.","Uddin, Mohammad Mohi; Akter, Amrin; Khaleduzzaman, A B M; Sultana, Mst Nadira; Hemme, Torsten",Trop Anim Health Prod,654,15

The present investigation summarizes the clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 infection in a cohort of patients with fractures. METHODS: Data on 10 patients with a fracture and COVID-19 were collected from 8 different hospitals located in the Hubei province from January 1, 2020, to February 27, 2020. Analyses of early prognosis were based on clinical outcomes and trends in laboratory results during treatment. RESULTS: All 10 patients presented with limited activity related to the fracture. The most common signs were fever, cough, and fatigue at the time of presentation (7 patients each). Other, less common signs included sore throat (4 patients), dyspnea (5 patients), chest pain (1 patient), nasal congestion (1 patient), headache (1 patient), dizziness (3 patients), abdominal pain (1 patient), and vomiting (1 patient). Lymphopenia (<1.0 × 10 cells/L) was identified in 6 of 10 patients, 9 of 9 patients had a high serum level of D-dimer, and 9 of 9 patients had a high level of C-reactive protein. Three patients underwent surgery, whereas the others were managed nonoperatively because of their compromised status. Four patients died on day 8 (3 patients) or day 14 (1 patient) after admission. The clinical outcomes for the surviving patients are not yet determined. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics and early prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with fracture tended to be more severe than those reported for adult patients with COVID-19 without fracture. This finding may be related to the duration between the development of symptoms and presentation. Surgical treatment should be carried out cautiously or nonoperative care should be chosen for patients with fracture in COVID-19-affected areas, especially older individuals with intertrochanteric fractures.

However, the direct effects of membrane lipids on viral replicases are still poorly understood. Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) protein A, which associates with mitochondrial membranes, is the sole replicase required for RNA replication. Here, we report that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane lipids (MMLs) stimulated the RNA binding activity and cooperativity of protein A, and such stimulations exhibited strong selectivity for distinct phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, manipulating MML metabolism affected the protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells. Together, our findings reveal the direct effects of membrane lipids on the RNA binding activity of a nodaviral replicase.","Qiu, Yang; Miao, Meng; Wang, Zhaowei; Liu, Yongxiang; Yang, Jie; Xia, Hongjie; Li, Xiao-Feng; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Hu, Yuanyang; Zhou, Xi",Virology,654,22

In the future, hospital epidemiology will be focused on viruses with the potential for causation of severe disease, and there will be additional need for detection of respiratory viruses with potential sequelae for which there are specific and potential life-saving treatments. Therefore, there will be increasing need for multiplex respiratory assays to detection such virus. The Abbott Alinity m Resp-4-Plex assay is a multiplex PCR assay that simultaneously detects and differentiates infection with SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Based on perceived assay utility, we characterized the new assay in a series of validation studies to characterize its accuracy, precision, and analytical sensitivity. All were found to be robust within the measures examined. In the context of sample-to-answer, near random access automation on the Alinity m platform, we believe that the Resp-4-Plex assay offers significant utility in addressing the needs of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and especially in the future with anticipated endemic circulation of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses.","Cheng, A.; Riedel, S.; Arnaout, R.; Kirby, J.

The results of fecal nucleic acid detection were analyzed systematically. Stata12.0 software was used for meta-analysis.The results showed that the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in children with COVID-19 were vomiting and diarrhea, with a total incidence of 17.7% (95% Cl 13.9–21.5%). However, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in other countries (21.1%, 95% CI 16.5–25.7%) was higher compared to China (12.9%, 95% CI 8–17.7%). In Wuhan, the pooled prevalence was much higher (41.3%, 95% CI 3.2–79.4%) compared to areas outside Wuhan in China (7.1%, 95% CI 4.0–10.3%). The positive rate of fecal nucleic acid testing in COVID-19 children was relatively high at 85.8% (91/106). Additionally, 71.2% (52/73) were still positive for fecal nucleic acid after respiratory tract specimens turned negative. One and two weeks after the respiratory tract specimens turned nucleic acid-negative, 45.2% (33/73) and 34.2% (25/73) patients, respectively, remained fecal nucleic acid-positive. The longest interval between the respiratory tract specimens turning negative and fecal specimens turning negative exceeded 70 days. Conclusions and relevance: gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are relatively common. Attention should be paid to the detection of fecal nucleic acids in children. Fecal nucleic acid-negative status should be considered as one of the desegregation standards.","Wang, Ji-gan; Cui, Hai-rong; Tang, Hua-bo; Deng, Xiu-li",Sci Rep,654,16

Initially, the large number of infected people required the direction of global healthcare resources to provide supportive care for the acutely ill population in an attempt to reduce mortality. While clinical trials for safe and effective antiviral agents are ongoing, and vaccine development programs are being accelerated, long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized and concerning. Although the upper and lower respiratory tracts are the main sites of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body, resulting in COVID-19 pneumonia as the most common presentation, acute lung damage may be followed by pulmonary fibrosis and chronic impairment of lung function, with impaired quality of life. Also, increasing reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and directly or indirectly damages neurons, leading to long-term neurological sequelae. This review aims to provide an update on the mechanisms involved in the development of the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3 main areas of lung injury, neuronal injury, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and multiple sclerosis, and highlights the need for patient monitoring following the acute stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2 to provide a rationale for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of these potential long-term sequelae.","Wang, Fuzhou; Kream, Richard M.; Stefano, George B.",Med Sci Monit,654,20

DESIGN: Data on patient demographic, clinical history and outcomes were entered prospectively and updated over time via an online database (REDCap). Clinical variables were compared with outcomes, with logistic regression used to develop a model for mortality. Participants recorded whether any operators tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of the procedure. SETTING: UK National Health Service departments involved in treating patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort comprised 1605 tracheostomy cases from 126 UK hospitals collected between 6 April and 26 August 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality following tracheostomy, successful wean from mechanical ventilation and length of time from tracheostomy to wean, discharge from hospital, complications from tracheostomy, reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among operators. RESULTS: The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 15 days (IQR 11, 21). 285 (18%) patients died following the procedure. 1229 (93%) of the survivors had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation at censoring and 1049 (81%) had been discharged from hospital. Age, inspired oxygen concentration, positive end-expiratory pressure setting, fever, number of days of ventilation before tracheostomy, C reactive protein and the use of anticoagulation and inotropic support independently predicted mortality. Six reports were received of operators testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy appears to be safe in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and to operators performing the procedure and we identified clinical parameters that are predictive of mortality.

The present study examined whether training in emotional intelligence (EI) skills, provided before the pandemic, would serve as a protective factor for sustaining mental health during the COVID‐19 crisis. METHODS: Data came from a longitudinal study (N = 89) that was initially designed to test the effectiveness of an EI training program versus a non‐emotion‐focused placebo program. The design and timing of the study were such that baseline and posttraining assessments of depression and anxiety had been completed before the pandemic, and planned 6‐month follow‐ups were serendipitously scheduled to occur after the onset of the COVID‐19 crisis. This provided us with an unexpected real‐world opportunity to investigate whether EI training would bolster emotional resilience to the challenges posed by the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: Although mental health concerns generally increased after the start of the pandemic, individuals who completed the EI training program scored lower on depression, suicidal ideation, and state anxiety relative to individuals who had been assigned to the placebo training program. CONCLUSION: Online EI training appears to be effective at sustaining critical aspects of mental health during a subsequent real‐life crisis.","Persich, Michelle R.; Smith, Ryan; Cloonan, Sara A.; Woods‐Lubbert, Rebecca; Strong, Michael; Killgore, William D.

However, the impact amongst homeless persons has not been fully evaluated. The ECHO study reports factors associated with depression amongst the homeless population living in shelters in France during the spring of 2020. METHODS: Interview data were collected from 527 participants living in temporary and/or emergency accommodation following France's first lockdown (02/05/20 – 07/06/20), in the metropolitan regions of Paris (74%), Lyon (19%) and Strasbourg (7%). Interviews were conducted in French, English, or with interpreters (33% of participants, ∼20 languages). Presence of depression was ascertained using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Amongst ECHO study participants, 30% had symptoms of moderate to severe depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10). Multivariate analysis revealed depression to be associated with being female (aOR: 2.15; CI: 1.26–3.69), single (aOR: 1.60; CI: 1.01–2.52), chronically ill (aOR: 2.32; CI: 1.43: 3.78), facing food insecurity (aOR: 2.12; CI: 1.40–3.22) and participants’ region of origin.

A cohort cross-sectional survey examined employees’ perceptions of an ethics environment, racial-ethnic, and position disparities (HO1; ANOVA), and, secondarily, ethics in relationship to select, research-grounded work features measured as manage disagreements, effectiveness, work satisfaction, and opinions of care, the latter including intention to remain (HO2; Pearson Correlations). Established questionnaires with robust psychometrics were employed. Response rate was 51%. Non-significant differences between sample and population on key variables supported extrapolation of results. Statistically significant differences between racial–ethnic (p < 0.03; F 2.42) and work positions (p <0.0001; F 6.24) were revealed on ethics (3.16; HO1). Statistically significant relationships (p <0.0001; r = 0.26–0.68; HO2) between ethics and employees’ work features also were found, confirming both hypotheses. Perceptions of ethics based on racial-ethnic and position disparities, as well as the robust links with employee work features, offered potential avenues for decreasing disparities at work and improving the quality of long-term care. Noted further on ethics item scoring were relatively low scores indicating less involvement in, and access to, ethics discussions and decisions. In contrast, the literature review substantiated the importance of empowerment and retention, which were enhanced by employee involvement in work, notably, discussions and decisions. Thus, implications of ethics committees in long-term care sites as ways to potentially enhance employees’ work and quality of care, especially work satisfaction and retention, were explored; relevant concerns raised by the Covid pandemic were, briefly, discussed.","McDaniel, Charlotte; Veledar, Emir",HEC Forum,654,1

Sequence analysis reveals of the S1 gene of JX17 the highest nucleotide identity of 98.15% with that of GI-7 genotype TW2575/98 strain. Furthermore, whole genome analysis among JX17 and other 18 IBV strains demonstrates that JX17 has the highest nucleotide identity of 95.94% with GI-19 genotype YX10 strain. Among all genes of JX17 except the S1 gene, the N gene and 3’ UTR have the highest identity to GI-13 genotype 4/91 strain and the rest genes are the most identical to GI-19 genotype YX10 strain.

The pathogenicity study shows that JX17 is a natural low virulent IBV variant which caused respiratory symptoms but no death. Taken together, these results indicate that IBV strains continue to evolve through genetic recombination and three prevalent genotypes in China including QX, TW and 4/91 have started to recombine.","Huang, Mengjiao; Zou, Chuangchao; Liu, Yuan; Han, Zhenling; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Vet Microbiol,654,2

Methods: We analysed data on COVID-19 cases from the national and state-level databases of the Federal Ministry of Health of Mexico and the Department of Health of Mexico City to determine the clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in children. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to calculate the risk of death. Results: The national and Mexico City databases had recorded a total of 18 465 (2.8%) and 5733 (4.2%) confirmed cases of COVID-19, respectively, in individuals aged less than 18 years as of September 2020.

The recombinant isolation frequency was about 10−9recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5′-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5′- and 3′-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR-46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, are involved. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature but which may be the binding site for a coreceptor essential for the enteric tropism of TGEV.","Ballesteros, M. L.; Sánchez, C.

The signs and symptoms associated with this excessive immune response are very diverse and can resemble some autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, with the clinical phenotype that is seemingly influenced by epidemiological factors such as age, sex or ethnicity. The severity of the manifestations is also very varied, ranging from benign and self-limiting features to life-threatening systemic syndromes. Little is known about the pathogenesis of these manifestations, and some tend to emerge within the first 2 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas others tend to appear in a late post-infectious stage or even in asymptomatic patients. As the body of evidence comprises predominantly case series and uncontrolled studies, diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making is unsurprisingly often based on the scarcely reported experience and expert opinion. Additional studies are required to learn about the mechanisms involved in the development of these manifestations and apply that knowledge to achieve early diagnosis and the most suitable therapy.","Ramos-Casals, Manuel; Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Mariette, Xavier",Nat Rev Rheumatol,654,14

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis, stage and initial treatment of breast cancer. METHODS: Women included in the Netherlands Cancer Registry and diagnosed during four periods in weeks 2–17 of 2020 were compared with reference data from 2018/2019 (averaged). Weekly incidence was calculated by age group and tumor stage. The number of women receiving initial treatment within 3 months of diagnosis was calculated by period, initial treatment, age, and stage. Initial treatment, stratified by tumor behavior (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] or invasive), was analyzed by logistic regression and adjusted for age, socioeconomic status, stage, subtype, and region. Factors influencing time to treatment were analyzed by Cox regression. RESULTS: Incidence declined across all age groups and tumor stages (except stage IV) from 2018/2019 to 2020, particularly for DCIS and stage I disease (p < 0.05). DCIS was less likely to be treated within 3 months (odds ratio [OR](wks2–8): 2.04, OR(wks9–11): 2.18). Invasive tumors were less likely to be treated initially by mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (OR(wks12–13): 0.52) or by breast conserving surgery (OR(wks14–17): 0.75). Chemotherapy was less likely for tumors diagnosed in the beginning of the study period (OR(wks9–11): 0.59, OR(wks12–13): 0.66), but more likely for those diagnosed at the end (OR(wks14–17): 1.31). Primary hormonal treatment was more common (OR(wks2–8): 1.23, OR(wks9–11): 1.92, OR(wks12–13): 3.01). Only women diagnosed in weeks 2–8 of 2020 experienced treatment delays. CONCLUSION: The incidence of breast cancer fell in early 2020, and treatment approaches adapted rapidly. Clarification is needed on how this has affected stage migration and outcomes.

This cross-sectional study examined the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on food access among low-income and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in New York State. New York residents were recruited to complete a web-based survey through Qualtrics. The survey took place in May and June 2020 and asked participants about COVID-19 health impacts, risk factors, and food access. Chi-square analysis examined issues with food access experienced by demographic characteristics, work disruptions, health impacts, and household risk for contracting the virus and experiencing severe illness, and significant results were analyzed in a series of logistic regression models. After accounting for covariates, Hispanic respondents, those with likely Major Depressive Disorder, and essential workers were more likely to experience worse food access during COVID-19. Improved policies and services to address impacts on vulnerable populations such as BIPOC, those suffering from mental health disorders, and workers in lower-paying essential jobs can reduce the risk of food access issues at this time. Future research can identify how food access issues during the pandemic influenced diet quality, chronic disease risk and infection, and persistence of food access issues.","Clay, Lauren A.; Rogus, Stephanie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,654,9

Recently, in the Arabian Peninsula, including in Saudi Arabia, epidemiological data indicated an actual increase in the number of emerging and/or reemerging cases of several viral zoonotic diseases. Data presented in this review are very relevant because Saudi Arabia is considered the largest country in the Peninsula. We believe that zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia remain an important public health problem; however, more than 10 million Muslim pilgrims from around 184 Islamic countries arrive yearly at Makkah for the Hajj season and/or for the Umrah. Therefore, for health reasons, several countries recommend vaccinations for various zoonotic diseases among preventive protocols that should be complied with before traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, there is a shortage of epidemiological data focusing on the emerging and reemerging of zoonotic pathogens transmitted from animal to humans in different densely populated cities and/or localities in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, further efforts might be needed to control the increasing impacts of zoonotic viral disease. Also, there is a need for a high collaboration to enhance the detection and determination of the prevalence, diagnosis, control, and prevention as well as intervention and reduction in outbreaks of these diseases in Saudi Arabia, particularly those from other countries. Persons in the health field including physicians and veterinarians, pet owners, pet store owners, exporters, border guards, and people involved in businesses related to animal products have adopted various preventive strategies. Some of these measures might pave the way to highly successful prevention and control results on the different transmission routes of these viral zoonotic diseases from or to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the prevention of these viral pathogens depends on socioeconomic impacts, available data, improved diagnosis, and highly effective therapeutics or prophylaxis.","Al-Tayib, Omar A.",Pathogens,654,11

We compare the results of 2 automated systems for the determination of IgG against SARS CoV-2 and assess the time-course of the IgG response. Methods: IgG were measured in 103 specimens of 55 patients with COVID-19 (time from the symptoms’ onset: 3–187 days) using the automated tests ""Abbott SARS-COV-2 IgG"" and ""MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG"". Results: The 2 methods had a concordance of 90.3%, but the quantitative correlation, although significant, showed dispersed results. All the specimens resulted positive after 17 days. However, the median concentrations of IgG rapidly increased up to 20 days and decreased for Maglumi IgG while Abbott IgG showed a constant trend up to 85 days, and then slowly declined. Conclusions: The titer of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 may significantly and rapidly decrease, but with a very different time-course depending on the method used for the determination.","Dittadi, Ruggero; Afshar, Haleh; Carraro, Paolo",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,654,26

Since then, the country counts over 150000 deaths due to COVID-19 and faces a profound social and economic crisis; there is also an ongoing health catastrophe, with the majority of hospital beds in many Brazilian cities currently occupied with COVID-19 patients. Thus, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme used to plan appropriate social distancing measures (and relaxations) in order to mitigate the effects of this pandemic is formulated in this paper. The strategy is designed upon an adapted data-driven Susceptible–Infected–Recovered–Deceased (SIRD) model, which includes time-varying auto-regressive immunological parameters. A novel identification procedure is proposed, composed of analytical regressions, Least-Squares optimization and auto-regressive model fits. The adapted SIRD model is validated with real data and able to adequately represent the contagion curves over large forecast horizons. The NMPC strategy is designed to generate piecewise constant quarantine guidelines, which can be reassessed (relaxed/strengthened) each week. Simulation results show that the proposed NMPC technique is able to mitigate the number of infections and progressively loosen social distancing measures. With respect to a “no-control” condition, the number of deaths could be reduced in up to 30% if the proposed NMPC coordinated health policy measures are enacted.","Morato, Marcelo M.; Pataro, Igor M.L.; Americano da Costa, Marcus V.; Normey-Rico, Julio E.",ISA Trans,654,29

We also describe the laboratory capacity building for these diagnostics. METHODS: Laboratory registry data for altogether 80,791 specimens from 70,517 individuals was analysed. The data included the date of sampling, sex, age and the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result on specimens collected between 1 February and 15 June 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 4057/80,791 (5.0%) of the specimens were positive and 3915/70,517 (5.6%) of the individuals were found positive. In all, 37% of specimens were from male and 67% from female subjects. While the number of positive cases was similar in male and female subjects, the positivity rate was significantly higher in male subjects: 7.5% of male and 4.4% of female subjects tested positive. The highest incidence/100,000 was observed in those aged ≥80 years. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased in late May 2020. Large dips in testing frequency were observed during every weekend and also during public holidays. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that men pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing less frequently than women. Consequently, a subset of coronavirus disease-2019 infections in men may have gone undetected. People sought testing less frequently on weekends and public holidays, and this may also lead to missing of positive cases. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased towards the end of the study period, which may suggest their returning back to social behaviour with an increased risk of infection.","Jarva, H.; Lappalainen, M.; Luomala, O.; Jokela, P.; Jääskeläinen, A.E.; Jääskeläinen, A.J.; Kallio-Kokko, H.; Kekäläinen, E.; Mannonen, L.; Soini, H.; Suuronen, S.; Toivonen, A.; Savolainen-Kopra, C.; Loginov, R.; Kurkela, S.",Int J Infect Dis,654,26

The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles/5 replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been simulated with these peptides during 24 hours of exposure in two concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (“C”) was composed of tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water. Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and AChE activity were assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes.

While there are few vaccines available now, there is the need for better treatment alternatives in line with preventive measures against COVID-19. Along with synthetic chemical compounds, phytochemicals cannot be overlooked as candidates for drugs against severe respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The important role of secondary metabolites or phytochemical compounds against coronaviruses has been confirmed by studies that reported the anti-coronavirus role of glycyrrhizin from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra. The study demonstrated that glycyrrhizin is a very promising phytochemical against SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in 2002–2003. Similarly, many phytochemical compounds (apigenin, betulonic acid, reserpine, emodin, etc.) were isolated from different plants such as Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate, and Artemisia annua and were employed against SARS-CoV. However, owing to the geographical and seasonal variation, the quality of standard medicinal compounds isolated from plants varies. Furthermore, many of the important medicinal plants are either threatened or on the verge of endangerment because of overharvesting for medicinal purposes. Therefore, plant biotechnology provides a better alternative in the form of in vitro culture technology, including plant cell cultures, adventitious roots cultures, and organ and tissue cultures. In vitro cultures can serve as factories of secondary metabolites/phytochemicals that can be produced in bulk and of uniform quality in the fight against COVID-19, once tested. Similarly, environmental and molecular manipulation of these in vitro cultures could provide engineered drug candidates for testing against COVID-19. The in vitro culture-based phytochemicals have an additional benefit of consistency in terms of yield as well as quality. Nonetheless, as the traditional plant-based compounds might prove toxic in some cases, engineered production of promising phytochemicals can bypass this barrier. Our article focuses on reviewing the potential of the different in vitro plant cultures to produce medicinally important secondary metabolites that could ultimately be helpful in the fight against COVID-19.","Khan, Tariq; Khan, Mubarak Ali; Karam, Kashmala; Ullah, Nazif; Mashwani, Zia-ur-Rehman; Nadhman, Akhtar",Front Plant Sci,654,20

Identifying factors associated with seroprevalence can help establish better practices in healthcare settings. In this study, we evaluate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among previously undiagnosed HCWs and describe profiling of antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2, including neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 386 HCWs in a university hospital in Egypt and 725 volunteers not affiliated to any healthcare facility (non-healthcare workers - NHCWs). Participants provided a nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, respectively. HCWs who tested positive by either test were sequentially monitored. RESULTS: At baseline, point prevalence of viral carriage was 11.4% in HCWs (n = 44/386) and 11.9% in NHCWs (86/725). The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs considering all studies was 25.6%, which was statistically lower than in NHCWs (41.0%). Prevalence was greatest among janitorial staff (45.9%) and the most affected departments were gastroenterology (31.1%), and emergency medicine (30.0%). Prior anosmia, fever or headache were associated with higher odds of positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regarding serial antibody measurements, RT-PCR-positive HCWs displayed IgG detection rates of 29.5%, 70% and 60% at visit 1, visit 2 and visit 3, respectively with slow decline of median IgG antibody titers, whereas, corresponding detection rates for total Ig antibodies were 50%, 90.3%, and 88.9%, respectively with increasing median titers. NAbs measured at each time point were positively correlated with total Ig levels, whereas IgG levels were positively correlated with NAbs at visit 1 and visit 3. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate lower cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs than general population and suggest that asymptomatic HCWs exhibit considerable IgG and total Ig antibodies response as well as NAbs for up to 120 days, with positive correlation in between.","Musa, Sherief; Abdel Alem, Shereen; Amer, Khaled; Elnagdy, Tarek; Hassan, Wael A.; Ali, Mohamed A.; Gaber, Yasmine; Badary, Hedy A.; Tantawi, Omnia; Abdelmoniem, Reham; Radwan, Amr; Yousof, Hanaa; Shawky, Shereen; Talaat, Hala; Fouad, Rabab; Kassem, Abdel Meguid",J Infect Public Health,654,17

However, the inhibitory effects of serine protease inhibitors on influenza virus infection of human airway epithelial cells, and on their production of inflammatory cytokines are unclear. METHODS: Primary cultures of human tracheal epithelial cells were treated with four types of serine protease inhibitors, including camostat, and infected with A/Sendai-H/108/2009/(H1N1) pdm09 or A/New York/55/2004(H3N2). RESULTS: Camostat reduced the amounts of influenza viruses in the supernatants and viral RNA in the cells. It reduced the cleavage of an influenza virus precursor protein, HA0, into the subunit HA1. Camostat also reduced the concentrations of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the supernatants. Gabexate and aprotinin reduced the viral titers and RNA levels in the cells, and aprotinin reduced the concentrations of TNF-α in the supernatants. The proteases transmembrane protease serine S1 member (TMPRSS) 2 and HAT (human trypsin-like protease: TMPRSS11D), which are known to cleave HA0 and to activate the virus, were detected at the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. mRNA encoding TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and TMPRSS11D was detectable in the cells, and the expression levels were not affected by camostat. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that human airway epithelial cells express these serine proteases and that serine protease inhibitors, especially camostat, may reduce influenza viral replication and the resultant production of inflammatory cytokines possibly through inhibition of activities of these proteases.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Hatachi, Yukimasa; Lusamba Kalonji, Nadine; Tando, Yukiko; Kitajima, Yasuo; Matsuo, Kaori; Kubo, Hiroshi; Nagatomi, Ryoichi; Hongo, Seiji; Homma, Morio; Nishimura, Hidekazu",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,654,24

As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Sircar, Shubhankar; Bhat, Sudipta; Sharun, Khan; Dhama, Kuldeep; Dadar, Maryam; Tiwari, Ruchi; Chaicumpa, Wanpen",Vet Q,654,16

To meet this challenge, the Italian National Transplant Center, with a mandate from World Health Organization, has built and maintained an open-access searchable database of instructive records on disease transmission and other MPHO adverse occurrences. METHODS. One record in the Notify Library describes a specific type of adverse occurrence in 1 type of MPHO and might be linked with 1 or multiple different references. The record inclusion criteria are that it has been reliably documented in a published article or official vigilance reporting system and that it has instructive value for the fields of transfusion, transplantation, or assisted reproduction. The selection and review of references for publication is performed by international experts who collaborate in 5 topic-specific editorial groups: infection transmission, malignancy transmission, living-donor reactions, process-related incidents, and clinical complications. New relevant references are identified through systematic searches and proactive communication by the experts. RESULTS. The Library contains 1733 records, quoting 2632 references. Of the records, 41.8% are related to organs, 20.8% to blood and blood components, 16.5% to hematopoietic progenitor cells, 15.2% to tissues, 4.2% to reproductive tissues and cells, and 1.5% to other MPHO. CONCLUSIONS. Notify Library is the first open-access, searchable database of systematically identified reports of disease transmission and other adverse occurrences arising from the donation and clinical application of MPHO.","Petrisli, Evangelia; Carella, Claudia; Navarro, Aurora; Fehily, Deirdre; Strong, Douglas Michael; Cardillo, Massimo",Transplantation,654,16

These innovative biopharmaceuticals present the remarkable advantages of closely mimicking the three-dimensional nature of an actual virus while lacking the virus genome packaged inside its capsid. As a result, an equally efficient but safer prophylaxis is anticipated as compared to inactivated or live attenuated viral vaccines. With the advent of successful cases of approved VLP-based vaccines, pharmaceutical companies are indeed redirecting their resources to the development of such products. This paper reviews the current choices and trends of large-scale production and purification of VLP-based vaccines generated through the baculovirus expression vector system using insect cells.","Vicente, Tiago; Roldão, António; Peixoto, Cristina; Carrondo, Manuel J.T.; Alves, Paula M.",J Invertebr Pathol,654,3

The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation. Strengthening psychological defences can help countries fight against this disease.","Idris, Haerawati",Int J Ment Health Addict,654,20

Even before the notification of the first autochthonous cases, the SARS-CoV-2 associated syndrome (COVID-19) had raised an intense attention in the public opinion (3), with a counterproductive over-abundance of mixed quality information. As even Italian healthcare workers (HCWs) were not spared by subsequent misunderstandings and knowledge gaps during the previous influenza pandemic of 2009 (4), we performed a web-based survey (Google® Modules), specifically aimed to characterize knowledge status and risk perceptions in a sample from participating to 6 Facebook discussion groups (181,684 total unique members at the time of the study). The questionnaire was made available between February 1st and 7th, 2020, i.e. around 2 weeks before the first COVID-19 was officially diagnosed in Italian residents. Overall, the sampled population included 2106 respondents (Table 1), and 39.3% were HCWs. Even though HCWs were more likely to exhibit a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 related issues (aOR 2.195, 95%CI 1.809 to 2.664), they were not exempt for misunderstandings, particularly on actual incidence and lethality of COVID-19. Interestingly, most of respondents were aware of the main clinical features of COVID-19, with HCWs more frequently acknowledging that the COVID-19 may run pauci- or even asymptomatic (86.3% vs. 79.1%), resembling an Influenza-Like Illness (i.e. fever, cough, headache, etc.), with a potential latency up to 14 days (85·9% vs· 80·3%), eventually spreading by droplets (98.5% vs. 92.7%) rather through running water (92.3% vs· 79.8%), or blood/body fluids (88.0% vs. 70.4%). Retrospectively, the assessment of preventive measures and risk perception appears somewhat worrisome. For instance, while HCWs were more likely to acknowledge as an appropriate preventive measure wearing a filtering mask (i.e. N95/FFP2/3 mask; aOR 2.296, 95%CI 1.507 to 3.946), around ¼ of HCWs failed to recognize the importance of such personal protective equipment, while 7.4% felt as appropriate the wearing of a surgical mask. Moreover, not only COVID-19 was appropriately acknowledged as a severe disease by only 62.0% of respondents, with no differences between HCWs and non-HCWs, but an even smaller share (i.e. 8.0%) reported any concern for being infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. In fact, at the time of the survey SARS-CoV-2 was more properly associated with international travelers (26.7%). Our results are therefore of certain interests for several reasons. First at all, early epidemiological reports on the Italian cases of COVID-19 hint towards some failures in the initial management of incident cases (5-6). In fact, in our survey a large share of respondents substantially overlooked the risk to interact with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, that was otherwise perceived as a not-so-severe disease (i.e. ""nothing more than a seasonal flu"", as often described in some social media) (7). Moreover, around a 1/3 of HCWs participating to the study presumptively did not use proper personal protective equipment for the airways interacting with possible COVID-19 cases, either underestimating the infection risk or being unable to recognize early symptoms. Actually, the base of evidence shared by participants at the time of the study substantially ignored that COVID-19 may be characterized by dermatologic and gastro-intestinal symptoms (8-9). As most of infections may be actually pauci- or asymptomatic, such early exposure in the healthcare settings may have contributed to the quick spreading of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Northern Italy. Therefore, despite the intrinsic limits of a convenience sampling, web-based survey (10), our study stresses the importance to improve the overall quality of information on COVID-19 conveyed not only in HCWs, but also in the general population. Moreover, our data may contribute to clarify the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy.","Riccò, Matteo; Vezzosi, Luigi; Balzarini, Federica; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",Acta Biomed,654,5

METHODS: Pediatric physical therapists' responses to 3 open-ended questions and 1 multipart Likert Scale question from an anonymous survey were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Three overarching themes (Caregiver Engagement, Technology, and Resilience) were identified and accompanied by 3 subthemes (Personal Attributes, Equity, and COVID-Specific Considerations). Themes were supported by the Likert Scale question with Child/Caregiver Interaction, Internet Connection, and Family Factors identified as the most important factors related to telehealth effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: High caregiver engagement and access to stable technology were most important for telehealth effectiveness.

Of the total suspended bacteria cultured in an indoor environment, Staphylococcus was dominant and occupied 49.0 to 61.3 % of indoor air. Among Staphylococcus, S. aureus were detected in 100 % of households' indoor air ranging from 4 to 140 CFU/m(3), and 66 % of households were positive for MRSA ranging from 2 to 80 CFU/m(3). Staphylococcus and S. aureus concentrations correlated with indoor temperature (adjusted β: 0.4440 and 0.403, p < 0.0001). Among respiratory viruses, adenovirus was detected in 14 (14 %) samples and influenza A virus was detected in 3 (3 %) samples regarding the indoor air of apartments. Adenovirus concentrations were generally higher in winter (mean concentration was 2,106 copies/m(3)) than in spring (mean concentration was 173 copies/m(3)), with concentrations ranging between 12 and 560 copies/m(3). Also, a strong negative correlation between adenovirus concentrations and relative humidity in indoor air was observed (r = −0.808, p < 0.01).

An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage and AKI in the setting of critical illness and COVID-19 is emerging, although further research is needed to identify patients at risk of AKI and to guide management strategies. As no specific treatment options exist for AKI secondary to COVID-19, intensive care is largely supportive. Current approaches to prevention and management of AKI, and identification of potential indications for use of RRT and sequential extracorporeal therapies, are based mainly on clinical experience, and AKI strategies are adapted empirically to patients with COVID-19.

Within this interval, the hospital responded to an overwhelming rate of admissions of patients in respiratory failure, rapidly reaching over 95% of its usual inpatient bed capacity and requiring 70 extra critical care beds and at least 40 intermediate care unit beds. This created a significant shortage of materials including ventilation equipment, requiring improvised use of available resources. Aims To describe our use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with the continuous positive nasal airway pressure (CPAP) device SuperNO2VA™ (Vyaire Medical, Mettawa, IL) with hospitalized patients in acute respiratory failure due to presumed COVID-19. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 14 inpatients receiving NIV CPAP at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal in Madrid, Spain. These were inpatients presenting in respiratory failure during the peak pandemic period based on defined respiratory health, oxygenation, and comorbidity status criteria. Patient data were retrospectively acquired from patient medical records. Results All 14 patients were reviewed. Our series consisted of 11 males and three females with an average age of 61.5 years. Ten of 14 patients (71.4%) NIV CPAP patients did not require intubation or reintubation. Of the four unsuccessful cases, one required intubation, two required reintubation, and one expired. Conclusions In a time of crisis, anesthesiologists and respiratory specialists implemented the use of NIV CPAP with SuperNO2VA to help meet the high care demand of patients in respiratory distress. Although the SuperNO2VA was not originally developed for the management of patients in respiratory failure or distress related to COVID-19, this case series demonstrates it can be used with mostly favorable results during a time of limited resources to improve the clinical situation in patients.

The effective implementation of quarantine is determined by the commitment of the people and monitoring by the State. The aim of the study was to find out the effectiveness of home quarantine practises and its role in determining SARS CoV2 transmission. METHODS: Record-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among expatriates of Kerala who were on quarantine at their homes and later tested positive for SARS –CoV-2. Quarantine practises were categorised as strict room quarantine, incomplete room quarantine, home quarantine and no quarantine. Risk of transmission was assessed using risk ratios. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to find out the determinants of SARS CoV2 transmission. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age and duration of quarantine of 95 study participants were found to be 35 (29, 44) years and 7 (3,13) days, respectively. Majority of the participants practised strict room quarantine (57%), whereas 11.6%, 16.8% and 14.7% practiced incomplete room, home and no quarantine, respectively. Home quarantine without room quarantine had 24 times odds for transmitting disease [OR (95%CI)): 24.14 (4.87--119.75), P < 0.001] and not being in quarantine for any duration before being diagnosed was found to be 14 times riskier when compared with strict room quarantine [OR (95%CI)): 14.44 (2.42–86.17), P = 0.003].

A significant number of countries impose the use of facemasks in public spaces and encourage it in the private sphere. Even in countries where relatively high vaccination rates are achieved at present, breakthrough infections have been frequently reported and usage of facemasks in certain settings has been recommended again. Alternative solutions, including community masks fabricated using various materials, such as cotton or jersey, have emerged alongside facemasks following long-established standards (e.g., EN 149, EN 14683). In the present work, we present a computational model to calculate the ability of different types of facemasks to reduce the exposure to virus-laden respiratory particles, with a focus on the relative importance of the filtration properties and the fitting on the wearer’s face. The model considers the facemask and the associated leakage, the transport of respiratory particles and their accumulation around the emitter, as well as the fraction of the inhaled particles deposited in the respiratory system. Different levels of leakages are considered to represent the diversity of fittings likely to be found among a population of non-trained users. The leakage prevails over the filtration performance of a facemask in determining the exposure level, and the ability of a face protection to limit leakages needs to be taken into account to accurately estimate the provided protection. Filtering facepieces (FFP) provide a better protection efficiency than surgical and community masks due to their higher filtration efficiency and their ability to provide a better fit and thus reduce the leakages. However, an improperly-fitted FFP mask loses a critical fraction of its protection efficiency, which may drop below the protection level provided by properly-worn surgical and community masks.","Schmitt, Jean; Wang, Jing",Sci Rep,654,16

The lack of evidence-based data on the management of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes an additional stress for obstetrics healthcare providers (HCPs). Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate depression, perceived social support, and quality of life among obstetrics HCPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in eight cities in Iran. During the study period, 599 HCPs were separated into direct, no direct, and unknown contact groups according to their exposure to COVID-19-infected pregnant patients. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess depression, perceived social support, and quality of life. RESULTS: Obstetrics and gynecology specialists had significantly higher social functioning and general health scores compared to other HCPs (residents/students or nurses/midwives). Depression was negatively correlated with most of the domains of quality of life, regardless of the COVID-19 contact status of the study participants. Social support, however, was positively correlated with some domains of quality of life, such as physical functioning, energy/fatigue, and emotional well-being, among staff members who had either direct contact or no contact with COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the depression score among obstetrics HCPs was negatively associated with quality of life. Social support, however, had a reinforcing effect on quality of life.","Vafaei, Homeira; Roozmeh, Shohreh; Hessami, Kamran; Kasraeian, Maryam; Asadi, Nasrin; Faraji, Azam; Bazrafshan, Khadije; Saadati, Najmieh; Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Zarean, Elahe; Golshahi, Mahboobeh; Haghiri, Mansoureh; Abdi, Nazanin; Tabrizi, Reza; Heshmati, Bahram; Arshadi, Elham",Psychol Res Behav Manag,654,1

Although age is a major risk factor for outcome impairment in COVID-19, its impact on coagulative patterns here is still unclear. We investigated the association of Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) with thrombotic and haemorrhagic events according to different ages in patients admitted for COVID-19. A total of 27 patients with COVID‐19-related pneumonia, without need for intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation at hospital presentation, and 24 controls with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively included. ETP levels were measured on admission. Patients were evaluated for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism) and bleeding complications [according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) definition] during in-hospital stay. COVID-19 patients had similar ETP levels compared to controls (AUC 93 ± 24% vs 99 ± 21%, p = 0.339). In the COVID-19 cohort, patients with in-hospital MACE showed lower ETP levels on admission vs those without (AUC 86 ± 14% vs 95 ± 27%, p = 0.041), whereas ETP values were comparable in patients with or without bleeding (AUC 82 ± 16% vs 95 ± 26%, p = 0.337). An interaction between age and ETP levels for both MACE and bleeding complications was observed, where a younger age was associated with an inverse relationship between ETP values and adverse event risk (p(int) 0.018 for MACE and 0.050 for bleeding). Patients with COVID-19 have similar thrombin potential on admission compared to those with non-COVID-19 pneumonia. In younger COVID-19 patients, lower ETP levels were associated with a higher risk of both MACE and bleeding.

METHOD AND RESULTS: Multi-centre, observational, cohort study over a 100-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) in the USA. Remote monitoring was used to assess AF episodes in patients with a CIED (pacemaker or defibrillator; 20 centres, 13 states). For comparison, the identical 100-day period in 2019 was used (Control). The primary outcomes were the AF burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the association of the pandemic with AF occurrence, as compared with 1 year prior. The secondary outcome was the association of AF occurrence with per-state COVID-19 prevalence. During COVID-19, 10 346 CIEDs with an atrial lead were monitored. There were 16 570 AF episodes of ≥6 min transmitted (16 events per 1000 patient days) with a significant increase in proportion of patients with AF episodes in high COVID-19 prevalence states compared with low prevalence states [odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21–1.48, P < 0.001]. There were significantly more AF episodes during COVID-19 compared with Control [incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.25–1.40, P < 0.001]. This relationship persisted for AF episodes ≥1 h (IRR 1.65, 95% CI 1.53–1.79, P < 0.001) and ≥6 h (IRR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38–1.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the first 100 days of COVID-19, a 33% increase in AF episodes occurred with a 34% increase in the proportion of patients with AF episodes observed in states with higher COVID-19 prevalence. These findings suggest a possible association between pandemic-associated social disruptions and AF in patients with CIEDs.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for “coronavirus” or “severe acute respiratory syndrome” or “SARS” or “Middle East respiratory syndrome” or “MERS” or “COVID-19” and “pregnancy”. The search and selection criteria were restricted to English language. Study eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical transmission. Results 19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth < 37 weeks, occurring in 41.1% (95% CI 25.6-57.6) of cases, while the rate of perinatal death was 7.0% (95% CI 1.4-16.3). None of the 41 newborns assessed showed clinical signs of vertical transmission. Conclusion In mothers infected with coronavirus infections, including COVID-19, >90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.","Di Mascio, Daniele; Khalil, Asma; Saccone, Gabriele; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Buca, Danilo; Liberati, Marco; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Nappi, Luigi; Scambia, Giovanni; Berghella, Vincenzo; D’Antonio, Francesco",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,654,1

Low-burden interventions to help slow or prevent cognitive decline in this high-risk group are needed. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of combining Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to increase putative benefits of MBSR for cognitive function and everyday mindfulness in depressed or anxious older adults with subjective cognitive decline. METHODS: We conducted a two-site pilot double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial, combining active MBSR with either active or sham tDCS. The intervention included weekly in-class group sessions at the local university hospital and daily at-home practice. Anodal tDCS was applied for 30 min during MBSR meditative practice, both in-class and at-home. RESULTS: Twenty-six individuals with subjective cognitive complaints and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety were randomized to active (n = 12) or sham tDCS (n = 14). The combination of MBSR and tDCS was safe and well tolerated, though at-home adherence and in-class attendance were variable. While they were not statistically significant, the largest effect sizes for active vs. sham tDCS were for everyday mindfulness (d = 0.6) and social functioning (d = 0.9) (F((1,21)) = 3.68, p = 0.07 and F((1,21)) = 3.9, p = 0.06, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that it is feasible and safe to combine tDCS with MBSR in older depressed and anxious adults, including during remote, at-home use. Furthermore, tDCS may enhance MBSR via transferring its meditative learning and practice into increases in everyday mindfulness. Future studies need to improve adherence to MBSR with tDCS.

Studies have found that health literacy may help the public identify the falsity of health rumors and avoid their negative impact. However, whether other types of literacy work in helping people disbelieve health rumors is still unknown. With a national survey in China (N = 1646), our study examined the effect of science literacy on rumor belief and further analyzed the moderating role of self-efficacy of science literacy in their relationship. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that science literacy significantly decreased the likelihood of people believing in health rumors, and moderator analysis showed that self-efficacy of science literacy plays a moderating role in this relationship; such that the relationship between science literacy and health rumor belief would be weakened if one′s self-efficacy of science literacy was low. This finding reveals that during campaigns to combat health rumors, improving and enhancing the self-efficacy of people′s science literacy is an effective way to prevent them from believing in health rumors. Our study highlights the benefits of science education in public health and the improvement of public science literacy.","He, Lingnan; Chen, Yue; Xiong, Xiling; Zou, Xiqian; Lai, Kaisheng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,654,26

Studying infectious disease among hosts (animals and humans), outside of the context of their environment, ignores the complexity in which hosts interact. We aimed to formulate a framework to study the effect of large livestock movement on the ecology of emerging zoonotic infectious disease in low-income and middle-income countries. Ultimately such a framework could identify points of intervention in livestock movement chains to reduce the risk of emerging diseases. As a test case, we use camel movement and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods We reviewed grey and peer-reviewed literature on camel husbandry and interviewed key stakeholders in Egypt and Ethiopia involved in public health research, animal husbandry, the camel trade, veterinary services for camels, and physicians. A multidisciplinary team consisting of wildlife biologists, anthropologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, geographers, modellers, virologists, and health-care professionals from the USA, Egypt, and Ethiopia was assembled to propose the framework. Findings A framework has been developed which highlights the associations between the complex linkages within the broader ecosystem: environment (flora, climate, pollution), animals (distribution and density of animals, interaction between humans, domesticated and wildlife animals), and human behavioural systems (socio-cultural and economic structures around animal husbandry and hunting, connectivity including market trade systems). Interpretation While there is an emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation in the area of one health, this type of work has several challenges. A history of interdisciplinary work in zoonotic infectious disease is limited, in part, because of the lack of undergraduate and graduate curricula that provide training. Additionally the large teams required to conduct truly interdisciplinary work require sustained funding and such opportunities are rare.

METHODS: Between January and December 2011, 637 patients <19 years of age exhibited culture-confirmed adenoviral infection in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and provided specimens available for genotyping by multiplex real-time PCR. Clinical data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Excluding five cases with multiple genotypes, 632 cases were included for analysis. Three genotypes were identified, including HAdV-3 (429/632; 67.6%), HAdV-7 (144/632; 22.6%) and HAdV-2 (59/632; 9.8%). Median age was 4.58 years (range 2 months to 18 years), with children infected with HAdV-3 significantly older (82.9% >3 years; p <0.001). Of the 621 inpatients, 98.2% had fevers and all exhibited respiratory symptoms, 75 patients (12.1%) had lower respiratory tract infections, 20 (3.2%) required intensive care (HAdV-2: 1; HAdV-3: 8; and HAdV-7: 11), and three died (all HAdV-7-infected). HAdV-3-infected patients were significantly more likely to have upper respiratory symptoms and a high serum C-reactive protein level >100 mg/L, whereas leucocytosis (white blood cell count >15 000/mm(3)) was more common in HAdV-2-infected patients (p 0.007). HAdV-7 infections were significantly associated with a longer duration of fever, leucopenia (white blood cell count <5000/mm(3)), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm(3)), lower respiratory tract infections, a longer length of hospital stay, and requiring intensive care (all p <0.001). CONCLUSION: Childhood HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infections may exhibit different clinical manifestations. Although HAdV-3 was the most prevalent genotype observed during the 2011 Taiwan outbreak, HAdV-7 caused more severe disease characteristics and outcomes.","Lin, M.-R.; Yang, S.-L.; Gong, Y.-N.; Kuo, C.-C.; Chiu, C.-H.; Chen, C.-J.; Hsieh, Y.-C.; Kuo, C.-Y.; Fang, C.-W.; Tsao, K.-C.; Huang, Y.-C.",Clin Microbiol Infect,654,1

Yet, scant research has addressed the potentially complex needs of youth on probation. This study is thus a first step in improving our ability to promote positive youth development and improved outcomes from youth on probation. It uses administrative data on probation youth from FY2011-2013 in a mid-Atlantic state. We estimated latent class models based on the ordinal scoring (high, moderate, none/low) of the 25 subscales from a standardized assessment administered at intake. In order to test whether groups were distinct, we examined a range of variables, including the official risk classification and recidivism rates measured by officieal rearrests and reconvictions. We report the demographic differences between the estimated groups, as well as adverse childhood experiences, school and employment status, previous legal history, and substance use history. Ultimately, the seven-class model produced four groups that others have noted: a relatively low needs (lowest need), relatively high needs (complex needs), substance use service needs, and mental health service needs. The other three groups that emerged include two gender specific groups (one for male and one for female high-need groups) and a group with skills needs that lacks supportive and protective skills. The analyses will facilitate a better appreciation for the service needs of moderate risk youth. Youth on probation are not a uniform population; they reflect tremendous heterogeneity, and probation systems should embrace systemic responsivity to provide appropriate services to improve youth outcomes. Advancing efforts to provide a broader spectrum of services that address multi-morbid conditions can ensure that youth have opportunities to improve their quality of life during the period of supervision.","Lee, JoAnn; Taxman, Faye",Child Youth Serv Rev,654,8

We measured the prevalence and risk factors of different forms of violence against women and girls in South Sudan, which has suffered decades of conflict, most recently in 2013. METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted among women aged 15–64 in three conflict-affected sites in South Sudan: Juba, Rumbek, and the Protection of Civilian Sites (PoCs) in Juba between 2015 and 2016. FINDINGS: A total of 2,244 women between the ages of 15–64 were interviewed. Fifty percent (in the Juba PoCs) to 65% (in Juba and Rumbek) of all female respondents experienced either physical or sexual violence from a partner or non-partner in the course of their lifetimes. Approximately 35% of respondents have experienced rape, attempted rape or other forms of sexual violence by a non-partner during their lifetime. For ever-partnered women, lifetime prevalence of physical and/or sexual partner violence ranged between 54% in the Juba PoCs and 73% in Rumbek. Restrictive marital practices and gender norms, and experiences of conflict were major drivers of both partner and non-partner violence. CONCLUSION: Women and girls in South Sudan suffer among the highest levels of physical and sexual violence in the world. Although the prevalence of sexual assault by non-partners is four times the global average, women are still at greatest risk of physical and sexual assault from intimate partners. Conflict-related and intimate partner violence reinforce each other and are upheld by restrictive gender norms and marital practices. Expansion of comprehensive services, including health and psycho-social support for survivors is urgently needed. Moreover, policies and laws to prevent violence against women and provide survivors with access to justice should be given high priority within the ongoing peacebuilding process in South Sudan.","Ellsberg, Mary; Ovince, Junior; Murphy, Maureen; Blackwell, Alexandra; Reddy, Dashakti; Stennes, Julianne; Hess, Tim; Contreras, Manuel",PLoS One,654,30

COVID-19 has the potential to lead to severe hypoxia; this is usually the cause of death if it occurs. In a substantial number of patients, adequate arterial oxygenation cannot be achieved with supplementary oxygen therapy alone. To date, there has been no clear guideline endorsement of ward-based non-invasive pressure support (NIPS) for severely hypoxic patients who are deemed unlikely to benefit from invasive ventilation. We established a ward-based NIPS service for COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, with severe hypoxia, and in whom escalation to critical care for invasive ventilation was not deemed appropriate. A retrospective analysis of survival in these patients was undertaken. Twenty-eight patients were included. Ward-based NIPS for severe hypoxia was associated with a 50% survival in this cohort. This compares favourably with Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre survival data following invasive ventilation in a less frail, less comorbid and younger population. These results suggest that ward-based NIPS should be considered as a treatment option in an integrated escalation strategy in all units managing respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.","Burns, Graham P; Lane, Nicholas D; Tedd, Hilary M; Deutsch, Elizabeth; Douglas, Florence; West, Sophie D; Macfarlane, Jim G; Wiscombe, Sarah; Funston, Wendy",BMJ Open Respir Res,654,20

This paper is devoted to modeling spatial diffusion patterns of COVID-19 stemming from Wuhan city to Hubei province, China. The modeling approach is to integrate analytical method and experimental method. The local gravity model is derived from allometric scaling and global gravity model, and then the parameters of the local gravity model are estimated by observational data and least squares calculation. The main results are as below. The local gravity model based on power law decay can effectively describe the diffusion patterns and process of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, and the goodness of fit of the gravity model based on negative exponential decay to the observational data is not satisfactory. Further, the goodness of fit of the model to data entirely became better and better over time, the size elasticity coefficient increases first and then decreases, and the distance attenuation exponent decreases first and then increases. Moreover, the significance of spatial autoregressive coefficient in the model is low, and the confidence level is less than 80%. The conclusions can be reached as follows. (1) The spatial diffusion of COVID-19 of Hubei bears long range effect, and the size of a city and the distance of the city to Wuhan affect the total number of confirmed cases. (2) Wuhan direct transmission is the main process in the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 in Hubei at the early stage, and the horizontal transmission between regions is not significant. (3) The effect of spatial lockdown and isolation measures taken by Chinese government against the transmission of COVID-19 is obvious. This study suggests that the role of urban gravity (size and distance) should be taken into account to prevent and control epidemic disease.","Chen, Yanguang; Li, Yajing; Feng, Shuo; Man, Xiaoming; Long, Yuqing",PLoS One,654,7

BACKGROUND: AAs have worse outcomes compared to whites while facing heart diseases, stroke, cancer, asthma, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. However, there is no current study to show the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the AA communities. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 tertiary centers in New Orleans, LA. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 157 patients were identified. Of these, 134 (77%) were AAs, whereas 23.4% of patients were Whites. Interestingly, AA were younger, with a mean age of 63 ± 13.4 compared to 75.7 ± 23 years in Whites (P < 0.001). Thirty-seven patients presented with no insurance, and 34 of them were AA. SOFA Score was significantly higher in AA (2.57 ± 2.1) compared to White patients (1.69 ± 1.7), P = 0.041. Elevated SOFA score was associated with higher odds for intubation (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.32–1.93, P < 0.001). AA had more prolonged length of hospital stays (11.1 ± 13.4 days vs 7.7 ± 23 days) than in Whites, P = 0.01.

Adipocytes are prominent contributors to systemic metabolic health. Obesity, defined by excess adipose tissue (AT), is recognized as a low-grade chronic inflammatory state. Cytokines are inflammatory mediators that are produced in adipose tissue (AT) and function in both AT homeostatic as well as pathological conditions. AT inflammation is associated with systemic metabolic dysfunction and obesity-associated infiltration and proliferation of immune cells occurs in a variety of fat depots in mice and humans. AT immune cells secrete a variety of chemokines and cytokines that act in a paracrine manner on adjacent adipocytes. TNFα, IL-6, and MCP-1, are well studied mediators of AT inflammation. Oncostatin M (OSM) is another proinflammatory cytokine that is elevated in AT in human obesity, and its specific receptor (OSMRβ) is also induced in conditions of obesity and insulin resistance. OSM production and paracrine signaling in AT regulates adipogenesis and the functions of AT.

There was no demonstrable household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among households containing a participant with faecal shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurred among community participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, during a period of high community transmission, faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected among participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is unlikely that the faecal-oral route plays a significant role in household and community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Virus grown in these cells was used to isolate and purify the HE-protein. This protein has been shown recently to have acetylesterase activity and to function as the receptor-destroying enzyme of BCV. Here we show that HEV contains this enzyme, too. The glycoproteins were solubilized by treatment of virions with octylglucoside. Following centrifugation through a sucrose gradient the surface proteins S and HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) were obtained in purified form. After removal of the detergent by dialysis, HE formed rosettes as shown by electron microscopy. The purified HE protein retained acetylesterase activity and was able to function as a receptor-destroying enzyme rendering red blood cells resistant against agglutination by both coronaviruses. HE protein released from the viral membrane failed to agglutinate red blood cells. However, it was found to recognize glycoconjugates containing N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid as indicated by a binding assay with rat serum proteins blotted to nitrocellulose and by its ability to inhibit the hemagglutinating activity of BCV, HEV, and influenza C virus. The purified enzyme provides a useful tool for analyzing the cellular receptors for coronaviruses.","Schultze, Beate; Wahn, Kurt; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Herrler, Georg",Virology,654,1

Aerosol samples were collected, before Deepawali period (BDP, n = 5), during Deepawali period (DDP, n = 5) and after Deepawali period (ADP, n = 5). Bimodal size-distribution with intense fine mode peak was found for Na during DDP. Bimodal distribution with fine mode intense peak was found for K during DDP. The bimodal size distribution of K was found common for other events because of biomass burning emissions, whereas high intense peak during DDP indicated mixed sources from biomass burning and fireworks. During DDP, K and Ca were well correlated (r(2) = 0.93) together. Strong metal-metal correlations were found between the following pairs, Zn–Fe, Cu–Fe and Cu–Ca, which indicated the similar firecrackers burning source. The atmospheric aging of aerosols was also found significantly high during fireworks days. Aging of aerosols were higher because of heterogeneous reactions of SO(2) and NO(x) on aerosols directly emitted from fireworks. The observed high values of inhalation dose of elemental carbon during DDP period imposed higher risk of respiratory diseases. This study has provided carbonaceous fractions composition data as a tool to detect the aging processes of fireworks in ultra-fine, fine and coarse mode particles during the extreme firework days. Inhalation doses were calculated to establish potential influence on human health.","Mahilang, Mithlesh; Deb, Manas Kanti; Nirmalkar, Jayant; Pervez, Shamsh",Atmos Pollut Res,654,15

To ground this suggestion and emphasize the complexity and significance of migrant health research, we start by briefly reviewing several migration-related notions including the process of migration and its key facilitators and benefits; existing barriers to the provision of migrant health care; and the intricate links between health systems, health professionals, and migrant health. The three areas of research examined in this article address (i) the specific role of health workers in providing care to migrants and refugees and their capacity to do so, (ii) the health problems experienced by health workers who become migrants or refugees, and (iii) the precarious employment conditions experienced by both migrant and non-migrant health care workers. After summarizing the current available evidence on these topics, we discuss key information gaps and strategies to address them, while also incorporating several relevant COVID-19 pandemic considerations and research implications. Expanding the focus of research studies on migration and health could not only enhance the results of current strategies by supplying additional information to support their implementation but also spearhead the development of new solutions to the migrant health problem.","Gunn, Virginia; Somani, Rozina; Muntaner, Carles",J Migr Health,654,21

Methods: Data from the 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) data was used. Patient health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) data and an average number of drinks per week were used to assess psychological distress and drinking status. Results: Out of the 3865 people who answered the survey in the year 2020, 1890 (59.11%) were employed in one or multiple jobs during the time of the survey. The sample included 1561 men and 2204 women with an average age of 48.4 years. More than half (58.7%) of them were Non-Hispanic White followed by Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black at 15.73% and 10.32%, respectively. Bivariate analysis showed a significant association between employment, psychological distress (p value=0.032), and alcohol drinking (p value=0.002); 60.59% of participants reporting severe distress (PHQ-4 score of 9-12) were unemployed. Alternatively, 73.1% of the employed respondents reported no stress (PHQ-4 score of 0-2). While more than half (75.97%) of those who were unemployed consumed only 1-2 drinks per week on an average, 7.27% consumed >13 drinks per week on an average. After adjusting for covariates, the regression analysis showed a highly significant association (p value< 0.001) between unemployment and psychological distress (OR=1.55; 95% CI 1.03, 2.31), and alcohol consumption (OR=0.67; 95% CI 0.48, 0.92).

In this multi-pronged scoping review, we explored the evolution and learning from SEP and GPEI implementation over time at global and country levels to inform other global health programs. METHODS: Three related reviews of literature were conducted; we searched for documents on 1) the SEP and 2) GPEI via online database searches and also conducted global and national-level grey literature searches for documents related to the GPEI in seven purposively selected countries under the Synthesis and Translation of Research and Innovations from Polio Eradication (STRIPE) project. We included documents relevant to GPEI implementation. We conducted full text data analysis and captured data on Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) implementation strategies and principles, tools, outcomes, target audiences, and relevance to global health knowledge areas. RESULTS: 200 articles were included in the SEP scoping review, 1885 articles in the GPEI scoping review, and 963 documents in the grey literature review. M&E and engagement strategies were consistently translated from the SEP to GPEI; these evolved into newer approaches under the GPEI. Management strategies including setting up robust record systems also carried forward from SEP to GPEI; however, lessons around the need for operational flexibility in applying these strategies at national and sub-national levels did not. Similarly, strategies and lessons around conducting health systems readiness assessments prior to implementation were not carried forward from SEP to GPEI. Differences in the planning and communication strategies between the two programs included fidelity to implementation blueprints appeared to be higher under SEP, and independent monitoring boards and communication and media strategies were more prominent under GPEI. CONCLUSIONS: Linear learning did not always occur between SEP and GPEI; several lessons were lost and had to be re-learned. Implementation and adaptation of strategies in global health programs should be well codified, including information on the contextual, time and stakeholders’ issues that elicit adaptations. Such description can improve the systematic translation of knowledge, and gains in efficiency and effectiveness of future global health programs.","Schleiff, Meike; Olateju, Adetoun; Decker, Ellie; Neel, Abigail H.; Oke, Rasheedat; Peters, Michael A.; Rao, Aditi; Alonge, Olakunle",BMC Public Health,654,1

In times of a pandemic, the spread of misinformation can have direct detrimental effects, potentially influencing citizens' behavioral decisions (e.g., to not socially distance) and putting collective health at risk. Misinformation could be especially harmful if it is distributed in isolated news cocoons that homogeneously provide misinformation in the absence of corrections or mere accurate information. The present study analyzes data gathered at the beginning of the pandemic (January–March 2020) and focuses on the network structure of YouTube videos and their comments to understand the level of informational homogeneity associated with misinformation on COVID-19 and its evolution over time. This study combined machine learning and network analytic approaches. Results indicate that nodes (either individual users or channels) that spread misinformation were usually integrated in heterogeneous discussion networks, predominantly involving content other than misinformation. This pattern remained stable over time. Findings are discussed in light of the COVID-19 “infodemic” and the fragmentation of information networks.","Röchert, Daniel; Shahi, Gautam Kishore; Neubaum, German; Ross, Björn; Stieglitz, Stefan",Online Soc Netw Media,654,8

In cells, zinc is typically buffered and bound to metalloproteins, but it may also exist in a labile or chelatable (free ion) form. Zinc plays a critical role in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, ranging from structural to catalytic to replication to demise. This review discusses the influential properties of zinc on various mechanisms of bacterial proliferation and synergistic action as an antimicrobial element. We also touch upon the significance of zinc among eukaryotic cells and how it may modulate their survival and death through its inhibitory or modulatory effect on certain receptors, enzymes, and signaling proteins. A brief discussion on zinc chelators is also presented, and chelating agents may be used with or against zinc to affect therapeutics against human diseases. Overall, the multidimensional effects of zinc in cells attest to the growing number of scientific research that reveal the consequential prominence of this remarkable transition metal in human health and disease.","Cuajungco, Math P.; Ramirez, Maria Soledad; Tolmasky, Marcelo E.",Biomedicines,654,16

Recently, the respiratory microbiome has been associated with both susceptibility and severity of LRTI. In this current study, we combined respiratory microbiome, viral, and clinical data to find associations with the severity of LRTI. Nasopharyngeal aspirates of children aged one month to five years included in the STRAP study (Study to Reduce Antibiotic prescription in childhood Pneumonia), who presented at the emergency department (ED) with fever and cough or dyspnea, were sequenced with nanopore 16S-rRNA gene sequencing and subsequently analyzed with hierarchical clustering to identify respiratory microbiome profiles. Samples were also tested using a panel of 15 respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which were analyzed in two groups, according to their reported virulence. The primary outcome was hospitalization, as measure of disease severity. Nasopharyngeal samples were isolated from a total of 167 children. After quality filtering, microbiome results were available for 54 children and virology panels for 158 children. Six distinct genus-dominant microbiome profiles were identified, with Haemophilus-, Moraxella-, and Streptococcus-dominant profiles being the most prevalent. However, these profiles were not found to be significantly associated with hospitalization. At least one virus was detected in 139 (88%) children, of whom 32.4% had co-infections with multiple viruses. Viral co-infections were common for adenovirus, bocavirus, and enterovirus, and uncommon for human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and influenza A virus. The detection of enteroviruses was negatively associated with hospitalization. Virulence groups were not significantly associated with hospitalization. Our data underlines high detection rates and co-infection of viruses in children with respiratory symptoms and confirms the predominant presence of Haemophilus-, Streptococcus-, and Moraxella-dominant profiles in a symptomatic pediatric population at the ED. However, we could not assess significant associations between microbiome profiles and disease severity measures.","Hoefnagels, Ivo; van de Maat, Josephine; van Kampen, Jeroen J.A.; van Rossum, Annemarie; Obihara, Charlie; Tramper-Stranders, Gerdien A.; Heikema, Astrid P.; de Koning, Willem; van Wermerskerken, Anne-Marie; Horst-Kreft, Deborah; Driessen, Gertjan J.A.; Punt, Janine; Smit, Frank J.; Stubbs, Andrew; Noordzij, Jeroen G.; Hays, John P.; Oostenbrink, Rianne",Microorganisms,654,20

Nuestro objetivo es resumir los hallazgos tempranos de la TC para informar a los profesionales sanitarios sobre la frecuencia de manifestaciones específicas de la COVID-19 en los pacientes adultos o pediátricos, y determinar si la sensibilidad de la TC justifica su uso en estas poblaciones. Métodos: Se buscó en PubMed la presencia de las palabras “TC”, “técnicas de imagen”, “COVID-19” en el título o en el resumen y se seleccionaron para la síntesis de datos 17 estudios a gran escala de PubMed y/o Scopus y casos clínicos publicados entre el 1 de enero de 2020 y el 15 de abril de 2020. Resultados: Las TC iniciales identificaron que las opacidades en vidrio esmerilado (OVE) y las anomalías bilaterales eran más frecuentes en los adultos (74%, n = 698 y 89%, n = 378, respectivamente) que en los niños (60%, n = 25 y 37%, n = 46). A partir de los 14 días, las TC evidenciaron diversos grados de mejoría en los adultos, pero no se observó resolución hasta al menos 26 días después del inicio de los síntomas seudogripales. En los pacientes pediátricos, un tercio (n = 9) mostró pequeñas OVE nodulares adicionales limitadas a un solo lóbulo 3-5 días después de una TC inicial. Conclusión: Los primeros hallazgos de la TC en adultos sugieren el uso limitado de la TC como herramienta complementaria en el diagnóstico de la COVID-19 en pacientes adultos sintomáticos, con especial atención a la identificación de las anomalías de los lóbulos inferiores derecho e izquierdo, las OVE y el engrosamiento del tabique interlobulillar. Los primeros hallazgos de la TC pediátrica desaconsejan el uso de la TC si se dispone de RT-PCR, debido a su sensibilidad significativamente menor en esta población y a la exposición a radiación. Objective: Initial COVID-19 reports described a variety of clinical presentations, but lower respiratory abnormalities are most common and chest CT findings differ between adult and pediatric patients. We aim to summarize early CT findings to inform healthcare providers on the frequency of COVID-19 manifestations specific to adult or pediatric patients, and to determine if the sensitivity of CT justifies its use in these populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for the presence of the words “CT, imaging, COVID-19” in the title or abstract, and 17 large-scale PubMed and/or Scopus studies and case reports published between January 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were selected for data synthesis. Results: Initial CT scans identified ground-glass opacities and bilateral abnormalities as more frequent in adults (74%, n=698, and 89%, n=378, respectively) than children (60%, n=25, and 37%, n=46). At 14+ days, CT scans evidenced varied degrees of improvement in adults but no resolution until at least 26 days after the onset of flu-like symptoms. In pediatric patients, a third (n=9) showed additional small nodular GGOs limited to a single lobe 3-5 days after an initial CT scan. Conclusión: Early adult CT findings suggest the limited use of CT as a supplemental tool in diagnosing COVID-19 in symptomatic adult patients, with a particular focus on identifying right and left lower lobe abnormalities, GGOs, and interlobular septal thickening. Early pediatric CT findings suggest against the use of CT if RT-PCR is available given its significantly lower sensitivity in this population and radiation exposure.","Waller, JV; Lin, KK; Diaz, MJ; Miao, T.; Amireh, A.; Agyemang, Ch.; Carter, RE; Bae, S.; Henry, T.",Radiologia,654,24

Its purpose was threefold: (1) to accommodate the anticipated influx of critically ill pregnant and postpartum patients due to novel coronavirus, (2) to care for critically ill obstetric patients who would previously have been transferred to a non-obstetric intensive care unit, and (3) to continue caring for our usual census of pregnant and postpartum patients, who are novel Coronavirus negative and require a higher level of care.

We reviewed the effects of hypercapnia and hypocapnia and existing carbon dioxide thresholds in neonates. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement and MOOSE guidelines. Two hundred and ninety-nine studies were screened and 37 studies included. Covidence online software was employed to streamline relevant articles. Hypocapnia was associated with predominantly neurological side effects while hypercapnia was linked with neurological, respiratory and gastrointestinal outcomes and Retinpathy of prematurity (ROP). Permissive hypercapnia did not decrease periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), ROP, hydrocephalus or air leaks. As safe pCO2 ranges were not explicitly concluded in the studies chosen, it was indirectly extrapolated with reference to pCO2 levels that were found to increase the risk of neonatal disease. Although PaCO2 ranges were reported from 2.6 to 8.7 kPa (19.5-64.3 mmHg) in both term and preterm infants, there are little data on the safety of these ranges. For permissive hypercapnia, parameters described for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; PaCO2 6.0-7.3 kPa: 45.0-54.8 mmHg) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH; PaCO2 ≤ 8.7 kPa: ≤65.3 mmHg) were identified. Contradictory findings on the effectiveness of permissive hypercapnia highlight the need for further data on appropriate CO2 parameters and correlation with outcomes. IMPACT: There is no consensus on the optimal pCO2 levels in the newborn. There is no consensus on the effectiveness of permissive hypercapnia in neonates. A safe range of pCO2 of 5-7 kPa was inferred following systematic review.","Wong, Sie Kei; Chim, M; Allen, J; Butler, A; Tyrrell, J; Hurley, T; McGovern, M; Omer, M; Lagan, N; Meehan, J; Cummins, E P; Molloy, E J",Pediatr. res,654,24

However, the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV is still unclear. A receptor binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV envelope-embedded spike protein specifically engages human CD26 (hCD26) to initiate viral entry. The high sequence identity in the viral spike protein prompted us to investigate if HKU4 and HKU5 can recognize hCD26 for cell entry. We found that HKU4-RBD, but not HKU5-RBD, binds to hCD26, and pseudotyped viruses embedding HKU4 spike can infect cells via hCD26 recognition. The structure of the HKU4-RBD/hCD26 complex revealed a hCD26-binding mode similar overall to that observed for MERS-RBD. HKU4-RBD, however, is less adapted to hCD26 than MERS-RBD, explaining its lower affinity for receptor binding. Our findings support a bat origin for MERS-CoV and indicate the need for surveillance of HKU4-related viruses in bats.","Wang, Qihui; Qi, Jianxun; Yuan, Yuan; Xuan, Yifang; Han, Pengcheng; Wan, Yuhua; Ji, Wei; Li, Yan; Wu, Ying; Wang, Jianwei; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Yan, Jinghua; Lu, Guangwen; Gao, George F.",Cell Host Microbe,654,24

Methanol extract (IC(50) = 15.04 μg/ml) exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on JEV plaque reduction than water extract (IC(50) = 51.41 μg/ml). Meanwhile, IC(50) values determined by plaque reduction assay were 15.82 μg/ml for chrysophanol and 17.39 μg/ml for aloe-emodin, respectively. Virucidal activity of agents correlated with anti-JEV activity, while virucidal IC(50) values were 7.58 μg/ml for methanol extract, 17.36 μg/ml for water extract, 0.75 μg/ml for chrysophanol and 0.46 μg/ml for aloe-emodin, respectively. In addition, 10 μg/ml of extract, chrysophanol or aloe emodin caused 90 % inhibition of JEV yields in cells and significantly activated gamma activated sequence-driven promoters.

Improved motor skills were associated with a reduction in neuroinflammation, decreased demyelination, and enhanced remyelination. Evidence indicates that the reduced neuroinflammation is correlated with an increased number of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) within the spinal cords. Coculture of hNPCs with activated T cells resulted in reduced T cell proliferation and increased Treg numbers. The hNPCs acted, in part, through secretion of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. These findings indicate that the transient presence of hNPCs transplanted in an animal model of MS has powerful immunomodulatory effects and mediates recovery. Further investigation of the restorative effects of hNPC transplantation may aid in the development of clinically relevant MS treatments.","Chen, Lu; Coleman, Ronald; Leang, Ronika; Tran, Ha; Kopf, Alexandra; Walsh, Craig M.; Sears-Kraxberger, Ilse; Steward, Oswald; Macklin, Wendy B.; Loring, Jeanne F.; Lane, Thomas E.",Stem Cell Reports,654,20

MERS is caused by MERS-CoV, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Despite expert opinions that the danger of MERS might be exaggerated, there was an overreaction by the public according to the Korean mass media, which led to a noticeable reduction in social and economic activities during the outbreak. To explain this phenomenon, we presumed that machine learning-based analysis of media outlets would be helpful and collected a number of Korean mass media articles and short-text comments produced during the 10-week outbreak. To process and analyze the collected data (over 86 million words in total) effectively, we created a methodology composed of machine-learning and information-theoretic approaches. Our proposal included techniques for extracting emotions from emoticons and Internet slang, which allowed us to significantly (approximately 73%) increase the number of emotion-bearing texts needed for robust sentiment analysis of social media. As a result, we discovered a plausible explanation for the public overreaction to MERS in terms of the interplay between the disease, mass media, and public emotions.","Choi, Sungwoon; Lee, Jangho; Kang, Min-Gyu; Min, Hyeyoung; Chang, Yoon-Seok; Yoon, Sungroh",Methods,654,10

RT-PCR followed by internal probe hybridisation or Southern blotting, or nested PCRs are currently the most sensitive methods for their identification. However, none of the published techniques can differentiate satisfactorily rhinoviruses from other picornaviruses. Examination of the restriction maps of sequenced rhinoviruses, revealed a highly conserved BglI restriction site (GCCnnnnnGGC), located exactly in the middle of the 380-bp amplicon generated with the OL26–OL27 primer pair, which has been used extensively in the past to identify picornaviruses. Such a site was either not present, or positioned differently in other picornaviruses of known sequence. It was, therefore, considered that digestion of rhinovirus amplicons with this enzyme would result in two equal length fragments, generating a single 190-bp band in gel electrophoresis. In contrast, either one undigested 380-bp band or a double-band pattern would appear in amplicons from other picornaviruses. To test this hypothesis, Bgl digestions of OL26–OL27 amplicons from cultured and wild-type rhinoviruses, whose identity was confirmed by acid lability, as well as from echo, polio and coxsackie viruses were carried out. All rhinovirus samples were digested successfully generating single bands. Among the other picornaviruses, only 6.6% presented a single band pattern, while the rest were as predicted from the model. With a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity over 90%, the method described, which is rapid and remarkably easy to perform, can be used to distinguish rhinoviruses from other picornaviruses to a considerable extent.","Papadopoulos, N.

Methods: Data from 1691 elderly residents and 1000 members of staff were retrospectively collected through interviewing the medical teams in 24 LTCFs and using the hospitals’ electronic health recording systems. Results: Elderly residents were predominantly female (64.8%) with a mean age of 83.0 years. SARS-CoV-2 detection among residents (226, 13.4%) was significantly higher than among staff members (87, 8.7%) (P < 0.001).

So far, results for the German population are lacking. Furthermore, existing studies pre-specify comorbidity risks by broad categories rather than deriving them from the data using statistical learning techniques. METHODS: Risk factors for severe, critical and lethal courses of Covid-19 are identified from a large German claims dataset covering more than 4 million individuals. To avoid prior grouping and pre-selection of risk factors, fine-grained hierarchical information from medical classification systems for diagnoses, pharmaceuticals and procedures are used, resulting in more than 33,000 covariates. These are processed using a LASSO approach. RESULTS: We identify relevant risk factors, among which hypertensive diseases, heart disease and the corresponding medications are most relevant at population level. Prior use of diuretics is the strongest single medical predictor for severe course (e.g. Torasemide, odds ratio (OR) 1.801), but also for a critical course (OR 2.304) and death (OR 2.523). To assess risk profiles at the individual level, our approach sums up many such factors and has better predictive ability than using pre-specified morbidity groups (AUC for predicting critical course 0.875 versus AUC ≤ 0.865).

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of PSU during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Bangladeshi students. METHODS: A total of 601 Bangladeshi students were recruited through an online-based cross-sectional survey that was conducted between October 7 and November 2, 2020. The survey collected information related to socio-demographics, behavioral health, internet use behaviors, depression, anxiety, and PSU. Independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were performed to present the relationship between the studied variables and PSU. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used for investigating the explanatory power of the predictive models for PSU. RESULTS: Surprisingly, about 86.9% of the students scored to be problematic smartphone users (≥21 out of a total 36 based on the Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale). In addition, medical students, engaging in a relationship, performing less physical activity, longer duration of internet use, some sorts of internet use purpose (eg, messaging, watching videos, using social media), depression, and anxiety were significantly associated with higher scores of PSU. After adjusting all the studied variables, the final model explained a 31.3% variance predicting PSU. CONCLUSION: The present study is one of the first approaches to assess the prevalence of PSU among the Bangladeshi students during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the addiction level was superfluous (and this may be due to more online engagement related to the pandemic). Thus, the study recommended strategies or policies related to the students’ risk-reducing and healthy use of smartphones.","Hosen, Ismail; al Mamun, Firoj; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Abbasi, Amir Zaib; Zou, Liye; Guo, Tianyou; Mamun, Mohammed A",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,654,5

Adequate use of this equipment is more critical than ever because the risk of shortages must be balanced against the need to effectively protect health care workers, including prehospital personnel. Specific training is therefore necessary; however, the need for social distancing has markedly disrupted the delivery of continuing education courses. Electronic learning (e-learning) may provide significant advantages because it requires neither the physical presence of learners nor the repetitive use of equipment for demonstration. OBJECTIVE: Inclusion of game mechanics, or “gamification,” has been shown to increase knowledge and skill acquisition. The objective of this research was to develop a gamified e-learning module to interactively deliver concepts and information regarding the correct choice and handling of PPE. METHODS: The SERES framework was used to define and describe the development process, including scientific and design foundations. After we defined the target audience and learning objectives by interviewing the stakeholders, we searched the scientific literature to establish relevant theoretical bases. The learning contents were validated by infection control and prehospital experts. Learning mechanics were then determined according to the learning objectives, and the content that could benefit from the inclusion of game mechanics was identified. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in the selection and inclusion of 12 articles. In addition to gamification, pretesting, feedback, avoiding content skipping, and demonstrations using embedded videos were used as learning mechanics. Gamification was used to enhance the interactivity of the PPE donning and doffing sequences, which presented the greatest learning challenges. The module was developed with Articulate Storyline 3 to ensure that it would be compatible with a wide array of devices, as this software generates HTML5-compatible output that can be accessed on smartphones, tablets, and regular computers as long as a recent browser is available. CONCLUSIONS: A gamified e-learning module designed to promote better knowledge and understanding of PPE use among prehospital health care workers was created by following the SERES framework. The impact of this module should now be assessed by means of a randomized controlled trial.","Suppan, Mélanie; Gartner, Birgit; Golay, Eric; Stuby, Loric; White, Marion; Cottet, Philippe; Abbas, Mohamed; Iten, Anne; Harbarth, Stephan; Suppan, Laurent",JMIR Serious Games,654,1

This article explores Norwegian teachers’ ideologies of English in society and English in school to consider locally relevant 21st century English language teaching (ELT). Language ideologies construct certain social realities that shape teachers’ understanding of English and contextually meaningful ELT. Data was generated through extensive interviews with 12 teachers in basic education in Norway. Data were inductively analyzed using methods from grounded theory and resulted in a conceptual framework of teacher ideologies. Findings reveal English as a natural, supranational language in modern Norwegian society, but also as personal and threatening. English in school, on the other hand, is foreign, communicative, historic and cultural, humanistic, for learning interdisciplinary content, and in flux. The final category explores self-reflexive questions teachers raise about ownership and identity, diversity, digitalization, and global orientation. In considering new directions, findings suggest the need for a metalanguage for English in non-native contexts that better encompasses experiences in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world. A current initiative to support teachers in exploring new and locally appropriate directions in ELT is then recommended.","Chvala, Lynell",,654,21

However, research aiming to examine public willingness to wear (WTW) face masks in Pakistan are scarce. The current research aims to overcome this research void and contributes by expanding the theoretical mechanism of theory of planned behavior (TPB) to include three novel dimensions (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of face masks, and unavailability of face masks) to comprehensively analyze the factors that motivate people to, or inhibit people from, wearing face masks. The study is based on an inclusive questionnaire survey of a sample of 738 respondents in the provincial capitals of Pakistan, namely, Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, Gilgit, and Quetta. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the proposed hypotheses. The results show that attitude, social norms, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of face masks are the major influencing factors that positively affect public WTW face masks, whereas the cost of face masks and unavailability of face masks tend to have opposite effects. The results emphasize the need to enhance risk perceptions by publicizing the deadly effects of COVID-19 on the environment and society, ensure the availability of face masks at an affordable price, and make integrated and coherent efforts to highlight the benefits that face masks offer.","Irfan, Muhammad; Akhtar, Nadeem; Ahmad, Munir; Shahzad, Farrukh; Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai; Wu, Haitao; Yang, Chuxiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,654,23

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as “what-if” tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions – for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak—some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios. These skills and insights would improve public health practice and be of particular use in the promotion of injury and disease prevention programs and practices.","Hoard, Marna; Homer, Jack; Manley, William; Furbee, Paul; Haque, Arshadul; Helmkamp, James",Int J Hyg Environ Health,654,8

The genomes of SARS-CoV-2 are being rapidly sequenced and shared on public repositories. To keep up with these updates, scientists need to frequently refresh and reclean data sets, which is an ad hoc and labor-intensive process. Further, scientists with limited bioinformatics or programming knowledge may find it difficult to analyze SARS-CoV-2 genomes. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, we developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web server that enables simple and rapid analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. METHODS: CoV-Seq is implemented in Python and JavaScript. The web server and source code URLs are provided in this article. RESULTS: Given a new sequence, CoV-Seq automatically predicts gene boundaries and identifies genetic variants, which are displayed in an interactive genome visualizer and are downloadable for further analysis. A command-line interface is available for high-throughput processing. In addition, we aggregated all publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and China National GeneBank (CNGB), and extracted genetic variants from these sequences for download and downstream analysis. The CoV-Seq database is updated weekly. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed CoV-Seq, an integrated web service for fast and easy analysis of custom SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The web server provides an interactive module for the analysis of custom sequences and a weekly updated database of genetic variants of all publicly accessible SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We believe CoV-Seq will help improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of COVID-19.","Liu, Boxiang; Liu, Kaibo; Zhang, He; Zhang, Liang; Bian, Yuchen; Huang, Liang",J Med Internet Res,654,24

The rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines during the ‘cytokine storm’ induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to an increase in kynurenine that activates the AhR, thereby heightening the initial pro-inflammatory cytokine phase and suppressing the endogenous anti-viral response. Such AhR-driven changes underpin the heightened severity and fatality associated with pre-existent high-risk medical conditions, such as type II diabetes, as well as to how racial discrimination stress contributes to the raised severity/fatality in people from the Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities. The AhR is pivotal in modulating mitochondrial metabolism and co-ordinating specialized, pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), the melatonergic pathways, acetyl-coenzyme A, and the cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-prostaglandin (PG) E2 pathway that underpin ‘exhaustion’ in the endogenous anti-viral cells, paralleling similar metabolic suppression in cytolytic immune cells that is evident across all cancers. The pro-inflammatory cytokine induced gut permeability/dysbiosis and suppression of pineal melatonin are aspects of the wider pathophysiological underpinnings regulated by the AhR. This has a number of prophylactic and treatment implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancers and future research directions that better investigate the biological underpinnings of social processes and how these may drive health disparities.","Anderson, George; Carbone, Annalucia; Mazzoccoli, Gianluigi",Biology (Basel),654,1

Several studies indicate that these densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Methods This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1st, 2020. Traffic data was measured by the 6,307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the traffic gap between 2019 and 2020. And non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and COVID-19 confirmed cases was analyzed using single linear regression. Results The mean daily nationwide in 2020 was 143,655,563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159,044,566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend for traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon, there only was a positive but insignificant (β = 43,146, p = .056) linear relationship with the increasing numbers of new confirmed cases associated with increased traffic. Conclusions New confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. Particularly, the fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.","Lee, Hocheol; Park, Sung Jong; Lee, Ga Ram; Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Ji Ho; Jung, Yeseul; Nam, Eun Woo",Int J Infect Dis,654,16

RAS was initially related to regulation of blood pressure and sodium and water homeostasis. However, local or paracrine RAS were later identified in many tissues, including brain, and play a major role in their physiology and pathophysiology. In addition, a major component, ACE2, is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Overactivation of tissue RAS leads several oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in aging-related degenerative changes. In addition, a third level of RAS, the intracellular or intracrine RAS (iRAS), with still unclear functions has been observed. The possible interaction between the intracellular and extracellular RAS, and particularly the possible deleterious or beneficial effects of the iRAS activation are controversial. The dopaminergic system is particularly interesting to investigate the RAS as important functional interactions between dopamine and RAS have been observed in the brain and several peripheral tissues. Our recent observations in mitochondria and nucleus of dopaminergic neurons may clarify the role of the iRAS. This may be important for the developing of new therapeutic strategies, since the effects on both extracellular and intracellular RAS must be taken into account, and perhaps better understanding of COVID-19 cell mechanisms.","Labandeira-Garcia, Jose L.; Valenzuela, Rita; Costa-Besada, Maria A.; Villar-Cheda, Begoña; Rodriguez-Perez, Ana I.",Prog Neurobiol,654,1

Here, ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide-range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the ICU, requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within six days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patient’s comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 Likelihood Ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention. Significance statement The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age. The presence of antibodies specifically binding to this epitope plus a score cutoff can predict severe COVID-19 outcomes with 96.7% specificity.","Sen, S.; Sanders, E.C.; Gabriel, K.N.; Miller, B.M.; Isoda, H.M.; Salcedo, G.S.; Garrido, J.E.; Dyer, R.P.; Nakajima, R.; Jain, A.; Caldaruse, A.-M.; Santos, A.M.; Bhuvan, K.; Tifrea, D.F.; Ricks-Oddie, J.L.; Felgner, P.L.; Edwards, R.A.; Majumdar, S.; Weiss, G.A.",bioRxiv,654,10

Failure to recognize a lesion as melanoma at first presentation might delay surgery aimed at complete resection. Acral melanoma has been related with the highest rate of misdiagnosis (~30%) causing further delayed diagnosis. Reliability of patient’ history taking in melanoma has not yet been systematically reported. PRESENTED CASES: Two patients visited our oncology clinic with pigmented lesions in their soles. A 66-year-old man disclosed it appeared since a year ago after accidently hitting a stone while farming. Physical examination showed a black-brown irregular 100 × 80 mm lesion covering the distal third of the right sole with ulceration in the central lesion. The second patient was a geriatric woman with a black-purple 25 × 27 mm lesion with slight protrusion and ulceration in the central, irregular border, and partial hyperkeratosis. She explained the lesion emerged two years ago after she accidently stepped on a nail. Both patients were then diagnosed with acral melanomas and were treated with wide-excision, closure with skin grafting, and inguinal dissection. DISCUSSION: Both patients reported history of traumas in lesions later confirmed as acral melanomas. Although history taking can provide up to 80% of the information for accurate diagnosis, in ambivalent cases, careful anamnesis, clinical examination, and biopsy are required to confirm diagnosis of acral melanoma. Early disease identification to establish definitive diagnosis of cancer is generally associated with better clinical outcomes. In suspected cases, vigilance toward misleading information in history taking is required.","Anwar, Sumadi Lukman; Dwianingsih, Ery Kus; Chandra, Tania Maharani; Wijayanti, Arini Rizky; Widhanto, Haryo; Ndraha Khairindra, Adryan Kalya; Hardiyanto, Herjuna; Suwardjo, Suwardjo",Ann Med Surg (Lond),654,22

Here we investigated the relationship between average number of transmissions though time, the reproductive number Rt, and social distancing index as reported by mobile phone data service inloco, for Goias State, Brazil, between March and June 2020. We calculated Rt values using EpiEstim package in R-plataform for confirmed cases incidence curves. We found a correlation equal to -0.72 between Rt values for confirmed cases and isolation index at a time lag of 8 days. As the Rt values were paired with center of the moving window of 7 days, the delay matches the mean incubation period of the virus. Our findings reinforce that isolation index can be an effective surrogate for modeling and epidemiological analyses and, more importantly, can be an useful metrics for anticipating the need for early interventions, a critical issue in public health.","Jardim, L.; Diniz-Filho, J.

We predicted that perceived similarity in agency/socioeconomic success and conservative-progressive beliefs increases cooperation across groups. Self-identified members (N = 583) of 30 society-representative U.S. groups (gays, Muslims, Blacks, upper class, women, Democrats, conservatives etc.) played an incentivized one-time continuous prisoner's dilemma game with one self-identified member of each of these groups. Players knew nothing of each other except one group membership. Consistent with the ABC (agency-beliefs-communion) model of spontaneous stereotypes, perceived self-group similarity in agency and beliefs independently increased expected and actual cooperation across groups, controlling for shared group membership. Similarity in conservative-progressive beliefs had a stronger effect on cooperation than similarity in agency, and this effect of similarity in beliefs was stronger for individuals with extreme (progressive or conservative) compared to moderate beliefs.","Koch, Alex; Dorrough, Angela; Glöckner, Andreas; Imhoff, Roland",J Exp Soc Psychol,654,20

An important application of HETs is telerehabilitation for patients with musculoskeletal shoulder disorders. Currently, there is no overview of HETs that assist patients with musculoskeletal shoulder disorders when exercising at home. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review provides a broad overview of HETs that assist patients with musculoskeletal shoulder disorders when exercising at home. It focuses on concepts and components of HETs, exercise program strategies, development phases, and reported outcomes. METHODS: The search strategy used Medical Subject Headings and text words related to the terms upper extremity, exercises, and information and communication technologies. The MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE Xplore, CINAHL, PEDro, and Scopus databases were searched. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and then full texts against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A systematic narrative synthesis was performed. Overall, 8988 records published between 1997 and 2019 were screened. Finally, 70 articles introducing 56 HETs were included. RESULTS: Identified HETs range from simple videoconferencing systems to mobile apps with video instructions to complex sensor-based technologies. Various software, sensor hardware, and hardware for output are in use. The most common hardware for output are PC displays (in 34 HETs). Microsoft Kinect cameras in connection with related software are frequently used as sensor hardware (in 27 HETs). The identified HETs provide direct or indirect instruction, monitoring, correction, assessment, information, or a reminder to exercise. Common parameters for exercise instructions are a patient’s range of motion (in 43 HETs), starting and final position (in 32 HETs), and exercise intensity (in 20 HETs). In total, 48 HETs provide visual instructions for the exercises; 29 HETs report on telerehabilitation aspects; 34 HETs only report on prototypes; and 15 HETs are evaluated for technical feasibility, acceptance, or usability, using different assessment instruments. Efficacy or effectiveness is demonstrated for only 8 HETs. In total, 18 articles report on patients’ evaluations. An interdisciplinary contribution to the development of technologies is found in 17 HETs. CONCLUSIONS: There are various HETs, ranging from simple videoconferencing systems to complex sensor-based technologies for telerehabilitation, that assist patients with musculoskeletal shoulder disorders when exercising at home. Most HETs are not ready for practical use. Comparability is complicated by varying prototype status, different measurement instruments, missing telerehabilitation aspects, and few efficacy studies. Consequently, choosing an HET for daily use is difficult for health care professionals and decision makers. Prototype testing, usability, and acceptance tests with the later target group under real-life conditions as well as efficacy or effectiveness studies with patient-relevant core outcomes for every promising HET are required. Furthermore, health care professionals and patients should be more involved in the product design cycle to consider relevant practical aspects.","Elgert, Lena; Steiner, Bianca; Saalfeld, Birgit; Marschollek, Michael; Wolf, Klaus-Hendrik",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,654,1

METHODS: We used a fundamental qualitative descriptive study design, enrolling 15 experts in public health and AI from June 2018 until July 2019 who worked in North America and Asia. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews, iteratively coded the resulting transcripts, and analyzed the results thematically. RESULTS: We developed 137 codes, from which nine themes emerged. The themes included opportunities such as leveraging big data and improving interventions; barriers to adoption such as confusion regarding AI’s applicability, limited capacity, and poor data quality; and risks such as propagation of bias, exacerbation of inequity, hype, and poor regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Experts are cautiously optimistic about AI’s impacts on public health practice, particularly for improving disease surveillance. However, they perceived substantial barriers, such as a lack of available expertise, and risks, including inadequate regulation. Therefore, investment and research into AI for public health practice would likely be beneficial. However, increased access to high-quality data, research and education regarding the limitations of AI, and development of rigorous regulation are necessary to realize these benefits.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) effectively forecasts the surge of COVID-19 cases in humans in a particular region. To understand the genomic characteristics/footprints and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, we analyzed 807 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 countries deposited in GISAID till 22 May 2021. The highest number of sequences (n = 638) were reported in Austria, followed by the Netherlands, China, and Bangladesh. Wastewater samples were highest (40.0%) to successfully yield the virus genome followed by a 24 h composite wastewater sample (32.6%) and sewage (18.5%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 environmental strains are a close congener with the strains mostly circulating in the human population from the same region. Clade GRY (32.7%), G (29.2%), GR (25.3%), O (7.2%), GH (3.4%), GV (1.4%), S (0.5%), and L (0.4%) were found in environmental samples. Various lineages were identified in environmental samples; nevertheless, the highest percentages (49.4%) of the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) were detected in Austria, Liechtenstein, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. Other prevalent lineages were B.1 (18.2%), B.1.1 (9.2%), and B.1.160 (3.9%). Furthermore, a significant number of amino acid substitutions were found in environmental strains where the D614G was found in 83.8% of the sequences. However, the key mutations—N501Y (44.6%), S982A (44.4%), A570D (43.3%), T716I (40.4%), and P681H (40.1%) were also recorded in spike protein. The identification of the environmental belvedere of SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic signature is crucial to detect outbreaks, forecast pandemic harshness, and prepare with the appropriate tools to control any impending pandemic. We recommend genomic environmental surveillance to trace the emerging variants and diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the community. Additionally, proper disposal and treatment of wastewater, sewage, and medical wastes are important to prevent environmental contamination.","Islam, Ariful; Sayeed, Md. Abu; Kalam, Md.

While the workplace represents an important context of social integration, previous studies evaluating the effect of discrimination experienced in the workplace found worse mental health status among immigrants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether self-perceived workplace discrimination has any role in the mental health status of immigrants living and working in Italy, evaluating the contribution of other personal experiences, such as loneliness and life satisfaction. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 12,408 immigrants (aged 15–64) living and working in Italy. Data were derived from the first national survey on immigrants carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat). Mental health status was measured through the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the SF-12 questionnaire. A linear multivariate linear regression was carried out to evaluate the association between mental health status, self-perceived workplace discrimination, and sociodemographic factors; path analysis was used to quantify the mediation effect of self-perceived loneliness, level of life satisfaction, and the Physical Component Summary (PCS). RESULTS: Mental health status was inversely associated (p < 0.001) with self-perceived workplace discrimination (β:-1.737), self-perceived loneliness (β:-2.653), and physical health status (β:-0.089); it was directly associated with level of life satisfaction (β:1.122). As confirmed by the path analysis, the effect of self-perceived workplace discrimination on MCS was mediated by the other factors considered: self-perceived loneliness (11.9%), level of life satisfaction (20.7%), and physical health status (3.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that self-perceived workplace discrimination is associated with worse mental health status in immigrant workers through personal experiences in the workplace and explains the effect of the exposure to workplace discrimination on immigrants’ psychological well-being. Our findings suggest that an overall public health response is needed to facilitate the social integration of immigrants and their access to health services, particularly those services that address mental health issues.

Sri Lanka is situated in the endemic belt of melioidosis. Melioidosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and results in high mortality rates in severe infection. Case Report. We report a 54-year-old previously healthy Sri Lankan farmer who presented with septicemia following a cut injury to the right leg while working in a paddy field. Initially, he had mild wound sepsis, and later, his condition deteriorated rapidly. The patient required organ support later for cardiovascular instability, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy. The patient's blood culture was negative on the admission day, and the repeated blood culture taken at the ICU was contaminated with a commensal flora initially and later isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although wound swab culture taken on the first day isolated an organism, it took six days to identify it as Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient succumbed to severe melioidosis leading to a severe sepsis and multiorgan failure in spite of treatment with meropenem. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis when a patient comes with risk factors for melioidosis.","Warapitiya, Dinuka S; Subasinghe, Shyama; de Silva, Rukshanie Frances; Piyarisi, Dadallage Lalitha; Jayatilleke, Kushlani",Case Rep Med,654,11

During the pandemic, Australian pharmacists have been working collaboratively with multidisciplinary teams at the frontline to manage the equitable and safe supply of medicines despite the unprecedented situation. Although these presented problems for small pharmacies, social distancing policies were implemented widely to maintain personal and environmental hygiene and reduce the number of face-to-face patient visits. In collaboration with various pharmaceutical stakeholders, the Australian government responded rapidly to ensure equitable and sufficient supply with continued access to therapeutic goods during the pandemic. Additionally, vital policies and practices have been implemented, including supplying regular medicines at government-subsidized prices, a maximum one-month supply of some prescription medicines and purchase limits on over-the-counter medicines (one unit per purchase), medication management reviews through telehealth, electronic and digital prescribing, home delivery of medicines to vulnerable people and those in home isolation and the provision of serious shortage medicine substitution rights to pharmacists. Pharmacists were encouraged to communicate and collaborate with other local pharmacies to ensure that essential pharmacy services met community needs (e.g., opening hours). However, there has been a shortage of some medicines due to supply chain disruption and increased demand due to the pandemic. Higher demand for flu vaccinations, increased work pressure in pharmacies, and severe frustration and anxiety in pharmacy customers were also reported. Vigilance is required to monitor foreseeable shortages of therapeutics goods, particularly in regional pharmacies. There is an opportunity for long-term change to retain certain rights and roles based on the competence shown by pharmacists in this challenging period, such as telephone medication reviews, telehealth for MedsCheck and Diabetes MedsCheck, digital prescription handling and therapeutic substitution.","Parajuli, Daya Ram; Khanal, Saval; Wechkunanukul, Kannikar Hannah; Ghimire, Saurav; Poudel, Arjun",Res Social Adm Pharm,654,12

Their heterogeneity was investigated by analysis of the ORF3 gene because of its potential function as a representation of virulence. According to the results, six Fujian strains in Group 1 showed a different genotype with unique point mutations, which might be used in differentiation between PEDV groups and brought potential antigenic variation. P55 and five reference strains in Group 2 had a long length deletion, showing another genotype and might be involved in the variation of virulence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the collected Fujian strains were very distant from the vaccine development strain CV777, which might be the reason why the vaccine was inefficient to control the disease. The results can help to reconsider the strategy of PEDV vaccine management and prevent outbreaks of PEDV-induced diarrhea more efficiently.","Chen, Xi; Zeng, Lili; Yang, Jinxian; Yu, Fusong; Ge, Junqing; Guo, Qing; Gao, Xindang; Song, Tieying",Viruses,654,1

Engagement is a process of working collaboratively with diverse groups of people to address common issues. We conducted a scoping review of youth HIV prevention interventions in sub‐Saharan Africa to identify and categorize forms and levels of youth engagement across the lifespan of intervention research. METHODS: We followed Arksey and O'Malley's framework for organizing a scoping review. We searched seven databases for related articles on identified intervention studies through May 28(th) 2020. Included studies focused on youth (10 to 24 years old) HIV prevention interventions in sub‐Saharan Africa. Two reviewers independently examined citations and full manuscripts for inclusion. Data were extracted on study characteristics, location, description of youth engagement and extent of engagement. Youth engagement approaches were categorized based on Hart’s ladder as substantial engagement (strong youth decision‐making power), moderate engagement (shared decision making with adults), minimal engagement (no youth decision‐making power) or no engagement. RESULTS: We identified 3149 citations and included 112 studies reporting on 74 unique HIV interventions. Twenty‐two interventions were in low‐income countries, 49 in middle‐income countries, and three were in both. Overall, only nine interventions (12%) had substantial or moderate youth engagement, two‐thirds (48, 65%) had minimal youth engagement and 17 interventions (23%) had no youth engagement. We also identified specific engagement strategies (e.g. youth‐led research, crowdsourcing) that were feasible in multiple settings and resulted in substantial engagement. CONCLUSIONS: We found limited youth engagement in youth HIV prevention intervention studies in sub‐Saharan Africa.

The choice of support mode depends largely on the indication. Patients with respiratory failure are predominantly treated with a venovenous (VV) approach. We hypothesized that mortality in Germany in ECLS therapy did not differ from previously reported literature METHODS: Inpatient data from Germany from 2007 to 2018 provided by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany were analysed. The international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems codes (ICD) and process keys (OPS) for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) types, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospital mortality were used. RESULTS: In total, 45,647 hospitalized patients treated with ECLS were analysed. In Germany, 231 hospitals provided ECLS therapy, with a median of 4 VV-ECMO and 9 VA-ECMO in 2018. Overall hospital mortality remained higher than predicted in comparison to the values reported in the literature. The number of VV-ECMO cases increased by 236% from 825 in 2007 to 2768 in 2018. ARDS was the main indication for VV-ECMO in only 33% of the patients in the past, but that proportion increased to 60% in 2018. VA-ECMO support is of minor importance in the treatment of ARDS in Germany. The age distribution of patients undergoing ECLS has shifted towards an older population. In 2018, the hospital mortality decreased in VV-ECMO patients and VV-ECMO patients with ARDS to 53.9% (n = 1493) and 54.4% (n = 926), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ARDS is a severe disease with a high mortality rate despite ECLS therapy. Although endpoints and timing of the evaluations differed from those of the CESAR and EOLIA studies and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry, the reported mortality in these studies was lower than in the present analysis. Further prospective analyses are necessary to evaluate outcomes in ECMO therapy at the centre volume level.","Friedrichson, Benjamin; Mutlak, Haitham; Zacharowski, Kai; Piekarski, Florian",Crit Care,654,21

This paper describes how an intensive weight management clinic rapidly transitioned from in‐person only to a telehealth environment. METHOD: As a program evaluation project, changes to clinic procedures were tracked on a weekly basis. Patients were invited to complete phone surveys after clinic appointments from 1 May 2020 to 31 July 2020. The survey included 12 items rated on a 5‐point scale (“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”). RESULTS: Adaptations included converting team meetings and clinical training to phone/video platforms and transferring a complex patient tracking system to an interactive virtual format. Fifty‐eight patients completed phone surveys (81% response rate). All “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that they were satisfied with telehealth care; 51% “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that telephone visits were as good as in‐person visits; and 53% preferred phone appointments even after pandemic restrictions are eased. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to rapidly transition to a telehealth clinic when supported by infrastructure and resources of a national, integrated healthcare system. Patient preferences include access to both telehealth and in‐person services. A blended telehealth/in‐person model that maintains interdisciplinary collaboration and training is necessary even after the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Lohnberg, Jessica A.; Salcido, Lianne; Frayne, Susan; Mahtani, Naina; Bates, Cheryl; Hauser, Michelle E.; Breland, Jessica Y.",Obes Sci Pract,654,16

The elderly people in senior care facility are commonly suffering from various geriatric syndromes, including declined daily living activities, cognitive dysfunction, frailty, comorbidities, and polypharmacy, which make them vulnerable to adverse effects, like hypoglycemia and fall. Therefore, layered management is necessary for this population with group disparities. However, the staff in senior care facility vary greatly in concepts and skills on management of senile diabetic population, which needs urgently to be standardized and improved. For this purpose, based on literature review and panel discussion, 28 recommendations are proposed in respect of the standardized management of blood glucose, covering the comprehensive assessment, layered management and grouping, exercise, nutrition, glucose monitoring, identification and treatment of severe hyperglycemia, identification of macrovascular and microvascular complications, management of hypoglycemic drugs, falls and choking and other common problems, blood glucose screening, hypoglycemia prevention, and blood glucose management in major public health events or serious natural disasters. This guideline aims to standardize management skills of medical staff and caregivers in senior care facility for the blood glucose of elderly people and improve their quality of life.","Wang, Shuang; Zhan, Junkun; Cheng, Mei; Pan, Qi; Liang, Zhen; Liu, Xiaohong; Peng, Wen; Cao, Xiaopei; Luo, Yingquan; Kang, Dongmei; Liu, Youshuo",Aging Med (Milton),654,28

Hyperglycemia is a predictor of poor prognosis in COVID-19 disease. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to describe a case series of HHS and/or DKA likely triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine. The aim is to alert physicians of the potential hyperglycemic complications from the COVID-19 vaccination and to provide further insight into the underlying mechanism of the bidirectional relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and DM. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: All 3 patients developed HHS and/or DKA within 2 to 10 days of the COVID-19 vaccination. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative and other clinical precipitating factors were excluded. Two patients had a history of type 2 DM (T2DM) with pre-admission HbA1c levels of 7.0% to 7.5% while 1 patient was newly diagnosed with T2DM during the hospitalization. They were each treated with insulin infusion and were discharged on subcutaneous insulin therapy. Due to the rapid resolution of the hyperglycemia, insulin was discontinued in all patients within 8 weeks and they remain well-controlled on oral DM medications. CONCLUSION: Severe hyperglycemia including HHS and DKA may be triggered by COVID-19 vaccination. Early evaluation and screening of patients with hyperglycemic symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination is recommended. The vaccine-induced hyperglycemia may provide further insight into the underlying pathogenesis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. The underlying robust inflammatory response and “cytokine storm” may be the primary precipitant.","Lee, Hanna J; Sajan, Alen; Tomer, Yaron",J Endocr Soc,654,20

With this in mind, several studies have indicated that glial cells play key roles in the development and progression of CNS diseases. In this sense, gliotoxicity can be referred as the cellular, molecular, and neurochemical changes that can mediate toxic effects or ultimately lead to impairment of the ability of glial cells to protect neurons and/or other glial cells. On the other hand, glioprotection is associated with specific responses of glial cells, by which they can protect themselves as well as neurons, resulting in an overall improvement of the CNS functioning. In addition, gliotoxic events, including metabolic stresses, inflammation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress, as well as their related mechanisms, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of neurological, psychiatric and infectious diseases. However, glioprotective molecules can prevent or improve these glial dysfunctions, representing glial cells-targeting therapies. Therefore, this review will provide a brief summary of types and functions of glial cells and point out cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with gliotoxicity and glioprotection, potential glioprotective molecules and their mechanisms, as well as gliotherapy. In summary, we expect to address the relevance of gliotoxicity and glioprotection in the CNS homeostasis and diseases.","Quincozes-Santos, André; Santos, Camila Leite; de Souza Almeida, Rômulo Rodrigo; da Silva, Amanda; Thomaz, Natalie K.; Costa, Naithan Ludian Fernandes; Weber, Fernanda Becker; Schmitz, Izaviany; Medeiros, Lara Scopel; Medeiros, Lívia; Dotto, Bethina Segabinazzi; Dias, Filipe Renato Pereira; Sovrani, Vanessa; Bobermin, Larissa Daniele",Mol Neurobiol,654,30

Materials and Methods: Participants were interviewed by phone when confined at home during the national lockdown (T1-May 2020; N = 138 young adults; N = 119 older adults) and after the first wave of contagions, when restrictions were discarded (T2-September 2020; N = 52 young adults; N = 59 older adults). A sub-sample also participated in a third assessment (T3-December 2020). Participants completed questionnaires assessing their emotional and psychological functioning (i.e., positive and negative affect, perceived social and emotional loneliness, resilience) along with memory tasks (Backward Digit Span task and words list recall). Results: Although individuals reported less positive and more negative emotions during the lockdown than at T2, results showed that older adults displayed overall fewer negative emotions and greater resilience than young adults. The latter were those who reported feeling more emotionally lonely when compared to their older counterpart during the lockdown than afterward. Older adults’ advantage in emotional and psychological functioning was also confirmed 7 months after the national lockdown. Only age-related differences in favor of young adults for the memory tasks were found. The measures of interest were also susceptible to mood and/or concerns of COVID-19 effects. Discussion: These findings further highlight the age-related advantage of older adults managing the emotional and psychological experience even when facing an unexpected, prolonged, and unpredictable, stressful life event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Carbone, Elena; Palumbo, Rocco; Sella, Enrico; Lenti, Graziana; Di Domenico, Alberto; Borella, Erika",Front Aging Neurosci,654,15

Within 10 months of its outbreak, SARS‐CoV‐2 has infected more than 23 million people around the world. Evidence suggests that older adults are the most vulnerable to infection and have an increased risk of mortality. Reduced immunity and underlying medical conditions make them risk‐prone and vulnerable to critical care. Older adults affected with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus present with distinct clinical manifestations necessitating specific treatment needs and management protocols. While it is crucial to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV), the role of oral healthcare workers in addressing the specific needs of ageing adult patients by adopting specific guidelines and appropriate infection control protocols is timely.

National reports have declared such schools to connote risk for elevated problems among teens. Asian American students are commonly referred to as model minorities, but little is known about adjustment issues within academically competitive settings, specifically. Guided by past research on culturally salient issues, multiple U.S. high schools were examined to (a) determine areas of relative strength versus weakness in adjustment of Asian Americans compared with Whites, and (b) more importantly, to illuminate salient within-group processes related to Asian Americans' well-being. Risk modifiers examined were perceptions of ethnic discrimination, parent perfectionism, internalized achievement pressure, authenticity in self-presentation, and closeness to school adults. Outcome variables included depression, anxiety, and isolation at school. Results demonstrated that Asian Americans fared better than Whites on anxiety and school isolation, but with low effect sizes. By contrast, they fared more poorly on almost all risk modifiers, with a large effect size on discrimination. Regression results showed that among Asian Americans the most consistent associations, across cohorts and outcomes, were for discrimination and authenticity. Findings underscore the need for greater recognition that discrimination could be inimical for students not typically thought of as vulnerable-Asian Americans in high-achieving schools; these issues are especially pressing in light of increased racism following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results also suggest that feelings of inauthenticity could be a marker of generalized vulnerability to internalizing symptoms. Implications for future theory and interventions are discussed.

The carboxypeptidase domain not only metabolizes angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1–7), but also other peptide substrates, such as apelin, kinins and morphins. In addition, the collectrin domain regulates the levels of some amino acids in the blood, in particular of tryptophan.

This study aims to determine the profile and possible mechanisms behind CNS inflammatory diseases in the context of Covid-19. We conducted a systematic review of case reports on Covid-19-related encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, acute necrotizing encephalitis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in adults, published before January 2021. A total of 182 cases (encephalitis = 109, meningoencephalitis = 26, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis = 35, acute necrotizing (hemorrhagic) encephalitis = 12) were included. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and increased protein level was present in less than 50%, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal in 78 and 93.2% of all cases, respectively. Viral particles were detected in cerebrospinal fluid of only 13 patients and autoantibodies were present in seven patients. All patients presented with altered mental status, either in the form of impaired consciousness or psychological/cognitive decline. Seizure, cranial nerve signs, motor, and reflex abnormalities were among associated symptoms. Covid-19-associated encephalitis presents with a distinctive profile requiring thorough diagnosis and thereby a comprehensive knowledge of the disease. The clinical profile of brain inflammation in Covid-19 exhibits majority of abnormal imaging and electroencephalography findings with mild/moderate pleocytosis or proteinorrhachia as prevalent as normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Oligoclonal bands and autoantibody assessments are useful in further evaluating neuro-covid patients, as supported by our pooled evidence. Despite the possibility that direct viral invasion cannot be easily estimated, it is still more likely that immune-mediated or autoimmune reactions play a more important role in SARS-CoV-2 neuroinflammation.","Zamani, Raha; Pouremamali, Rozhina; Rezaei, Nima",Reviews in the neurosciences,654,20

Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, a retrospective review evaluated the outcomes of 158,710 bottles collected between November 2018 and October 2019. The number of positive blood bottles was 13,592 (8.6%); 99% of positive aerobic and anaerobic bottles flagged positive by 91.5 and 108 h, respectively. The mean (median) times to positivity were 18.4 h (15.6 h) for Staphylococcus aureus, 12.3 h (9.5 h) for Escherichia coli, 22.2 h (15.9 h) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 48.9 h (42.9 h) for Candida spp. Only 175 bottles (0.1% of all bottles) flagged positive after 4 days of incubation; 89 (51%) of these bottles grew Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) species.

Finally, a seeded study of the HACEK group (i.e., Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella), historically associated with delayed blood culture positivity, demonstrated no benefit to extended incubation beyond 4 days. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that a 4-day incubation time was sufficient for the Virtuo system and media.

Although the stay-at-home order was one of the most effective methods to contain its spread, residents in lower-income neighborhoods faced barriers to practicing social distancing. We aimed to quantify the differential impact of stay-at-home policy on COVID-19 transmission and residents mobility across neighborhoods of different levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. MethodsThis was a comparative interrupted time-series analysis at the county level. We included 2,087 counties from 38 states which both implemented and lifted the state-wide stay-at-home order. Every county was assigned to one of four equally-sized groups based on its levels of disadvantage, represented by the Area Deprivation Index. Prevalence of COVID-19 was calculated by dividing the daily number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases by the number of residents from the 2010 Census. We used the Social Distancing Index, derived from the COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, to measure the social distancing practice. For the evaluation of implementation, the observation started from Mar 1 St 2020 to one day before lifting; and, for lifting, it ranged from one day after implementation to Jul 5 th 2020. We calculated a comparative change of daily trends in COVID-19 prevalence and Social Distancing Index between counties with three highest disadvantage levels and those with the least level before and after the implementation and lifting of the stay-at-home order, separately. ResultsOn both stay-at-home implementation and lifting dates, COVID-19 prevalence was much higher among counties with the highest or lowest disadvantage level, while mobility decreased as the disadvantage level increased. Mobility of the most disadvantaged counties was least impacted by stay-at-home implementation and relaxation compared to counties with the most resources; however, disadvantaged counties experienced the largest relative increase in COVID-19 infection after both stay-at-home implementation and relaxation. ConclusionsNeighborhoods with varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage reacted differently to the implementation and relaxation of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Policymakers should consider investing more resources in disadvantaged counties as the pandemic may not stop until most neighborhoods have it under control.","Chang, Hsien-Yen; Tang, Wenze; Hatef, Elham; Kitchen, Christopher; Weiner, Jonathan P.; Kharrazi, Hadi",,654,6

RepRNA derived from the non-cytopathogenic classical swine fever virus (CSFV) targets monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), potentially promoting prolonged antigen expression in the DCs, contrasting with cytopathogenic RepRNA. We engineered pestivirus RepRNA constructs encoding influenza virus H5N1 (A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/2004) nucleoprotein (Rep-NP) or hemagglutinin (Rep-HA). The inherent RNase-sensitivity of RepRNA had to be circumvented to ensure efficient delivery to DCs for intracellular release and RepRNA translation; we have reported how only particular synthetic delivery vehicle formulations are appropriate. The question remained concerning RepRNA packaged in virus replicon particles (VRPs); we have now compared an efficient polyethylenimine (PEI)-based formulation (polyplex) with VRP-delivery as well as naked RepRNA co-administered with the potent bis-(3’,5’)-cyclic dimeric adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) adjuvant. All formulations contained a Rep-HA/Rep-NP mix, to assess the breadth of both humoral and cell-mediated defences against the influenza virus antigens. Assessment employed pigs for their close immunological relationship to humans, and as natural hosts for influenza virus. Animals receiving the VRPs, as well as PEI-delivered RepRNA, displayed strong humoral and cellular responses against both HA and NP, but with VRPs proving to be more efficacious. In contrast, naked RepRNA plus c-di-AMP could induce only low-level immune responses, in one out of five pigs. In conclusion, RepRNA encoding different influenza virus antigens are efficacious for inducing both humoral and cellular immune defences in pigs. Comparisons showed that packaging within VRP remains the most efficacious for delivery leading to induction of immune defences; however, this technology necessitates employment of expensive complementing cell cultures, and VRPs do not target human cells. Therefore, choosing the appropriate synthetic delivery vehicle still offers potential for rapid vaccine design, particularly in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic.","Démoulins, Thomas; Ruggli, Nicolas; Gerber, Markus; Thomann-Harwood, Lisa J.; Ebensen, Thomas; Schulze, Kai; Guzmán, Carlos A.; McCullough, Kenneth C.",Front Immunol,654,33

As well, the paper explores outcomes associated with a third ""Hybrid"" policy that reflects ranges of expected levels of protection according to Pfizer and Moderna EUA's, but entails a 35 day separation between first and second dose, which exceeds the 21 days set out in Pfizer documentation or the 28 days in Moderna documentation. Four CovidSIMVL parameters are varied in the course of 75 simulated clinical trials. Two relate directly to the vaccines and their impacts (duration between doses; degree of expected protection conferred by different vaccines following first or second dose). Two relate to the simulation contexts to which the vaccines are applied (degree of infectivity; duration of infectivity). The simulated trials demonstrate expected effects for timing of second dose, and for degree of protection associated with first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, and the effects are consistent with an assumed value of 75% for degree of protection after first and second doses for the Hybrid vaccine. However, the simulated trials suggest a more complex interaction between expected level of protection following first dose, timing of second dose and degree of infectivity. These results suggest that policy options should not be considered independent of the transmission dynamics that are manifested in the contexts in which the policies could be applied. CovidSIMVL embodies stochasticity in the mechanisms that govern viral transmission, and it treats the basic reproduction number (R0)as an emergent characteristic of transmission dynamics, not as a pre-set value that determines those dynamics. As such, results reported in this paper reflect outcomes that could happen, but do not necessarily reflect what is more or less likely to happen, given different configurations of parameters. The discussion section goes into some measure of detail regarding next steps that could be pursued to enhance the potential for agent-based models such as CovidSIMVL to inform exploration of possible vaccination policies, and to project outcomes that are possible or likely in local contexts, where stochasticity and heterogeneity of transmission must be featured in models that are intended to reflect local realism.","Chang, E.; Moselle, K.

Despite the large body of evidence as regards the effect of lifestyle factors on the CVD onset, the gender-specific effect of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on the prognosis of patients with already established CVD has not been well investigated and understood. Furthermore, CVD in women is often misdiagnosed, underestimated and undertreated. Women also experience hormonal changes from adolescence till elder life that affect CV physiology. Unfortunately, in most of the clinical trials women are under-represented, leading to limited knowledge of CV and systemic impact effects of several treatment modalities on women’s health. Thus, in this consensus a group of female Cardiologists from the Hellenic Society of Cardiology present the special features of CVD in women: the different needs in primary and secondary prevention, as well as therapeutic strategies, that may be implemented in daily clinical practice in order to eliminate underestimation and undertreatment of CVD in female population.","Chrysohoou, Christina; Aggeli, Constantina; Avgeropoulou, Katerina; Aroni, Maria; Bonou, Maria; Boutsikou, Maria; Brili, Stella; Chamodraka, Eftyhia; Dagre, Anna; Flevari, Panagiota; Fountoulaki, Aikaterini; Frogoudaki, Alexandra; Gkouziouta, Aggeliki; Grapsa, Julia; Hatzinikolaou-Kotsakou, Eleni; Kalantzi, Kallirroi; Kitsiou, Anastasia; Kostakou, Panagiota; Kourea, Roy; Koutrolou-Sotiropoulou, Paraskevi; Marketou, Maria; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Naka, Katerina K.; Nikolaou, Maria; Papazachou, Ourania; Papavasileiou, Lida Pieretta; Simeonidou, Eftihia; Theopistou, Artemisia; Triantafyllidi, Helen; Trikka, Chrysanthi; Tsekoura, Dorothea; Tzifa, Aphrodite; Vaina, Sophia; Vrettou, Agathi Rosa; Zaglavara, Theodora; Kolovou., Genovefa; Aggelopoulou, Eleni; Antoniou, Anna; Bistola, Vasiliki; Bilianou, Eleni; Boufidou, Αmalia; Demerouti, Eftyhia; Giannakopoulou, Vasiliki; Karvouni, Evaggelia; Komnou, Areti; Kyriakou, Panagiota; Limperi, Sotiria; Mavrogianni, Aggeliki; Michalopoulou, Helena; Nakou, Eleni; Nyhtari, Eva; Papavasiliou, Maria; Pietri, Panagiota; Petropoulou, Evdokia; Prappa, Efstathia; Riga, Maria; Sbarouni, Eftihia; Stavrati, Alexia",Hellenic J Cardiol,654,9

GX-19 contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and GX-19N contains plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) foldon and nucleocapsid protein (NP) as well as plasmid DNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Methods : Two open-label phase 1 trials of GX-19 and GX-19N safety and immunogenicity were performed in healthy adults aged 19-55 years. GX-19 trial participants received two vaccine injections (1.5 mg or 3.0 mg, 1:1 ratio) four weeks apart. GX-19N trial participants received two 3.0 mg vaccine injections four weeks apart. Findings : Between June 17 and July 30 and December 28 and 31, 2020, 40 and 21 participants were enrolled in the GX-19 and GX-19N trials, respectively. Thirty-two participants (52.5%) reported 80 treatment-emergent adverse events (AE) after vaccination. All solicited AEs were mild except one case of moderate fatigue reported in the 1.5 mg GX-19 group. Binding antibody responses increased after vaccination in all groups. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of spike-binding antibodies on day 57 were 85.74, 144.20, and 201.59 in the 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg GX-19 groups and the 3.0 mg GX-19N group, respectively. In GX-19N group, neutralizing antibody response (50% neutralizing titer using FRNT) significantly increased after vaccination, but GMT of neutralizing antibody on day 57 (37.26) was lower than those from human convalescent serum (288.78). GX-19N induced stronger T cell responses than GX-19. The magnitude of GX-19N-induced T cell responses was comparable to those observed in the convalescent PBMCs. GX-19N induced both SARS-CoV-2 spike- and NP-specific T cell responses, and the amino acid sequences of 15-mer peptides containing NP-specific T cell epitopes identified in GX-19N-vaccinated participants were identical with those of diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants Interpretation : GX-19N is safe, tolerated and induces humoral and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response which may enable cross-reactivity to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older Covid-19 patients, we hypothesize, are therefore at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting of the terminal restriction fragments (SB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 Covid-19 and 21 non-Covid-19 patients, aged 87 ± 8 (mean ± SD) and 87 ± 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields two key metrics: the proportion of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %), and their mean, TeSLA mTL (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (10 (9)/L) was 0.91 ± 0.42 in Covid-19 patients and 1.50 ± 0.50 in non-Covid-19 patients (P < 0.001). In Covid-19 patients, but not in non-Covid-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to Covid-19 lymphopenia among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.","Benetos, Athanase; Lai, Tsung-Po; Toupance, Simon; Labat, Carlos; Verhulst, Simon; Gautier, Sylvie; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Perret-Guillaume, Christine; Levy, Daniel; Susser, Ezra; Aviv, Abraham",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,654,1

Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoV-infected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected. Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time reverse-transcription quantitative PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterized MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed. Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm. The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves. Three partial camel sequences characterized in this study (open reading frames 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from one farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula. Data provided further evidence of the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV infection and strongly suggested that camels may have a role in the transmission of the virus to humans.","Muhairi, Salama Al; Hosani, Farida Al; Eltahir, Yassir M.; Mulla, Mariam Al; Yusof, Mohammed F.; Serhan, Wissam S.; Hashem, Farouq M.; Elsayed, Elsaeid A.; Marzoug, Bahaaeldin A.; Abdelazim, Assem S.",Virus Genes,654,24

Methods PHOSP-COVID is a multi-centre, UK, observational study of adults discharged from hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 involving an assessment between two- and seven-months later including detailed symptom, physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function. Findings We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69% white ethnicity, 27% mechanical ventilation, and 50% had at least two co-morbidities. At follow-up only 29% felt fully recovered, 20% had a new disability, and 19% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, two or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17%), 2) Severe (21%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17%), 4) Mild (46%), with 3%, 7%, 36% and 43% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity. Interpretation We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and four different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health five months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide-access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services.

While it is known that COVID-19 is more severe in those cardiovascular disease, the predictors of mortality of CS with COVID-19 has yet to be explored in depth. Utilizing a large hospital research database, we explored the predictors of death in these patients. Methods Subjects with diagnosis codes “COVID-19” and “cardiogenic shock” or “acute dilated cardiomyopathy” were identified in an institutional registry of patients. 72 patients met the diagnostic criteria. Clinical variables studied included disease history, biomarkers, and imaging were included. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling were performed using STATA/ SE 15.1. Results Of the 72 patients diagnosed with CS with COVID-19, 29 died. History of heart failure (HF) was associated with a higher risk of death (OR 4.06, p=0.012) as was diuretic use (likely a proxy for HF (OR 2.71, p=0.05)). Age, sex, and other clinical variables (see table) were not associated with death. In a multivariable model including age and sex, prior HF diagnosis remained significantly associated with death (OR 4.27 p=0.015). Conclusion In CS with COVID-19, a history of cardiac disease and/or HF strongly predicted mortality. Other markers presumed to be associated with mortality such as age, sex and biomarkers were not significantly associated with death in this population. Given these findings, HF patients should be strongly encouraged to reduce their risk of exposure to infection.","Brooks, L. C.; Coglianese, E. E.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,654,24

RGB-based methods suffer from heavy self-occlusions and depth ambiguity. Depth sensors rely heavily on distance and can only be used indoors, thus there are many limitations to the practical application of depth-based methods. The aforementioned challenges have inspired us to combine the two modalities to offset the shortcomings of the other. In this paper, we propose a novel RGB and depth information fusion network to improve the accuracy of 3D hand pose estimation, which is called CrossFuNet. Specifically, the RGB image and the paired depth map are input into two different subnetworks, respectively. The feature maps are fused in the fusion module in which we propose a completely new approach to combine the information from the two modalities. Then, the common method is used to regress the 3D key-points by heatmaps. We validate our model on two public datasets and the results reveal that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","Sun, Xiaojing; Wang, Bin; Huang, Longxiang; Zhang, Qian; Zhu, Sulei; Ma, Yan",Sensors,654,18

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between hospitals' severity-weighted COVID-19 caseload and COVID-19 mortality risk and identify effect modifiers of this relationship. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04688372) SETTING: 558 U.S. hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. PARTICIPANTS: Adult COVID-19–coded inpatients admitted from March to August 2020 with discharge dispositions by October 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Each hospital-month was stratified by percentile rank on a surge index (a severity-weighted measure of COVID-19 caseload relative to pre–COVID-19 bed capacity). The effect of surge index on risk-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice was calculated using hierarchical modeling; interaction by surge attributes was assessed. RESULTS: Of 144 116 inpatients with COVID-19 at 558 U.S. hospitals, 78 144 (54.2%) were admitted to hospitals in the top surge index decile. Overall, 25 344 (17.6%) died; crude COVID-19 mortality decreased over time across all surge index strata. However, compared with nonsurging (<50th surge index percentile) hospital-months, aORs in the 50th to 75th, 75th to 90th, 90th to 95th, 95th to 99th, and greater than 99th percentiles were 1.11 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.23), 1.24 (CI, 1.12 to 1.38), 1.42 (CI, 1.27 to 1.60), 1.59 (CI, 1.41 to 1.80), and 2.00 (CI, 1.69 to 2.38), respectively. The surge index was associated with mortality across ward, intensive care unit, and intubated patients. The surge–mortality relationship was stronger in June to August than in March to May (slope difference, 0.10 [CI, 0.033 to 0.16]) despite greater corticosteroid use and more judicious intubation during later and higher-surging months. Nearly 1 in 4 COVID-19 deaths (5868 [CI, 3584 to 8171]; 23.2%) was potentially attributable to hospitals strained by surging caseload. LIMITATION: Residual confounding. CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in COVID-19 survival between March and August 2020, surges in hospital COVID-19 caseload remained detrimental to survival and potentially eroded benefits gained from emerging treatments. Bolstering preventive measures and supporting surging hospitals will save many lives.

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants emphasized the need to enlarge the repertoire of antibodies that target diverse epitopes, the combination of which may improve immune-diagnostics, augment the efficiency of the immunotherapy and prevent selection of escape-mutants. Antigen-specific controlled immunization of experimental animals may elicit antibody repertoires that significantly differ from those generated in the context of the immune response mounted in the course of disease. Accordingly, rabbits were immunized by several recombinant antigens representing distinct domains of the viral spike protein and monoclonal antibodies were isolated from single cells obtained by cell sorting. Characterization of a panel of successfully isolated anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies demonstrated that they exhibit high specificity and affinity profiles. Anti-RBD antibodies revealing significant neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro were found to target at least three distinct epitopes.

In this study, we selected two epitope peptide sequences within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV S protein. We used a complex consisting of the epitope peptide of the MERS-CoV S protein and CpG-DNA encapsulated in liposome complex to immunize mice, and produced the monoclonal antibodies 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2. The western blotting data showed that both monoclonal antibodies detected the S protein and immunoprecipitated the native form of the S protein. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal analysis suggested strong reactivity of the antibodies towards the S protein of MERS-CoV virus infected Vero cells. Furthermore, the 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced plaque formation in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells compared to normal mouse IgG and 492-1G10E4E2. Thus, we successfully produced a monoclonal antibody directed against the RBD domain of the S protein which could be used in the development of diagnostics and therapeutic applications in the future.","Park, Byoung Kwon; Maharjan, Sony; Lee, Su In; Kim, Jinsoo; Bae, Joon-Yong; Park, Man-Seong; Kwon, Hyung-Joo",BMB Rep,654,26

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the association of COVID-19 risk misperceptions with self-reported household isolation, a potential risk factor for social isolation and loneliness. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Franklin Templeton-Gallup Economics of Recovery Study (July to December 2020) of 24,649 US adults. We also analyzed data from the Gallup Panel (March 2020 to February 2021), which included 123,516 observations about loneliness. The primary outcome was self-reported household isolation, which we defined as a respondent having no contact or very little contact with people outside their household, analogous to quarantining. RESULTS: From July to December 2020, 53% to 57% of respondents reported living in household isolation. Most participants reported beliefs about COVID-19 health risks that were inaccurate, and overestimation of health risk was most common. For example, while deaths in persons younger than 55 years old accounted for 7% of total US deaths, respondents estimated that this population represented 43% of deaths. Overestimating COVID-19 health risks was associated with increased self-reported household isolation, with percentage differences ranging from 5.6 to 11.8 (P<.001 at each time point). Characteristics associated with self-reported household isolation from the July and August 2020 surveys and persisting in the December 2020 survey included younger age (18 to 39 years), having a serious medical condition, having a household member with a serious medical condition, and identifying as a Democrat. In the Gallup Panel, self-reported household isolation was associated with a higher prevalence of loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic-related harms to emotional and mental well-being may be attenuated by reducing risk overestimation and household isolation preferences that exceed public health guidelines.","Ladapo, Joseph A; Rothwell, Jonathan T; Ramirez, Christina M",JMIR Form Res,654,16

In this study, we compared the RT-PCR method with the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) methods. The results for the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies and the CLEIA antigen quantification values were highly correlated. The detection limit for antigen quantification was 42.8 RNA copies for saliva samples and 23.4 copies for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The number of RNA copies and RT-LAMP threshold time (Tt) values were inversely correlated for both purified RNA and purification-free crude RNA. RT-LAMP with purified RNA detected low copy numbers of RNA (5-50 copies) whereas fewer than 250 RNA copies could not be detected using crude RNA. CLEIA antigen quantification is potentially useful for large scale screening because it is compatible with high throughput testing. RT-LAMP with crude RNA samples is applicable to rapid point-of-care testing because it can directly use the patient specimen.

To estimate the immediate COVID-19 impact on BP, we have assessed PubMed-indexed articles about COVID-19 (PMIAC) from December 2019 to April 2020. PMIAC have been classified according to publication date, country, and journals for evaluation of time-, region- and scientometric-dependant impact of COVID-19 on BP and have been curated manually (i.e. each entry has been individually analyzed). PMIAC analysis reflects geographic and temporal parameters of outbreak spread. A major BP problem is related to the fact that only 40% of articles report/review/analyze data. Another BP weakness is the clusterization of ""highly-trusted"" publications according to countries of origin and ""highly impacting"" journals. Finally, a problem highlighted by COVID-19 crisis is the increased specification of biomedical research. To solve the problem, analytical reviews integrating data from different areas of biology and medicine are required. The data on PMIAC suggest priority of ""what is published"" over ""where it is published"" and ""who are the authors"".

This otherwise rare fungal infection has become an endemic among patients who have recovered from recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the different types of mucormycosis, rhino-orbital-cerebral involvement has mainly been observed in the recent surge of cases. Very few cases of mucormycosis of mandible have been reported in literature and none in COVID-19 patients. We report a case of isolated mandibular mucormycosis in a COVID- 19 patient, with no other predisposing comorbidities. Case report A 39 year old patient recently recovered from COVID-19 presented with typical symptoms of osteomyelitis which was confirmed using computed tomography of face. He underwent thorough debridement and curettage and tissue was sent for culture, special staining and biopsy. Result Diagnosis of mucormycosis was confirmed based on postoperative biopsy and special staining. He was further managed with complete course of appropriate antifungal therapy. Conclusion Mucormycosis is a fulminant and aggressive infection which requires prompt diagnosis and intervention. Early referral to a maxillofacial surgeon by physicians and general dental practitioners on seeing signs and symptoms of secondary fungal infections involving maxilla or mandible in patients with history of SARS-CoV-19 infection can improve prognosis.","Ambereen, Aafiya; Rahman, Sajjad A.; Rehman, Suhailur; Zaidi, Kamran; Arif, S.

Loneliness affects social, physical, and mental health, and it is associated with multimorbidity and premature mortality. In addition to social interventions, a range of digital technology interventions (DTIs) are being used to tackle loneliness. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness, especially in adults. The effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness needs to be systematically assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness in older adults. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science for empirical studies published in English from January 1, 2010, to July 31, 2019. The study selection criteria included interventional studies that used any type of DTIs to reduce loneliness in adults (aged ≥18 years) with a minimum intervention duration of 3 months and follow-up measurements at least 3 months after the intervention. Two researchers independently screened articles and extracted data using the PICO (participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome) framework. The primary outcome measure was loneliness. Loneliness scores in both the intervention and control groups at baseline and at follow-up at 3, 4, 6, and 12 months after the intervention were extracted. Data were analyzed via narrative synthesis and meta-analysis using RevMan (The Cochrane Collaboration) software. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were selected from 4939 screened articles. These studies included 1 before and after study and 5 clinical trials (4 randomized clinical trials and 1 quasi-experimental study). All of these studies enrolled a total of 646 participants (men: n=154, 23.8%; women: n=427, 66.1%; no gender information: n=65, 10.1%) with an average age of 73-78 years (SD 6-11). Five clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis, and by using the random effects model, standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for each trial and pooled across studies at the 3-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups. The overall effect estimates showed no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of DTIs compared with that of usual care or non-DTIs at follow-up at 3 months (SMD 0.02; 95% CI −0.36 to 0.40; P=.92), 4 months (SMD −1.11; 95% CI −2.60 to 0.38; P=.14), and 6 months (SMD −0.11; 95% CI −0.54 to 0.32; P=.61). The quality of evidence was very low to moderate in these trials. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis shows no evidence supporting the effectiveness of DTIs in reducing loneliness in older adults. Future research may consider randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer durations for both the interventions and follow-ups.

The objective of the study was to understand the psychological impact of the coronavirus lockdown measure on athletes who were not able to carry out their normal daily routine. Athletes from nine different sports completed an online survey during the sixth week of the total lockdown in Nigeria. The online survey consists of an athletic identity scale and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data collected were analyzed using Multiple regression and the Mann-Whitney test at 0.05 level of significance. The result of the findings revealed that category of sports (individual and team) (M = 0.73, β = −6.116) and athletic identity (M = 59.16, β = −0.166) predicts psychological distress to some degree. Few individual sports athletes and athletes with low athletic identity are prone to higher levels of psychological distress than team sports athletes and athletes with high athletic identity during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. Individual sports athletes reported elevated levels of psychological distress compared to team sports athletes (z = −2.186, p = 0.03, r = 0.27). In conclusion, the results have confirmed that some athletes competing in individual sports experience elevated levels of psychological distress during the coronavirus pandemic, therefore they need the support of a sports psychologist during such periods to help in maintaining their psychological well-being.","Uroh, Clifford C.; Adewunmi, Celina M.",Front Sports Act Living,654,8

Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools. Recently devised CRISPR-technologies represent the unprecedented opportunity to reshape epidemiological surveillance and molecular diagnostics.","Kostyusheva, Anastasiya; Brezgin, Sergey; Babin, Yurii; Vasilyeva, Irina; Glebe, Dieter; Kostyushev, Dmitry; Chulanov, Vladimir",Methods,654,30

Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure among Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. METHODS: Between April 21 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as follows: <1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and ≥3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, the Perceived Stress Scale-10, and the Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. RESULTS: Of the 4322 eligible participants, 4004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1481 (37.0%), 1644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for less than 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or 3 or more hours per day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.03-1.76; P=.03), anxiety (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.43-2.46; P<.001), and insomnia (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.17-1.97; P=.001) than people exposed to information for less than 1 hour per day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1 to 2 hours per day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08-1.69; P=.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure of 3 or more hours per day and the severity of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19-related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for 3 or more hours per day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on household food security in Jordan, determined the percentage of food security and the levels of food insecurity during the quarantine, determined the associated factor with food insecurity, and determined main food groups associated with FINS during the quarantine. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a Web-based validated questionnaire. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale was used to measure the food insecurity during the first four weeks of the quarantine, and a modified food consumption score was used to determine the number of times the household consumes each food group. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to describe, explore, and predict risk factors correlated with food insecurity among Jordanians, during the first four weeks of the quarantine. RESULTS: A total of 3129 Jordanians had responded to the assessment and fully answered the questionnaire. 23.1% of the total participants were severe food insecure, while 36.1% were moderate food insecure, 40.7% were food secure. The regression model demonstrated the monthly income per capita below the poverty line and a number of the family member (1–4 and 5–7) associated significantly with moderate food insecurity (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 4.44–6.40, OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47–0.86, OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58–0.98, respectively).

That is, the introduction of infection to a supercritical system results in a significant fraction of the population becoming infected only with a certain probability. Understanding the waiting time to the first major outbreak of an emerging disease is then more complicated than determining when the system becomes supercritical. We treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical. Specifically, we consider an SIR model with a time-varying transmission term and random infections originating from outside the population. We derive an analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in agreement with stochastic simulations. We find the key parameters to be the rate of introduction of infection and the rate of change of the basic reproductive ratio.

Demographic characteristics, previous comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findings on admission were collected. Comorbidities were assessed by Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Results: Hypoalbuminemia on admission (<34 g/L) was more frequent in nonsurvivors than survivors (65.6% vs. 38%, p<0.001) and was significantly associated with the development of sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome, acute heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury, regardless of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Hypoalbuminemia was a predictor of mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis (HR 1.537, 95% CI 1.050-2.250, p=0.027), independently of Charlson-Age Index, gender, lymphocyte count <800/µL, creatinine, high-sensitivity C- reactive protein >8 mg/L, lactate dehydrogenase >250 U/L, bilateral infiltration on chest X-ray and q-SOFA ≥2. Conclusions: Hypoalbuminemia was an early predictor of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19, regardless of age, comorbidity and inflammatory markers. It also had significant association with severe adverse events, independently of Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index. Our results suggest that serum albumin determination on admission may help to identify patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at high risk of developing potential life-threatening conditions and death.","Viana-Llamas, María C.; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Alberto Silva-Obregón, J.; Uribe-Heredia, Giovanna; Núñez-Gil, Iván; García-Magallón, Belén; Torán-Martínez, Claudio G.; Castillo-Sandoval, Alicia; Díaz-Caraballo, Eva; Rodríguez-Guinea, Itsaso; Domínguez-López, Jesús",Med Clin (Barc),654,16

Amantadine, rimantadine, bananins and the structurally related memantine are effective against human respiratory coronavirus HCoV-OC43, bovine coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and a spiroadamantane amine is effective against the coronavirus strain 229E. Molecular docking studies suggest that amantadine may block the viral E protein channel, leading to impaired viral propagation. Additionally, amantadine analogues may inhibit entry of the virus into the host cell by increasing the pH of the endosomes and thus inhibiting the action of host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L. High-throughput drug screen gene expression analysis identified compounds able to down-regulate Cathepsin L expression where the fifth most potent agent of 466 candidates was amantadine. Amantadine inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro but does not inhibit the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Adamantanes also may act against coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via antagonism of glutamate (NMDA) and the α-7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor located on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. As an NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine has the potential to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into these cell populations. Amantadine and memantine are widely employed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and a pathophysiologic link between the antiviral and anti-Parkinson actions of amantadine has been entertained. Case reports involving 23 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a range of co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and severe cognitive impairment reveal significant potential benefits of amantadine and memantine for the prevention and/or treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 and its neurological complications.","Butterworth, Roger F.",Drugs R D,654,16

Epidemiological data and observational reports from both the original SARS epidemic and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic have a common feature: males are more likely to exhibit enhanced disease severity and mortality than females. Sex differences in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 share mechanistic foundations, namely, the involvement of both the innate immune system and the canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Immunological differences suggest that females mount a rapid and aggressive innate immune response, and the attenuated antiviral response in males may confer enhanced susceptibility to severe disease. Furthermore, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is involved in disease pathogenesis in cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, either to serve as a protective mechanism by deactivating the RAS or as the receptor for viral entry, respectively. Loss of membrane ACE2 and a corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 are associated with worsened cardiovascular disease outcomes, a mechanism attributed to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM17). SARS-CoV-2 infection also leads to ADAM17 activation, a positive feedback cycle that exacerbates ACE2 loss. Therefore, the relationship between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is critically dependent on the loss of membrane ACE2 by ADAM17-mediated proteolytic cleavage. This article explores potential mechanisms involved in COVID-19 that may contribute to sex-specific susceptibility focusing on the innate immune system and the RAS, namely, genetics and sex hormones. Finally, we highlight here the added challenges of gender in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Viveiros, Anissa; Rasmuson, Jaslyn; Vu, Jennie; Mulvagh, Sharon L.; Yip, Cindy Y.

Conditions uniquely found in the Adaptive Immune System (AIS) and Mirror Neuron System (MNS), termed the genomic immuno-cognitive system, coincide with three building blocks in computation theory of Gödel, Turing and Post (G-T-P). (i) Biotic elements have unique digital identifiers with gene codes executing 3D self-assembly for morphology and regulation of the organism using the recursive operation of Self-Ref (Self-Reference) with the other being a self-referential projection of self. (ii) A parallel offline simulation meta/mirror environment in 1–1 relation to online machine executions of self-codes gives G-T-P Self-Rep (Self-Representation). (iii) This permits a digital biotic entity to self-report that it is under attack by a biotic malware or non-self antigen in the format of the Gödel sentence, resulting in the “smarts” for contextual novelty production. The proposed unitary G-T-P recursive machinery in AIS and in MNS for social cognition yields a new explanation that the Interferon Gamma factor, known for friend-foe identification in AIS, is also integral to social behaviors. New G-T-P bio-informatics of AIS and novel anti-body production is given with interesting testable implications for COVID-19 pathology.","Markose, Sheri M.",Entropy (Basel),654,29

Our department has formally introduced a DIEP Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Pathway in May 2019. Although in a much smaller sample size, our results were similar to this article and we would agree with the authors’ conclusion that implementation of such protocol could effectively reduce the length of inpatient stay (LoS) and cost of care, without compromising patient care nor increasing complication rates. Prior to the introduction of ERAS Pathway, 28 of our patients who had DIEP between November 2018 and May 2019 had an mean LoS of 7.1 days (median 6 days, range 5-21 days); whereas 27 patients who experienced the ERAS Pathway between May and December 2019 had an mean LoS of 4.8 days (median 5 days, range 3-7 days). The cost of inpatient stay in a normal ward at our hospital is approximately £232 per patient per day. By reducing an extra 2.3 days of inpatient stay, our Trust could save at least an average of £32,016 per annum with the estimated 60 DIEP performed annually at our department. We would like to emphasise the benefits and effectiveness of this multimodal, patient-centre and evidence-based ERAS.

But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. METHOD: A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. RESULTS: A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Drissi, Nidal; Ouhbi, Sofia; Janati Idrissi, Mohammed Abdou; Ghogho, Mounir",Int J Med Inform,654,1

METHODS: Four thousands and forty-eight healthy adults aged ≥18 years were randomized (1:1) to receive one dose of either the adjuvanted split virion (3.75 μg hemagglutinin antigen [HA]/AS03) or non-adjuvanted (15 μg HA) vaccine. Hemagglutination inhibition [HI] antibody response was evaluated before vaccination and at Days 21, 42 and 182 (Month 6). Safety of the study vaccines was evaluated during the entire study duration. RESULTS: At Day 21, both study vaccines induced HI immune responses meeting the US regulatory criteria in subjects 18–64 years (seroprotection rate [SPR]: 98.0% [97.1–98.6]; seroconversion rate [SCR]: 89.7% [88.0–91.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 91.4% [89.9–92.8]; SCR: 74.6% [72.3–76.9] in the non-adjuvanted group) and >64 years of age (SPR: 86.0% [82.5–89.0]; SCR: 75.3% [71.1–79.2] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 69.1% [64.6–73.3]; SCR: 56.7% [52.0–61.3] in the non-adjuvanted group). The AS03-adjuvanted vaccine induced higher HI geometric mean titers than the non-adjuvanted vaccine at all time points. At Month 6, only subjects 18–64 years of age from both vaccine groups still met the US regulatory criteria (SPR: 82.1% [80.0–84.1]; SCR: 62.3% [59.6–64.8] in the AS03-adjuvanted group; SPR: 75.3% [72.9–77.5]; SCR: 53.7% [51.0–56.4] in the non-adjuvanted group). Protective efficacy was not evaluated due to low number of RT-qPCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza cases. Through Month 12, 216 serious adverse events (in 157 subjects: 84 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 73 in the non-adjuvanted group) and 12 potentially immune mediated diseases (5 in the AS03-adjuvanted and 7 in the non-adjuvanted group) were reported. CONCLUSION: A single dose of either adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine induced protective HI antibody levels against the A/California/7/2009 strain that persisted through Month 6 in the 18–64 years population.","Yang, William H.; Dionne, Marc; Kyle, Michael; Aggarwal, Naresh; Li, Ping; Madariaga, Miguel; Godeaux, Olivier; Vaughn, David W.",Vaccine,654,24

In order to follow biosafety recommendations, we used Ultrasound‐Guided Minimally Invasive Autopsy (MIA‐US) to assess the systemic involvement of COVID‐19 and present the results of ten initial autopsies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used MIA‐US for tissue sampling of lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, spleen, brain, skin, skeletal muscle and testis for histology and RT‐PCR to detect SARS‐COV‐2‐RNA. All patients presented exudative/proliferative Diffuse Alveolar Damage. There were intense pleomorphic cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, including airway and alveolar cells. Fibrinous thrombi in alveolar arterioles were present in eight patients and all patients presented a high density of alveolar megakaryocytes. Small thrombi were less frequently observed in glomeruli, spleen, heart, dermis, testis, and liver sinusoids. The main systemic findings were associated with comorbidities, age, and sepsis, in addition to possible tissue damage due to the viral infection such as myositis, dermatitis, myocarditis and orchitis. CONCLUSIONS: MIA‐US is safe and effective for the study of severe COVID‐19. Our findings show that COVID‐19 is a systemic disease with major events in the lungs and involvement of various organs and tissues. Pulmonary changes are the result of severe epithelial injury and microthrombotic vascular phenomena.

Mice intranasally inoculated with membrane glycoprotein substantially increased the interleukin (IL)-6, a hallmark of the cytokine storm, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), compared to mice inoculated with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The high level of IL-6 induced by membrane glycoprotein was significantly diminished in phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4B) knockout mice, demonstrating the essential role of PDE4B in IL-6 signaling. Mycelium fermentation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) EH8 strain yielded butyric acid, which can down-regulate the PDE4B expression and IL-6 secretion in macrophages. Feeding mice with mycelia increased the relative abundance of commensal L. rhamnosus. Two-week supplementation of mice with L. rhamnosus plus mycelia considerably decreased membrane glycoprotein-induced PDE4B expression and IL-6 secretion. The probiotic activity of L. rhamnosus plus mycelia against membrane glycoprotein was abolished in mice treated with GLPG-0974, an antagonist of free fatty acid receptor 2 (Ffar2). Activation of Ffar2 in the gut-lung axis for down-regulation of the PDE4B-IL-6 signalling may provide targets for development of modalities including probiotics for treatment of the cytokine storm in COVID-19.","Pham, Minh Tan; Yang, Albert Jackson; Kao, Ming-Shan; Gankhuyag, Uuganbayar; Zayabaatar, Enkhbat; Jin, Shiow-Lian Catherine; Huang, Chun-Ming",J Nutr Biochem,654,24

Apelin induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in failing hearts, thereby improving heart function in an angiotensin 1–7-dependent manner. Whether apelin antagonizes the over-activation of the renin–angiotensin system in the heart remains elusive. In this study we show that the detrimental effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) were exacerbated in the hearts of aged apelin-gene-deficient mice. Ang II-mediated cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy were augmented in apelin knockout mice. The loss of apelin increased the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to ACE2 expression in the Ang II-stressed hearts, and Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis was markedly enhanced in apelin knockout mice. mRNA expression of pro-fibrotic genes, such as transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, were significantly upregulated in apelin knockout hearts. Consistently, treatment with the ACE-inhibitor Captopril decreased cardiac contractility in apelin knockout mice. In vitro, apelin ameliorated Ang II-induced TGF-β expression in primary cardiomyocytes, accompanied with reduced hypertrophy. These results provide direct evidence that endogenous apelin plays a crucial role in suppressing Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling.","Sato, Teruki; Kadowaki, Ayumi; Suzuki, Takashi; Ito, Hiroshi; Watanabe, Hiroyuki; Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji",Int J Mol Sci,654,26

Isolate LDL/150434–I was a re-isolation of H120 vaccine strain that was introduced into the chicken flock by vaccination, transmitted between chickens, and later accumulated several genomic mutations. Isolate LDL/150434–II was a novel variant that originated from recombination events between H120 and ck/CH/LDT3/03-like viruses. The widespread use of H120 vaccine, which offered incomplete protection against heterotypic IBVs in the fields, may play important roles in the emergence of such a novel genetic variant. Based on the analysis of S1 and complete genomic sequence, isolate LDL/150434–III was related genetically but distinct from the established strains of nrTW I type viruses of GI-7 lineage circulating in Mainland China since 2009. The three IBV isolates were avirulent when they infected SPF chickens. Furthermore, synergistic effects on pathogenicity were not observed when the different types co-infected the SPF chickens.

In hybrid cells of somatic cells and pluripotential stem cells, including embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ cells, somatic nuclei acquire pluripotential competence. ES and embryonic germ cells retain intrinsic trans activity to induce epigenetic reprogramming. For generating hybrid cells, we have used the technique of electrofusion. Electrofusion is a highly effective, reproducible, and biomedically safe in vitro system. For successful cell fusion, two sequential steps of electric pulse stimulation are required for the alignment (pearl chain formation) of two different types of cells between electrodes in response to alternating current stimulation and for the fusion of cytoplasmic membranes by direct current stimulation. Optimal conditions for electrofusion with a pulse generator are introduced for ES and somatic cell fusion. Topics in the field of stem cell research include the successful production of cloned animals via the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells and contribution of spontaneous cell fusion to generating intrinsic plasticity of tissue stem cells.

Among age groups, COVID-19 seroprevalence was found to be in order of 30-41 years (33.33%) > 42-53 years (32.42%) > 54-65 years (30%) > 66 years and above (25%) > 6-17 years (19.20%) > 18-29 years (17.65%) > 5 years and below (6.66%). A seroprevalence of 27.18% was recorded for males and 23.17% for females in the state. COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection are almost the same for both urban and rural dwellers in the state. However, health care workers and those that have had contact with person (s) that travelled out of Nigeria in the last six (6) months are twice ( 2 times) at risk of being infected with the virus. More than half (54.59%) of the participants in this study did not practice social distancing at any time since the pandemic started. Discussions about knowledge, practice and attitude of the participants are included. The observed Niger State COVID-19 seroprevalence means that the herd immunity for COVID-19 is yet to be achieved and the population is still susceptible for more infection and transmission of the virus. If the prevalence stays as reported here, the population will definitely need COVID-19 vaccines when they become available. Niger State should fully enforce the use of face/nose masks and observation of social/physical distancing in gatherings including religious gatherings in order to stop or slow the spread of the virus.","Majiya, H.; Aliyu-Paiko, M.; Balogu, V.

Previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. However, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. METHODS: MDBK was used as a model to study the precise signaling pathways of apoptosis induced by BHV-1 infection. RESULTS: BHV-1 infection activated a Fas/FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, BHV-1 infection down-regulated Bcl-2 and up-regulated Bax expression, thereby initiating the release of cytochrome c followed by caspase-9 activation. The combined activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways resulted in activation of downstream effecter caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking apoptosis using caspase inhibitors improved BHV-1-infected MDBK cell viability to different extent. BHV-1 infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in MDBK cells pretreated with ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) or cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. Blocking caspases activation increased BHV-1 replication. CONCLUSIONS: BHV-1 induces apoptosis in MDBK cells through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and there might be cross-talk between the two pathways. In addition, BHV-1 replication may be necessary for the induction of apoptosis in BHV-1-infected cells, and prolonged cell viability benefits BHV-1 replication.","Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Kuan; Huang, Yong; Ding, Li; Chen, Guangda; Zhang, Honglei; Tong, Dewen",Virol J,654,5

Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. METHODS: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9–12 of a national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. RESULTS: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. CONCLUSION: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.","Williams, Lynn; Rollins, Lesley; Young, David; Fleming, Leanne; Grealy, Madeleine; Janssen, Xanne; Kirk, Alison; MacDonald, Bradley; Flowers, Paul",PLoS One,654,27

METHODS: Using Poisson regression and regularized linear regression (elastic net), we evaluated the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Chicago through July 22 (2514 deaths across 795 populated census tracts). RESULTS: Black residents (31% of the population) accounted for 42% of COVID-19 deaths. Deaths among Hispanic/Latino residents occurred at a younger age (63 years, compared to 71 for white residents). Regarding residential setting, 52% of deaths among white residents occurred inside nursing homes, compared to 35% of deaths among Black residents and 17% among Hispanic/Latino residents. Higher COVID-19 mortality was seen in neighborhoods with heightened barriers to social distancing and low health insurance coverage. Neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white and Asian residents had lower COVID-19 mortality. The associations differed by race, suggesting that neighborhood context may be most tightly linked to COVID-19 mortality among white residents. CONCLUSIONS: We describe communities that may benefit from supportive services, and identify traits of communities that may benefit from targeted campaigns for prevention and testing to prevent future deaths from COVID-19.","Bryan, Molly Scannell; Sun, Jiehuan; Jagai, Jyotsna; Horton, Daniel E.; Montgomery, Anastasia; Sargis, Robert; Argos, Maria",Ann Epidemiol,654,3

A pre-post design to measure the impact on symptom management, caregiver burden and satisfaction with care delivery, and service utilization was used. Two cohorts of eligible patients and caregivers completed Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scales, Caregiver Reaction Assessment and FAMCARE Scales and chart audits were conducted. Administrative data from each participating site were examined for utilization trends. Audits of 53 charts preimplementation and 63 postimplementation showed an increase in documentation of pain from 24.5% to 74.6% (P < 0.001) of charts. Administrative data showed a decrease in the percentage of patients with at least one emergency room visit from 94.3% to 84.8% (P < 0.001), in the percentage of patients with at least one admission to the acute care hospital (P < 0.001), and deaths in acute care 43.1%–35.7% (P = 0.133). There was minimal change in the intensity of symptoms (P = 0.591), and no change in the burden on the caregiver (P = 0.086) or caregiver satisfaction with care (P = 0.942).

Attention to IFN-λ is mainly focused on direct antiviral activity in which, as with IFN-α, viral genome replication is inhibited without the participation of immune system cells. The heterodimeric receptor for lambda interferons is exposed mainly on epithelial cells, which limits its possible action on other cells, thus reducing the likelihood of developing undesirable side effects compared to type I IFN. In this study, we examined the antiviral potential of exogenous human IFN-λ1 in cellular models of viral infection. To study the protective effects of IFN-λ1, three administration schemes were used: ‘preventive’ (pretreatment); ‘preventive/therapeutic’ (pre/post); and ‘therapeutic’ (post). Three IFN-λ1 concentrations (from 10 to 500 ng/mL) were used. We have shown that human IFN-λ1 restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells with all three treatment schemes. In addition, we have shown a decrease in the viral loads of CHIKV and IVA with the ‘preventive’ and ‘preventive/therapeutic’ regimes. No significant antiviral effect of IFN-λ1 against AdV was detected.

METHOD: Self-reported lonely individuals with AARP Medicare Supplement plans insured by UnitedHealthcare who participated in a program with a robotic pet (n = 20) were recruited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to provide feedback about their experiences interacting with a robotic pet, their perceptions about the potential impact on loneliness, and recommendations for improving the program. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Participants’ responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Constant comparison and consensus-gaining processes were used to develop categories that later formed representative themes. RESULTS: Seven themes emerged from analysis: Openness to Adoption of Robotic Pet, Reactions to Pet and its Attributes, Integration of Pet in Daily Life, Strategic Utilization and Forging New Connections, Deriving Comfort and Camaraderie, Advice for Future Users, and Recommendations for Enhancing Ownership Experience. Participants living alone, with fewer social connections and less active lifestyles, derived the most benefit from interacting with their pets. Common responses to pets included cuddling, petting, grooming, and sleeping with them. Some shared or loaned their pets, while others refused to loan their pets to interested peers. Most reported showing their pets to others, which helped some facilitate communication and social connections. CONCLUSION: Robotic pets may be an effective solution for alleviating loneliness in older adults, especially among those who live alone, have fewer social connections, and live less active lifestyles.","Hudson, Janella; Ungar, Rachel; Albright, Laurie; Tkatch, Rifky; Schaeffer, James; Wicker, Ellen R",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,654,33

ONG is most commonly seen in the pediatric population, in association with neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. However, sporadic adult cases may also occur and may clinically behave more aggressively, despite benign histopathology. Genetic characterization of these tumors, particularly in the adult population, is lacking. A 39-year-old female presented with 1 month of progressive left-sided visual loss secondary to a enhancing mass along the left optic nerve sheath. Initial empiric management with focal radiotherapy failed to prevent tumor progression, prompting open biopsy which revealed a WHO I pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve. Whole-exome sequencing of the biopsy specimen revealed somatic mutations in NF1,FGFR1 and PTPN11 that may provide actionable targets for molecularly guided therapies. Genetic characterization of ONG is lacking but is needed to guide the management of these rare but complex tumors. The genomic alterations reported in this case contributes to understanding the pathophysiology of adult sporadic ONG and may help guide future clinical prognostication and development of targeted therapies.","Hong, Christopher S.; Fliney, Greg; Fisayo, Adeniyi; An, Yi; Gopal, Pallavi P.; Omuro, Antonio; Pointdujour-Lim, Renelle; Erson-Omay, E.

In COVID-19 patients delirium is associated with higher mortality rate, increased length of stay and a greater rate of admission in Intensive Care Unit and ventilator utilisation. We hypothesized a greater rate of delirium in Helmet CPAP COVID-19 ventilated patients because many known risk factors for delirium co-exist in these kind of patients (i.e. isolation, noise, dehydration). The first aim of our study is to investigate the incidence of delirium occurring during Helmet CPAP therapy in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we wanted to verify if there are predictable risk factors for delirium and to determine if delirium increases the risk of adverse outcomes (need of endotracheal intubation and death). The cohort of CPAP ventilated COVID-19 patients were composed by 194 patients. Of them, 57 patients (29.3%) developed delirium during CPAP, more than two third in the first 48h. Age over 70 years, previous diagnosis of dementia or psychiatric condition, P/F < 150 after starting CPAP and Gr/Lys >8 resulted risk factors for delirium. Delirium group had a significantly higher mortality rate (47% vs 23%) and lower intubation rate (12% vs 26%) compared to non-delirious ones. Despite many potential predisposing factors are common in CPAP ventilated patients, delirium incidence in our population seems not to differ from what reported by other studies. Moreover, the occurrence of delirium seems not to be related to prolonged CPAP treatment, indeed no correlation between time spent in CPAP and delirium onset was found.","Samartin, F.; Salvi, E.; Brambilla, A.

Various distance functions for PFSs are introduced in the literature and have their own pros and cons. The common thread of incompetency for these existing distance functions is their inability to distinguish highly uncertain PFSs distinctly. To tackle this point, we introduce a novel distance measure for PFSs. An added advantage of the measure is its simple mathematical form. Moreover, superiority and reasonability of the prescribed definition are demonstrated through proper numerical examples. Boundedness and nonlinear behaviour of the distance measure is established and verified via suitable illustrations. In the current scenario, selecting an antivirus face-mask as a preventive measure in the COVID-19 pandemic and choosing the best school in private sector for children are some of the burning issues of a modern society.

This study investigated how the Italian lockdown affected self-perceived food purchases (FP), occurrence of impulse buying (IB), household food waste production (HFWP) and their determinants. A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed in May 2020, collecting an opportunistic sample of the Italian population. A total of 1865 (70% females) people were enrolled, the median age was 29 (IQR 16.0).

Baking ingredients, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit and chocolate had the largest sales increase by individuals, while bakery products, fresh fish and salted snacks purchases highly decreased. Increased FP was associated with the occurrence of IB (adjOR 2.48, p < 0.001) and inversely associated with not having worked during lockdown (adjOR 0.71, p = 0.003). Multivariable logistic regressions revealed occurrence of IB was associated with low perceived dietary quality (adjOR 2.22, p < 0.001), resulting at risk, according to the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ, adjOR 1.68, p < 0.001), and inversely associated with decreased HFWP (adjOR 0.73, p < 0.012).

This interest has also resulted in competition for funding and turf wars between animal health and public health scientists and public officials and, in some cases, has delayed and hindered progress toward effective prevention, control and biodefense. There is a dynamic list of outbreaks causing substantial morbidity and mortality in humans and often in the reservoir animal species. Some agents have the potential to grow into major epidemics. There are many determinants that influence the emergence of diseases of concern that require the use of current understanding of the nature of agent persistence and spread. Additional factors that are global must be added to plans for prevention and control. To this complex mix has been added the potential for accidental or malicious release of agents. The nature of emerging infectious agents and their impact is largely unpredictable. Models that strive to predict the dynamics of agents may be useful but can also blind us to increasing disease risks if it does not match a specific model. Field investigations of early events will be critical and should drive prevention and control actions. Many disease agents have developed strategies to overcome extremes of reservoir qualities like population size and density. Every infectious agent spreads easier when its hosts are closer together. Zoonoses must be dealt with at the interface of human and animal health by all available information. Lessons learned from the emergence of and response to agents like West Nile virus, H5N1 avian influenza, SARS and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the cause of new-variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease in humans, must be used to create better plans for response and meet the challenge for public health and biodefense.","Murphy, Frederick A.",Prev Vet Med,654,1

While it is being recommended to carry out only the emergent procedures and to postpone the non-urgent ones to a later date, this article is meant to provide an insight into triage of the ENT procedures and the various precautions to be taken into account by the ENT surgeons while carrying out a procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The ENT Cochrane, Pubmed and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using the terms ‘COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 in conjunction with ENT surgery. RESULTS: Elective and non urgent cases are best avoided during this time. Only absolutely essential and emergent procedures need to be carried out with the use of Personal protective equipment comprising of safety gown, N95 mask, safety goggles, disposable gloves and caps. There is a possibility of transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 through asymptomatic patients and hence all patients, even with an unknown COVID-19 status, need to undergo a preoperative screening. As all procedures under general anesthesia are aerosol generating, the use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended for all the health care workers present in the operation theater. CONCLUSION: A proper knowledge of triage would be of immense help to the ENT surgeon in minimizing the exposure to health care workers and patients during this pandemic. All patients with an unknown COVID-19 status should be considered suspects and essential precautions for their management be taken accordingly.","Sharma, Akriti; Bhardwaj, Rohit",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,654,21

We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23–0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94–3.12; p = 0.081). Patients in this cohort also had higher median serum levels of interleukin-6 compared with IS-AD patients (98.2 vs 21.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0328) and NIS-NAD patients (29.1 pg/mL; p = 0.0057). In conclusion, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those receiving immunosuppressive treatment for an AD may have a reduced risk of developing severe ARDS.

The study included 6720 parents recruited through schools, patient organizations and social media platforms (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the UK (n = 508), Sweden (n = 1436), Spain (n = 1491), Belgium (n = 508), the Netherlands (n = 324), Germany (n = 1662) and Italy (n = 794). Many parents reported negative effects of homeschooling for themselves and their child, and many found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools. In most countries, contact with teachers was limited, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing homeschooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some negative experiences were more common in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, differences between countries and between families with and without a mental health condition were generally small, indicating that many parents across countries reported negative experiences. Some parents also reported positive experiences of homeschooling. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures may be less effective than other interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during additional waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Thorell, Lisa B.; Skoglund, Charlotte; de la Peña, Almudena Giménez; Baeyens, Dieter; Fuermaier, Anselm B.

The aim of the present study is to investigate psychological effect of working directly with patients infected with COVID-19 (WD) and possible individual vulnerability factors for the development of psychological problems in HCWs. The data used in this cross-sectional study were collected using online self-reported questionnaires from 290 HCWs aged 21-61 years old. The mean score of the scales of 145 HCWs-WD and 145 HCWs not WD (HCWs-NWD) were compared by independent sample t test. Associations between childhood traumas, metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs and internalizing symptoms were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The depression, anxiety, stress symptoms levels, somatization and sleep problem levels were found to be higher in HCWs-WD compared to HCWs-NWD. SEM revealed that childhood trauma levels was associated with the increased risk of internalizing problems, and metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs had a partial mediator role between childhood traumas and internalizing symptoms in HCWs-WD. Improving metacognitive abilities may hence need to be considered in prevention programs for the HCWs. The findings can also be used to set up further research on the specific interventions on the HCWs who are at a risk as their profession entails them being in such traumatic situations.","Sen Demirdogen, Ezgi; Algedik, Pinar; Warikoo, Nishchint; Bahadır, Erdi; Akbiyik, Meral; Büyüktarakçı, Seda; Kadak, Muhammed Tayyip; Yavuz, Mesut","Psychology, health & medicine",654,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood diagnosed by pediatric neurology and pediatric intensive care at Sami Ulus Maternity, Child Health and Diseases Training and Research Hospital between 2007 and 2020 were included in this study. RESULTS: Nine patients (six females, three males) with a mean age of 4.05 ± 1.94 years (age range 1–6.5) were included in this study. The interval range between fever and encephalopathy in patients was 1–4 days. Influenza A (3H1N1, one untyped) was detected in four patients, influenza B in three patients, and no cause was found in two patients. Major clinical findings other than febrile encephalopathy in all patients were a hemodynamic shock in seven patients, seizures in six patients, vomiting in five patients, dystonia in three patients, and flaccid paralysis in the upper extremity in one patient. Despite all our treatment approaches, including plasmapheresis, moderate to severe neurological sequelae was observed in all of our patients, who survived even with significant radiological improvement. Three patients for whom we could not perform plasmapheresis died. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that thalamic involvement increased as the interval shortened, and brainstem involvement increased in patients over four years of age. The presence of persistent vomiting accompanying encephalopathy during the parainfectious period and plasmapheresis treatment being a treatment option that could prevent mortality were cautionary for our study.","AKSOY, Erhan; ÖZTOPRAK, Ülkü; ÇELİK, Halil; ÖZDEMİR, Fatih Mehmet Akif; ÖZKAN, Mehpare; KAYALIOĞLU, Hülya; DANIŞ, Ayşegül; KUCUR, Özge; KESİCİ, Selman; YAZICI, Mutlu Uysal; AZAPAĞASI, Ebru; TAŞCI YILDIZ, Yasemin; CEYLAN, Nesrin; ŞENEL, Saliha; YÜKSEL, Deniz",Turk J Med Sci,654,16

Before COVID, much of the emphasis in transport policy was on demand management, ‘smart’ technological interventions and sustainable mobility. The public health crisis has necessitated an urgent reconsideration of transport and its contribution to post-COVID economic recovery. In recognition of the importance of individual behaviour and collective responsibility in protecting both personal and public health during the crisis, this think piece proposes a new concept of Responsible Transport to help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID. The novelty of this proposal lies in the fact that it incorporates not only environmental considerations with respect to sustainability but also encompasses considerations of individual and community health and wellbeing. Moreover, it stresses the role of the individual as a responsible autonomous actor in delivering socially desired transport outcomes.","Budd, Lucy; Ison, Stephen",Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,654,23

Research has also shown that LREs tend to affect technology acceptance which in turn affects learning outcomes as well. Today though, the negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the sudden transmission to obligatory remote education might yield different functions of emotions and acceptance on learning outcomes. In this context, the current study seeks to model the relations between students’ negative emotions, acceptance of (emergency) remote education, and self-perceived knowledge improvement. The suggested model was examined and validated on 116 university students that attended fully remote courses in Greece during the COVID-19 crisis. The results suggested that negative emotions of boredom and cognitive load are significant predictors of students’ acceptance of remote learning components: i) online attending a lecture, ii) online communicating with professor, and iii) online collaborating with peers. Anxiety directly affected perceived knowledge improvement, boredom, and cognitive load; Boredom was also affected by cognitive load. In addition, acceptance of remote learning components indirectly affected perceived knowledge improvement mediated by learnability. Boredom was the strongest predictor of online attending a lecture and online collaborating with peers, while online communication with professor was the strongest predictor of learnability.

Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18–55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5–30·0 kg/m(2) and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 × 10(7) plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1 × 10(8) PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous prime–boost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1–3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% CI 0·6960–0·9427], p=0·0001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous prime–boost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A dose–effect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

The objective of this study was to measure aerosol production during multiple patient care activities and to examine the samples for bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Five aerosol characterization instruments were used to measure aerosols during 7 patient care activities: patient bathing, changing bed linens, pouring and flushing liquid waste, bronchoscopy, noninvasive ventilation, and nebulized medication administration (NMA). Each procedure was sampled 5 times. An SKC BioSampler was used for pathogen recovery. Bacterial cultures were performed on the sampling solution. Patients on contact precautions for drug-resistant organisms were selected for most activity sampling. Any patient undergoing bronchoscopy was eligible. RESULTS: Of 35 sampling episodes, only 2 procedures showed a significant increase in particle concentrations over baseline: NMA and bronchoscopy with NMA. Bronchoscopy without NMA and noninvasive ventilation did not generate significant aerosols. Of 78 cultures from the impinger samples, 6 of 28 baseline samples (21.4%) and 14 of 50 procedure samples (28.0%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, significant aerosol generation was only observed during NMA, both alone and during bronchoscopy. Minimal viable bacteria were recovered, mostly common environmental organisms. Although more research is needed, these data suggest that some of the procedures considered to be aerosol-generating may pose little infection risk to HCP.","O’Neil, Caroline A; Li, Jiayu; Leavey, Anna; Wang, Yang; Hink, Matthew; Wallace, Meghan; Biswas, Pratim; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Babcock, Hilary M",Clinical Infectious Diseases,654,32

In pathology, present study mainly focused on the immune mechanism, but very few studies have concerned with the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of DVH. To study the antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of icariin and its phosphorylated derivative against DVH, we prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using the sodium trimetaphosphate–sodium tripolyphosphate method. Ducklings were drunk with icariin and p-icariin after being challenged with duck hepatitis virus 1 (DHV-1). We recorded the number of dead ducklings, gross pathological changes in the liver, and changes in indices of oxidative stress and liver injury. The correlations between these indices were also analyzed. RESULTS: Exposure to DHV-1 induced significant oxidative damage in ducklings. Administration of icariin or p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and significantly increased the survival rate, with better outcomes in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated with icariin. Icariin and p-icariin also attenuated the changes in oxidative stress and liver injury. We found positive correlations among indices of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and liver injury (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase), suggesting that DHV-1 causes significant oxidative damage, which is related to the extent of hepatic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Icariin and p-icariin improved the survival and attenuated oxidative stress and liver dysfunction induced by DHV-1. These outcomes were better in ducklings treated with p-icariin than in those treated by icariin. The clinical effects of both components were related to their antioxidant activities.","Xiong, Wen; Chen, Yun; Wang, Yu; Liu, Jiaguo",BMC Vet Res,654,1

The COVID-19 pandemic required an unprecedented shutdown in our institutional LDCT program. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer screening and subsequent cancer diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed our prospective institutional LDCT screening database, which began in 2012. In all, 2,153 patients have participated. Monthly mean number of LDCTs were compared between baseline (January 2017 to February 2020) and COVID-19 periods (March 2020 to July 2020). RESULTS: LDCT was suspended on March 13, 2020 and 818 screening visits were cancelled. Phased reopening began on May 5, 2020 and full opening on June 1, 2020. Total monthly mean ± SD LDCTs (146 ± 31 vs 39 ± 40; p < 0.01) and new patient monthly LDCTs (56 ± 14 vs 15 ± 17; p < 0.01) were significantly decreased during the COVID-19 period. New patient monthly LDCTs have remained low despite resuming full operations. Three- and 6-month interval follow-up LDCTs were prioritized and were significantly increased compared with baseline (11 ± 4 vs 30 ± 4; p < 0.01). The “no-show” rate was significantly increased from baseline (15% vs 40%; p < 0.04). Most concerning, the percentage of patients with lung nodules suspicious for malignancy (Lung-RADS 4) were significantly increased after screenings resumed (8% vs 29%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 caused significant disruption in lung cancer screening, leading to a decrease in new patients screened and an increased proportion of nodules suspicious for malignancy once screening resumed. Using lung cancer and the LDCT screening program as a model, this early analysis showed the unrecognized consequences related to the pandemic for screening programs and cancer care.","Van Haren, Robert M.; Delman, Aaron M.; Turner, Kevin M.; Waits, Brandy; Hemingway, Mona; Shah, Shimul A.; Starnes, Sandra L.",J Am Coll Surg,654,16

Now that there is a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, lessons can usefully be drawn from previous well documented vaccination efforts. Of these, the best documented and most successful is the Smallpox Eradication Program (SEP). A review was made of publications by major players in smallpox eradication, respecting the important differences between the disease, this review revealed several points of connection. Cultural factors loomed large both in the eradication of smallpox and progress, to date, in the control of COVID-19. Other points of similarity included political commitment, the set-up of strong surveillance mechanisms, and assurance of uniformly high quality vaccines tested and approved by the World Health Organization. The future of COVID-19 control depends, in part, on lessons learned from previous vaccination efforts. A review of those efforts will avoid repetition of past errors and permit adoption of best practices from the past.

The possibility of domiciliary tDCS supported by technology for remote administration and telemonitoring provides the opportunity to continue research on tDCS for geriatric mental health conditions. Over recent years, tDCS (a type of tES) is evolving as a potential treatment modality for neurocognitive disorders and depression. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of the longer course of tDCS possibly delivered as domiciliary treatment with or without supervision (remotely supervised or preprogrammed).25 This becomes increasingly relevant for geriatric mental health conditions, particularly in the context of COVID-19, as there is a need for precautions to avoid high-risk exposure in hospital settings.

Consequently, the positive effect on the environment has been witnessed. One of the most prominent evidences has been the drastic air quality improvement, as a direct consequence of lower emissions from reduced industrial activity. While several studies have demonstrated the validity of this hypothesis in mega-cities worldwide, it is still an unsubstantiated fact whether the same holds true for cities with a smaller urban extent and population. In the present study we investigate the temporal development of atmospheric constituent concentrations as retrieved concurrently from the Sentinel-5P satellite and a ground meteorological station. We focus on the period before and during the COVID-19 pandemic over the city of Hat Yai, Thailand and present the effect of the lockdown on the atmospheric quality over this average populated city (156,000 inhabitants). NO(2), PM(2.5) and PM(10) concentrations decreased by 33.7%, 21.8% and 22.9% respectively in the first 3 weeks of the lockdown compared to the respective pre-lockdown period; O(3) also decreased by 12.5% and contrary to similar studies. Monthly averages of NO(2), CO and PM(2.5) for the month April exhibit in 2020 the lowest values in the last decade. Sentinel-5P retrieved NO(2) tropospheric concentrations, both locally over the ground station and the spatial average over the urban extent of the city, are in agreement with the reduction observed from the ground station. Numerous studies have already presented evidence of the bettering of the air quality over large metropolitan areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study we demonstrate that this holds true for Hat Yai, Thailand; we propound that the environmental benefits documented in major urban agglomerations during the lockdown may extend to medium-sized urban areas as well.","Stratoulias, Dimitris; Nuthammachot, Narissara",Sci Total Environ,654,16

Although recent semi-supervised learning algorithms may alleviate the problem of annotation scarcity, limited real-world CT images still cause those algorithms producing inaccurate detection results, especially in real-world COVID-19 cases. Existing models often cannot detect the small infected regions in COVID-19 CT images, such a challenge implicitly causes that many patients with minor symptoms are misdiagnosed and develop more severe symptoms, causing a higher mortality. In this paper, we propose a new method to address this challenge. Not only can we detect severe cases, but also detect minor symptoms using real-world COVID-19 CT images in which the source domain only includes limited labeled CT images but the target domain has a lot of unlabeled CT images. Specifically, we adopt Network-in-Network and Instance Normalization to build a new module (we term it NI module) and extract discriminative representations from CT images from both source and target domains. A domain classifier is utilized to implement infected region adaptation from source domain to target domain in an Adversarial Learning manner, and learns domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model. We call our model NIA-Network (Network-in-Network, Instance Normalization and Adversarial Learning), and conduct extensive experiments on two COVID-19 datasets to validate our approach. The experimental results show that our model can effectively detect infected regions with different sizes and achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy compared with existing SOTA methods.","Li, Wei; Chen, Jinlin; Chen, Ping; Yu, Lequan; Cui, Xiaohui; Li, Yiwei; Cheng, Fang; Ouyang, Wen",Artif Intell Med,654,1

In this study, we establish a standardized process for manufacture of canine adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), including tissue sourcing, cell isolation and culture, cryopreservation, thawing and expansion, quality control and testing, and evaluate the safety and efficacy of those cells for clinical applications. RESULTS: After expansion, the viability of AD-MSCs manufactured under our standardized process was above 90 %. Expression of surface markers and differentiation potential was consistent with ISCT standards. Sterility, mycoplasma, and endotoxin tests were consistently negative.

RESULTS: We immobilized Ulp1 on N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose with a coupling efficiency of 1.7 mg/ml. The immobilized Ulp1 maintains 95% substrate-cleavage ability and significantly enhances pH and thermal stability, especially can withstand pH of 10.5. Besides resistance against some small molecules, the immobilized Ulp1 can tolerate 15% (v/v) DMSO and 20% (v/v) ethanol. It can be reused for more than 15 batch reactions with 90% activity retention. This provides a fast purification system to quickly obtain cleaved recombinant proteins with 95% purity from cell lysates with the application of immobilized Ulp1. CONCLUSIONS: Ulp1 used in immobilization form is a potentially useful tool for cleavage of SUMO-tagged proteins and may reduce time and cost of protein purification.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to gather information about the ability of hospitals in Kenya to provide emergency and critical care services and to identify priority actions for use by policymakers and other stakeholders as a roadmap toward strengthening the COVID-19 response in the country. METHODS: This was a comprehensive review of the published and grey literature on emergency and critical care services in Kenya published in the last three years through April 2020. Screening of articles was conducted independently by the authors and the final decision for inclusion was made collaboratively. A total of 15 papers and documents were included in the review. Key recommendations. There is an urgent need to strengthen prehospital emergency care in Kenya by establishing a single toll-free ambulance access number and an integrated public Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to respond to severe and critical COVID-19 patients in the community and other emergency cases. Functional 24-h emergency departments (EDs) need to be established in all the level 4, 5 and 6 hospitals in the country to ensure these patients receive immediate lifesaving emergency care when they arrive at the hospitals. The EDs should be equipped with pulse oximeters and functioning oxygen systems and have the necessary resources and skills to perform endotracheal intubation to manage COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and hypoxia. Additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are also needed to ensure continuity of care for the critically ill patients seen in the ED. Appropriate practical interventions should be instituted to limit the spread of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel and other patients within the healthcare system. Further research with individual facility levels of assessment around infrastructure and service provision is necessary to more narrowly define areas with significant shortfalls in emergency and critical care services as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country increase.","Wachira, Benjamin W.; Mwai, Margarita",Afr J Emerg Med,654,28

Randomized data have shown that baricitinib improves outcomes in these patients, but focused stratified analyses of geriatric cohorts are lacking. Our objective was to analyze the efficacy of baricitinib in older adults with COVID‐19 moderate‐to‐severe pneumonia. METHODS: This is a propensity score [PS]‐matched retrospective cohort study. Patients from the COVID‐AGE and Alba‐Score cohorts, hospitalized for moderate‐to‐severe COVID‐19 pneumonia, were categorized in two age brackets of age <70 years old (86 with baricitinib and 86 PS‐matched controls) or ≥70 years old (78 on baricitinib and 78 PS‐matched controls). Thirty‐day mortality rates were analyzed with Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Mean age was 79.1 for those ≥70 years and 58.9 for those <70. Exactly 29.6% were female. Treatment with baricitinib resulted in a significant reduction in death from any cause by 48% in patients aged 70 or older, an 18.5% reduction in 30‐day absolute mortality risk (n/N: 16/78 [20.5%] baricitinib, 30/78 [38.5%] in PS‐matched controls, p < 0.001) and a lower 30‐day adjusted fatality rate (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.09–0.47; p < 0.001). Beneficial effects on mortality were also observed in the age group <70 (8.1% reduction in 30‐day absolute mortality risk; HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03–0.64; p = 0.011).

COVID-19 affects all age groups; however, it is suggested to progress into severe disease and cause mortality in over 10% of the confirmed cases, depending on the individual characteristics of the affected population. One of the biggest unanswered questions it is why only some individuals develop into the severe stages of the disease. Current data indicate that most of the critically ill are the elderly or those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. However, it has been noted that, in some populations, severe disease is mostly observed in much younger individuals (<60-years old) with no reported underlying medical conditions. Certainly, many factors may contribute to disease severity including intrinsic host factors such as genetic variants, the expression levels of tissue proteins, among others. Considering all these aspects, this review aims to discuss how the expression levels of tissue proteases and the different profiles of immune responses influence the susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as disease severity and outcome.","Mulinari Turin de Oliveira, Natália; Fernandes da Silva Figueiredo, Isabella; Cristine Malaquias da Silva, Liziane; Sauruk da Silva, Karien; Regis Bueno, Laryssa; Barbosa da Luz, Bruna; Rita Corso, Cláudia; Paula Werner, Maria Fernanda; Soares Fernandes, Elizabeth; Maria-Ferreira, Daniele",Pathogens,654,28

Although substantial empirical research has addressed this topic, the literature is fragmented across subdisciplines, and an overarching theoretical framework is lacking. The first step toward constructing a unifying framework is identifying relevant phenomena. This systematic review of 6305 articles used text mining to identify phenomena relevant to adolescents’ emotion regulation. First, a baseline was established of relevant phenomena discussed in theory and recent narrative reviews. Then, article keywords and abstracts were analyzed using text mining, examining term frequency as an indicator of relevance and term co-occurrence as an indicator of association. The results reflected themes commonly featured in theory and narrative reviews, such as socialization and neurocognitive development, but also identified undertheorized themes, such as developmental disorders, physical health, external stressors, structural disadvantage, substance use, identity and moral development, and sexual development. The findings illustrate how text mining systematic reviews, a novel approach, may complement narrative reviews. Future theoretical work might integrate these undertheorized themes into an overarching framework, and empirical research might consider them as promising areas for future research, or as potential confounders in research on adolescents’ emotion regulation.

Initial infection with certain viruses, such as varicella zoster virus and measles, allows for development of lifelong immunity; on the other hand, the influenza virus requires yearly vaccination, which may not provide adequate immunity. This can be attributed to antigenic shift and drift, rendering previously made antibodies ineffective against new strains of influenza. This article describes six cases of patients who presented with mild acute respiratory symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 virus. After recovering from initial illness and being asymptomatic for several months, they developed recurrence of acute respiratory symptoms and, again, tested positive for COVID-19 virus, in more severe form than initial presentation. In the current state of the world, COVID-19 has created a lot of unknowns in the medical community, including patient presentation and treatment. COVID-19 research is evolving daily, but many questions remained unanswered. “Will a sufficient antibody response be created by the human body in those infected with COVID-19 and how long will that immunity last?” “Will antigenic drift occur quickly allowing the virus to evade previously made antibodies?” During initial surveillance of the COVID-19 virus, we were expecting development of an immune response comparable to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, given the viral similarities. Unfortunately, based on our observations, this may not necessarily be true and will be further discussed in the presented article.","Chew, Christopher; Mannepalli, Supriya",Case Rep Infect Dis,654,26

This discrepancy centres on whether they are considered to be an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP), thus requiring airborne protection to prevent transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs). The need to don higher-level PPE has to be weighed against the resulting delay to emergency treatment.We performed a literature search on this topic which found eight relevant studies. All were observational with low patient numbers and multiple confounding factors, but describe cases of acute respiratory infection transmission during chest compressions. One systematic review concluded that chest compressions were not an AGP. Two simulated studies (released as preprints) potentially demonstrate aerosol generation. Given that there is evidence for infection transmission during chest compressions, we conclude that a precautionary approach with appropriate PPE is necessary to protect HCW from contracting a potentially fatal infection.","Brown, Evelyn; Chan, Lai Man",Clinical medicine,654,27

Leaving aside the natural process of viral mutation, the pandemic, recession and pincer-grip crisis can be understood as distinct repulsions of an hyperglobalization that is gradually undermining its own conditions of existence. Meanwhile, the recent rupture cannot be adequately grasped without taking into account the financial crash of 2007 to 2009, the political interregnum of the post-crisis years and the tendency towards bonapartistic democracy. By itself, the corona crisis will not lead to a “build back better”; the emergency state is hardly capable of such a setting of the course.

Methods: A management review was conducted based on a structured search in the PubMed and Web of Science databases. Results: The review included 20 case—and lessons learned reports covering natural disasters, man-made events, and accidents across Europe, the United States of Amerika (USA), Asia and the Middle East. Five common challenges were identified: (1) to identify the situation and deal with uncertainty, (2) to balance the mismatch between the contingency plan and the reality, (3) to establish a functional crisis organization, (4) to adapt the medical response to the actual and overall situation and (5) to ensure a resilient response. Conclusions: The challenges when managing mass casualty or disaster events involved were mainly related to the ability to manage uncertainty and surprising situations, using structured processes to respond. The ability to change mind set, organization and procedures, both from an organizational- and individual perspective, was essential.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics strain health systems and households. Health systems in Africa and South Asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity. Methods. We investigated the impact of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. We adapted a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use. Findings. The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. A highly mitigated COVID-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity. Interpretation. Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease.","Davies, Nicholas G; Sweeney, Sedona; Torres-Rueda, Sergio; Bozzani, Fiammetta; Kitson, Nichola; Barasa, Edwine; Procter, Simon; Quaife, Matthew; Group, - LSHTM Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases COVID-19 Working; Eggo, Rosalind M; Vassall, Anna; Jit, Mark",,654,20

The desire to control infection in hospitals and at the same time to reduce their carbon footprint motivates the use of unconventional solutions for building design and associated control measures. This paper considers indoor sources and types of infectious aerosols, and pathogen viability and infectivity behaviors in response to environmental conditions. Aerosol dispersion, heat and mass transfer, deposition in the respiratory tract, and infection mechanisms are discussed, with an emphasis on experimental and modeling approaches. Key building design parameters are described that include types of ventilation systems (mixing, displacement, natural and hybrid), air exchange rate, temperature and relative humidity, air flow distribution structure, occupancy, engineered disinfection of air (filtration and UV radiation), and architectural programming (source and activity management) for health care facilities. The paper describes major findings and suggests future research needs in methods for ventilation design of health care facilities to prevent airborne infection risk.","Aliabadi, Amir A.; Rogak, Steven N.; Bartlett, Karen H.; Green, Sheldon I.",Adv Prev Med,654,17

The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.","Reinacher, M.",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,654,1

Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or pain—a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.","Song, Woo-Jung; Hui, Christopher K M; Hull, James H; Birring, Surinder S; McGarvey, Lorcan; Mazzone, Stuart B; Chung, Kian Fan",Lancet Respir Med,654,26

The spread of aerosols through singing and musical instruments in music performances has necessitated precautionary methods such as masks and portable purifiers. This study investigates the effects of placing portable air purifiers at different locations inside a classroom and the effects of different aerosol injection rates (e.g., with and without masks, different musical instruments, and different injection modes). Aerosol deposition, airborne concentration, and removal are analyzed in this study. It was found that using purifiers could help in achieving ventilation rates close to the prescribed values by the World Health Organization, while also achieving aerosol removal times within the Center of Disease Control and Prevention recommended guidelines. This could help in deciding break periods between classroom sessions, which was around 25 min through this study. Moreover, proper placement of purifiers could offer significant advantages in reducing airborne aerosol numbers (offering several orders of magnitude higher aerosol removal when compared to nearly zero removal when having no purifiers), and improper placement of the purifiers could worsen the situation. This study suggests the purifier to be placed close to the injector to yield a benefit and away from the people to be protected. The injection rate was found to have an almost linear correlation with the average airborne aerosol suspension rate and deposition rate, which could be used to predict the trends for scenarios with other injection rates.","Narayanan, Sai Ranjeet; Yang, Suo",Phys Fluids (1994),654,27

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of food banks and pantries has increased in the US. Here we examine perceptions of food banks and food pantries and their relationship to food security and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a statewide representative survey (n = 600) of residents of Vermont. The utilization of food pantries was more common among food insecure households and households with children. Among food insecure respondents, those who did not use a food pantry were significantly more likely to report consuming less FV during the pandemic. Further, we find respondents who are food insecure and using a food pantry report consuming more FV since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that respondents who were both food insecure and reported not using a food pantry were significantly more likely to report both a reduction in fruit consumption (b = −0.58; p = 0.001) and a reduction in vegetable consumption (b = −0.415; p = 0.012).

We survey the history and mechanism of coronaviruses, and the structural characteristics of the spike protein and its key residues responsible for human transmissions. METHODS: We have carried out a systematic review to summarize the origin, transmission and etiology of COVID-19. The structural analysis of the spike protein and its disordered residues explains the mechanism of the viral transmission. A meta-data analysis of the therapeutic compounds targeting the SARS-CoV-2 is also included. RESULTS: Coronaviruses can cross the species barrier and infect humans with unexpected consequences for public health. The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher compared to that of the closely related SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, intrinsically disordered regions are observed at the interface of the spike protein and ACE2 receptor, providing a shape complementarity to the complex. The key residues of the spike protein have stronger binding affinity with ACE2. These can be probable reasons for the higher transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we have also discussed the therapeutic compounds and the vaccines to target SARS-CoV-2, which can help researchers to develop effective drugs/vaccines for COVID-19. SUMMARY: The overall history and mechanism of entry of SARS-CoV-2 along with structural study of spike-ACE2 complex provide insights to understand disease pathogenesis and development of vaccines and drugs.","Yesudhas, Dhanusha; Srivastava, Ambuj; Gromiha, M.

BACKGROUND: Registered nurse/patient ratio and nursing competence is known to affect patient outcomes. The first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic entailed novel ways for staffing to meet the expected increased acute care demand, which potentially could impact on quality of care. METHODS: A comparative cross‐sectional study was conducted, using the MISSCARE Survey. A sample of nursing staff during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic (n=130) was compared with a reference sample (n=157). RESULTS: Few differences between samples concerning elements of missed care, and no significant differences concerning reasons for missed care were found. Most participants perceived the quality of care and the patient safety to be good. CONCLUSION: The results may be explained by three factors: maintained registered nurse/patient ratio, patients’ dependency levels and that nursing managers could maintain the staffing needs with a sufficient skill mix. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing managers impact on the occurrence of MNC; to provide a sufficient registered nurse/patient ratio and skill mix when staffing.

We aimed to determine the extent of knowledge, self-reported preventive behavior, and risk perception of the COVID-19 outbreak among college students in Libya. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 20 to April 30, 2020. The participants were students of medical and non-medical subjects from Libyan educational institutes. Data on participants’ characteristics, knowledge, preventive behavior, and risk perception were collected. RESULTS: Approximately 3669 participants completed the questionnaire, of which 2547 (69.4) were medical students and 1122 (30.6%) were non-medical students. The mean knowledge score on COVID-19 was 8.62 (SD: 1.26, range: 0-12), corresponding to 71.8% correct answers. A significant difference was observed between medical and non-medical students in terms of knowledge (p < 0.001). Overall, the knowledge score of the students differed significantly with respect to age, current year of study, and financial source (p < 0.05). The mean score of preventive behavioral measures toward COVID-19 (out of 8) was 7.42 (SD: 0.95, range: 0-8), and the overall preventive measure score was estimated to be approximately 7.42/8*100, which corresponds to 92.7% for both medical and non-medical students. CONCLUSION: Notably, college students were observed to have substantial knowledge, preventive behavior, and a positive attitude toward COVID-19.

After the example of China, all the affected countries are taking hard-confinement measures to control the infection and to gain some time to reduce the significant amount of cases that arrive at the hospital. Although the measures in China reduced the percentages of new cases, this is not seen in other countries that have taken similar measures, such as Italy and Spain. After the first weeks, the worry was whether or not the healthcare system would collapse rather than its response to the patient's needs who are infected and require hospitalization. Using China as a mirror of what could happen in our countries and with the data available, we calculated a model that forecasts the peak of the curve of infection, hospitalization, and ICU bed numbers. We aimed to review the patterns of spread of the virus in the two countries and their regions, looking for similarities that reflect the existence of a typical path in this expansive virulence and the effects of the intervention of the authorities with drastic isolation measures, to contain the outbreak. A model based on Autorregressive and moving average models (ARMA) methodology and including Chinese disease pattern as a proxy, predicts the contagious pattern robustly. Based on the prediction, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were also calculated. Results suggest a reduction in the speed of contagion during April in both countries, earlier in Spain than in Italy. The forecast advanced a significant increase in the ICU needs for Spain surpassing 8,000 units by the end of April, but for Italy, ICU needs would decrease in the same period, according to the model. We present the following predictions to inform political leaders because they have the responsibility to maintain the national health systems away from collapsing. We are confident these data could help them into decision-taking and place the capitals (from hospital beds to human resources) into the right place.","Monllor, Paloma; Su, Zhenyu; Gabrielli, Laura; Taltavull de La Paz, Paloma",Front Public Health,654,2

It is unknown whether the innate myeloid response differs with disease severity, and whether markers of innate immunity discriminate high risk patients. Thus, we performed high dimensional flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient peripheral blood cells and detected the disappearance of non-classical CD14LowCD16High monocytes, the accumulation of HLA-DRLow classical monocytes, and the release of massive amounts of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) in severe cases. Immature CD10LowCD101-CXCR4+/- neutrophils with an immuno-suppressive profile accumulated as well in blood and lungs, suggesting emergency myelopoiesis. We finally showed that calprotectin plasma level and a routine flow cytometry assay detecting decreased frequencies of non-classical monocytes could discriminate patients who develop a severe COVID-19 form, suggesting a predictive value that deserves prospective evaluation.","Silvin, Aymeric; Chapuis, Nicolas; Dunsmore, Garett; Goubet, Anne-Gaëlle; Dubuisson, Agathe; Derosa, Lisa; Almire, Carole; Hénon, Clémence; Kosmider, Olivier; Droin, Nathalie; Rameau, Philippe; Catelain, Cyril; Alfaro, Alexia; Dussiau, Charles; Friedrich, Chloé; Sourdeau, Elise; Marin, Nathalie; Szwebel, Tali-Anne; Cantin, Delphine; Mouthon, Luc; Borderie, Didier; Deloger, Marc; Bredel, Delphine; Mouraud, Severine; Drubay, Damien; Andrieu, Muriel; Lhonneur, Anne-Sophie; Saada, Véronique; Stoclin, Annabelle; Willekens, Christophe; Pommeret, Fanny; Griscelli, Frank; Ng, Lai Guan; Zhang, Zheng; Bost, Pierre; Amit, Ido; Barlesi, Fabrice; Marabelle, Aurélien; Pène, Frédéric; Gachot, Bertrand; André, Fabrice; Zitvogel, Laurence; Ginhoux, Florent; Fontenay, Michaela; Solary, Eric",Cell,654,18

Cases were characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting, with 80–100% morbidity and 50–90% mortality in suckling piglets. The causative agent of the diarrhea was ultimately identified as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In this study, we isolated a PEDV strain designated CHGD-01 from piglet intestines using Vero cell cultures, and its specific cytopathic effects were confirmed in susceptible cells by direct immunofluorescence testing and electron microscopy. The complete genome of CHGD-01 was shown to be 28,035 nucleotides in length, with a similar structure to that of PEDV reference strains. Phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome revealed that CHGD-01 shared nucleotide sequence identities of 98.2–98.4% with two other Chinese isolates reported in the same year, thus constituting a new cluster. Amino acid sequence analysis based on individual virus genes indicated a close relationship between the spike protein gene of CHGD-01 and the field strain KNU0802 in Korea. Its ORF3 and nucleoprotein genes, however, were divergent from all other sequenced PEDV isolate clusters and therefore formed a new group, suggesting a new variant PEDV isolate in China. Further studies will be required to determine the immunogenicity and pathogenicity of this new variant.","Pan, Yongfei; Tian, Xiaoyan; Li, Wei; Zhou, Qingfeng; Wang, Dongdong; Bi, Yingzuo; Chen, Feng; Song, Yanhua",Virol J,654,16

The implementation of digital health tools has suffered from 2 limitations: (1) the interventions commonly ignore the “law of amplification” that states that technology is most likely to succeed when it seeks to augment and not alter human behavior; and (2) end-user needs and clinical gaps are often poorly understood while designing solutions, contributing to a substantial decrease in usage, referred to as the “law of attrition” in eHealth. The COVID-19 pandemic has addressed the first of the 2 problems—technology solutions, such as telemedicine, that were struggling to find traction are now closely aligned with health-seeking behavior. The second problem (poorly designed solutions) persists, as demonstrated by a plethora of poorly designed epidemic prediction tools and digital contact-tracing apps, which were deployed at scale, around the world, with little validation. The pandemic has accelerated the Indian state’s desire to build the nation’s digital health ecosystem. We call for the inclusion of regulatory sandboxes, as successfully done in the fintech sector, to provide a real-world testing environment for mHealth solutions before deploying them at scale.","Bhatia, Abhishek; Matthan, Rahul; Khanna, Tarun; Balsari, Satchit",J Med Internet Res,654,1

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively compared use of antibiotics, chest radiographs, and isolation precautions for patients <18 years old (excluding neonates) hospitalized at a tertiary referral center tested for respiratory pathogens in the emergency department or during the first 2 hospital days, during two periods: June 2010–June 2012 (non-MPCR group) vs. October 2012-May 2014 (MPCR group). RESULTS: Subjects (n=2430) in the MPCR group were older, had more complex chronic conditions, and were admitted to the PICU more often compared with the non-MPCR (n=2349) group. Subjects in the MPCR group had more positive tests (42.4% vs. 14.4%, p<0.01), received fewer days of antibiotics (4 vs. 5 median antibiotic days, p<0.01), fewer chest radiographs performed, (59% vs. 78%, p<0.01), and were placed in isolation longer (20 vs. 0 median isolation-hours, p<0.01) compared with the non-MPCR group.

We have developed a mass-spectrometry-based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples, even those with the lowest viral loads, and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and the addition of isopropanol and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.","Nikolaev, Evgeny N.; Indeykina, Maria I.; Brzhozovskiy, Alexander G.; Bugrova, Anna E.; Kononikhin, Alexey S.; Starodubtseva, Natalia L.; Petrotchenko, Evgeny V.; Kovalev, Grigoriy I.; Borchers, Christoph H.; Sukhikh, Gennady T.",J Proteome Res,654,26

Due to their severity and chronic course, anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD), are of considerable interest and clinical importance in this population. This study has two main objectives: (1) to estimate the prevalence and incidence of GAD and PD in patients with CAD over a 2-year period and (2) to prospectively assess the association between PD or GAD and adverse cardiac events, treatment adherence, CAD-related health behaviors, quality of life and psychological distress. DESIGN/METHOD: This is a longitudinal cohort study in which 3610 participants will be recruited following a CAD-related revascularization procedure. They will complete an interview and questionnaires at 5 time points over a 2-year period (baseline and follow-ups after 3, 6, 12 and 24 months). The presence of PD or GAD, adherence to recommended treatments, health behaviors, quality of life and psychological distress will be assessed at each time point. Data regarding mortality and adverse cardiac events will be collected with a combination of interviews and review of medical files. DISCUSSION: This study will provide essential information on the prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders in patients with CAD and on the consequences of these comorbidities. Such data is necessary in order to develop clear clinical recommendations for the management of PD and GAD in patients with CAD. This will help improve the prognosis of patients suffering from both conditions.","Foldes-Busque, Guillaume; Dionne, Clermont E.; Turcotte, Stéphane; Tully, Phillip J.; Tremblay, Marie-Andrée; Poirier, Paul; Denis, Isabelle",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,654,10

We sampled and genetically characterized in detail a contact zone of two subtaxa of the rodent Mastomys natalensis in Tanzania. We find two distinct arenaviruses, Gairo and Morogoro virus, each spatially confined to a single M. natalensis subtaxon, only co-occurring at the contact zone’s centre. Inter-subtaxon hybridization at this centre and a continuum of quality habitat for M. natalensis show that both viruses have the ecological opportunity to spread into the other substaxon’s range, but do not, strongly suggesting host-intrinsic barriers. Such barriers could explain why human cases of another M. natalensis-borne arenavirus, Lassa virus, are limited to West Africa.","Gryseels, Sophie; Baird, Stuart J.

Using available items from previous studies to derive a social frailty scale as guided by the Bunt social frailty theoretical framework, we aimed to examine the association of social frailty, independently of physical frailty, with salient outcomes of mood, nutrition, physical performance, physical activity, and life–space mobility. We studied 229 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 67.22 years; 72.6% females) who were non-frail (defined by the FRAIL criteria). Using exploratory factor analysis, the resultant 8-item Social Frailty Scale (SFS-8) yielded a three-factor structure comprising social resources, social activities and financial resource, and social need fulfilment (score range: 0–8 points). Social non-frailty (SNF), social pre-frailty (SPF), and social frailty (SF) were defined based on optimal cutoffs, with corresponding prevalence of 63.8%, 28.8%, and 7.4%, respectively. In logistic regression adjusted for significant covariates and physical frailty (Modified Fried criteria), there is an association of SPF with poor physical performance and low physical activity (odds ratio, OR range: 3.10 to 6.22), and SF with depressive symptoms, malnutrition risk, poor physical performance, and low physical activity (OR range: 3.58 to 13.97) compared to SNF. There was no significant association of SPF or SF with life–space mobility. In summary, through a theory-guided approach, our study demonstrates the independent association of social frailty with a comprehensive range of intermediary health outcomes in more robust older adults. A holistic preventative approach to frailty should include upstream interventions that target social frailty to address social gradient and inequalities.","Pek, Kalene; Chew, Justin; Lim, Jun Pei; Yew, Suzanne; Tan, Cai Ning; Yeo, Audrey; Ding, Yew Yoong; Lim, Wee Shiong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,654,26

Several public health and social protective measures that may prevent or slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 were introduced. However, these measures are unfortunately neglected or deliberately ignored by some individuals. Objective To identify the factors influencing intention to adhere to precautionary measures againstCOVID-19 in Sudan. Methods and Design Cross sectional online based survey using virtual convenience sampling technique. Variables Measured Perceived threat of corona virus (perceived severity and perceived susceptibility), perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy and intention to adhere to precautionary behavior towards COVID-19 Results The significant predictors of intention to adhere to the precautionary behavior against COVID-19 were: gender ({beta} =3.34, P <0.001), self-efficacy ({beta}= 0.476, P<0.001), perceived benefits ({beta}= 0.349, P<0.001) and perceived severity ({beta}= 0.113, P=0.005). These factors explained 43% of the variance in participants intention to adhere to the protective measures. Participants who were female, confident in their ability to adhere to the protective measures when available, believing in the benefits of the protective measures against COVID-19 and perceiving that the disease could have serious consequences were more likely to be willing to adhere to the protective measures.

It is believed that if a CF patient ceases treatment for 2 days, this can result in an exacerbation. One week of missed treatments can result in a hospitalization and 1 month of missed treatments can result in an earlier demise. With a global pandemic that has affected more than 9 million people, many CF clinics were required to take steps to avoid transmission of this dangerous virus. This may result in delays in delivery of timely CF care due to closure of clinics and pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories and limited staff allowed on site for conducting in-person visits. These measures, along with suggestions from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) to extend the social distancing longer than traditional CDC recommendations for the CF community, create an urgent need to explore novel ways to deliver safer care via new standards in chronic health conditions like CF. Especially, as these preventive strategies may be necessary for long-term maintenance, few objective alternatives exist to guide clinicians and allied health professionals in CF centers how to proceed in this new era. This also presents an opportunity for novel approaches that could improve delivery of CF care with remote monitoring and real-time delivery of care in patients’ home environments. Such emerging approaches could benefit patient care, leading to reduced costs and readmissions and improved access to care, medication adherence, and patient communication.

A lack of awareness, stigma related to mental health issues, and limited accessibility to treatment services magnify the profound personal and societal impact of depression. Given the rise of smartphones in India, mobile technology can help alleviate some of these depression-related challenges. AIMS AND METHOD The aim of this paper is to investigate the essential features of an India targeted depression smartphone app. We conducted an online survey to profile the needs of individuals with depression in India, which varied based on variables such as socioeconomic background, age, level of awareness toward depression, and the extent of exposure to mental health stigma. We also conducted a systematic evaluation of depression apps currently available to Indian users to investigate the user needs that these apps met and the needs that they failed to meet. Based on our findings, we made a set of recommendations related to the essential features of a future app targeted at managing depression in India. RESULTS Presently available depression apps fall short in providing some significant features such as local language options, content in audio and video formats, and user location matched resources. These gaps make these apps less than fully relevant to a diverse set of Indian users. CONCLUSIONS It is essential to provide depression-related information in a targeted manner depending upon each user's particular needs and context. Potential customizations, such as offering content in local languages and flexible formats (e.g. audio, video, and text); and providing user-relevant diagnostic tools and location matched treatment resources can help improve the suitability of the app for diverse users.","Ramnath, Swati; Suri, Gaurav",The International journal of social psychiatry,654,14

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed 130 young adults (mean age: 28.39 ± 4.77; 65 male, 65 female) and 36 children (mean age: 12.41 ± 4.51; 17 male, 19 female), between March and June 2020. COVID-19 related imaging findings on chest CT were examined in young adults and compared with children by the Mann-Whitney U, and Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Laboratory examinations of young adults were assessed in terms of correlation with radiological findings by the Spearman's correlation analysis. RESULTS: Bilateral multiple distributions (p = 0.014), subpleural involvement, and pleural thickening (p = 0.004), GGOs with internal consolidations were more frequent in adults (p = 0.009). Infiltrations were significantly larger than 20 mm in young adults (p = 0.011). The rates of feeding vessel sign, vascular enlargement, and halo sign were significantly higher in young adults (p < 0.003). Highly significant positive correlations were found between radiological and biochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: Distribution, size, and pattern of COVID-19 related imaging findings differed in children and young adults. Radiological findings were correlated with biochemical parameters but not with blood count results of young adults.","Bayramoglu, Zuhal; Cingoz, Eda; Comert, Rana G.; Gasimli, Nilufar; Kaba, Ozge; Sari Yanartas, Mehpare; Hancerli Torun, Selda; Somer, Ayper; Erturk, Sukru Mehmet; Tunaci, Atadan",Clin Imaging,654,26

A growing repertoire of mechanisms supporting BMC formation, composition, dynamics, and functions are becoming elucidated. BMCs are now appreciated as required for several steps of gene regulation, while their deregulation promotes pathological aggregates, such as stress granules (SGs) and insoluble irreversible plaques that are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment of BMC-related diseases will greatly benefit from identification of therapeutics preventing pathological aggregates while sparing BMCs required for cellular functions. Numerous viruses that block SG assembly also utilize or engineer BMCs for their replication. While BMC formation first depends on prion-like disordered protein domains (PrLDs), metal ion-controlled RNA-binding domains (RBDs) also orchestrate their formation. Virus replication and viral genomic RNA (vRNA) packaging dynamics involving nucleocapsid (NC) proteins and their orthologs rely on Zinc (Zn) availability, while virus morphology and infectivity are negatively influenced by excess Copper (Cu). While virus infections modify physiological metal homeostasis towards an increased copper to zinc ratio (Cu/Zn), how and why they do this remains elusive. Following our recent finding that pan-retroviruses employ Zn for NC-mediated LLPS for virus assembly, we present a pan-virus bioinformatics and literature meta-analysis study identifying metal-based mechanisms linking virus-induced BMCs to neurodegenerative disease processes. We discover that conserved degree and placement of PrLDs juxtaposing metal-regulated RBDs are associated with disease-causing prion-like proteins and are common features of viral proteins responsible for virus capsid assembly and structure. Virus infections both modulate gene expression of metalloproteins and interfere with metal homeostasis, representing an additional virus strategy impeding physiological and cellular antiviral responses. Our analyses reveal that metal-coordinated virus NC protein PrLDs initiate LLPS that nucleate pan-virus assembly and contribute to their persistence as cell-free infectious aerosol droplets. Virus aerosol droplets and insoluble neurological disease aggregates should be eliminated by physiological or environmental metals that outcompete PrLD-bound metals. While environmental metals can control virus spreading via aerosol droplets, therapeutic interference with metals or metalloproteins represent additional attractive avenues against pan-virus infection and virus-exacerbated neurological diseases.","Monette, Anne; Mouland, Andrew J.",Viruses,654,16

Specifically, are they likely to have improved public health understood according to widely used aggregate population health measures, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) as much or more than alternatives? This is a reasonable question, since such measures have been promoted extensively in global and national health policy by influential actors, and they have become almost synonymous with quantification of public health. If the steps taken against COVID-19 did not meet this test, then either the measures or the policies must be re-evaluated. There are indications that policies against COVID-19 may have been unbalanced and therefore not optimal. A balanced approach to protecting population health should be proportionate in its effects across distinct health concerns at a moment, across populations over time and across populations over space. These criteria provide a guide to designing and implementing policies that diminish harm from COVID-19 while also providing due attention to other threats to aggregate population health. They should shape future policies in response to this pandemic and others.","Reddy, Sanjay G",BMJ Glob Health,654,16

Our aim is to document hematological parameters of patients with COVID‐19 during initial stage of diagnosis and to identify early hematological indicators of severe infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Shifa International Hospital, Pakistan from April to November 2020. Patients hospitalized with COVID‐19, diagnosed on RT‐PCR and had a complete blood count (CBC) done within 48 hours of diagnosis were included. Data was analyzed using IBM(®) SPSS Statistics. RESULTS: A total of 425 patients were included in this study out of whom 272(64%) were males. The mean age was 55.61 ± 17.84 years. 95 patients (22.4%) had normal blood counts within 48 hours of COVID‐19 diagnosis. Cytopenias were seen in 193(45.4%) patients. There were 75(17.6%) mortalities during the study period. Chi‐square test showed that thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and neutrophilic leucocytosis were significantly associated with mortality (P = .037, P < .001, P < .001 respectively) and need for ventilator (P = .009, P < .001, P < .001, respectively). Neutrophilia was also associated with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (P < .001). On ROC analysis, Neutrophil‐to‐Lymphocyte Ratio yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.693 and 0.660 for the outcomes mortality and need for ventilator, respectively. For a subset of 288 patients who had D‐dimer levels checked within 48 hours of COVID‐19 diagnosis, the AUC for mortality and ventilator need was 0.708 and 0.671, respectively. CONCLUSION: Hematological indices are vital indicators in the prognosis and risk stratification of COVID‐19 during initial stages of disease.","Sharif, Fatima; Khan, Samreen; Junaid, Ayesha; Jahangir, Sehreen; Saeed, Maria; Ijaz, Maira; Ahmad, Imran Nazir; Kamran, Shawana",Int J Lab Hematol,654,1

We have been investigating an approach to multiple disorders that involves recruiting the innate immune system to aid the body’s healing and regenerative mechanism(s). In the case of West Nile Virus encephalitis and potentially COVID-19, the proposed intervention to stimulate the innate immune system may give the adaptive immune response the necessary time to develop, finish clearing the virus, and provide future immunity. Furthermore, we have found that GM-CSF-induced recruitment of the innate immune system is also able to reverse brain pathology, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and Down syndrome, as well as improving cognition in normal aging and in human patients with cognitive deficits due to chemotherapy, both of which exhibit neuroinflammation. Others have shown that GM-CSF is an effective treatment for both bacterial and viral pneumonias, and their associated inflammation, in animals and that it has successfully treated pneumonia-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in humans. These and other data strongly suggest that GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for many viral infections, including COVID-19.","Potter, Huntington; Boyd, Timothy D.; Clarke, Penny; Pelak, Victoria S.; Tyler, Kenneth L.",F1000Res,654,33

This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. METHODS: The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72–0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2–12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. CONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage.

Unconscious bias, gendered expectations, and overt hostility minimize the contributions of women in academic medicine to the detriment of all. The current environment of heightened stress and new socially distant forms of communication may be exacerbating these well-recognized obstacles to women contributing to the field. Of note, none of these actions requires ill intent; all they require is the activation of unconscious biases and almost instinctive preferences and behaviors that favor the comfortable and familiar leadership of men in a time of extreme stress. The authors argue that it is time to investigate the frequency of behaviors that limit both the recognition and the very exercise of women’s leadership during this pandemic, which is unprecedented but nevertheless may recur in the future. Leaders in health care must pay attention to equity, diversity, and inclusion given increases in undermining and harassing behaviors toward women during this crisis. The longer-term consequences of marginalizing women may hamper efforts to combat the next pandemic, so the time to flatten the rising gender bias curve in academic medicine is now.","Lewiss, Resa E.; Jagsi, Reshma",Acad Med,654,1

While traditionally perceived as macrophage- and foam cell-dominated disease, it is now established that atherosclerosis is a partial autoimmune disease that involves the recognition of peptides from ApoB (apolipoprotein B), the core protein of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol particles, by CD4(+) T-helper cells and autoantibodies against LDL and ApoB. Autoimmunity in the atherosclerotic plaque has long been understood as a pathogenic T-helper type-1 driven response with proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Recent developments in high-parametric cell immunophenotyping by mass cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and in tools exploring antigen-specificity have established the existence of several unforeseen layers of T-cell diversity with mixed T(H)1 and T regulatory cells transcriptional programs and unpredicted fates. These findings suggest that pathogenic ApoB-reactive T cells evolve from atheroprotective and immunosuppressive CD4(+) T regulatory cells that lose their protective properties over time. Here, we discuss T-cell heterogeneity in atherosclerosis with a focus on plasticity, antigen-specificity, exhaustion, maturation, tissue residency, and its potential use in clinical prediction.","Winkels, Holger; Wolf, Dennis",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,654,20
