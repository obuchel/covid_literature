32544,Flecainide/paracetamol interaction: Various toxicities: case report,2020-05-09,"American-based social media companies have become active players in digital war, both by accident of design and a subsequent failure to address the threat due to concerns over profits. Discussions about the negative role of social media in society generally address the myriad problems wrought by social media, including electoral manipulation, foreign disinformation, trolling, and deepfakes, as unfortunate side effects of a democratizing technology. This article argues that the design of social media fosters information warfare. With its current composition and lack of regulation, social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are active agents of disinformation, their destructive force in society outweighing their contributions to democracy. While this is not by deliberate design, the twin forces of capitalism and a lack of regulation of the world’s largest social media platforms have led to a situation in which social media are a key component of information war around the globe. This means that scholarly discussions should shift away from questions of ethics or actions (or lack thereof) on the part of social media companies to a frank focus on the security risk posed to democracy by social media.","Oates, Sarah",Digi War,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7212244/,775

Using various forms of dual reasoning allows our CDCL-based algorithm to enumerate partial models with no need for exploring and shrinking full models. Our focus is on model enumeration without repetition, with potential applications in weighted model counting and weighted model integration for probabilistic inference over Boolean and hybrid domains. Chronological backtracking renders the use of blocking clauses obsolete. We provide a formalization and examples. We further discuss important design choices for a future implementation related to the strength of dual reasoning, including unit propagation, using SAT or QBF oracles.","Möhle, Sibylle; Sebastiani, Roberto; Biere, Armin",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326472/,775

Similarly, security is increasingly undermined by, for example, economic, health, and environmental threats that can affect individuals’ daily lives and know no state boundaries. This is the kaleidoscopic world as outlined by Edith Brown Weiss. The concept of ‘human security’ has been advanced to inform decision-making on threats to security in the interest of individuals in a bottom-up manner. This article looks forward to methods that can counter what could be perceived as a legitimacy crisis in international law. First, some of the current challenges which international law faces are explained ranging from globalisation, the declining state-based order, and decentralised security threats. Second, the concept of human security is defined, and its contents expounded. Lastly, the thesis is advanced that a conceptual framework of human security can reorientate international law to be responsive to the kaleidoscopic world by using UN peace operations as an example of where human security could have a profound impact.","Gilder, Alexander",Indian Journal of International Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360997/,775

41653,Azithromycin/benzonatate/methocarbamol: Various toxicities: case report,2020-10-31,"The Covid-19 crisis intensifies the lively debate on regional disparities in the supply of public services. Particularly in sparsely populated rural areas, many municipalities had a hard time providing competitive medical care, education facilities, public transport, or broadband internet – even before the Covid-19 outbreak. While on the one hand a further strengthening of urban centres is currently discussed, on the other hand a feeling of being abandoned is perceived among people in rural areas indicating a conflict between agglomerations and the countryside. The present analysis kicks off the empirical debate for Germany: Based on a newly compiled dataset, this contribution provides a spatial analysis, in how far a poor supply of public services is related to an alienation from established political parties in the elections to the Bundestag 2017 and the European elections 2019. An index of public services is created combining amongst others the distance to the closest situated train station as well as the accessibility of the nearest hospital on the municipality level. As expected from other Western democracies, also in Germany a less intense supply of public services is related to a stronger election result for the right-wing AfD. Partly however, this result is simply driven by the stark divergence between rural and urban municipalities and disappears when zooming in on smaller rural municipalities. What is more, AfD support does neither increase with a longer distance to the closest train station nor with a higher level of municipality debt. Nevertheless, the results point to favourable breeding grounds for right-wing populism in areas of political alienation and economic distress. Robustly, the AfD performs better where turnout is lower, where larger shares of the population emigrated and in the face of a tighter labour market. On the contrary, an innovative local economy has the potential to contain right-wing support.","Diermeier, Matthias",Z Politikwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607891/,775

44374,Chloroquine-diphosphate/ciprofloxacin/meropenem: Various toxicities: case report,2021-01-09,"When you search repeatedly for a set of items among very similar distractors, does that make you more efficient in locating the targets? To address this, we had observers search for two categories of targets among the same set of distractors across trials. Visual and conceptual similarity of the stimuli were validated with a multidimensional scaling analysis, and separately using a deep neural network model. After a few blocks of visual search trials, the distractor set was replaced. In three experiments, we manipulated the level of discriminability between the targets and distractors before and after the distractors were replaced. Our results suggest that in the presence of repeated distractors, observers generally become more efficient. However, the difficulty of the search task does impact how efficient people are when the distractor set is replaced. Specifically, when the training is easy, people are more impaired in a difficult transfer test. We attribute this effect to the precision of the target template generated during training. In particular, a coarse target template is created when the target and distractors are easy to discriminate. These coarse target templates do not transfer well in a context with new distractors. This suggests that learning with more distinct targets and distractors can result in lower performance when context changes, but observers recover from this effect quickly (within a block of search trials).

But the accuracies have been criticized as a consequence of its aspatial nature. The work presented here describes a geographically weighted method combined with logistic regression for producing and visualizing the spatially distributed accuracy measures across the landscape. The outcomes compare the standard confusion matrix-based accuracy measures with those that have been permitted to differ locally. Furthermore, statistical parameters, i.e. Akaike information criterion, adjusted squared correlation coefficient (R(2)) and residual sum of squares (RSS) were employed to compare the performance of geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) with global ordinary least square regression technique. The GWLR technique was found to provide more reliable performance in estimating spatially varying accuracy measures. The results demonstrated that the geographically weighted approach offers additional and valuable insights for examining spatial variation in the context of landscape mapping accuracy.","Mishra, Varun Narayan; Kumar, Vivek; Prasad, Rajendra; Punia, Milap",J Indian Soc Remote Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847807/,775

The objective of the study was to estimate the genetic variability within EHV-5 viruses circulating among horses in Poland. Partial glycoprotein B (gB) sequences from 92 Polish horses from 13 studs throughout Poland were compared to each other and to three EHV-5 sequences from other countries. Despite the overall high level of conservation, considerable variability was observed around the putative furin cleavage site. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the viruses clustered within two major lineages (A and B), with further sub-clustering within group A. The clustering of EHV-5 sequences was independent of age or geographical origin of the sampled horses. Recombination was identified as one of the factors contributing to the genomic heterogeneity. Viruses from unweaned foals were more similar to viruses from other foals at the same stud than to viruses form their dams, suggesting the horizontal transfer and/or evolution of EHV-5 within individual hosts. Our data indicate that the gB sequence is not suitable for tracking the source of EHV-5 infection. Further research is needed to elucidate the importance of the sequence variability around the EHV-5 gB furin cleavage site on the biology of the virus.","Stasiak, Karol; Dunowska, Magdalena; Trewick, Steven; Rola, Jerzy",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998979/,775

In this study, calves with BRSV-specific maternally derived antibodies were vaccinated once, either with (i) a BRSV pre-fusion protein (PreF) and Montanide(TM) ISA61 VG (ISA61, n = 6), (ii) BRSV lacking the SH gene (ΔSHrBRSV, n = 6), (iii) a commercial vaccine (CV, n = 6), or were injected with ISA61 alone (n = 6). All calves were challenged with BRSV 92 days later and were euthanized 13 days post-infection. Based on clinical, pathological, and proteomic data, all vaccines appeared safe. Compared to the controls, PreF induced the most significant clinical and virological protection post-challenge, followed by ΔSHrBRSV and CV, whereas the protection of PreF-vaccinated calves was correlated with BRSV-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody responses 84 days post-vaccination, and the IgG antibody titers of ΔSHrBRSV- and CV-vaccinated calves did not differ from the controls on this day. Nevertheless, strong anamnestic BRSV- and PreF-specific IgG responses occurred in calves vaccinated with either of the vaccines, following a BRSV challenge. In conclusion, PreF and ΔSHrBRSV are two efficient one-shot candidate vaccines. By inducing a protection for at least three months, they could potentially improve the control of BRSV in calves.","Valarcher, Jean François; Hägglund, Sara; Näslund, Katarina; Jouneau, Luc; Malmström, Ester; Boulesteix, Olivier; Pinard, Anne; Leguéré, Dany; Deslis, Alain; Gauthier, David; Dubuquoy, Catherine; Pietralunga, Vincent; Rémot, Aude; Falk, Alexander; Shevchenko, Ganna; Bergström Lind, Sara; Von Brömssen, Claudia; Vargmar, Karin; Zhang, Baoshan; Kwong, Peter D.; Rodriguez, María Jose; Garcia Duran, Marga; Schwartz-Cornil, Isabelle; Taylor, Geraldine; Riffault, Sabine",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001206/,775

52582,"Cefixime: Thrombocytopenia, oral erosions and petechiae: case report",2021-05-08,"Background: Hypopituitarism refers to complete or partial insufficiency of pituitary hormone secretion and patients require lifelong hormone replacement. Those with ACTH deficiency rely on exogenous glucocorticoids and at times of intercurrent illness require stress doses to prevent an adrenal crisis. The benefits and adverse effects of corticosteroids for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia are currently under investigation. We report our experience in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia who received high dose corticosteroids for panhypopituitarism. Clinical Case: A 51-year-old man presented with one-week history of fever and generalized weakness. He had been diagnosed with a non-functional pituitary macro-adenoma causing panhypopituitarism 1 year ago when he developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He underwent trans-sphenoidal resection of the pituitary adenoma. However, he then discontinued his hormonal therapy and was lost to follow up. He had postural hypotension but was not tachypneic or hypoxemic. He tested positive for COVID-19 and chest x-ray showed prominent bilateral broncho-vascular markings; he was hospitalized as mild COVID-19 pneumonia. Laboratory investigations revealed secondary adrenal insufficiency, secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. MRI of the pituitary now showed persistence of the pituitary macroadenoma, measuring 3.5 x 3.7 x 2.4 cm in dimensions, causing sellar obliteration and left cavernous sinus invasion. Treatment with stress dose steroids, Hydrocortisone 50 mg 4 times daily was initiated, followed by thyroid hormone replacement with Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily. He also received antivirals and supportive care for COVID-19, guided by local hospital protocol. After significant clinical improvement, steroids were tapered down and he was discharged on a maintenance dose of 20 mg hydrocortisone per day in divided doses. The patient was stable at outpatient follow up after one month. He was started on testosterone replacement for erectile dysfunction due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. He was offered surgery for complete resection of the residual pituitary adenoma, but he declined and preferred to continue medical therapy. Conclusion: Hypopituitarism is associated with significant morbidity and premature mortality, a key risk factor being cortisol deficiency. Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening medical emergency and remains an important cause of death in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These patients are also vulnerable to develop severe complications from COVID-19 infection due to the absence of normal cortisol responses to stress. Despite receiving stress dose corticosteroids, this high-risk patient recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia without complications. These findings support the use of corticosteroids when necessary for treatment of coexisting conditions in patients with COVID-19.","Karuppasamy, Gowri; Alamer, Zaina Abdelhalim; Rose, Samman; Al-Janahi, Ibrahim Abdulla",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090643/,775
53657,AZD-1222: Brain haemorrhage: case report,2021-05-29,"The current study sought to investigate the joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on child nutritional status in sub-Saharan Africa. Data in the children’s files of 31 sub-Saharan African countries were pooled from the Demographic and Health Surveys collected between 2010 and 2019. The outcome variables were three child anthropometrics: stunting (height-for-age z-scores); wasting (weight-for-height z-scores); and underweight (weight-for-age z-scores). The joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on child nutritional status was examined using multilevel regression models. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) at p < 0.05. The percentages of children who were stunted, wasted and underweight in the 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were 31%, 8% and 17%, respectively. On the joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on stunting, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who use unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who use clean household cooking fuel, and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be stunted. With wasting, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking fuel were more likely to be wasted compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel. With underweight, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who used clean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be underweight. It is imperative for the governments of the 31 sub-Saharan African countries to double their efforts to end the use of unclean household cooking fuel. This goal could be achieved by promoting clean household cooking fuel (e.g., electricity, gas, ethanol, solar, etc.) through effective health education, and promotion programmes. The attention of policymakers is drawn to the urgent need for children’s nutritional status policies and programmes (e.g., dietary supplementation, increasing dietary diversity, improving agriculture and food security) to be targeted towards at-risk sub-populations (i.e., single mothered households).","Amadu, Iddrisu; Seidu, Abdul-Aziz; Duku, Eric; Okyere, Joshua; Hagan, John Elvis; Hormenu, Thomas; Ahinkorah, Bright Opoku",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147609/,775
54319,Aspirin/heparin: Intracerebral haemorrhage: case report,2021-06-12,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) is the focus of the catecholaldehyde hypothesis for the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease and other Lewy body diseases. The catecholaldehyde is produced via oxidative deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase (MAO) acting on cytoplasmic dopamine. DOPAL is autotoxic, in that it can harm the same cells in which it is produced. Normally, DOPAL is detoxified by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-mediated conversion to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), which rapidly exits the neurons. Genetic, environmental, or drug-induced manipulations of ALDH that build up DOPAL promote catecholaminergic neurodegeneration. A concept derived from the catecholaldehyde hypothesis imputes deleterious interactions between DOPAL and the protein alpha-synuclein (αS), a major component of Lewy bodies. DOPAL potently oligomerizes αS, and αS oligomers impede vesicular and mitochondrial functions, shifting the fate of cytoplasmic dopamine toward the MAO-catalyzed formation of DOPAL—destabilizing vicious cycles. Direct and indirect effects of DOPAL and of DOPAL-induced misfolded proteins could “freeze” intraneuronal reactions, plasticity of which is required for neuronal homeostasis. The extent to which DOPAL toxicity is mediated by interactions with αS, and vice versa, is poorly understood. Because of numerous secondary effects such as augmented spontaneous oxidation of dopamine by MAO inhibition, there has been insufficient testing of the catecholaldehyde hypothesis in animal models. The clinical pathophysiological significance of genetics, emotional stress, environmental agents, and interactions with numerous proteins relevant to the catecholaldehyde hypothesis are matters for future research. The imposing complexity of intraneuronal catecholamine metabolism seems to require a computational modeling approach to elucidate clinical pathogenetic mechanisms and devise pathophysiology-based, individualized treatments.","Goldstein, David S.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199574/,775

55696,Olanzapine: Polyuria and polydipsia: case report,2021-07-10,"Pigs are a valuable human biomedical model and an important protein source supporting global food security. The transcriptomes of peripheral blood immune cells in pigs were defined at the bulk cell-type and single cell levels. First, eight cell types were isolated in bulk from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by cell sorting, representing Myeloid, NK cells and specific populations of T and B-cells. Transcriptomes for each bulk population of cells were generated by RNA-seq with 10,974 expressed genes detected. Pairwise comparisons between cell types revealed specific expression, while enrichment analysis identified 1,885 to 3,591 significantly enriched genes across all 8 cell types. Gene Ontology analysis for the top 25% of significantly enriched genes (SEG) showed high enrichment of biological processes related to the nature of each cell type. Comparison of gene expression indicated highly significant correlations between pig cells and corresponding human PBMC bulk RNA-seq data available in Haemopedia. Second, higher resolution of distinct cell populations was obtained by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBMC. Seven PBMC samples were partitioned and sequenced that produced 28,810 single cell transcriptomes distributed across 36 clusters and classified into 13 general cell types including plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC), conventional DCs, monocytes, B-cell, conventional CD4 and CD8 αβ T-cells, NK cells, and γδ T-cells. Signature gene sets from the human Haemopedia data were assessed for relative enrichment in genes expressed in pig cells and integration of pig scRNA-seq with a public human scRNA-seq dataset provided further validation for similarity between human and pig data. The sorted porcine bulk RNAseq dataset informed classification of scRNA-seq PBMC populations; specifically, an integration of the datasets showed that the pig bulk RNAseq data helped define the CD4CD8 double-positive T-cell populations in the scRNA-seq data. Overall, the data provides deep and well-validated transcriptomic data from sorted PBMC populations and the first single-cell transcriptomic data for porcine PBMCs. This resource will be invaluable for annotation of pig genes controlling immunogenetic traits as part of the porcine Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) project, as well as further study of, and development of new reagents for, porcine immunology.","Herrera-Uribe, Juber; Wiarda, Jayne E.; Sivasankaran, Sathesh K.; Daharsh, Lance; Liu, Haibo; Byrne, Kristen A.; Smith, Timothy P.

Cependant, l’efficacité de la réponse vaccinale anti-SARS-CoV-2 reste peu étudiée dans cette population. DESCRIPTION: L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer la réponse humorale au vaccin BNT162b2, et les facteurs associés à la réponse vaccinale chez des patients traités par hémodialyse (HD) et par dialyse péritonéale (DP). MÉTHODES: Cette étude rétrospective a inclus 85 patients (n = 45 HD, n = 40 DP), ayant reçu deux doses du vaccin BNT162b2. La réponse vaccinale était évaluée par le titre d’anticorps anti-protéine spike, dosé au moins 10 jours après la deuxième dose vaccinale. Un titre d’anticorps anti-spike inférieur à 0,8 UI/mL correspondait à une non-réponse et un titre inférieur au 10(e) percentile (< 10 UI/mL) était considéré comme une faible réponse vaccinale. RÉSULTATS: L’âge médian était de 66 ans [intervalle interquartile : 54 ; 77] et 64,7 % étaient des hommes. Après un délai médian de 50 jours [29 ; 58], le titre médian d’anticorps anti-spike était de 250 UI/mL [87 ; 250]. Cinq (5,9 %) patients étaient non-répondeurs et 11 (12,9 %) étaient faiblement répondeurs. La réponse vaccinale n’était pas différente selon la modalité de dialyse (91,2 % en HD, 97,5 % en DP). En analyse multivariée, les facteurs associés à une plus faible réponse vaccinale étaient l’âge (β par année supplémentaire : −1,50 [IC95 % : −2,88 ; −0,13], p = 0,03), une immunosuppression (β : −52,71 [−99,59 ; −5,84], p = 0,03), le statut nutritionnel (β pour l’augmentation d’1 g/L de l’albuminémie : 3,89 [0,08 ; 7,70], p = 0,045). CONCLUSION: La réponse vaccinale n’était pas différente selon la modalité de dialyse.

60649,Histology and immunohistochemistry of severe inflammatory bowel disease versus lymphoma in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo).,2016,"INTRODUCTION Conventional two-dimensional (2D) laparoscopy systems have the drawback of poor depth perception and spatial orientation. Three-dimensional (3D) laparoscopic systems have stereoscopic vision in which depth perception is achieved by different unique images received by each eye. We evaluated 3D laparoscopy in comparison with conventional 2D laparoscopy in urological procedures in a prospective randomized study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Over a 19 month study period, 108 patients scheduled to undergo various urological procedures were randomized to either conventional 2D or 3D laparoscopy (2D n = 53; 3D n = 55). A single senior surgeon performed all the surgeries. Parameters such as total operative time, dissection and suturing time, blood loss, hospital stay, complications (Clavien-Dindo), and visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain were assessed. The subjective assessment of the operating surgeon of superiority and inferiority of either technology on parameters defining surgical skills was recorded using a Likert scale. RESULTS The total operative time (P < 0.0003), blood loss (P < 0.028), dissection, suturing and stenting time (P < 0.0001), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults score (P < 0.0001) was significantly in favor of 3D laparoscopy. CONCLUSION Our study showed significant advantages of the 3D system over 2D laparoscopy. These advantages include enhanced operative performance and greater surgeon comfort.","Patankar, Suresh B; Padasalagi, Gururaj R",Indian journal of urology : IJU : journal of the Urological Society of India,https://doi.org/10.4103/iju.iju_418_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717274/,775
62761,Validation of a radioimmunoassay of serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity in ferrets.,2018,"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a new scenario for dental practice, and teledentistry (TD) is a field of relevance for dentists. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the knowledge, practices, and expectations of dentists toward TD and its association with sociodemographic variables. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was administered to dentists in Colombia as part of global research on the impact of COVID-19 on dentistry. The core questionnaire included 5 additional questions on TD that were added by the Colombian research team in 5 domains about TD: Q1, knowledge; Q2, practices; Q3, expectations; Q4, usefulness; and Q5, reimbursement. Sociodemographic variables were also measured. The questionnaire was validated in a pilot test and administered via digital media. Descriptive and bivariate analysis for sociodemographic and TD variables were done. For the evaluation of the chances of a determined answer, an ordinal multinomial logistic regression (Q1 and Q2) and binomial logistic regression (Q3 and Q5) analyses were made. RESULTS In total, 5,370 dentists answered the survey (women: 3,878; mean age: 45 y). The response rate of the survey was 16.84%. Knowledge and practice of TD before the COVID-19 pandemic were both low (25.75% and 12.42%, respectively); however, since the beginning of the current pandemic, knowledge increased by 62.72% and practice by 42.53%. Some 93.1% of respondents considered that TD could be useful in their clinical practice, and 59.55% would consider practicing it after the pandemic. A high number of dentists (88.58%) did not charge for these services. Logistic regressions showed significant differences according to sociodemographic variables. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has had a great impact on TD, increasing knowledge and practice significantly. Dentists expect to continue practicing TD in the future. However, some geographical, technological, and attitudinal barriers need to be broken down to increase daily use of TD. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT This article provides an overview about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the knowledge and attitudes about teledentistry (TD) in general dentists and both clinical and nonclinical specialists. Although some barriers to the use of TD continue, this pandemic brought with it a new scenario for dental practice, which must be implemented through training for professionals to increase its use.","Plaza-Ruíz, S P; Barbosa-Liz, D M; Agudelo-Suárez, A A",JDR clinical and translational research,https://doi.org/10.1177/2380084421998632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632011/,775

However, some patients may experience a worsened arrhythmia phenotype after ablation. We aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of arrhythmia exacerbation (AE) after post-infarction VT ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS A total of 1187 consecutive patients (93% men, median age 68 years, median ejection fraction 30%) who underwent post-infarction VT ablation at six centres were included. Arrhythmia exacerbation was defined as post-ablation VT storm or incessant VT in patients without prior similar events. During follow-up (median 717 days), 426 (36%) patients experienced VT recurrence. Events qualifying as AE occurred in 67 patients (6%). Median times to VT recurrence with and without AE were 238 [interquartile range (IQR) 35-640] days and 135 (IQR 22-521) days, respectively (P = 0.25). Almost half of the patients (46%) who experienced AE experienced it within 6 months of the index procedure. Patients with AE had had longer ablation times during the ablation procedures compared to the rest of the patients (median 42 vs. 34 min, P = 0.02). Among patients with VT recurrence, the risk of death or heart transplantation was significantly higher in patients with than without AE (hazard ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.28-3.10; P = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender, ejection fraction, cardiac resynchronization therapy, post-ablation non-inducibility, and post-ablation amiodarone use. CONCLUSION Arrhythmia exacerbation after ablation of infarct-related VT is infrequent but is independently associated with an adverse long-term outcome among patients who experience a VT recurrence. The mechanisms and mitigation strategies of AE after catheter ablation require further investigation.","Siontis, Konstantinos C; Kim, Hyungjin M; Vergara, Pasquale; Peretto, Giovanni; Do, Duc H; de Riva, Marta; Lam, Anna; Qian, Pierre; Yokokawa, Miki; Jongnarangsin, Krit; Latchamsetty, Rakesh; Jais, Pierre; Sacher, Fred; Tedrow, Usha; Shivkumar, Kalyanam; Zeppenfeld, Katja; Della Bella, Paolo; Stevenson, William G; Morady, Fred; Bogun, Frank M","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830247/,775
66312,Proposed grading scheme for inflammatory bowel disease in ferrets and correlation with clinical signs.,2019-12-30,"BACKGROUND Underrepresented minority (URM) cancer survivors experience disparities in mortality and quality of life, compared with non-Hispanic whites. Disparities are associated with poor social determinants of health, enhanced by mistrust of the healthcare system. Trust can be facilitated by provider-patient racial/ethnic concordance, yet URM survivors rarely experience concordance. Effective health communication is needed for this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the composition and utility of health education videos among adult URM survivors. METHODS Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and CINAHL databases. Articles that included adult URM cancer survivor samples and either described or tested a video intervention aimed to improve health outcomes were included. Two researchers independently screened articles for inclusion and quality appraisal and abstracted and synthesized relevant data to identify themes. RESULTS Eight articles, detailing 7 independent studies, met inclusion criteria. Quality appraisal of the included studies was fair to good. Six themes were identified: (1) video development with stakeholders, (2) focus on designing culturally appropriate videos, (3) in-clinic video delivery, (4) video intervention effects, (5) provider and URM survivors support video interventions, and (6) building trust through personal stories. CONCLUSIONS Video interventions are well received by URMs and improve outcomes yet are underutilized. More rigorous studies are warranted to develop best practices for video development and application. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Videos serve as an easy, effective tool to achieve favorable outcomes in the care of URM survivors.","Hirschey, Rachel; Bryant, Ashley Leak; Walker, Jennifer S; Nolan, Timiya S",Cancer nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/ncc.0000000000000829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32467430/,775
66578,Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: Evolution and public health.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Bilateral axillo-breast approach (BABA) robotic thyroidectomy (RT) is proven to be a feasible method for the treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancers in terms of oncology as well as cosmesis. However, BABA RT causes postoperative sternal discomfort and needs an incision over the nipple areolar area. Here, we suggest a novel robotic surgical technique for thyroid surgery that does not need a breast incision-bilateral axillary approach (BAA). PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited 51 patients who were willing to undergo the novel BAA robotic thyroid surgery. We performed a propensity score-matched analysis to compare the BAA robotic thyroid surgery group (BAA group) with the conventional open thyroid surgery group (open group). RESULTS Mean operation time in the BAA group (129.7 min) was significantly longer than that in the open group (103.1 min) (p < 0.001). However, no significant differences in the mean number of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), mean number of retrieved LNs, vocal cord palsy, hypoparathyroidism, and mean stimulated thyroglobulin level were observed between the two groups. There was no case of postoperative bleeding or chyle leak. Of the 51 patients who had undergone the BAA procedure, 27 patients answered the questionnaire. The mean scale, ranging from 0 to 10, at postoperative 1 day/2 weeks was as follows: voice change score, 3.0/1.6; swallowing difficulty score, 4.0/2.0; anterior neck pain score, 4.6/3.6; anterior neck numbness score, 5.4/4.3; right chest pain score, 3.8/2.1; left chest pain score, 3.6/2.3; right chest numbness score, 3.2/2.8; left chest numbness score, 2.4/2.7; right breast pain score, 0.9/0; left breast pain score, 1.2/0; right breast numbness score, 1.7/0; and left breast numbness score, 2.6/0, respectively. CONCLUSION BAA robotic thyroid surgery is a novel, safe, and feasible oncoplastic method, especially for patients who have fear of procedures around the nipple areolar complex.","Woo, Jung-Woo; Kim, Seo Ki; Park, Inhye; Choe, Jun Ho; Kim, Jung-Han; Kim, Jee Soo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5018-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27317039/,775

We then study the effect of a perfect unilateral exit screening programme. Finally, we compare numerically the effects of using different incidence functions for infection within and while travelling between patches, and find that using mass action incidence to model infection during transport has the effect of maintaining disease prevalence at a higher level compared with when standard incidence is used.","Arino, Julien; Sun, Chengjun; Yang, Wei",Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA,https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqv001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25678683/,775
68617,"Acute bovine viral diarrhea associated with extensive mucosal lesions, high morbidity, and mortality in a commercial feedlot.",2012,"We report the case of a 49-year-old man with underlying hypertension who developed diplopia lasting 2 months. Magnetic resonance imaging and digital subtraction angiography showed multi-lobular unruptured aneurysms in the P2 portion of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) migrating into the interpeduncular cistern of the midbrain. Because the shapes of the aneurysms were serpentine fusiform and the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) was the fetal type, we planned anastomosis of the occipital artery to the P4 portion of the PCA followed by endovascular obliteration of the parent artery including the aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was performed via a femoral approach one week after the anastomosis. Super-selective balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the PCoA was performed by using an occlusion balloon microcatheter before endovascular treatment. Occlusion of the proximal segment of the PCoA induced disturbance of consciousness of the patient. Occlusion of the distal segment other than the first point of the PCoA did not induce any neurological symptoms. The information from this super-selective BTO helped us to perform precise endovascular obliteration. The aneurysm was successfully obliterated, and the diplopia almost disappeared in a few months. Super-selective BTO of the PCoA might be a useful method for preventing ischemic complications due to occlusion of invisible perforators.","Isozaki, Makoto; Arai, Hiroshi; Neishi, Hiroyuki; Kitai, Ryuhei; Kikuta, Ken-Ichiro",NMC case report journal,https://doi.org/10.2176/nmccrj.cr.2016-0096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664014/,775

Different implementation strategies have been developed to support the implementation of interventions in routine care; however, the implementation of complex interventions remains challenging. The aim of our reviews is to identify promising strategies for, significant facilitators of and barriers to the implementation of evidence-based interventions for very common dementia care phenomena: (A) behaviour that challenges supporting a person with dementia in long-term care, (B) delirium in acute care and (C) the postacute care needs of people with dementia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct one scoping review for each preselected dementia care phenomenon (A, B and C). For this, three literature searches will be carried out in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINAHL (via EBSCO) and PsycINFO (via EBSCO). Additionally, we will perform backward and forward citation tracking via reference lists and Google Scholar. Identified records will be independently screened by two reviewers (title/abstract and full text) using the defined inclusion criteria.

METHODS The Arizona Department of Health Services convened and facilitated 4 meetings during 4 months with a workgroup comprising the deans and curriculum representatives of all 18 medical, osteopathic, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, dental, podiatry, and naturopathic programs in Arizona. During this collaborative and iterative process, the workgroup reviewed existing curricula, established a philosophical framework, and developed a flexible and practical structure for a curriculum that would suit the needs of all program types. RESULTS The Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum was finalized in June 2018. The curriculum aims to redefine pain and addiction as multidimensional public health issues and is structured as 10 core components, each supported by a detailed set of evidence-based objectives. The curriculum includes a set of annual metrics to collect from both programs (focused on implementation progress and barriers) and learners (focused on knowledge, attitudes, and practice plans). CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first example of a statewide collaboration among diverse health professional education programs to create a single, standard curriculum. This collaborative process and the nonproprietary Arizona Pain and Addiction Curriculum may serve as a useful template for other states to enhance pain and addiction education.","Villarroel, Lisa; Mardian, Aram S; Christ, Cara; Rehman, Shakaib",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920954505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962529/,775

Here we report the first LDRH performed in mainland China and review current literature, focusing on perioperative donor evaluation and surgical procedure to secure donor safety. METHODS A 47-year-old man volunteered for living donation to his wife who suffered from sclerosing cholangitis-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Donor height is 165 cm and weight is 65 kg, whereas the body mass index is 23.9. The CT volume evaluation showed that the graft-to-body weight ratio was 1.42%, and the remnant liver volume was 36.3% for right graft without middle hepatic vein (MHV). The anatomy of hepatic vein, artery, portal vein, and bile duct was normal. Preoperative liver function tests were normal. RESULTS Intraoperative biopsy result showed minimal steatosis. A transection was performed along the right side of the MHV. Two branches of MHV (V5 and V8) were <5 mm in diameter, and there was no need for reconstruction in the back table. Hilar dissection was meticulously performed. Right portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct were transected above the bifurcation. The right hepatic vein was transected by a laparoscopic linear stapler. The real graft volume was 660 mL, with a revised graft-to-body weight ratio of 1.14%. Warm ischemia time was about 4 minutes. The donor's postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS Total LDRH has been proven to be technically feasible in selected adult donors.

80359,Switchover phenomenon induced by epidemic seeding on geometric networks.,2021-10-12,"BACKGROUND The Andago is a rehabilitation robot that allows training walking over-ground while providing bodyweight unloading (BWU). We investigated the practicability, acceptability, and appropriateness of the device in children with gait impairments undergoing neurorehabilitation. Concerning appropriateness, we investigated whether (i) stride-to-stride variability of the stride time and inter-joint coordination was higher when walking over-ground in Andago versus treadmill walking, and (ii) activation of antigravity leg muscles decreased with higher levels of BWU. METHODS Eighteen children and adolescents with gait impairments participated in three sessions. Practicability was assessed by determining the time needed to get a patient in and out of Andago, the accuracy of the BWU system, and other aspects. Acceptability was assessed by patients responding to questions, while six therapists filled out the System Usability Scale. To determine appropriateness, the participants were equipped with surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes, electrogoniometers and accelerometers. Various parameters were compared between walking over-ground and on a treadmill, and between walking with three different levels of BWU (median: 20%, 35% and 50% of the bodyweight) over-ground. RESULTS Practicability: the average time needed to get in and out of Andago amounted to 60 s and 16 s, respectively. The BWU system seemed accurate, especially at higher levels. We experienced no technical difficulties and Andago prevented 12 falls. However, participants had difficulties walking through a door without bumping into it. Acceptability: after the second session, nine participants felt safer walking in Andago compared to normal walking, 15 preferred walking in Andago compared to treadmill walking, and all wanted to train again with Andago. Therapists rated the usability of the Andago as excellent. Appropriateness: stride-to-stride variability of stride duration and inter-joint coordination was higher in Andago compared to treadmill walking. sEMG activity was not largely influenced by the levels of BWU investigated in this study, except for a reduced M. Gluteus Medius activity at the highest level of BWU tested. CONCLUSIONS The Andago is a practical and well-accepted device to train walking over-ground with BWU in children and adolescents with gait impairments safely. The system allows individual stride-to-stride variability of temporospatial gait parameters without affecting antigravity muscle activity strongly.

81639,An efficient peptide-based ELISA for differentiating fowl adenovirus 4-infected chickens from vaccinated chickens.,2021-04-15,"Muscle atrophy arises from a multiplicity of physio-pathological situations and has very detrimental consequences for the whole body. Although knowledge of muscle atrophy mechanisms keeps growing, there is still no proven treatment to date. This study aimed at identifying new drivers for muscle atrophy resistance. We selected an innovative approach that compares muscle transcriptome between an original model of natural resistance to muscle atrophy, the hibernating brown bear, and a classical model of induced atrophy, the unloaded mouse. Using RNA sequencing, we identified 4415 differentially expressed genes, including 1746 up- and 2369 down-regulated genes, in bear muscles between the active versus hibernating period. We focused on the Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β and the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways, respectively, involved in muscle mass loss and maintenance. TGF-β- and BMP-related genes were overall down- and up-regulated in the non-atrophied muscles of the hibernating bear, respectively, and the opposite occurred for the atrophied muscles of the unloaded mouse. This was further substantiated at the protein level. Our data suggest TGF-β/BMP balance is crucial for muscle mass maintenance during long-term physical inactivity in the hibernating bear. Thus, concurrent activation of the BMP pathway may potentiate TGF-β inhibiting therapies already targeted to prevent muscle atrophy.","Cussonneau, Laura; Boyer, Christian; Brun, Charlotte; Deval, Christiane; Loizon, Emmanuelle; Meugnier, Emmanuelle; Gueret, Elise; Dubois, Emeric; Taillandier, Daniel; Polge, Cécile; Béchet, Daniel; Gauquelin-Koch, Guillemette; Evans, Alina L; Arnemo, Jon M; Swenson, Jon E; Blanc, Stéphane; Simon, Chantal; Lefai, Etienne; Bertile, Fabrice; Combaret, Lydie",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10081873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34440643/,775

RECENT FINDINGS This review discusses the increasing spectrum of opportunistic infections in the ICH, the general approach for early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infections in this population, and the current and novel diagnostic modalities available to establish a rapid and specific microbiologic diagnosis, focusing on recent controversies and advances. SUMMARY Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of effective therapy for infection help reduce morbidity in ICHs. Advances in diagnostic assays using nonculture-based methods, such as nucleic acid amplification, may allow for earlier targeted therapy. Invasive procedures including bronchoscopy and biopsy remain essential and should be vigorously pursued in ICHs given the broad differential diagnosis of possible pulmonary pathogens in this population, and the need to establish a specific diagnosis to allow accurate targeted therapy.","Letourneau, Alyssa R; Issa, Nicolas C; Baden, Lindsey R",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24626236/,775

Objective To compare the lifetime benefits and costs of high- versus low-intensity surveillance. Design Microsimulation model. Data Sources U.S. cancer registry, cost data, and published literature. Target Population U.S. patients aged 50, 60, or 70 years with low-risk adenomas (LRAs) (1 to 2 small adenomas) or high-risk adenomas (HRAs) (3 to 10 small adenomas or ≥1 large adenoma) removed after screening with colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT). Time Horizon Lifetime. Perspective Societal. Intervention No further screening or surveillance, routine screening after 10 years, low-intensity surveillance (10 years after LRA removal and 5 years after HRA removal), and high-intensity surveillance (5 years after LRA removal and 3 years after HRA removal). Outcome Measures Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results of Base-Case Analysis Without surveillance or screening, lifetime CRC incidence for patients aged 50 years was 10.9% after LRA removal and 17.2% after HRA removal at screening colonoscopy. Subsequent colonoscopic screening, low-intensity surveillance, or high-intensity surveillance decreased incidence by 39%, 46% to 48%, and 55% to 56%, respectively. Incidence of CRC and surveillance benefits were higher for adenomas detected at FIT screening and lower for older patients. High-intensity surveillance cost less than $30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with low-intensity surveillance. Results of Sensitivity Analysis High-intensity surveillance cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained in most alternative scenarios for adenoma recurrence, CRC incidence, longevity, quality of life, screening ages, surveillance ages, test performance, disutilities, and cost. Limitation Few surveillance outcome data exist. Conclusion The model suggests that high-intensity surveillance as recommended in the United States provides modest but clinically relevant benefits over low-intensity surveillance at acceptable cost.

The mean (standard deviation) active ranges of motion of two interphalangeal joints of the fingers were 98° (40) and 114° (45) at 8 weeks postoperatively and at the last follow-up (mean 7 months, range 3-98), respectively. Using the Strickland criteria, 'excellent' or 'good' function was obtained in 95 (30%) out of 322 fingers at 8 weeks and 107 (48%) out of 225 fingers at the last follow-up. A total of 48 (13%) fingers required reoperation because of rupture, adhesion, contracture or other complications. The prevalence of rupture was 4%. We carried out multiple linear regression analysis to identify the predictors of the active digital motion. The following variables were found as negative predictors: age; smoking; injury localization between subzones 1C and 2C; injury to the little finger; the extent of soft tissue damage; concomitant skeletal injury; delay to surgery; use of a 2-strand Kessler repair technique; attempted suture or preservation of the tendon sheath-pulley system; and resecting or leaving the concomitant superficial flexor tendon cuts untreated.

91620,Outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 in the southwestern United States: first detections in southern California.,2021-04-02,"Retroelements are important evolutionary forces but can be deleterious if left uncontrolled. Members of the human APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases can inhibit a wide range of endogenous, as well as exogenous, retroelements. These enzymes are structurally organized in one or two domains comprising a zinc-coordinating motif. APOBEC3G contains two such domains, only the C terminal of which is endowed with editing activity, while its N-terminal counterpart binds RNA, promotes homo-oligomerization, and is necessary for packaging into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. Here, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis-based analysis of the APOBEC3G N terminus, testing mutants for (i) inhibition of vif-defective HIV-1 infection and Alu retrotransposition, (ii) RNA binding, and (iii) oligomerization. Furthermore, in the absence of structural information on this domain, we used homology modeling to examine the positions of functionally important residues and of residues found to be under positive selection by phylogenetic analyses of primate APOBEC3G genes. Our results reveal the importance of a predicted RNA binding dimerization interface both for packaging into HIV-1 virions and inhibition of both HIV-1 infection and Alu transposition. We further found that the HIV-1-blocking activity of APOBEC3G N-terminal mutants defective for packaging can be almost entirely rescued if their virion incorporation is forced by fusion with Vpr, indicating that the corresponding region of APOBEC3G plays little role in other aspects of its action against this pathogen. Interestingly, residues forming the APOBEC3G dimer interface are highly conserved, contrasting with the rapid evolution of two neighboring surface-exposed amino acid patches, one targeted by the Vif protein of primate lentiviruses and the other of yet-undefined function.","Bulliard, Yannick; Turelli, Priscilla; Röhrig, Ute F; Zoete, Vincent; Mangeat, Bastien; Michielin, Olivier; Trono, Didier",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01491-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19776130/,775

Now, mobile X-ray examinations are also used outside the hospital. The literature describes that fragile patients may benefit from mobile X-ray, but we need to provide insights into the breadth, depth and gaps in a body of literature. METHODS The scoping review was performed by searching PubMed, Cinahl, Embase, EconLit and Health Technology Assessment. English-, Danish-, Norwegian-, German-, Italian-, French- and Swedish-language studies, published 1.1.2009-1.5.2020 about mobile X-ray outside the hospital were included. Participants were patients examined using mobile X-ray as the intervention. PRISMA was used when eligible to build up the review. To extract data from the selected articles, we used a structured summary table. RESULTS We included 12 studies in this scoping review. The results were divided into four topics:1. Target population 2. Population health 3. Experience of care and 4. Cost effectiveness. The main findings are that target population could be larger for instance including hospice patients for palliative care, group dwelling for people with intellectual disabilities, or psychiatric patients, population health may be improved, image quality seems to be good and mobile X-ray may be cost effective. Limitations of language, databases and grey literature may have resulted in studies being missed. CONCLUSIONS Mobile X-ray may be used outside hospital. There seems to be potential benefits to both patients and health care staff. Based on the published studies it is not possible to draw a final conclusion if mobile X-ray examination is a relevant diagnostic offer and for whom. Further studies are needed to assess the feasibility of use in fragile patients, also regarding staff, relatives and societal consequences and therefore the topic mobile X-ray needs more research.","Toppenberg, Maria Dietz; Christiansen, Thomas Erik Møller; Rasmussen, Finn; Nielsen, Camilla Palmhøj; Damsgaard, Else Marie",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05564-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814588/,775

The molecular clocks driving circadian rhythmic changes are based on intertwined transcriptional/translational feedback loops that combine with a range of environmental and metabolic stimuli to generate daily internal programing. Understanding how biological rhythms are generated throughout the body and the reasons for their dysregulation can provide avenues for temporally directed therapeutics. Summary In recent years, microRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of the circadian clock, particularly in Drosophila, but also in some small animal and human studies. This review will summarize our current understanding of the role of miRNAs during clock regulation, with a particular focus on the control of clock regulated gene expression.","Ma, Qianwen; Mo, Genlin; Tan, Yong",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394254/,775

PURPOSE This work was undertaken to evaluate, using subjective questionnaires and clinical and radiographical scores, patients who underwent an arthroscopically assisted meniscal allograft transplantation with a minimum follow-up between 5 and 15 years (range, 62-169 months). STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Demographic data of 49 patients (50 meniscal allograft transplantations) were collected. At the latest follow-up visit, the authors collected preoperative and follow-up Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm, Tegner, and Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain for comparison. Patients were also evaluated with a standardized clinical examination of the knee to objectively evaluate knee-related symptoms. Standard weightbearing radiographs and a full-leg standing radiograph were performed to evaluate the progression of osteoarthritis and malalignment. RESULTS Five patients underwent total knee replacement and were considered failures, 8 patients could only be contacted by phone, and 2 patients were lost to follow-up, so 34 patients underwent the complete study protocol (except for 1 patient who did not have a radiographical evaluation because of pregnancy). The study group consisted of 18 men and 16 women, with a mean age of 33 years at the moment of transplantation and with an average follow-up of 8 years and 9 months. There were only a few concomitant procedures. There was a significant (P < .001) and clinically relevant decrease in the VAS (7 to 3.4) and increase in KOOS (35.8 to 60.2), Lysholm (39.7 to 71.8), and total SF-36 (51.5 to 75.2) from preoperative mean score to postoperative mean score. This improvement stayed consistent during the follow-up period. Despite this improvement, there was no increase in Tegner activity level (P = .604). The more severe the osteoarthritis, the less the improvement. There was a significant (P < .001) increase in osteoarthritis in 42% of the patients (14 of 33), as scored following the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. When strictly respecting the indications, there was no significant correlation between preoperative cartilage damage, preoperative osteoarthritis, alignment deviation, gender, and body mass index and the outcome scores or improvement. In this series, with few concomitant procedures, there was no difference in outcome between medial and lateral transplants. CONCLUSION Meniscal allograft transplantation may result in important pain relief and functional improvement in patients with a history of (sub)total meniscectomy and pain localized in the affected compartment. Strictly following the indications, meniscal transplantation can give good and predictable results. In 58% of patients, there was no increase in osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification. In 42%, there was a slight or moderate increase in osteoarthritis. No severe increase was noted.","Vundelinckx, Bart; Bellemans, Johan; Vanlauwe, Johan",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546510375399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724642/,775

We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows the outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for neoplasia. METHODS We collected data on 335 patients with BE and neoplasia (72% with HGD, 24% with intramucosal cancer, 4% with low-grade dysplasia [mean age, 69 years; 81% male]), treated at 19 centers in the United Kingdom from July 2008 through August 2012. Mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Patients' nodules were removed by endoscopic mucosal resection, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until all areas of BE were ablated or cancer developed. Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD, dysplasia, and BE were assessed. RESULTS HGD was cleared from 86% of patients, all dysplasia from 81%, and BE from 62% at the 12-month time point, after a mean of 2.5 (range, 2-6) RFA procedures. Complete reversal dysplasia was 15% less likely for every 1-cm increment in BE length (odds ratio = 1.156; SE = 0.048; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.26; P < .001). Endoscopic mucosal resection before RFA did not provide any benefit. Invasive cancer developed in 10 patients (3%) by the 12-month time point and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months. Symptomatic strictures developed in 9% of patients and were treated by endoscopic dilatation. Nineteen months after therapy began, 94% of patients remained clear of dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the United Kingdom who underwent RFA for BE-related neoplasia and found that by 12 months after treatment, dysplasia was cleared from 81%.

The BMT pharmacist is a clinical oncology pharmacist with experience and specialized training in hematological cancers and BMT patient care. Only pediatrics patients with beta thalassemia major and those who were on chemotherapy treatment and post-transplant patient were included in this study. RESULTS During the five months' tenure, there were 1820 pediatric patients' visits in total. The clinical oncology pharmacist performed 980 direct patient interviews and documented 1665 pharmacist interventions. The majority of the documented clinical oncology pharmacist interventions were review of medication histories (n: 404, 24%) and ""deferiprone"" dose adjustments (n:400, 24%). Genomic profiling interventions were also among the commonly reported activities by the clinical oncology pharmacist. For beta thalassemia patients undergoing hydroxyurea therapy, the genomic profiling was performed to assess whether the hydroxyurea treatment is clinically effective or not (n:396, 23%). CONCLUSION The involvement of clinical oncology pharmacist into a specialized outpatient clinic of hematology-oncology and transplant clinic plays an integral role in minimizing the adverse effect and reduction in readmission into the hospital. This is new expansion of pharmacist's role especially in underdeveloped country, considering the relevant clinical participation of clinical oncology pharmacist into specialized clinic revealing through optimized therapy and future prospect of clinical oncology pharmacist in pediatric hematology.","Ali, Kashif; Al-Quteimat, Osama; Naseem, Rida; Malhi, Saima Mehmood; Wajdi, Mehwish; Jahan, Noor; Ansari, Saqib Hussain; Shamsi, Tahir Sultan",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220934167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633660/,775
107790,"Infections and pathology of free-roaming backyard chickens on St. Kitts, West Indies.",2019,"PURPOSE Balloon-assisted coiling (BAC) has made the treatment of aneurysms with complex shape and broad neck possible, especially during the acute phase of hemorrhage. The authors present a prospective series of their preliminary experience with the TransForm occlusion balloon catheter (TOBC). METHODS Between September 2015 to February 2016 a total of 20 patients underwent endovascular treatment assisted by TOBC of which 19 had 20 untreated aneurysms and 1 patient harboring a meningioma was submitted to balloon test occlusion (BTO). The TOBC was used to perform BAC and BTO for the treatment of vasospasms and to cross the neck of giant aneurysms (anchor technique). All data regarding the feasibility and safety of treatment with the device were collected prospectively. RESULTS All patients completed treatment according to the modality previously chosen. The balloon was employed solely for remodeling in 17 patients, for anchor technique in 2, for both remodeling and vasospasm angioplasty in 1 and for BTO in 1 patient. The balloon could be navigated to the target aneurysm in all cases. Evaluation of postoperative anatomical results indicated total occlusion in 13 (72.2 %) aneurysms, neck remnants in 4 (22.2 %) and residual sac filling in 1 (5.5 %). There were two (9.5 %) complications related to treatment, all thromboembolic. No technical complications were observed. CONCLUSION The TOBC was shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with BAC. In addition, it was successfully employed to perform angioplasty for vasospasm and BTO. Finally, it was used in the balloon anchor technique for the first time.","Trivelato, Felipe Padovani; Rezende, Marco Túlio Salles; Fonseca, Luiz Venâncio; Bonadio, Lucas; Ulhôa, Alexandre Cordeiro",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-016-0519-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27325365/,775
109412,Identification of Mycoplasma suis antigens and development of a multiplex microbead immunoassay.,2014,"Introduction The Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, and later caused a severe health crisis, causing massive disruptions to most healthcare systems worldwide. The Covid-19 health emergency has seen healthcare workers in the front line facing all the difficulties related to the care burden. One of the most significant and probably underinvestigated aspects is the psychological stress of the healthcare staff managing the emergency. The aim of the paper is to analyze the literature on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the psychological well-being of health professionals. Methodology We conducted a systematic review of articles published on this topic during the months from January 2020 to December 2020, searching on Pub Med, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results Most of the issues can be summarized into five conceptual categories: Stress, Depression and Infection Anxiety, Anguish, Insomnia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicide. The literature identifies many factors contributing to the onset of anxiety, depression, and stress, like the fear of contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and friends, stressful shifts, and little rest among several others. The literature highlights the needs for adequate measures, including proper psychological support. Conclusion The conducted review suggests that the behaviours of healthcare professionals during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic show psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, there is a call for those in chief like hospital managers and policymakers to take action, promoting measures like surveillance, monitoring, and psychological support among others, to increase the resilience of healthcare workers, limiting stress and anxiety and allowing them to keep their performance at work.","Della Monica, A; Ferrara, P; Dal Mas, F; Cobianchi, L; Scannapieco, F; F Ruta, F Ruta",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33779676/,775

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of specially designed audio-visual module over traditional instructional module in improving the assisted breastfeeding habits. METHODOLOGY Sixteen patients received training regarding the feeding practices through the traditional instructional method, and 16 subjects received training through audio-visual module. Infants in both the groups received the standard care. These infants were followed up longitudinally for 6 months. During the follow up period, the growth parameters were recorded monthly. The knowledge, attitude, and practices of the mothers regarding feeding practices were assessed using KAP questionnaire. RESULTS There was significant improvement in the knowledge of the mothers from baseline to 6 months, however, the practices indicated that the mothers belonging to the audio-visual module group showed better understating of the condition and earlier adaptation of the breastfeeding practices. Correspondingly, the growth parameters also showed significant difference. CONCLUSION The custom-made audio-visual module would help the mothers adapt better to the stressful situation following the birth of the infant affected with cleft lip and palate.","Murthy, Prashanth Sadashiva; Deshmukh, Seema; Murthy, Srinivasa","Special care in dentistry : official publication of the American Association of Hospital Dentists, the Academy of Dentistry for the Handicapped, and the American Society for Geriatric Dentistry",https://doi.org/10.1111/scd.12464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388857/,775
113215,"Emergence of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in the United States: clinical signs, lesions, and viral genomic sequences.",2013,"PURPOSE To assess tomographic ganglion cell complex changes in patients with diabetic macular edema treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). METHODS We analyzed data from 35 eyes of 35 previously untreated patients in whom diabetic macular edema improved after three loading doses of anti-VEGF injection and who did not receive repeated injections. We recorded spectral domain-optical coherence tomography assessments of ganglion cell complex and central macular thickness at baseline and monthly for three months, and on the sixth and ninth month after treatment. We compared the results with those of the unaffected eyes in the same patients and with those in a control group of patients with diabetic macular edema who were untreated. RESULTS The mean age of the patients in the treatment group was 60 ± 4.38 years. The foveal thicknesses measured using optical coherence tomography decreased significantly from baseline to the third month post-injection (p<0.05). The mean ganglion cell complex thickness was 115.08 ± 16.72 µm before the first injection and 101.05 ± 12.67 µm after the third injection (p<0.05). The mean ganglion cell complex was 110.04 ± 15.07 µm on the sixth month (p>0.05) and 113.12 ± 11.15 µm on the ninth month (p>0.05). We found a significant difference between the patients and the control group in terms of mean ganglion cell complex thickness on the second- and third-months post-injection (p<0.05). CONCLUSION Our study showed that the ganglion cell complex thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema decreased after the anti-VEGF injections. We cannot ascertain whether the ganglion cell complex thickness decreases were due to effects of the anti-VEGF agents or to the natural disease course.","Ciloglu, Emine; Unal, Fikret; Dogan, Nese Cetin",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20200045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084813/,775
118115,Cecal infarction in neonatal calves.,2017,"PURPOSE The mechanism in which bariatric surgery induces diabetes remission is still poorly understood. This study proposes Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as a possible factor for the anti-diabetic mechanism after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasma TXNIP level in obesity patients with diabetes (T2D, N = 20), obesity patients without diabetes (NDO, N = 20), and patients without obesity and diabetes (lean, N = 10) were assessed before surgery and at 1 and 12 months after SG. RESULTS Preoperative TXNIP level was significantly higher in T2D (196.4 ± 76.0 pg/ml) and NDO (149.7 ± 94.1 pg/ml) patients when compared with lean patients (98.7 ± 22.7 pg/ml) (p-value < 0.05). At 1 month and 12 months postoperatively, the TXNIP levels were reduced significantly from the preoperative levels in the T2D and NDO patients (p-value < 0.05). Before surgery, a correlation between TXNIP and fasting blood glucose (FBG) (r2 = 0.1585, p-value = 0.0109), HbA1C (r2 = 0.2120, p-value = 0.0028), and insulin (r2 = 0.1217, p-value = 0.0274) was observed. At 12 months after surgery, the reduction of TXNIP was also correlated with the degree of FBG (r2 = 0.1038, p-value = 0.0426), HbA1C (r2 = 0.2459, p-value = 0.0011), and insulin (r2 = 0.1365, p-value = 0.0190) reduction. CONCLUSION Plasma TXNIP level is elevated in obesity patients with/without diabetes. SG resulted in a significant reduction of plasma TXNIP level which is correlated with the degree of FBG, HbA1C, and insulin reduction. Regulation of TXNIP could be part of the mechanism of diabetes remission after bariatric surgery.","Chu, Yuxiao; Widjaja, Jason; Hong, Jian; Dolo, Ponnie Robertlee; Zhu, Xiaocheng; Yao, Libin",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05649-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370159/,775

126089,Otitis and meningoencephalitis associated with infectious coryza ( Avibacterium paragallinarum) in commercial broiler chickens.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Type 2 endoleaks (T2E) occur in 10 to 20% of patients after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and remain a significant clinical issue. AIM To evaluate the efficacy and clinical outcomes of transarterial treatment of persistent type II endoleaks after EVAR using the liquid embolic Onyx. MATERIAL AND METHODS From February 2012 to August 2015 transarterial T2E embolization was attempted in 22 patients (21 men, median age: 73, range: 62-88 years). Indications for treatment included an increase in the diameter of the aneurysm sac above 5 mm and a persistent endoleak observed for more than 6 months. Mean time from EVAR to endoleak treatment was 43 months (range: 2-125 months). RESULTS Primary technical success was achieved in 17 (77.3%) patients and secondary technical success in 81.8%, with 0% in-hospital mortality. The mean procedure time was 95 ±48 min, with an average fluoroscopy time of 54 ±25 min. The mean amount of Onyx used was 7.5 ±6.6 ml. Clinical success was seen in 17/21 patients with follow-up imaging (80.9%). Mean follow-up time was 17 months (range: 3-38 months). CONCLUSIONS Onyx has been shown to effectively stabilize previous aneurysm growth as a result of the T2E in the majority of our patients. Transarterial embolization of T2E can be significantly improved as compared to previously reported results by using liquid embolic polymers such as Onyx.","Wojtaszek, Mikolaj; Wnuk, Emilia; Maciag, Rafal; Solonynko, Bohdan; Korzeniowski, Krzysztof; Lamparski, Krzysztof; Rowinski, Olgierd",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2016.64747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28194246/,775

Binary metal oxides are of interest for aqueous energy storage due to their better structural stability and electronic conductivity and tunability of redox potentials. They have also been widely studied as novel electrodes for supercapacitors. The interactions between water and lithium/sodium ions, and water and binary metal oxide surface determine the electrochemical reactions and their long-term stability. Our results indicate that the aqueous sodium electrolyte has a stronger influence on the capacitance and cycling stability of the binary (Ca and Mo) metal oxide electrode than its lithium cousin. The symmetric cell in a two-electrode configuration was assembled with the proposed binary metal oxide, which shows an average discharge voltage of 1.2 V, delivering a specific capacitance of 72 F g-1 at a specific energy density of 32 W h kg-1 based on the total mass of the active materials.

129582,Virus detection by PCR following vaccination of naive calves with intranasal or injectable multivalent modified-live viral vaccines.,2017,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFOT) is becoming an alternative to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and standard oxygen in management of patients with acute respiratory failure. RECENT FINDINGS Patients with de novo acute respiratory failure should be managed with HFOT rather than NIV. Indeed, the vast majority of patients with de novo respiratory failure meet the criteria for ARDS, and NIV does not seem protective, as patients generate overly high tidal volume that may worsen underlying lung injury. However, NIV remains the first-line oxygenation strategy in postoperative patients and those with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure when pH is equal to or below 7.35. During preoxygenation, NIV also seems to be more efficient than standard oxygen using valve-bag mask to prevent profound oxygen desaturation. In postoperative cardiothoracic patients, HFOT could be an alternative to NIV in the management of acute respiratory failure. SUMMARY Recent recommendations for managing patients with acute respiratory failure have been established on the basis of studies comparing NIV with standard oxygen. Growing use of HFOT will lead to new studies comparing NIV versus HFOT in view of more precisely defining the appropriate indications for each treatment.","Frat, Jean-Pierre; Joly, Florent; Thille, Arnaud W",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694832/,775
132810,Systemic Bovine herpesvirus 1 infections in neonatal dairy calves.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Composite measures may better objectify hospital performance than individual outcome measures (IOM). Textbook outcome (TO) is an outcome measure achieved for an individual patient when all undesirable outcomes are absent. The aim of this study was to assess TO as an additional outcome measure to evaluate quality of care in symptomatic patients treated by carotid endarterectomy (CEA). METHODS All symptomatic patients treated by CEA in 2018, registered in the Dutch Audit for Carotid Interventions, were included. TO was defined as a composite of the absence of 30 day mortality, neurological events (any stroke or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]), cranial nerve deficit, haemorrhage, 30 day readmission, prolonged length of stay (LOS; > 5 days) and any other surgical complication. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify covariables associated with achieving TO, which were used for casemix adjustment for hospital comparison. For each hospital, an observed vs. expected number of events ratio (O/E ratio) was calculated and plotted in a funnel plot with 95% control limits. RESULTS In total, 70.7% of patients had a desired outcome within 30 days after CEA and therefore achieved TO. Prolonged LOS was the most common parameter (85%) and mortality the least common (1.1%) for not achieving TO. Covariates associated with achieving TO were younger age, the absence of pulmonary comorbidity, higher haemoglobin levels, and TIA as index event. In the case mix adjusted funnel plot, the O/E ratios between hospitals ranged between 0.63 and 1.27, with two hospitals revealing a statistically significantly lower rate of TO (with O/E ratios of 0.63 and 0.66). CONCLUSION In the Netherlands, most patients treated by CEA achieve TO. Variation between hospitals in achieving TO might imply differences in performance. TO may be used as an additive to the pre-existing IOM, especially in surgical care with low baseline risk such as CEA.","Kuhrij, Laurien S; Karthaus, Eleonora G; Vahl, Anco C; Willems, Martine C M; Elshof, Jan W; de Borst, Gert J",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2020.06.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732140/,775

The present study describes detailed observations of the frequency and nature of hand-to-mouth and other hand-to-face touching behavior among 14 male and female volunteers in a controlled, quasi-naturalistic setting. Participants performed four 15-min tasks: 1) installation of a brass object as part of a short home improvement project, 2) completion of a pen-and-paper survey, 3) engagement in a telephone conversation, and 4) use of headphones to listen to music. Video recordings of the participants performing each task were reviewed and coded for touches to the face with emphasis on specific regions of the face and palmar versus dorsal contacts. During the installation task, only one of the 14 participants was observed touching his face; this was to the nose, on two separate occasions. Summed across the three non-installation tasks, including palmar and dorsal contacts, participants touched their lips, their mouth, and anywhere on their face on average (range) 5.1 (0-19), 0.4 (0-3), and 27.7 (6-49) times, respectively. Facial contacts during these three non-installation tasks were predominantly with the palmar surface of the hand. The implications of these data are contextually specific, as the potential health impacts of face touching behavior among adults might differ based upon toxicity or virulence of hand contaminants of interest.","Lewis, Ryan C; Rauschenberger, Robert; Kalmes, Renee",Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Along with addressing problems of demand and supply mismatch, there also need to ensure procurement of high quality PPEs that provide both safety and comfort to users. The purpose of this article is to review existing standards and recommendations on the technical aspects of PPE. Areas covered: For this review, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Research Gate were searched. Studies reporting technical aspects of component of PPE including mask and respirator, gown and coverall, gloves, goggles, face shields or visors, and boots, are included in this review. Expert commentary: The design and materials of PPE needs further research, which might have minimal carriage of infective biological load like use of antimicrobial repellent finishes along with adequate tensile strength and breathability through the fabric. Respirators should have least resistance while providing maximum protection; goggles should not have fogging. Also, there is need of formulating universal technical specifications for medically used PPE, and ensuring easy availability of testing facility.","Saran, Sai; Gurjar, Mohan; Baronia, Arvind Kumar; Lohiya, Ayush; Azim, Afzal; Poddar, Banani; Rao, Namrata S",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2020.1852079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203245/,775

Initial studies have shown a low complication rate with good efficacy. PURPOSE To report clinical and anatomical results of the WEB treatment in the cumulative population of three Good Clinical Practice (GCP) studies: WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm), French Observatory, and WEBCAST-2. METHODS WEBCAST, French Observatory, and WEBCAST-2 are single-arm, prospective, multicenter, GCP studies dedicated to the evaluation of WEB treatment. Clinical data were independently evaluated. Postoperative and 1-year aneurysm occlusion was independently evaluated using the 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The cumulative population comprised 168 patients with 169 aneurysms, including 112 female subjects (66.7%). The patients' ages ranged between 27 and 77 years (mean 55.5±10.2 years). Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 86/169 aneurysms (50.9%), anterior communicating artery in 36/169 (21.3%), basilar artery in 30/169 (17.8%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 17/169 (10.1%). The aneurysm was ruptured in 14/169 (8.3%). There was no mortality at 1 month and procedure/device-related morbidity was 1.2% (2/168). At 1 year, complete aneurysm occlusion was observed in 81/153 aneurysms (52.9%), neck remnant in 40/153 aneurysms (26.1%), and aneurysm remnant in 32/153 aneurysms (20.9%). Re-treatment was carried out in 6.9%. CONCLUSIONS This series is at the moment the largest prospective, multicenter, GCP series of patients with aneurysms treated with WEB.

143027,Systemic Listeria monocytogenes infection and concurrent pleural mesothelioma in a cat.,2020-10-15,"OBJECTIVE The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by hyperactive neutrophils has recently been recognized to play an important role in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Here, we aimed to evaluate autoantibodies targeting NETs in patients with primary APS, and to determine their potential functions and clinical associations. METHOD We measured global anti-NET activity in 76 patients with primary APS, 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), 11 patients with history of unprovoked venous thrombosis without aPL, and 44 healthy controls. The ability of APS sera to degrade NETs was also assessed. RESULT We found markedly elevated levels of anti-NET IgG and IgM in patients with primary APS as compared with healthy controls (IgG mean optical density 0.55 ± 0.34 vs. 0.33 ± 0.17; IgM mean optical density 0.76 ± 0.51 vs. 0.26 ± 0.23). This anti-NET activity did not correlate with levels of traditional aPL and was relatively stable over time. Mechanistically, anti-NET antibodies (especially of the IgG isotype) impaired the ability of patient sera to degrade NETs (r=0.4, p=0.003). Levels of anti-NET IgM inversely correlated with complement C4 (r=0.4, p=0.019). Clinically, anti-NET antibodies associated with certain APS clinical manifestations, and in particular recurrent venous thrombosis (OR=4.3, p=0.002). Interestingly, anti-NET antibodies also appeared to associate with unprovoked venous thrombosis in the general population (IgM mean optical density 0.67 ± 0.34 vs. 0.26 ± 0.23).

In this study, we (1) examined rates and correlates of telehealth (video call) use among those aged 70+, and (2) tested the significance of access to information and communication technology (ICT) device ownership and knowledge of how to use the internet and devices as telehealth-enabling factors. The Behavioral Model of Health Services Use served as the conceptual framework, and data came from the COVID-19 supplemental survey of the National Health and Aging Trend Study. Results show that telehealth use increased to 21.1% from 4.6% pre-pandemic. In logistic regression models without technology-enabling factors, older age and lower income were negatively associated with telehealth use; however, when technology-enabling factors were included, they were significant while age and income were no longer significant. Insuring that older adults have ICT devices and internet access may reduce health disparities and improve telehealth care delivery.","Choi, Namkee G; DiNitto, Diana M; Marti, C Nathan; Choi, Bryan Y",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/07334648211047347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608821/,775

In this work, the immune response, safety and efficacy of different vaccine formulations using the N. caninum recombinant proteins rNcSAG4 (the first bradyzoite-specific protein assayed as a vaccine) and rNcGRA7 were evaluated in mouse models. The survival curves of pups from all vaccinated groups showed a slight delay in time to death compared to control groups; this difference was statistically significant for rNcSAG4+adjuvant group. Immune response of mice vaccinated with rNcSAG4 was characterized by reduced specific IgG and cytokine levels with an equilibrated IFN-gamma/IL-10 balance. Regarding mice vaccinated with rNcGRA7, a very strong humoral and cellular immune response was generated characterized by a hyper-production of IFN-gamma. This response was not accompanied by significant protection. Vaccination with a mixture of both recombinant proteins reduced infection in lung and brain during acute and chronic infection, respectively, although it was not statistically significant. In summary, no significant protection was obtained with these vaccine formulations in the present mouse models. However, the study reveals some positive results on immune response and efficacy for both recombinant proteins; these results are being discussed in order to suggest new approaches with new chronic infection mouse models and adjuvants.","Aguado-Martínez, Adriana; Alvarez-García, Gema; Fernández-García, Aurora; Risco-Castillo, Verónica; Marugán-Hernández, Virginia; Ortega-Mora, Luis M",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.09.050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19782735/,775
155530,Glomerulonephritis in a ferret with feline coronavirus infection.,2015,"As post-secondary education migrates online, developing and evaluating new avenues for assessment in anatomy is paramount. Three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology is one area with the potential to augment or even replace resource-intensive cadaver use in anatomical education. This manuscript details the development of a smartphone application, entitled ""Virtual Reality Bell-Ringer (VRBR)"", capable of displaying monoscopic two-dimensional (2D) or stereoscopic 3D images with the use of an inexpensive cardboard headset for use in spot examinations. Cadaveric image use, creation, and pinning processes are explained, and the source code is provided. To validate this tool, this paper compares traditional laboratory-based spot examination assessment stations against those administered using the VRBR application to test anatomical knowledge. Participants (undergraduate, n = 38; graduate, n = 13) completed three spot examinations specific to their level of study, one in each of the modalities (2D, 3D, laboratory) as well as a mental rotation test (MRT), Stereo Fly stereotest, and cybersickness survey. Repeated measures ANCOVA suggested participants performed significantly better on laboratory and 3D stations compared to 2D stations. Moderate to severe cybersickness symptoms were reported by 63% of participants in at least one category while using the VRBR application. Highest reported symptoms included: eye strain, general discomfort, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating. Overall, the VRBR application is a promising tool for its portability, affordability, and accessibility. Due to reported cybersickness and other technical limitations, use of VRBR as an alternative to cadaveric specimens presents several challenges when testing anatomy knowledge that must be addressed before widespread adoption.","Brewer-Deluce, Danielle; Bak, Alex B; Simms, Abigail J; Sinha, Sakshi; Mitchell, Josh P; Shin, David; Saraco, Anthony N; Wainman, Bruce C",Anatomical sciences education,https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735524/,775

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the epidemiology and burden of HZ in LAC. Bibliographic databases and grey literature sources were consulted to find studies published (January 2000 -February 2020) with epidemiological endpoints: cumulative incidence and incidence density (HZ cases per 100,000 person-years), prevalence, case-fatality rates, HZ mortality, hospitalization rates, and rates of each HZ complication. Twenty-six studies were included with most studies coming from Brazil. No studies reported the incidence of HZ in the general population. In population at higher risk, the cumulative incidence ranged from 318-3,423 cases of HZ per 100,000 persons per year of follow-up. The incidence density was 6.4-36.5 cases per 1,000 person-years. Age was identified as a major risk factor towards HZ incidence which increase significantly in people >50 years of age. Hospitalization rates ranged from 3%-35.7%. The in-hospital HZ mortality rate ranged from 0%-36%. Overall, HZ mortality rates were found to be higher in females across all age groups and countries. The incidence of HZ complications (such as post-herpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic herpes zoster, and Ramsay Hunt syndrome) was higher in the immunosuppressed compared to the immunocompetent population. Acyclovir was the most frequently used therapy. Epidemiological data from Ministry of Health databases (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile y Mexico) and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease project reported stable rates of hospitalizations and deaths over the last 10 years. High-risk groups for HZ impose a considerable burden in LAC.

Coroners' Prevention of Future Death reports (PFDs) provide valuable insights that may enable safer and more effective use of these agents. Objective: To identify CVD-related PFD reports highlighting the use or lack of anticoagulants as having caused or contributed to deaths. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of coronial case reports in England and Wales between 2013 and 2019. We screened 3037 PFDs for inclusion and used content analysis to assess concerns raised by coroners and who responded to them. Results: We identified 113 CVD-related PFDs (113 deaths) involving anticoagulants. Warfarin (36%), enoxaparin (11%), and rivaroxaban (11%) were the most common anticoagulants reported. In 14 cases, the coroner mentioned that the administration of an anticoagulant may have prevented the death. Concerns most frequently raised by coroners included poor systems (31%), poor communication (25%), and failures to keep accurate medical records (25%). These concerns were most often directed to NHS trusts (29%), hospitals (10%), and general practices (8%), but had national importance. Nearly two-thirds (60%) of PFDs had not received responses from such organisations, which are mandatory under regulation 28 of the Coroners' (Investigations) Regulations 2013. Conclusions: We created a tool (https://preventabledeathstracker.net/) that bring together coroner reports to identify important lessons related to preventable deaths. Here we examined instances of premature deaths from CVD involving anticoagulants. National organisations, healthcare professionals, and prescribers should take actions to address these concerns, to improve the use of anticoagulants in patients with CVD.","Ains, A.; Heneghan, C.; Aronson, J.

183346,Enteric coronavirus infection in a juvenile dromedary (Camelus dromedarius).,2002,"SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibodies wane during the first three months after infection and IgG antibody levels decline. This may limit the ability of antibody tests to identify previous SARS CoV-2 infection at later time points. To examine if the sensitivity of antibody tests falls off, we compared the sensitivity of two nucleoprotein-based antibody tests, the Roche Elecsis II Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and three glycoprotein-based tests, the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant, Siemens Atellica IM COV2T and Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 assay with 56 sera obtained 6-8 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity of the Roche, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and Siemens antibody assays was 94.6 % (95% confidence interval (CI) 85.1-98.9 %), 98.2 % (95% CI: 90.4-99.9 %) and 100 % (95% CI: 93.6-100 %). The sensitivity of the N-based Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the glycoprotein-based Euroimmun ELISA was 48.2 % (95% CI: 34.7-62.0 %) and 83.9 % (95% CI: 71.7-92.4 %). The nucleoprotein-based Roche and the glycoprotein-based Abbott RBD and Siemens tests were more sensitive than the N-based Abbott and the Euroimmun antibody tests (p=0.0001 to p=0.039). The N-based Abbott antibody test was less sensitive 6-8 months than 4-10 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.0002). The findings show that most SARS CoV-2 antibody assays correctly identified previous infection 6-8 months after infection. The sensitivity of pan-Ig antibody tests was not reduced at 6-8 months when IgM antibodies have usually disappeared. However, one of the nucleoprotein-based antibody tests significantly lost sensitivity over time.","Kannenberg, J.; Schnurra, C.; Reiners, N.; Henschler, R.; Buhmann, R.; Kaiser, T.; Biemann, R.; Hoenemann, M.; Ackermann, G.; Trawinski, H.; Jassoy, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.21259772v1?rss=1,775

In Ukraine, education, healthcare, and social services have been chronically deteriorating, and the corona-crisis has further exacerbated their state and increased poverty in the country. The aim of this study is to reveal the main weaknesses of fiscal policy in Ukraine and to outline the prospects of public finance transformations under the impact of the COVID-19. To achieve this aim, the indicators of fiscal policy response to the pandemic in Ukraine are calculated and a comparative analysis of Ukraine’s public finance structure with the international patterns is undertaken. A moderate fiscal impulse and insufficient fiscal rescue package in Ukraine are shown. Moreover, the inconsistencies of anti-crisis fiscal policy instruments with the international best practice are revealed. Summarizing the available theoretical sources and recent applied research allows identifying the prospects of public finances transformations under the impact of the COVID-19 in a global context.

184957,Experimental reproduction of pneumonia in gnotobiotic pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus isolate AR310.,1993,"Rapid and accurate crop type mapping is of great significance for agricultural management and sustainable development. Time-series multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is suitable for obtaining the large-scale distribution of crop types and continuously monitoring crops. At present, the classification method based on the time-series alignment of time-varying feature curves has been widely used, which can take the uncertainty of the phenological cycles of crops into account. The most classical method is the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment. While the DTW alignment does not consider the local shape of the curves and temporal ranges, and the NN classifier is inadequate in generalization, which restricts the accuracy of crop type mapping. In this paper, a pairwise proximity function support vector machine (ppfSVM) classification method with the time-weighted shapeDTW (TWshapeDTW) alignment is proposed. Firstly, the novel alignment method simultaneously considers the local shape of the curve and the temporal range of crops. Besides, the novel ppfSVM classifier with the time-series alignment kernel is established. Such kernel matrix considers dual-similarity metrics of multiple features, and it is positive semi-definite (PSD) in this classifier. With 42 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR images located in Gansu Province, China, the crop classification maps in 2018 and 2019 are generated respectively. The proposed method in this paper obtains the overall accuracies of more than 90% in both two years, and the changes of crop types from 2018 to 2019 are also in line with the actual crop rotation. Compared with traditional classification methods (SVM and the NN method with the DTW alignment), it is found that the proposed method has higher overall accuracy (OA) and better robustness in the case of small number of samples. The OA's improvements of our method compared with the SVM method are 3% and 1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Such improvements are 14% and 12% respect to the NN method with the DTW alignment. This method can achieve more obvious improvement under the condition of less training samples and unaligned phenological sequences. Furthermore, the novel TWshapeDTW alignment is superior to the DTW and the time-weighted DTW alignment under the ppfSVM classifier. The OA's improvement introduced by the TWshapeDTW alignment respect to the DTW alignment can obtain 5% and 4% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. • The proposed TWshapeDTW method reduces matching errors between feature curves. • The ppfSVM classifier with time-series alignment kernel improves generalization. • The proposed method adapts to the uncertainty of crop phenology and finite samples. • The proposed method has accuracies over 90%, which is superior to traditional methods.

Coronaviruses induce dysregulation of the immune system resulting in a cytokine storm syndrome with activation of the macrophage mediated mainly by IL-1 and IL-6. Although there is no specific treatment to date, researchers have explored novel approaches through targeting both IL-6 and IL-1. Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist that prevents IL-1β and IL-1α binding and therefore blocks signal transduction. Its high bioavailability, rapid action, relatively short half-life and good safety profile make it a promising drug. Objectives: Analyse the experience of administering Anakinra for severe forms of COVID19 in patients hospitalised at a tertiary hospital. Methods: Retrospective single-center study in which all patients admitted for COVID-19 and treated with Anakinra from April 1st to the end of the 1st wave (July 2020) were included. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic, clinical and lab test data, using Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale, SaFi, CRP, Ferritin, LDH and lymphocytes. Variables were assessed at baseline, 72h and 7 days after treatment initiation. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed, including a sub-analysis of patients who received anakinra as the only biological treatment. Results: 54 patients were included, of which 37 male (68.5%) with a median age of 69.5 years (36-94). Comorbidities were lung disease 14 pts (25.9%), cardiovascular disease 39 pts (72.2%), Diabetes Mellitus 11 pts (20.4%), kidney disease and rheumatic disease each in 6 pts (11.1%), and immunosuppression 13 pts (24.1%). Each patient received a mean of 4.85 doses of anakinra (± 3.96). Other therapies included low-dose steroids (70.3%);high-dose steroids: 1mg/kg (87%), bolus (24%), Tocilizumab (57.4%), Infliximab (24.1%), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (48%), Hydroxychloroquine (94.4%), and Azithromycin (79.6%). Mortality was 22% overall, 75% due to COVID19, 8.3% due to infectious complications and 16.7% due to non-infectious complications. In the group receiving Anakinra as only biological drug, mortality accounted for 17.9% of patients, 75% due to COVID19 and 25% to non-infectious complications.

185453,Prior infection of nursery-age pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus does not affect the outcome of transmissible gastroenteritis virus challenge.,1998,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant dilemma for governments across the globe. The public health consequences of inaction are catastrophic; but the economic consequences of drastic action are likewise catastrophic. Governments must therefore strike a balance in the face of these trade-offs. But with critical uncertainty about how to find such a balance, they are forced to experiment with their interventions and await the results of their experimentation. Models have proved inaccurate because behavioral response patterns are either not factored in or are hard to predict. One crucial behavioral response in a pandemic is adaptive social contact: potentially infectious contact between people is deliberately reduced either individually or by fiat; and this must be balanced against the economic cost of having fewer people in contact and therefore active in the labor force. We develop a model for adaptive optimal control of the effective social contact rate within a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model using a dynamic utility function with delayed information. This utility function trades off the population-wide contact rate with the expected cost and risk of increasing infections. Our analytical and computational analysis of this simple discrete-time deterministic model reveals the existence of a non-zero equilibrium, oscillatory dynamics around this equilibrium under some parametric conditions, and complex dynamic regimes that shift under small parameter perturbations. These results support the supposition that infectious disease dynamics under adaptive behavior-change may have an indifference point, may produce oscillatory dynamics without other forcing, and constitute complex adaptive systems with associated dynamics. Implications for COVID-19 include an expectation of fluctuations, for a considerable time, around a quasi-equilibrium that balances public health and economic priorities, that shows multiple peaks and surges in some scenarios, and that implies a high degree of uncertainty in mathematical projections. Author summary Epidemic response in the form of social contact reduction, such as has been utilized during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, presents inherent tradeoffs between the economic costs of reducing social contacts and the public health costs of neglecting to do so. Such tradeoffs introduce an interactive, iterative mechanism which adds complexity to an infectious disease system. Consequently, infectious disease modeling typically has not included dynamic behavior change that must address such a tradeoff. Here, we develop a theoretical model that introduces lost or gained economic and public health utility through the adjustment of social contact rates with delayed information. We find this model produces an equilibrium, a point of indifference where the tradeoff is neutral, and at which a disease will be endemic for a long period of time. Under small perturbations, this model exhibits complex dynamic regimes, including oscillatory behavior, runaway exponential growth, and eradication. These dynamics suggest that for epidemic response that relies on social contact reduction, secondary waves and surges with accompanied business re-closures and shutdowns may be expected, and that accurate projection under such circumstances is unlikely.","Arthur, Ronan F.; Jones, James H.; Bonds, Matthew H.; Ram, Yoav; Feldman, Marcus W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.028407,775
185909,Effect of pancreatic tissue sampling on serum pancreatic enzyme levels in clinically healthy dogs.,2010,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached by July 2021 almost 200 million cases and more than 4 million deaths worldwide since its beginning in late 2019, leading to enhanced concern in the scientific community and the general population. One of the most important pieces of this host-pathogen interaction is the spike protein, which binds to the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) cell receptor, mediates the membrane fusion and is the major target of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The multiple amino acid substitutions observed in this region, specially in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), mainly after almost one year of its emergence (late 2020), have enhanced the hACE2 binding affinity and led to several modifications in the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, improving the viral fitness and/or promoting immune evasion, with potential impact in the vaccine development. In this way, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of positively selected mutations fixed in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 lineages and to check for mutational evidence of coevolution. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of selected mutations identified in some of the VOC and VOI lineages (C.37, B.1.1.7, P.1, and P.2) of Brazilian samples on the structural stability of the spike protein, as well as their possible association with more aggressive infection profiles by estimating the binding affinity in the RBD-hACE2 complex. We identified 48 sites under selective pressure in Brazilian spike sequences, 17 of them with the strongest evidence by the HyPhy tests, including VOC related mutation sites 138, 142, 222, 262, 484, 681, and 845, among others. The coevolutionary analysis identified a number of 28 coevolving sites that were found not to be conditionally independent, such as the couple E484K - N501Y from P.1 and B.1.351 lineages. Finally, the molecular dynamics and free energy estimates showed the structural stabilizing effect and the higher impact of E484K for the improvement of the binding affinity between the spike RBD and the hACE2 in P.1 and P.2 lineages, as well as the stabilizing and destabilizing effects for the positively selected sites.","Ferrareze, Patrícia Aline Gröhs; Zimerman, Ricardo Ariel; Franceschi, Vinícius Bonetti; Caldana, Gabriel Dickin; Netz, Paulo Augusto; Thompson, Claudia Elizabeth",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.16.452571,775

From January 23, 2020 to March 30, 2020, one hundred and thirteen elderly patients with stable COPD were selected as participants of the research, and a WeChat group was used for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. CAT and mMRC were used to compare the symptoms and health status of patients before and after the epidemic lockdown. After the epidemic lockdown, the cough symptoms, energy status, total score and mMRC score in the CAT questionnaire were lower than before the epidemic lockdown, and the difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). During the epidemic lockdown, the use of WeChat groups to conduct mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can help alleviate panic, improve patients' self-management behavior, and enhance the quality of life and health of patients. © 2021, ASCR Press.

This study aimed to asses the value of the drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) using a MAD in the prediction of treatment outcome for OSAHS METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center cohort study that enrolled sixty-six consecutive patients with diagnosed OSA (5 events/h < apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) < 50 events/h) to be treated with a custom-made titratable MAD. The patients were evaluated polysomnographically with the MAD in situ after the adaptation and titration period of 3 months. The associations between findings during DISE and treatment outcome were assessed RESULTS: The subjects showed a wide range of severity of OSAHS pre-treatment: median AHI was 43.10 with a range from 20.13 to 66.07. The simulation bite was associated with a significant increase in cross-sectional area at level of the velopharynx, tongue base and epiglottis. MAD treatment response in the studied population was 91%, with a mean AHI improving from 43.10 to 12.93. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-induced sleep endoscopy with simulation bite is an acceptably reproducible technique for determining the sites of obstruction in OSAHS subjects; it thus offers possibilities as a prognostic indicator for treatment with MAD","Cavaliere, M.; De Luca, P.; De Santis, C.; Scarpa, A.; Ralli, M.; Di Stadio, A.; Viola, P.; Chiarella, G.; Cassandro, C.; Cassandro, F.",Transl Med UniSa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7789928/,775

187827,Disseminated adenovirus infection in a cat.,1993,"Rotaviruses represent 80% of recognized viral etiologies and 140 million cases of diarrhea per year. They strike young children with similar frequency throughout the world, but the mortality rate is high in developing countries only, with some 870,000 deaths per year (WHO, 1997). Rotaviruses belong to the family of Reoviridae; they are segmented bicatenary RNA viruses, which explains their genetic variability, the presence of mixed infections, the establishment for some time already of a molecular epidemiology by electrophore types. The viruses are ""naked"" and thus resistant to the outside environment; their massive elimination, 10(8) to 10(10)viral particles per gram of faeces, begins with the first day of diarrhea. They are found in used water and can also be concentrated by shellfish; the environment thus constitutes a notable reservoir for the virus. Oral-faecal transmission is facilitated by deficient sanitary conditions. The 11 fragments of the genome each codify for 1 viral protein; 2 surface proteins, VP4 and VP7, bring about the formation of neutralizing antibodies, which are important for the protection and determination of different serotypes. A non structural protein--NSP4--would seem to intervene in the cytopathogenic effect and may act as a veritable viral enterotoxine. Numerous animal species are infected by rotaviruses which are district from the human ones. The pathology as it affects animals is of economic importance and of interest as an experimental and vaccinal model. Between human and animal rotaviruses there can be genetic rematchings and the VP6 protein is an antigen common to the group. The description of the other viruses responsible for diarrhea has benefited from widespread use of electronic microscopes from the very first years of study of rotaviruses. These other viruses belong to 6 different types: adenovirus, calcivirus, astrovirus, Norwalk agent and related viruses, coronavirus, enterovirus. They therefore have a structural and antigenic polymorphism but, except for the coronavirus, they are all ""naked"" virions with resistance in outside environments and means of transmission analogous to the rotaviruses. Clinical signs of viral gastroenterites, the age of the patient and epidemiological circumstances help in making an etiological diagnosis; the biological diagnosis has been simplified for the rotaviruses and the adenoviruses. Epidemics related to food, or of hydric and nosocomial origin, especially those due to the Norwalk agent, are under-declared and more frequent than those of bacterial origin. The prevention of dangers related to faeces, the improvement of sanitary conditions, health education, and better nutrition contribute to rotavirus prevention, but rotavirus diarrheas, the incidence of which is similar in developed and developing countries, would be more efficiently controlled through vaccination.","Bajolet, O; Chippaux-Hyppolite, C",Bulletin de la Societe de pathologie exotique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10078381/,775

Both the 32K and 37K partial cleavage products and one of the complete cleavage products bind MHV leader RNA, suggesting that the central region of the N protein contains the RNA-binding domain. Monoclonal antibody mapping of the cleavage products confirmed that the MHV leader RNA binding domain is contained within the central 140-amino acid fragment, comprising amino acids 169 to 308.

Vaccination of persons over 60 years of age and immunocompromised persons, who are demonstrably at the highest risk of a serious course of the disease, is of the utmost importance. In order to achieve adequate vaccination coverage, it is necessary to motivate other groups of people to be vaccinated, including children over 12 years of age and young adults. Vaccination is also recommended in pregnant women in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and in breastfeeding women. For selected groups of vaccines, a third dose of vaccination is recommended (additional third dose 4 weeks after the second dose or a booster dose 8 to 12 months after the second dose).

189826,Detection of bovine torovirus and other enteric pathogens in feces from diarrhea cases in cattle.,2003,"The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) receptor (MHVR), CEACAM1, has two different functions for MHV entry into cells: binding to MHV spike protein (S protein) and activation of the S protein to execute virus-cell membrane fusion, the latter of which is accompanied by conformational changes of the S protein. The MHVR comprising the N-terminal and fourth domains [R1(1,4)] displays these two activities, and the N domain is thought to be critical for binding to MHV. In this study, we have addressed whether or not the N domain alone is sufficient for these activities. We examined three types of soluble form MHVR (soMHVR), one consisting of the N domain alone [soR1(1)], one with the N and second domains [soR1(1,2)], and one [soR1(1,4)] expressed by recombinant baculoviruses. We assessed the abilities of these three types of soMHVR to bind to MHV, activate fusogenicity, and induce conformational changes of the S protein. All three types of soMHVR similarly bound to MHV, as examined by a solid-phase binding assay and neutralized MHV infectivity. They also activated S protein fusogenicity and induced its conformational changes with similar levels of efficiency. However, R1(1) expressed on the BHK cell surface failed to serve as a receptor in spite of a sufficient level of expression. The inability of expressed R1(1) to work as a receptor was due to the inaccessibility of virions to R1(1); however, these were accessible using the MHVR-specific monoclonal antibody CC1. These results collectively indicated that the N domain retains all biological activities necessary for receptor function.","Miura, Hideka S; Nakagaki, Keiko; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671103/,775

This report summarizes the initial epidemiologic findings, clinical description, and diagnostic findings that followed the identification of SARS in Canada. METHODS SARS was first identified in Canada in early March 2003. We collected epidemiologic, clinical, and diagnostic data from each of the first 10 cases prospectively as they were identified. Specimens from all cases were sent to local, provincial, national, and international laboratories for studies to identify an etiologic agent. RESULTS The patients ranged from 24 to 78 years old; 60 percent were men. Transmission occurred only after close contact. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (in 100 percent of cases) and malaise (in 70 percent), followed by nonproductive cough (in 100 percent) and dyspnea (in 80 percent) associated with infiltrates on chest radiography (in 100 percent). Lymphopenia (in 89 percent of those for whom data were available), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (in 80 percent), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (in 78 percent), and elevated creatinine kinase levels (in 56 percent) were common. Empirical therapy most commonly included antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intravenous ribavirin. Mechanical ventilation was required in five patients. Three patients died, and five have had clinical improvement. The results of laboratory investigations were negative or not clinically significant except for the amplification of human metapneumovirus from respiratory specimens from five of nine patients and the isolation and amplification of a novel coronavirus from five of nine patients. In four cases both pathogens were isolated. CONCLUSIONS SARS is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It appears to be of viral origin, with patterns suggesting droplet or contact transmission.

190106,"Identification of a novel coronavirus possibly associated with acute respiratory syndrome in alpacas (Vicugna pacos) in California, 2007.",2010,"BACKGROUND In the absence of definitive anti-viral therapy, there is considerable interest in mitigating against severe inflammatory reactions in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to improve survival. These reactions are sometimes termed cytokine storm. PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4i) have anti-inflammatory properties with approved indications in inflammatory skin and joint diseases as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4i in respiratory models of viral and bacterial infection and also after chemically mediated lung injury. The rationale for PDE4i use in COVID-19 patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile. We highlight how PDE4i could be an overlooked treatment from the rheumatologic and respiratory armamentarium, which has potential beneficial immune-modulation for treating severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storms. The proposed use of PDE4i is also supported by age-related immune changes in inflammation severity in PDE4i modifiable pathways in primate coronavirus disease. In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with COVID-19 may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with PDE4i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.","Bridgewood, Charlie; Damiani, Giovanni; Sharif, Kassem; Watad, Abdulla; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Quartuccio, Luca; Savic, Sinisa; McGonagle, Dennis",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32558435/,775

190470,Paramyxovirus infection in pigs with interstitial pneumonia and encephalitis in the United States.,2001,"Depression has been identified as a complicating comorbid diagnosis in a variety of medical conditions, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite this, the psychological health of hemodialysis patients is understudied. The purpose of this paper is to review the research and issues involved in the assessment of depression and its sequelae in ESRD. Accurate estimation of the prevalence of depression in the ESRD population has been difficult due to the use of different definitions of depression and varied assessment techniques, the overlap of depressive symptomatology with symptoms of uremia, and the confounding effects of medications. We suggest that depressive affect is a more important construct to study than diagnosis of depression syndromes per se in patients with chronic kidney disease. The Beck Depression Inventory is a reasonable measure of depressive affect in the ESRD population, if a higher than usual cutoff score is used or if its somatic components are omitted.

The occurrence of myocardial injury in the context of COVID-19 is multifactorial and has generated increasing interest. METHODS A systematic review with a meta-analysis of the literature was performed. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Two independent reviewers evaluated the selected manuscripts for the outcome ""myocardial injury"", defined by troponin elevation above the 99th percentile. The study heterogeneity and risk of bias were evaluated. RESULTS Eight studies, with a total of 1,229 patients, were included. The frequency of myocardial injury was 16% (95% CI: 9%-27%). The heterogeneity among the studies was high (93%). CONCLUSIONS Myocardial injury may occur in patients with COVID-19, with a frequency of 16% according to current studies. Continuous research is needed to update these findings as the pandemic evolves and to define the implications of myocardial injury in the context of this infection.","De Lorenzo, Andrea; Kasal, Daniel Ab; Tura, Bernardo R; Lamas, Cristiane C; Rey, Helena Cv",American journal of cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685261/,775

This is the drip trajectory and contact transmission. The order to cover the mouth and nose in the public space has been introduced as one of the preventive measures to limit the spread of some virus-induced respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Both medical and non-medical masks have become the most popular tool. Is there any evidence of their effectiveness? What can be the disadvantages of using them? The aim: To analyze social behaviour towards the order to cover the nose and mouth during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to confront them with the results of research on the effectiveness of medical and non-medical masks. PATIENTS AND METHODS Material and methods: The study involved a group of 2512 respondents from all over Poland. The research tool was an original questionnaire containing 24 questions. RESULTS Results: 76.1% of the respondents declare that they always obey the current order. 83% use a material mask and 26.9% wear a surgical mask. 35.2% of respondents think that the order to cover their nose and mouth is not justified. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The authors confronted the results of the questionnaire with the scientific research mentioned above. There is limited evidence to resolve the question - ""Masks - protection or danger?"" However, it is worth noting the small harmfulness and indirect evidence of benefits, which together have precedence over the lack of clear arguments supporting the use of masks by Polish society in times of epidemics.","Krzyżak, Katarzyna; Kościelecka, Klaudia Ewa; Joanna Kuć, Aleksandra; Kubik, Daria Małgorzata; Męcik-Kronenberg, Tomasz",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33055326/,775

In both cases, the template switch apparently took place between the S and M genes, giving rise to recombinant viruses which encode a CCV-like S protein and the M, N, 7a, and 7b proteins of FCoV type I (K.

Vaccines offer the possibility of decreasing the severity and complications of viral respiratory disease, but development has been delayed by numerous factors. First, there are more than 200 serologically distinct RNA and DNA virus species and strains which cause an essentially similar spectrum of disease. Some re-infect at high efficiency despite little antigenic variation, while others exhibit extensive coat protein variability. Vaccine candidates show variable efficacy in partially immune adults, the immunocompromised and the elderly, and may be ineffective or pathogenic in neonates or in the presence of maternal antibodies. However, effective childhood vaccines are essential to prevent severe disease due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza and to reduce virus transmission to adults. A number of promising vaccines are in clinical trial, and it is likely that vaccines against RSV and parainfluenza will be licensed within the next 5-10 years.

The large amount of available public health data makes it possible to extract such information to monitor and predict significant disease events in disease epidemic. The detection of unusual events often involves a combination of a forecasting and a decision mechanism assessing the extent to which an observed event differs significantly from a forecast event. A number of methods and models have been proposed to monitor the trend of infectious disease and to detect unusual events. Although these existing methods and models are useful, many new issues remain to be addressed, including the complicated data structure and the infectious disease dynamics. To overcome these issues, we introduced the statistical tool using statistical process control, and proposed a new method under that framework. METHODS In this paper, we first reviewed the most commonly used methods and models, including the historical limit method, the time series analysis, the hidden Markov models, and the process control charts. Then, we further discussed issues with the current available methods. We proposed a new method using statistical process control. A major feature of the new method is that it prospectively monitors the disease incidence using sequentially collected data over time. It also takes into account a wide variety of longitudinal patterns and possible autocorrelation in the data. RESULTS We test this novel method with the recorded data of the number of AIDS cases in different states of US from 1985 to 2011. The results show that our new method is effective in detecting and predicting the time trends of AIDS epidemic for individual states and for US as a whole. Although AIDS data are used in our demonstration, this method can be used for monitoring other infectious diseases.","Zhang, Jingnan; Qiu, Peihua; Chen, Xinguang",Current HIV research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511339/,775

The disease clinically manifests in three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary manifestation, a self-limited genital ulcer at the site of inoculation, often is absent by the time the patient seeks medical attention. The most common clinical manifestation of LGV is evident in its secondary stage: unilateral tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy. However, proctocolitis or inflammatory involvement of perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues resulting in fistulas and strictures may also occur. The diagnosis of LGV is usually made serologically and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Doxycycline is the preferred treatment; it cures the infection and prevents ongoing tissue damage. This case highlights an unusual manifestation of LGV infection--cervical lymphadenopathy following suspected oropharyngeal infection with C trachomatis.

Experiments with mice have begun to define how the innate and adaptive immune responses function to limit infection. Here, we demonstrate that the complement system, a major component of innate immunity, controls WNV infection in vitro primarily in an antibody-dependent manner by neutralizing virus particles in solution and lysing WNV-infected cells. More decisively, mice that genetically lack the third component of complement or complement receptor 1 (CR1) and CR2 developed increased CNS virus burdens and were vulnerable to lethal infection at a low dose of WNV. Both C3-deficient and CR1- and CR2-deficient mice also had significant deficits in their humoral responses after infection with markedly reduced levels of specific anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG. Overall, these results suggest that complement controls WNV infection, in part through its ability to induce a protective antibody response.","Mehlhop, Erin; Whitby, Kevin; Oliphant, Theodore; Marri, Anantha; Engle, Michael; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15919902/,775

196634,Adenovirus infection in Spanish ibex.,1998,"Genetically engineered RNA transcripts coding for various Sindbis virus (SIN) genes were used to study structure and sequence requirements of RNA recombination in BHK cells. Three different groups of RNA transcripts were made: (i) RNAs which retain the ability to replicate and which carry sequences coding for either viral polymerase or viral structural proteins; (ii) RNAs which lack the complete 3' end of the SIN genome and thus are incapable of replicating; and (iii) RNAs which lack the complete 5' end of the SIN genome and also are incapable of replicating. BHK cells were transfected with specific combinations of these precursor RNAs, and virus production and RNA synthetic abilities of the released virus were determined. We demonstrate in vivo generation of infectious SIN by fusion of (i) replicative RNAs to nonreplicative RNAs and (ii) two nonreplicative RNA precursors. Both homologous and nonhomologous types of recombinations were observed. In the homologous type of recombination, a 694-nucleotide overlap at the crossover region of the first pair of precursors resulted in the addition of an A residue converting the UAG stop codon of nonstructural protein P4 to a UAA stop codon. In the nonhomologous type of recombination, the crossover sites contained deletion of up to 76 nucleotides from one of the precursors and complete preservation of junction sequence from the other precursor. This is also the first report that a cytoplasmic RNA virus can be generated from biologically nonreplicative RNA precursors. These results have implications for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and recombination between RNA viral genomes in general. We favor template switching as a mechanism for the fusion events described here and suggest inclusion of polymerase scanning of diverse nonreplicative RNAs as an inherent feature of the copy choice model of RNA recombination. Very importantly, the facile nature of RNA recombination occurring between nonreplicative RNA precursors should speed up the production and analysis of targeted mutants of SIN and possibly other RNA viruses.","Raju, R; Subramaniam, S V; Hajjou, M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494243/,775

This study focuses on how shifts in global health governance may influence related online networks. We compare social network metrics (average degree centrality [AVGD], density [D] and clustering coefficient [CC]) of Globalink, an online network of tobacco control advocates, across three eras in global tobacco control governance; pre-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) policy transfer (1992-1998), global regime formation through the FCTC negotiations (1999-2005), and philanthropic funding through the Bloomberg Initiative (2006-2012). Prior to 1999, Globalink was driven by a handful of high-income countries (AVGD=1.908 D=0.030, CC=0.215). The FCTC negotiations (1999-2005) corresponded with a rapid uptick in the number of countries represented within Globalink and new members were most often brought into the network through relationships with regional neighbors (AVGD=2.824, D=0.021, CC=0.253). Between 2006 and 2012, the centrality of the US in the network increases significantly (AVGD=3.414, D=0.023, CC=0.310). The findings suggest that global institutionalization through WHO, as with the FCTC, can lead to the rapid growth of decentralized online networks. Alternatively, private initiatives, such as the Bloomberg Initiative, can lead to clustering in which a single source of information gains increasing influence over an online network.","Wipfli, Heather; Chu, Kar-Hai; Lancaster, Molly; Valente, Thomas",Global health governance : the scholarly journal for the new health security paradigm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596813/,775

This study describes development of instrumentation and techniques for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy using laser-assisted soldering technology. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Anesthetized 20 kg to 25 kg female Yorkshire pigs underwent laparoscopy with a 3-trocar technique. Parietex TET, Parietex TEC, and Prolene mesh segments (5 x 5 cm) were embedded in 55% collagen solder. Segments were inserted by using a specially designed introducer and affixed to the peritoneum by using prototype laser devices (1.45 micro, 4.5 W continuous wave, 5-mm spot, 55 degrees C set temperature) and a custom laparoscopic handpiece (IPOM). Parietex PCO mesh was inserted and affixed using the Endo-hernia stapler (Control). Animals were recovered and underwent second-look laparoscopy at 6 weeks. Mesh sites were harvested after animals were euthanized. RESULTS The mesh-solder constructs were easily inserted and affixed in an IPOM approach. Prolene mesh tended to curl at its edges as the solder was melted. Postoperative healing was similar to that in Control segments in all cases. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Collagen-based tissue soldering permits normal wound healing and may mitigate or reduce the use of staples or other foreign bodies for laparoscopic mesh fixation, prevent tissue ischemia and possibly nerve entrapment, which result in severe postoperative pain and morbidity. Laser-assisted mesh fixation is a promising alternative for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. Further development of this strategy is warranted.","Lanzafame, Raymond J; Soltz, Barbara A; Stadler, Istvan; Soltz, Robert",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793465/,775

198491,Factors that make an infectious disease outbreak controllable.,2004,"A balance between proteolytic activity and protease inhibition is crucial to the appropriate function of many biological processes. There is mounting evidence for the presence of both papain-like cysteine proteases and serpins with a corresponding inhibitory activity in the nucleus. Well characterized examples of cofactors fine tuning serpin activity in the extracellular milieu are known, but such modulation has not been studied for protease-serpin interactions within the cell. Accordingly, we present an investigation into the effect of a DNA-rich environment on the interaction between model serpins (MENT and SCCA-1), cysteine proteases (human cathepsin V and human cathepsin L), and cystatin A. DNA was indeed found to accelerate the rate at which MENT inhibited cathepsin V, a human orthologue of mammalian cathepsin L, up to 50-fold, but unexpectedly this effect was primarily effected via the protease and secondarily by the recruitment of the DNA as a ""template"" onto which cathepsin V and MENT are bound. Notably, the protease-mediated effect was found to correspond both with an altered substrate turnover and a conformational change within the protease. Consistent with this, cystatin inhibition, which relies on occlusion of the active site rather than the substrate-like behavior of serpins, was unaltered by DNA. This represents the first example of modulation of serpin inhibition of cysteine proteases by a co-factor and reveals a mechanism for differential regulation of cathepsin proteolytic activity in a DNA-rich environment.","Ong, Poh Chee; McGowan, Sheena; Pearce, Mary C; Irving, James A; Kan, Wan-Ting; Grigoryev, Sergei A; Turk, Boris; Silverman, Gary A; Brix, Klaudia; Bottomley, Stephen P; Whisstock, James C; Pike, Robert N",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17923478/,775

METHODS In-situ hybridization(ISH) and immunohistochemistry(IHC) double staining was applied to study the lung tissues from 7 SARS cases of Beijing and one of Anhui province. According to SARS-CoV genome sequence, the cDNA probe was synthesized and labelled by digoxin. Immunohistochemically, antibodies of cytokeratin(CK), CD34, CD68, Vimentin and CD3 were applied to demonstrate bronchial epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts and T cells respectively. RESULTS The positive results of in-situ hybridization showed that the lung tissues of all cases expressed SARS-CoV RNA, and positive signals displayed in cytoplasms (purple-blue, NBP-BCIP. ISH-IHC double staining showed that positive signals of both ISH (purple-blue NBT-BCIP and IHC (red-brown, AEC expressed in the cytoplasms (purple and red). The positive results of double staining indicated that bronchial epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, endothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts and T lymphocytes were diffusely infected by SARS-CoV.

The basis for this extreme susceptibility to toxoplasmosis is unknown. In the present study, the general health status of wild Pallas' cats in Mongolia was evaluated, including assessment of basal hematologic parameters and fecal corticoid metabolite concentrations. The prevalence of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii in Mongolian Pallas' cats, local domestic cats, and prey species also was determined based on serology and/or polymerase chain reaction analysis. Biologic samples (blood, feces, and/or brain tissue) were obtained from 15 wild Pallas' cats, 15 domestic cats, and 45 prey animals (rodents and pikas) captured in Mongolia during the summers of 2000 and 2001. Comparative data were obtained from nine captive Pallas' cats maintained in North American zoos. Based on physical examinations, complete blood counts, and blood chemistry analyses, only minor differences were observed in the general health status of wild and captive Pallas' cats. Fecal cortisol metabolite concentrations did not differ (P > 0.05) between populations, indicating that Pallas' cats in captivity and in the wild have similar basal adrenocortical activity. A pronounced difference (P < 0.01) in seroprevalence to T. gondii was observed between populations. Whereas all captive Pallas' cats exhibited elevated immunoglobulin titers (IgG > 2,048) to T. gondii, only two of 15 (13%) wild Pallas' cats were seropositive, with both cats having lower IgG titers (< 1,024). Furthermore, no evidence of exposure to this parasite was found in any of the Mongolian domestic cats or prey species. These findings suggest that wild Pallas' cats have minimal opportunity for exposure to T. gondii in their natural habitat and, typically, do not become infected with this parasite until being brought into captivity. Accordingly, maintenance of a viable captive population may require implementing effective strategies to prevent exposure of immunologically naive Pallas' cats to T. gondii and to reduce parasite transmission between seropositive females and their highly susceptible offspring.","Brown, Meredith; Lappin, Michael R; Brown, Janine L; Munkhtsog, Bariushaa; Swanson, William F",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16456157/,775

608716,A High-Resolution Human Contact Network for Infectious Disease Transmission,2010-06-23,"As of May 1, 2020, the number of cases of Covid-19 in the US passed 1,062,446, interventions to slow down the spread of Covid-19 curtailed most social activities. Meanwhile, an economic crisis and resistance to the strict intervention measures are rising. Some researchers proposed intermittent social distancing that may drive the outbreak of Covid-19 into 2022. Questions arise about whether we should maintain or relax quarantine measures. We developed novel artificial intelligence and causal inference integrated methods for real-time prediction and control of nonlinear epidemic systems. We estimated that the peak time of the Covid-19 in the US would be April 24, 2020 and its outbreak in the US will be over by the end of July and reach 1,551,901 cases. We evaluated the impact of relaxing the current interventions for reopening economy on the spread of Covid-19. We provide tools for balancing the risks of workers and reopening economy.","Hu, Z.; Ge, Q.; Li, S.; Xu, T.; Boerwinkle, E.; Jin, L.; Xiong, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.20091272v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.20091272,775
655845,Using time-use diaries to track changing behavior across successive stages of COVID-19 social restrictions.,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: The major structural protein of coronaviruses, the membrane (M) protein, can elicit the formation of protective antibodies, but little information is available about the M protein of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Identification of epitopes on the PEDV M protein will be helpful in the elucidation of the antigenic properties of this protein. RESULTS: One hybridoma cell line secreting anti-M protein monoclonal antibody (McAb) was generated and designated 4D4. To map the epitopes on the PEDV M protein, a total of 17 partially overlapping fragments covering the C-terminus of M protein were expressed as fusion proteins with a 6×His tag or a GST tag. A linear motif, (193)TGWAFYVR(200), was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis using McAb 4D4. The motif (195)WAFYVR(200) was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by removing amino acids individually from both ends of the motif (193)TGWAFYVR(200). The result of WB analysis showed that the 4D4-defined epitope could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, but not transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-positive serum. Furthermore, this epitope was highly conserved among different PEDV strains, as shown by alignment and comparison of sequences. CONCLUSION: A McAb, 4D4, directed against the M protein of PEDV, was obtained, and the 4D4-defined minimal epitope sequence was (195)WAFYVR(200). The McAb could serve as a candidate for development of a McAb-based antigen capture ELISA for detection of PEDV. The epitope identified provides a basis for the development of epitope-based differential diagnostic techniques and may be useful in the design of epitope-based vaccines.","Zhang, Zhibang; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Xiaojin; Shi, Da; Feng, Li; Yang, Bin",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23025700/,775
