345,Correcting the Actual Reproduction Number: A Simple Method to Estimate R(0) from Early Epidemic Growth Data,2010-01-21,"The basic reproduction number, R(0), a summary measure of the transmission potential of an infectious disease, is estimated from early epidemic growth rate, but a likelihood-based method for the estimation has yet to be developed. The present study corrects the concept of the actual reproduction number, offering a simple framework for estimating R(0) without assuming exponential growth of cases. The proposed method is applied to the HIV epidemic in European countries, yielding R(0) values ranging from 3.60 to 3.74, consistent with those based on the Euler-Lotka equation. The method also permits calculating the expected value of R(0) using a spreadsheet.","Nishiura, Hiroshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819789/,158
1656,"Spatial Analysis of the Distribution, Risk Factors and Access to Medical Resources of Patients with Hepatitis B in Shenzhen, China",2014-11-07,"Considering the high morbidity of hepatitis B in China, many epidemiological studies based on classic medical statistical analysis have been started but lack spatial information. However, spatial information such as the spatial distribution, autocorrelation and risk factors of the disease is of great help in studying patients with hepatitis B. This study examined 2851 cases of hepatitis B that were hospitalized in Shenzhen in 2010 and studied the spatial distribution, risk factors and spatial access to health services using spatial interpolation, Pearson correlation analysis and the improved two-step floating catchment area method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of hepatitis B, along with risk factors as well as spatial access to the regional medical resources, was uneven and mainly concentrated in the south and southwest of Shenzhen in 2010. In addition, the distribution characteristics of hepatitis B revealed a positive correlation between four types of service establishments and risk factors for the disease. The Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.566, 0.515, 0.626, 0.538 corresponding to bath centres, beauty salons, massage parlours and pedicure parlours (p < 0.05). Additionally, the allocation of medical resources for hepatitis B is adequate, as most patients could be treated at nearby hospitals.","Xi, Yuliang; Ren, Fu; Liang, Shi; Zhang, Jinghua; Lin, De-Nan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245626/,158
2612,"Comparison of Influenza Epidemiological and Virological Characteristics between Outpatients and Inpatients in Zhejiang Province, China, March 2011–June 2015",2017-02-22,"Given the rapid rate of global spread and consequently healthcare costs related to influenza, surveillance plays an important role in monitoring the emerging pandemics in China. However, the characteristics of influenza in Southeast of China haven’t been fully studied. Our study use the surveillance data collected from 16 sentinel hospitals across Zhejiang Province during March 2011 through June 2015, including the demographic information and respiratory specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients. As analysis results, most SARI and ILI patients were in the age group of 0–4 years old (62.38% of ILI and 71.54% of SARI). The respiratory specimens have statistically significantly higher positive rate for influenza among ILI patients than that among SARI patients (p < 0.001). The comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significantly difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype. The SARI and ILI patients were found to be positively correlated for overall positive rate (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), the weekly percentage of A(H1N1)pdm09 (r = 0.51, p < 0.001), influenza B virus (r = 0.17, p = 0.013), and A/H3N2 (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) among all the positive numbers. Our study demonstrated that the activities of influenza virus, including its subtypes, had a similar temporal pattern between ILI and SARI cases.","Cheng, Wei; Yu, Zhao; Liu, Shelan; Zhang, Xueying; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Cai, Jian; Ling, Feng; Chen, Enfu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5334771/,158
2640,"Comparative Epidemiology of Human Fatal Infections with Novel, High (H5N6 and H5N1) and Low (H7N9 and H9N2) Pathogenicity Avian Influenza A Viruses",2017-03-04,"This study aimed to assess the mortality risks for human infection with high (HPAI) and low (LPAI) pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. The HPAI case fatality rate (CFR) was far higher than the LPAI CFR [66.0% (293/444) vs. 68.75% (11/16) vs. 40.4% (265/656) vs. 0.0% (0/18) in the cases with H5N1, H5N6, H7N9, and H9N2 viruses, respectively; p < 0.001]. Similarly, the CFR of the index cases was greater than the secondary cases with H5N1 [100% (43/43) vs. 43.3% (42/97), p < 0.001]. Old age [22.5 vs. 17 years for H5N1, p = 0.018; 61 vs. 49 years for H7H9, p < 0.001], concurrent diseases [18.8% (15/80) vs. 8.33% (9/108) for H5N1, p = 0.046; 58.6% (156/266) vs. 34.8% (135/388) for H7H9, p < 0.001], delayed confirmation [13 vs. 6 days for H5N1, p < 0.001; 10 vs. 8 days for H7N9, p = 0.011] in the fatalities and survivors, were risk factors for deaths. With regard to the H5N1 clusters, exposure to poultry [67.4% (29/43) vs. 45.2% (19/42), p = 0.039] was the higher risk for the primary than the secondary deaths. In conclusion, old age, comorbidities, delayed confirmation, along with poultry exposure are the major risks contributing to fatal outcomes in human HPAI and LPAI infections.","Wu, Zu-Qun; Zhang, Yi; Zhao, Na; Yu, Zhao; Pan, Hao; Chan, Ta-Chien; Zhang, Zhi-Ruo; Liu, She-Lan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369099/,158
3811,Bioaerosols Play a Major Role in the Nasopharyngeal Microbiota Content in Agricultural Environment,2019-04-16,"Background: Bioaerosols are a major concern for public health and sampling for exposure assessment purposes is challenging. The nasopharyngeal region could be a potent carrier of long-term bioaerosol exposure agents. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of swine workers and the swine barns bioaerosol biodiversity. Methods: Air samples from eight swine barns as well as nasopharyngeal swabs from pig workers (n = 25) and from a non-exposed control group (n = 29) were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Wastewater treatment plants were used as the industrial, low-dust, non-agricultural environment control to validate the microbial link between the bioaerosol content (air) and the nasopharynxes of workers. Results: A multivariate analysis showed air samples and nasopharyngeal flora of pig workers cluster together, compared to the non-exposed control group. The significance was confirmed with the PERMANOVA statistical test (p-value of 0.0001). Unlike the farm environment, nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers did not cluster with air samples from wastewater treatment plants. The difference in the microbial community of nasopharynx of swine workers and a control group suggest that swine workers are carriers of germs found in bioaerosols. Conclusion: Nasopharynx sampling and microbiota could be used as a proxy of air sampling for exposure assessment studies or for the determination of exposure markers in highly contaminated agricultural environments.","Mbareche, Hamza; Veillette, Marc; Pilote, Jonathan; Létourneau, Valérie; Duchaine, Caroline",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518280/,158
11709,Evolution of the Output–Workforce Relationship in Primary Care Facilities in China from 2009 to 2017,2020-04-27,"Adhesion is the initial step in the infection process of gram-negative bacteria. It is usually followed by the formation of biofilms that serve as a hub for further spread of the infection. Type V secretion systems engage in this process by binding to components of the extracellular matrix, which is the first step in the infection process. At the same time they provide protection from the immune system by either binding components of the innate immune system or by establishing a physical layer against aggressors. Trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) are of particular interest in this family of proteins as they possess a unique structural composition which arises from constraints during translocation. The sequence of individual domains can vary dramatically while the overall structure can be very similar to one another. This patchwork approach allows researchers to draw conclusions of the underlying function of a specific domain in a structure-based approach which underscores the importance of solving structures of yet uncharacterized TAAs and their individual domains to estimate the full extent of functions of the protein a priori. Here, we describe recent advances in understanding the translocation process of TAAs and give an overview of structural motifs that are unique to this class of proteins. The role of BpaC in the infection process of Burkholderia pseudomallei is highlighted as an exceptional example of a TAA being at the centre of infection initiation.","Kiessling, Andreas R.; Malik, Anchal; Goldman, Adrian",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247746/,158
12153,Optimization of Vehicle Routing for Waste Collection and Transportation,2020-07-09,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: “Sudden death” has been defined by the World Health Organization as a non-violent, unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms. The causes of sudden death have been widely investigated in human forensic medicine. In contrast, few studies have been reported in the veterinary literature. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of sudden deaths in young dogs in different age ranges. A secondary aim was to collect information regarding clinical symptoms, and pathological and microbiological findings related to sudden death in young dogs. The results of the present study demonstrate that the highest frequency of sudden death occurs in animals in an age range from 10 days to 1 month and from 6 to 12 months. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms in cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, Canine parvovirus type 2, E. coli, Canine Distemper Virus, Clostridium perfringens type A, and Pasteurella spp. were the main causes of death observed in the present study. The results reported in the present study could provide a reference basis to better investigate sudden death in veterinary clinical practice. ABSTRACT: In human medicine, “sudden death” has been defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a non-violent, unexpected death occurring less than 24 h from the onset of symptoms. The aims of this study were: (1) to estimate the proportional mortality ratio for “sudden and unexpected death” (SUD) in young dogs; (2) to investigate the pathological and microbiological findings in SUD cases in young dogs. For these purposes, a retrospective study of a total of 145 cases of young dead dogs was performed. For each case, we collected information about the age, medical history and the gross and microbiological findings of the animals. The results of this study found 21 cases of SUD. The most frequently observed clinical symptoms in the cases of sudden death were acute respiratory symptoms, followed by acute gastroenteric symptoms, non-specific symptoms and neurological symptoms. The evaluation of necropsy reports allowed us to observe enteritis in 18 out of 21 cases and pneumonia in seven out of 21 cases. Viral infection with Canine parvovirus type 2 was the most common cause of SUD observed. These results could provide a valuable tool for the investigation of sudden death in young dogs.","Piegari, Giuseppe; Cardillo, Lorena; Alfano, Flora; Vangone, Lucia; Iovane, Valentina; Fusco, Giovanna",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7401551/,158
12580,Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Automated Machine Learning on a National ICD-10 Database,2020-07-10,"During one-lung ventilation (OLV), titrating the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to target a low driving pressure (∆P) could reduce postoperative pulmonary complications. However, it is unclear how to conduct PEEP titration: by stepwise increase starting from zero PEEP (PEEP(INCREMENTAL)) or by stepwise decrease after a lung recruiting manoeuvre (PEEP(DECREMENTAL)). In this randomized trial, we compared the physiological effects of these two PEEP titration strategies on respiratory mechanics, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and gas exchange. Patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in OLV were randomly assigned to a PEEP(INCREMENTAL) or PEEP(DECREMENTAL) strategy to match the lowest ∆P. In the PEEP(INCREMENTAL) group, PEEP was stepwise titrated from ZEEP up to 16 cm H(2)O, whereas in the PEEP(DECREMENTAL) group PEEP was decrementally titrated, starting from 16 cm H(2)O, immediately after a lung recruiting manoeuvre. Respiratory mechanics, ventilation/perfusion mismatch and blood gas analyses were recorded at baseline, after PEEP titration and at the end of surgery. Sixty patients were included in the study. After PEEP titration, shunt decreased similarly in both groups, from 50 [39–55]% to 35 [28–42]% in the PEEP(INCREMENTAL) and from 45 [37–58]% to 33 [25–45]% in the PEEP(DECREMENTAL) group (both p < 0.001 vs baseline). The resulting ∆P, however, was lower in the PEEP(DECREMENTAL) than in the PEEP(INCREMENTAL) group (8 [7–11] vs 10 [9–11] cm H(2)O; p = 0.03). In the PEEP(DECREMENTAL) group the PaO(2)/ FIO(2) ratio increased significantly after intervention (from 140 [99–176] to 186 [152–243], p < 0.001). Both the PEEP(INCREMENTAL) and the PEEP(DECREMENTAL) strategies were able to decrease intraoperative shunt, but only PEEP(DECREMENTAL) improved oxygenation and lowered intraoperative ΔP.

13466,Upper and Lower Respiratory Signs and Symptoms in Workers Occupationally Exposed to Flour Dust,2020-09-27,"Gender-based violence is a widespread phenomenon and pandemic that affects women’s lives. Many interventions have been activated for perpetrators, but the dropout rate is still high. In order to draw up guidelines for responsibly and sustainably dealing with the phenomenon, this study is aimed at investigating the professionals’ perception of the perpetrator as a useful element in designing innovative intervention policies. Open interviews were carried out with welfare and health professionals and the Grounded Theory Methodology was used to analyze the collected data. These results detect attitudes of social health personnel and their feelings of impotence towards gender-based perpetrators because of the emergence of an inevitable repetitiveness of the violent behavior, as well as the “normality of violence” in a patriarchal culture and its “transversality”. This reflective knowledge allows for the opportunity to develop best transformative attitudes toward the phenomenon. According to the results, it is urgent to establish an active and convinced alliance with the healthy part of the man, through specific prevention paths, in order to activate an authentic motivation for change and its sustainability.","Procentese, Fortuna; Fasanelli, Roberto; Carnevale, Stefania; Esposito, Ciro; Pisapia, Noemi; Arcidiacono, Caterina; Napoli, Immacolata Di",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579262/,158
13532,"Trust, Connection and Equity: Can Understanding Context Help to Establish Successful Campus Community Gardens?",2020-10-14,"Self-regulation is the ability to manage emotions, modulate behaviors, and focus attention. This critical skill begins to develop in infancy, improves substantially in early childhood and continues through adolescence, and has been linked to long-term health and well-being. The objectives of this study were to determine risk factors and moderators associated with the three elements of self-regulation (i.e., inattention, emotional control, or behavioral control) as well as overall self-regulation, among children at age 5. Participants were mother–child dyads from the All Our Families study (n = 1644). Self-regulation was assessed at age 5. Risk factors included income, maternal mental health, child sex, and screen time, and potential moderation by parenting and childcare. Adjusted odds ratios of children being at risk for poor self were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Twenty-one percent of children had poor self-regulation skills. Risk factors for poor self-regulation included lower income, maternal mental health difficulties, and male sex. Childcare and poor parenting did not moderate these associations and hostile and ineffective parenting was independently associated with poor self-regulation. Excess screen time (>1 h per day) was associated with poor self-regulation. Self-regulation involves a complex and overlapping set of skills and risk factors that operate differently on different elements. Parenting and participation in childcare do not appear to moderate the associations between lower income, maternal mental health, male sex, and screen time with child self-regulation.","Hetherington, Erin; McDonald, Sheila; Racine, Nicole; Tough, Suzanne",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7602711/,158

This pathway can drive pathological inflammation, as documented for type I interferonopathies. In contrast, specific STING activation and subsequent IFN-β release have shown beneficial effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Although less severe cases of relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) are treated with IFN-β, there is little information correlating aberrant type I IFN signaling and the pathologic conditions of MS. We hypothesized that there is a link between STING activation and the endogenous production of IFN-β during neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis in EAE mice showed that Sting level decreased in the peripheral lymphoid tissue, while its level increased within the central nervous system over the course of the disease. Similar patterns could be verified in peripheral immune cells during the acute phases of RRMS in comparison to remitting phases and appropriately matched healthy controls. Our study is the first to provide evidence that the STING/IFN-β-axis is downregulated in RRMS patients, meriting further intensified research to understand its role in the pathophysiology of MS and potential translational applications.","Masanneck, Lars; Eichler, Susann; Vogelsang, Anna; Korsen, Melanie; Wiendl, Heinz; Budde, Thomas; Meuth, Sven G.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730283/,158

A new generation of molecular tracking that provides both information simultaneously involves in situ detection coupled with non-invasive imaging. An example is antisense imaging that uses antisense oligonucleotide probes complementary to a target nucleotide sequence. In this study, we explored the potential of repurposing antisense oligonucleotides initially developed as antiviral therapeutics as molecular probes for imaging of viral infections in vitro and in vivo. We employed nuclease-resistant phosphorodiamidate synthetic oligonucleotides conjugated with cell-penetrating peptides (i.e., PPMOs) previously established as antivirals for dengue virus serotype-2 (DENV2). As proof of concept, and before further development for preclinical testing, we evaluated its validity as in situ molecular imaging probe for tracking cellular DENV2 infection using live-cell fluorescence imaging. Although the PPMO was designed to specifically target the DENV2 genome, it was unsuitable as in situ molecular imaging probe. This study details our evaluation of the PPMOs to assess specific and sensitive molecular imaging of DENV2 infection and tells a cautionary tale for those exploring antisense oligonucleotides as probes for non-invasive imaging and monitoring of pathogen infections in experimental animal models.","Victorio, Carla Bianca Luena; Novera, Wisna; Tham, Jing Yang; Watanabe, Satoru; Vasudevan, Subhash G.; Chacko, Ann-Marie",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730579/,158

A major hurdle for the development of anti-enterovirus agents is the lack of physiologically relevant evaluation platforms that closely correlate with the in vivo state. We established the human small intestinal organoids as a novel platform for characterizing the viral replication kinetics and evaluating candidate antivirals for enteroviruses. The organoids supported productive replication of enterovirus (EV)-A71, coxsackievirus B2, and poliovirus type 3, as evidenced by increasing viral loads, infectious virus titers, and the presence of cytopathic effects. In contrast, EV-D68, which mainly causes respiratory tract infection in humans, did not replicate significantly in the organoids. The differential expression profiles of the receptors for these enteroviruses correlated with their replication kinetics. Using itraconazole as control, we showed that the results of various antiviral assays, including viral load reduction, plaque reduction, and cytopathic effect inhibition assays, were highly reproducible in the organoids. Moreover, itraconazole attenuated virus-induced inflammatory response in the organoids, which helped to explain its antiviral effects and mechanism. Collectively, these data showed that the human small intestinal organoids may serve as a robust platform for investigating the pathogenesis and evaluating antivirals for enteroviruses.","Tsang, Jessica Oi-Ling; Zhou, Jie; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Li, Cun; Zou, Zijiao; Yin, Feifei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Yeung, Man-Lung; Chu, Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7831294/,158

The external surface of the exosporium is coated with glycosylated proteins. The sugar additions are capped with the unique monosaccharide anthrose. The West African Group (WAG) B. anthracis have mutations rendering them anthrose deficient. Through genome sequencing, we identified 2 different large chromosomal deletions within the anthrose biosynthetic operon of B. anthracis strains from Chile and Poland. In silico analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in B. anthracis Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD(50) and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement B. anthracis Sterne in the A/J mouse model. Following infection, anthrose mutant bacteria were more abundant in the spleen, indicating enhanced dissemination of Sterne anthrose mutant. At low sample sizes in the A/J mouse model, the mortality of ΔantC-infected mice challenged by intranasal or subcutaneous routes was 20% greater than wild type. Competitive index (CI) studies indicated that spores without anthrose disseminated to organs more extensively than a complemented mutant. Death process modeling using mouse mortality dynamics suggested that larger sample sizes would lead to significantly higher deaths in anthrose-negative infected animals. The model was tested by infecting Galleria mellonella with spores and confirmed the anthrose mutant was significantly more lethal. Vaccination studies in the A/J mouse model showed that the human vaccine protected against high-dose challenges of the nonencapsulated Sterne-based anthrose mutant.

15619,Severe Suicidality in Athletes with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Case Series and Overview on Putative Ethiopathogenetic Mechanisms,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: Syndemic theory highlights the potential for health problems to interact synergistically, compounding impact. Young adults not in education, employment or training (NEET) are more likely to experience disadvantage and poorer general health outcomes. However, there is little research on their sexual health, or the extent to which this clusters with mental and physical health outcomes. METHODS: Analysis of data from 16 to 24 year olds (1729 men, 2140 women) interviewed 2010–12 for Britain’s third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles. Natsal-3 is a national probability sample survey using computer-assisted personal interviewing with computer-assisted self-interviewing. Participants were classified as workers, students or NEET. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between being NEET (relative to worker or student) and risk behaviours and outcomes in physical, sexual and mental health domains. We then examined how risk behaviours and poor health outcomes cluster within and across domains. RESULTS: 15% men and 20% women were NEET; 36% men and 32% women were workers; and 49% men and 48% women were students. Young people who were NEET were more likely to report smoking and drug use (men) than other young people. There were few differences in sexual health, although NEETs were more likely to report condomless sex, and NEET women, unplanned pregnancy (past year). Risk behaviours clustered more within and across domains for NEET men. Among NEET women, poor health outcomes clustered across mental, physical and sexual health domains. CONCLUSIONS: Harmful health behaviours (men) and poor health outcomes (women) clustered more in those who are NEET. This points to a possible syndemic effect of NEET status on general ill health, especially for women. Our paper is novel in highlighting that elevated risk pertains to sexual as well as mental and physical health.

Using a cross-sectional study design and convenience sampling, 96 nurses and 68 EMTs were recruited from 12 emergency medical centers. A survey on knowledge about and attitudes toward ADs was performed using both online and offline methods between November and December 2019. Emergency healthcare providers were conceptually knowledgeable regarding ADs and LST, although approximately half or fewer had knowledge about ADs (such as the legal process for preparation, family or healthcare providers’ role, and the healthcare proxy). The knowledge levels of nurses and EMTs were moderate. Nurses had significantly greater knowledge relative to EMTs about ADs and LST. Positive attitudes of emergency healthcare providers were also moderately low, with nurses having less positive views than EMTs. Significant differences regarding ADs were found, with younger emergency healthcare providers having fewer career years, no personal end-of-life experiences, and less need for ADs having less knowledge. Emergency healthcare providers’ knowledge about and attitudes toward ADs were moderately low, with EMTs demonstrating a greater knowledge deficit and nurses exhibiting lower positive attitudes. Younger and novice providers had lower knowledge, but younger providers had more positive attitudes, implying that professional education and training should begin early in their careers to enhance their confidence for emergency delivery of advanced care planning.","Hong, Sun Woo; Kim, Shinmi; Yun, Yu Jin; Jung, Hyun Sook; Shim, JaeLan; Kim, JinShil",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908551/,158

Consequently, tremendous social responsibility lies with public health professionals and their associations. Therefore, this study addressed the following question: “How can the Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) best support the goals of the European Green Deal through its network of public health schools and departments?” This study looked at the implementation of climate education in public health schools in the European region and climate action taken by these public health schools. An online survey among ASPHER members with a 51% overall response rate (excluding non-European members) shows that 64% of the responding schools provide climate-health educational offerings, while 63% consider these for the future. Additionally, most climate actions taken by the schools were ad hoc actions. These findings show that a systematic approach is missing, and there is a general lack of strategy in most schools. We consequently recommend that schools invest in climate and health education in their curricula and become exemplars for climate action to actively contribute to the achievement of Europe’s climate goals.","Orhan, Rana; Middleton, John; Krafft, Thomas; Czabanowska, Katarzyna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914969/,158
15826,Stress and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk for Indigenous Populations throughout the Lifespan,2021-02-13,"Coculture is a productive technique to trigger microbes’ biosynthetic capacity by mimicking the natural habitats’ features principally by competition for food and space and interspecies cross-talks. Mixed cultivation of two Red Sea-derived actinobacteria, Actinokineospora spheciospongiae strain EG49 and Rhodococcus sp. UR59, resulted in the induction of several non-traced metabolites in their axenic cultures, which were detected using LC–HRMS metabolomics analysis. Antimalarial guided isolation of the cocultured fermentation led to the isolation of the angucyclines actinosporins E (1), H (2), G (3), tetragulol (5) and the anthraquinone capillasterquinone B (6), which were not reported under axenic conditions. Interestingly, actinosporins were previously induced when the axenic culture of the Actinokineospora spheciospongiae strain EG49 was treated with signalling molecule N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GluNAc); this finding confirmed the effectiveness of coculture in the discovery of microbial metabolites yet to be discovered in the axenic fermentation with the potential that could be comparable to adding chemical signalling molecules in the fermentation flask. The isolated angucycline and anthraquinone compounds exhibited in vitro antimalarial activity and good biding affinity against lysyl-tRNA synthetase (PfKRS1), highlighting their potential developability as new antimalarial structural motif.","Alhadrami, Hani A.; Thissera, Bathini; Hassan, Marwa H.

Respiratory system involvement is the most common manifestation in symptomatic patients. In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.

Despite its initial success, the program has stalled recently and is yet to achieve national and international targets. We used age- and sex-stratified salt intake of 19 to 64 years old participants in the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys 2000 to 2018 and a multistate life table model to assess the effects of the voluntary dietary salt reduction program on premature CVD, quality-adjusted survival, and health care and social care costs in England. The program reduced population-level salt intake from 9.38 grams/day per adult (SE, 0.16) in 2000 to 8.38 grams/day per adult (SE, 0.17) in 2018. Compared with a scenario of persistent 2000 levels, assuming that the population-level salt intake is maintained at 2018 values, by 2050, the program is projected to avoid 83 140 (95% CI, 73 710–84 520) premature ischemic heart disease (IHD) cases and 110 730 (95% CI, 98 390–112 260) premature strokes, generating 542 850 (95% CI, 529 020–556 850) extra quality-adjusted life-years and £1640 million (95% CI, £1570–£1660) health care cost savings for the adult population of England. We also projected the gains of achieving the World Health Organization target of 5 grams/day per adult by 2030, which by 2050 would avert further 87 870 (95% CI, 82 050–88 470) premature IHD cases, 126 010 (95% CI, 118 600–126 460) premature strokes and achieve £1260 million (95% CI, £1180–£1260) extra health care savings compared with maintaining 2018 levels.

Home-based programs are equally effective in improving exercise capacity, risk factors, mortality, and health-related quality of life outcomes compared to hospital-based intervention. Cardio-telerehabilitation (CTR) programs are a supplement or an alternative to hospital rehabilitation programs providing similar benefits to usual hospital and home care.

The main objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and adherence of a personalized eight-week mHealth telerehabilitation program in low-risk cardiac patients in the hospital of Melilla (Spain). The secondary aims were to investigate patient satisfaction, identify barriers of implementation and adverse events, and assess cost-effectiveness from a health system perspective. A study protocol for a single center prospective controlled trial was conducted at the Regional Hospital of Melilla (Spain), with a sample size of (n = 30) patients with a diagnosis of low-risk CVD with class I heart failure according to NYHA (New York Heart Association).

Changes in microbiota composition have been observed in patients who were developing acute diverticulitis, with a reduction of taxa with anti-inflammatory activity, such as Clostridium cluster IV, Lactobacilli and Bacteroides. Recent observations supported that a dysbiosis characterised by decreased presence of anti-inflammatory bacterial species might be linked to mucosal inflammation, and a vicious cycle results from a mucosal inflammation driving dysbiosis at the same time. An alteration in gut microbiota can lead to an altered activation of nerve fibres, and subsequent neuronal and muscular dysfunction, thus favoring abdominal symptoms’ development. The possible role of dysbiosis and mucosal inflammation in leading to dysmotility is linked, in turn, to bacterial translocation from the lumen of the diverticulum to perivisceral area. There, a possible activation of Toll-like receptors has been described, with a subsequent inflammatory reaction at the level of the perivisceral tissues. Being aware that bacterial colonisation of diverticula is involved in the pathogenesis of acute diverticulitis, the rationale for the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of this disease becomes clearer. For this review, articles were identified using the electronic PubMed database through a comprehensive search conducted by combining key terms such as “gut microbiota”, “probiotics and gut disease”, “probiotics and acute diverticulitis”, “probiotics and diverticular disease”, “probiotics mechanism of action”. However, the amount of data present on this matter is not sufficient to draw robust conclusions on the efficacy of probiotics for symptoms’ management in diverticular disease.","Piccioni, Andrea; Franza, Laura; Brigida, Mattia; Zanza, Christian; Torelli, Enrico; Petrucci, Martina; Nicolò, Rebecca; Covino, Marcello; Candelli, Marcello; Saviano, Angela; Ojetti, Veronica; Franceschi, Francesco",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8070761/,158

Phlorotannins’ structures are formed by dibenzodioxin, ether and phenyl, ether, or phenyl linkages. The polymerization of phlorotannins is used to classify and characterize. The structural diversity of phlorotannins grows as polymerization increases. They have been characterized extensively with respect to chemical properties and functionality. However, review papers of the biological activities of phlorotannins have focused on their antibacterial and antiviral effects, and reviews of their broad antifungal and larvicidal effects are lacking. Accordingly, evidence for the effectiveness of phlorotannins as antifungal and larvicidal agents is discussed in this review. Online databases (ScienceDirect, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were used to identify relevant articles. In total, 11 articles were retrieved after duplicates were removed and exclusion criteria were applied. Phlorotannins from brown seaweeds show antifungal activity against dermal and plant fungi, and larvicidal activity against mosquitos and marine invertebrate larvae. However, further studies of the biological activity of phlorotannins against fungal and parasitic infections in aquaculture fish, livestock, and companion animals are needed for systematic analyses of their effectiveness.

As a strong Michael acceptor, dehydroalanine in proteins has been explored to undergo reactions with different thiolate reagents for making close analogues of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including a variety of lysine PTMs. The chemical reagent 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid (NTCB) selectively modifies cysteine to form S-cyano-cysteine, in which the S–Cβ bond is highly polarized. We explored the labile nature of this bond for triggering E2 elimination to generate dehydroalanine. Our results indicated that when cysteine is at the flexible C-terminal end of a protein, the dehydroalanine formation is highly effective. We produced ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins with a C-terminal dehydroalanine residue with high yields. When cysteine is located at an internal region of a protein, the efficiency of the reaction varies with mainly hydrolysis products observed. Dehydroalanine in proteins such as ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins can serve as probes for studying pathways involving ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins and it is also a starting point to generate proteins with many PTM analogues; therefore, we believe that this NTCB-triggered dehydroalanine formation method will find broad applications in studying ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein pathways and the functional annotation of many PTMs in proteins such as histones.","Qiao, Yuchen; Yu, Ge; Leeuwon, Sunshine Z.; Liu, Wenshe Ray",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125731/,158

In this paper, we consider two different xylanases from the GH-11 family: the particularly active GH-11 xylanase from Neocallimastix patriciarum, NpXyn11A, and the hyper-thermostable mutant of the environmentally isolated GH-11 xylanase, EvXyn11(TS). Our aim is to identify the molecular determinants underlying the enhanced capacities of these two enzymes to ultimately graft the abilities of one on the other. Molecular dynamics simulations of the respective free-enzymes and enzyme–xylohexaose complexes were carried out at temperatures of 300, 340, and 500 K. An in-depth analysis of these MD simulations showed how differences in dynamics influence the activity and stability of these two enzymes and allowed us to study and understand in greater depth the molecular and structural basis of these two systems. In light of the results presented in this paper, the thumb region and the larger substrate binding cleft of NpXyn11A seem to play a major role on the activity of this enzyme. Its lower thermal stability may instead be caused by the higher flexibility of certain regions located further from the active site. Regions such as the N-ter, the loops located in the fingers region, the palm loop, and the helix loop seem to be less stable than in the hyper-thermostable EvXyn11(TS). By identifying molecular regions that are critical for the stability of these enzymes, this study allowed us to identify promising targets for engineering GH-11 xylanases. Eventually, we identify NpXyn11A as the ideal host for grafting the thermostabilizing traits of EvXyn11(TS).","Vucinic, Jelena; Novikov, Gleb; Montanier, Cédric Y.; Dumon, Claire; Schiex, Thomas; Barbe, Sophie",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199483/,158

In this study, 102 effective samples 28 (April–May), 19 (July–August), 27 (September–October), 28 (December–January) of PM(2.5) were collected during different seasons from 2017 to 2018. The water-soluble ions and metal elements in PM(2.5) were analyzed via ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. The blood routine physical examination parameters under different polluted weather conditions from January to December 2017 and 2018, the corresponding PM(2.5) concentration, temperature, and relative humidity during the same period were collected from Second People’s Hospital of Xinxiang during 2017–2018. Risk assessment was carried out using the generalized additive time series model (GAM). It was used to analyze the influence of PM(2.5) concentration and its components on blood routine indicators of the physical examination population. The “mgcv” package in R.3.5.3 statistical software was used for modeling and analysis and used to perform nonparametric smoothing on meteorological indicators such as temperature and humidity. When Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) value is the smallest, the goodness of fit of the model is the highest. Additionally, the US EPA exposure model was used to evaluate the health risks caused by different heavy metals in PM(2.5) to the human body through the respiratory pathway, including carcinogenic risk and non-carcinogenic risk. The result showed that the air particulate matter and its chemical components in Xinxiang City were higher in winter as compared to other seasons with an overall trend of winter > spring > autumn > summer. The content of nitrate (NO(3)(−)) and sulfate (SO(4)(2)(−)) ions in the atmosphere were higher in winter, which, together with ammonium, constitute the main components of water-soluble ions in PM(2.5) in Xinxiang City. Source analysis reported that mobile pollution sources (coal combustion emissions, automobile exhaust emissions, and industrial emissions) in Xinxiang City during the winter season contributed more to atmospheric pollution as compared to fixed sources. The results of the risk assessment showed that the non-carcinogenic health risk of heavy metals in fine particulate matter is acceptable to the human body, while among the carcinogenic elements, the order of lifetime carcinogenic risk is arsenic (As) > chromium(Cr) > cadmium (Cd) > cobalt(Co) > nickel (Ni). During periods of haze pollution, the exposure concentration of PM(2.5) has a certain lag effect on blood routine parameters. On the day when haze pollution occurs, when the daily average concentration of PM(2.5) rises by 10 μg·m(−3), hemoglobin (HGB) and platelet count (PLT) increase, respectively, by 9.923% (95% CI, 8.741–11.264) and 0.068% (95% CI, 0.067–0.069). GAM model analysis predicted the maximum effect of PM(2.5) exposure concentration on red blood cell count (RBC) and PLT was reached when the hysteresis accumulates for 1d (Lag0). The maximum effect of exposure concentration ofPM(2.5) on MONO is reached when the lag accumulation is 3d (Lag2). When the hysteresis accumulates for 6d (Lag5), the exposure concentration of PM(2.5) has the greatest effect on HGB. The maximum cumulative effect of PM(2.5) on neutrophil count (NEUT) and lymphocyte (LMY) was strongest when the lag was 2d (Lag1). During periods of moderate to severe pollution, the concentration of water-soluble ions and heavy metal elements in PM(2.5) increases significantly and has a significant correlation with some blood routine indicators.","Wang, Shuang; Kaur, Mandeep; Li, Tengfei; Pan, Feng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8297198/,158

For prediction, the two methodologies were selected (Schall 03 and Methodical instructions for the calculation of sound pressure level from transport). The results show that the Schall 03 method is sensitive to the measurement location (the value reaches half of the significance level) and to the location–period interaction. The second prediction method is sensitive to systematic error (absolute term) and, such as Schall 03, to the location–period interaction. This method systematically overestimates the results.

19382,"The Olfactory System as Marker of Neurodegeneration in Aging, Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Disorders",2021-06-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Big data has created many opportunities to improve both preventive medicine and medical treatments. In the field of veterinary medical big data, information collected from companion animals, primarily dogs, can be used to inform healthcare decisions in both dogs and other species. Currently, veterinary medical datasets are an underused resource for translational research, but recent advances in data collection in this population have helped to make these data more accessible for use in translational studies. The largest open access dataset in the United States is part of the Dog Aging Project and includes detailed information about individual dog participant’s physical and chemical environments, diet, exercise, behavior, and comprehensive health history. These data are collected longitudinally and at regular intervals over the course of the dog’s lifespan. Large-scale datasets such as this can be used to inform our understanding of health, disease, and how to increase healthy lifespan. ABSTRACT: Dogs provide an ideal model for study as they have the most phenotypic diversity and known naturally occurring diseases of all non-human land mammals. Thus, data related to dog health present many opportunities to discover insights into health and disease outcomes. Here, we describe several sources of veterinary medical big data that can be used in research. These sources include medical records from primary medical care centers or referral hospitals, medical claims data from animal insurance companies, and datasets constructed specifically for research purposes. No data source provides information that is without limitations, but large-scale, prospective, longitudinally collected data from dog populations are ideal for further research as they offer many advantages over other data sources.","Paynter, Ashley N.; Dunbar, Matthew D.; Creevy, Kate E.; Ruple, Audrey",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8300140/,158
19822,The Lifestyle of Saudi Medical Students,2021-07-25,"Before the introduction of universal vaccination, hepatitis B caused high morbidity and mortality, especially among healthcare workers. In the present study, the immune status against hepatitis B was assessed in a cohort of 11,188 students of the degree courses of the School of Medicine of the University of Padua (Italy) who had been subjected to mandatory vaccination in childhood or adolescence and who will be future healthcare workers. The variables that influence the antibody response to vaccination are mainly the age at which the vaccine was administered and sex. If vaccination was administered before one year of age, there is a high probability (around 50%) of having an antibody titer lower than 10 IU/L compared to those vaccinated after one year of age (12.8%). The time between vaccine and analysis is not decisive. Furthermore, female sex, but only if vaccination was administered after one year of age, shows a significant (p = 0.0008) lower percentage of anti-HBs below 10 IU/L and a greater antibody titer (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the differences related to the age of vaccination induce more doubts than answers. The only plausible hypothesis, in addition to the different immune responses (innate and adaptive), is the type of vaccine. This is not easy to verify because vaccination certificates rarely report it.","Trevisan, Andrea; Mason, Paola; Nicolli, Annamaria; Maso, Stefano; Fonzo, Marco; Scarpa, Bruno; Bertoncello, Chiara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8345783/,158
19840,"Resilience in Sports: Sport Type, Gender, Age and Sport Level Differences",2021-08-03,"Functional foods or drinks prepared using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have recently gained considerable attention because they can offer additional nutritional and health benefits. The present study aimed to develop functional drinks by the fermentation of buttermilk and soymilk preparations using the Pediococcus acidilactici BD16 (alaD(+)) strain expressing the L-alanine dehydrogenase enzyme. LAB fermentation was carried out for 24 h and its impact on the physicochemical and quality attributes of the fermented drinks was evaluated. Levels of total antioxidants, phenolics, flavonoids, and especially L-alanine enhanced significantly after LAB fermentation. Further, GC-MS-based metabolomic fingerprinting was performed to identify the presence of bioactive metabolites such as 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1-dodecene, 2-aminononadecane, 3-octadecene, 4-octen-3-one, acetic acid, azanonane, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, chloroacetic acid, colchicine, heptadecanenitrile, hexadecanal, quercetin, and triacontane, which could be accountable for the improvement of organoleptic attributes and health benefits of the drinks. Meanwhile, the levels of certain undesirable metabolites such as 1-pentadecene, 2-bromopropionic acid, 8-heptadecene, formic acid, and propionic acid, which impart bitterness, rancidity, and unpleasant odor to the fermented drinks, were reduced considerably after LAB fermentation. This study is probably the first of its kind that highlights the application of P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD(+)) as a starter culture candidate for the production of functional buttermilk and soymilk.","Sharma, Anshula; Noda, Masafumi; Sugiyama, Masanori; Ahmad, Ajaz; Kaur, Baljinder",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8347781/,158
20360,Socioeconomic Inequalities in Chronic Liver Diseases and Cirrhosis Mortality in European Urban Areas before and after the Onset of the 2008 Economic Recession,2021-08-20,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the indications of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy among patients with mild hypercapnia and to explore the predictors of intubation when HFNC fails. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Adult patients with mild hypercapnia (45 < PaCO(2) ≤ 60 mmHg) received either HFNC or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) oxygen therapy. Propensity score matching (PSM) was implemented to increase between-group comparability. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate overall survival and cumulative intubation rates, while 28-day mortality and 48-h and 28-day intubation rates were compared using the Chi-squared test. The predictive performances of HR/SpO(2) and the ROX index (the ratio of SpO(2)/FiO(2) to respiratory rate) at 4 h were assessed regarding HFNC failure, which was determined if intubation was given within 48 h after the initiation of oxygen therapy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for HR/SpO(2) and the ROX index were calculated and compared. RESULTS: A total of 524,520 inpatient hospitalization records were screened, 106 patients in HFNC group and 106 patients in NIV group were successfully matched. No significant difference in 48-h intubation rate between the HFNC group (the treatment group) and the NIV group (the control group) (14.2% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.278); patients receiving HFNC had higher 28-day intubation rate (26.4% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.029), higher 28-day mortality (17.9% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.043), and longer ICU length of stay (4.4 vs. 3.3 days, p = 0.019), compared to those of NIV group. The AUC of HR/SpO(2) at 4 h after the initiation of HFNC yielded around 0.660 for predicting 48-h intubation, greater than that of the ROX index with an AUC of 0.589 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with impending respiratory failure had lower intubation rate, shorter ICU length of stay, and lower mortality when treated mild hypercapnia with NIV over HFNC. As opposed to the ROX index, a modest, yet improved predictive performance is demonstrated using HR/SpO(2) in predicting the failure of HFNC among these patients.","Su, Lingling; Zhao, Qinyu; Liu, Taotao; Xu, Yujun; Li, Weichun; Zhang, Aiping",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391867/,158

While it is well established that endogenously derived oxidized lipids are ligands of the transcription factor PPARγ, the binding ability of diet-derived oxidized lipids is unknown. Our two-fold objective was to determine the oxidized lipid content and PPARγ binding ability of commonly consumed foods. Extracted food lipids were assayed for the peroxide value, conjugated dienes, and aldehydes, and PPARγ binding was assessed by an in vitro PPARγ ligand screening assay. Oxidized lipids were present in all foods tested at the time of purchase, and oxidation did not increase during storage. The peroxide values for walnuts, sunflower seeds, and flax meal were significantly lower at the end of three months as compared to the day of purchase (peroxide value: 1.26 ± 0.13 vs. 2.32 ± 0.4; 1.65 ± 0.23 vs. 2.08 ± 0.09; 3.07 ± 0.22 vs. 9.94 ± 0.75 mEq/kg fat, p ≤ 0.05, respectively). Lipids extracted from French fries had the highest binding affinity (50.87 ± 11.76%) to PPARγ compared to other foods. Our work demonstrates that oxidized lipids are present in commonly consumed foods when purchased, and for the first time demonstrates that some contain ligands of PPARγ.","Skinner, Joanna; Arora, Payal; McMath, Nicole; Penumetcha, Meera",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393428/,158

To date, numerous methods of detecting the JAK2 V617F mutation have been reported, but there is no gold-standard diagnostic method for clinical applications. Here, we developed and validated an efficient Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 12a (Cas12a)-based assay to detect the JAK2 V617F mutation. Our results showed that the sensitivity of the JAK2 V617F/Cas12a fluorescence detection system was as high as 0.01%, and the JAK2 V617F/Cas12a lateral flow strip assay could unambiguously detect as low as 0.5% of the JAK2 V617F mutation, which was much higher than the sensitivity required for clinical application. The minimum detectable concentration of genomic DNA achieved was 0.01 ng/μL (~5 aM, ~3 copies/μL). In addition, the whole process only took about 1.5 h, and the cost of an individual test was much lower than that of the current assays. Thus, our methods can be applied to detect the JAK2 V617F mutation, and they are highly sensitive, rapid, cost-effective, and convenient.","Chen, Miaomiao; Zhang, Chunhua; Hu, Zhiqing; Li, Zhuo; Li, Menglin; Wu, Lingqian; Zhou, Miaojin; Liang, Desheng",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394843/,158
20435,The Significance of Occupants’ Interaction with Their Environment on Reducing Cooling Loads and Dermatological Distresses in East Mediterranean Climates,2021-08-23,"The clinical success of cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin has sparked the interest of medicinal inorganic chemistry to synthesize and study compounds with non-platinum metal centers. Despite Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes being widely studied and well established for their antitumor properties, there are not enough in vivo studies to establish the potentiality of this type of compound. Therefore, we report to the best of our knowledge the first in vivo study of Ru(II)–polypyridyl complexes against breast cancer with promising results. In order to conduct our study, we used MCF7 zebrafish xenografts and ruthenium complexes [Ru(bipy)(2)(C(12)H(8)N(6)-N,N)][CF(3)SO(3)](2) Ru1 and [{Ru(bipy)(2)}(2)(μ-C(12)H(8)N(6)-N,N)][CF(3)SO(3)](4) Ru2, which were recently developed by our group. Ru1 and Ru2 reduced the tumor size by an average of 30% without causing significant signs of lethality when administered at low doses of 1.25 mg·L(−1). Moreover, the in vitro selectivity results were confirmed in vivo against MCF7 breast cancer cells. Surprisingly, this work suggests that both the mono- and the dinuclear Ru(II)–polypyridyl compounds have in vivo potential against breast cancer, since there were no significant differences between both treatments, highlighting Ru1 and Ru2 as promising chemotherapy agents in breast cancer therapy.","Lenis-Rojas, Oscar A.; Roma-Rodrigues, Catarina; Fernandes, Alexandra R.; Carvalho, Andreia; Cordeiro, Sandra; Guerra-Varela, Jorge; Sánchez, Laura; Vázquez-García, Digna; López-Torres, Margarita; Fernández, Alberto; Fernández, Jesús J.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396206/,158
20967,Imaging of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Malaria eradication requires a combined effort involving all available control tools, and these efforts would be complemented by an effective vaccine. The antigen targets of immune responses may show polymorphisms that can undermine their recognition by immune effectors and hence render vaccines based on antigens from a single parasite variant ineffective against other variants. This study compared the influence of allelic polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) peptide sequences from three strains of P. falciparum (3D7, 7G8 and FVO) on their function as immunodominant targets of T cell responses in high and low malaria transmission communities in Ghana. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 subjects from a high transmission area (Obom) and 10 subjects from a low transmission area (Legon) were tested against 15 predicted CD8 + T cell minimal epitopes within the PfAMA1 antigen of multiple parasite strains using IFN-γ ELISpot assay. The peptides were also tested in similar assays against CD8 + enriched PBMC fractions from the same subjects in an effort to characterize the responding T cell subsets. RESULTS: In assays using unfractionated PBMCs, two subjects from the high transmission area, Obom, responded positively to four (26.7%) of the 15 tested peptides. None of the Legon subject PBMCs yielded positive peptide responses using unfractionated PBMCs. In assays with CD8 + enriched PBMCs, three subjects from Obom made positive recall responses to six (40%) of the 15 tested peptides, while only one subject from Legon made a positive recall response to a single peptide. Overall, 5 of the 20 study subjects who had positive peptide-specific IFN-γ recall responses were from the high transmission area, Obom. Furthermore, while subjects from Obom responded to peptides in PfAMA1 from multiple parasite strains, one subject from Legon responded to a peptide from 3D7 strain only. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate the possibility of a real effect of PfAMA1 polymorphisms on the induction of T cell responses in malaria exposed subjects, and this effect may be more pronounced in communities with higher parasite exposure.

Possible regions with RNA modifications were found in the negative-strand segments of viral genomic RNA. In addition, our analyses of previously published data revealed that the expression levels of the host factors for RNA modifications were affected by an infection with influenza A virus, and some of the host factors likely have a proviral effect. RNA modification is a novel aspect of host–virus interactions leading to the discovery of previously unrecognized viral pathogenicity mechanisms and has the potential to aid the development of novel antivirals.","Furuse, Yuki",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431438/,158

These alterations are triggered by genetic and epigenetic alterations in genes that control cell homeostasis. Increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) induced by different enzymes and reactions with distinct molecules contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression by modifying DNA, proteins, and lipids, altering their activities. Nitric oxide synthase plays a central role in oncogenic signaling modulation and redox landscape. Overexpression of the three NOS isoforms has been found in innumerous types of cancer contributing to tumor growth and development. Although the main function of NOS is the production of nitric oxide (NO), it can be a source of ROS in some pathological conditions. Decreased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactor availability is involved in NOS dysfunction, leading to ROS production and reduced levels of NO. The regulation of NOSs by BH4 in cancer is controversial since BH4 has been reported as a pro-tumoral or an antitumoral molecule. Therefore, in this review, the role of BH4 in the control of NOS activity and its involvement in the capabilities acquired along tumor progression of different cancers was described.","Gonçalves, Diego Assis; Jasiulionis, Miriam Galvonas; de Melo, Fabiana Henriques Machado",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431490/,158

The aim of this study was to estimate the socio-economic burden of breast cancer (BC) in Italy both from the National Health Service (NHS) and the government perspectives (costs borne by the social security system). Methods: The economic analysis was based on the costs incurred by the NHS from 2008 to 2016 (direct costs related to hospitalizations) and by the National Social Security Institute (INPS) from 2009 to 2015 (costs of social security benefits) for patients with breast cancer. The analysis was based on the Hospital Information System (HIS) and Disability Insurance Awards databases. For both databases, patients affected by a malignant neoplasm of the female breast, carcinoma in situ, or secondary malignant neoplasm of the breast were considered. Results: Results show that more than 75,000 women were hospitalized for breast cancer every year, with an overall cost for hospitalization of about €300 million per year. From the Social Security analysis, a number of 29,000 beneficiaries each year was estimated. Considering per patient social costs, breast cancer at the primary stage cost €8828 per year, while secondary neoplasms cost €9780, with an average total economic burden of €257 million per year.

This study aims to build structured CT-based reports for lymphoma patients during the staging phase to improve communication between radiologists, members of multidisciplinary teams, and patients. A panel of expert radiologists, members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM), was established. A modified Delphi process was used to develop the SR and to assess a level of agreement for all report sections. The Cronbach’s alpha (Cα) correlation coefficient was used to assess internal consistency for each section and to measure quality analysis according to the average inter-item correlation. The final SR version was divided into four sections: (a) Patient Clinical Data, (b) Clinical Evaluation, (c) Imaging Protocol, and (d) Report, including n = 13 items in the “Patient Clinical Data” section, n = 8 items in the “Clinical Evaluation” section, n = 9 items in the “Imaging Protocol” section, and n = 32 items in the “Report” section. Overall, 62 items were included in the final version of the SR. A dedicated section of significant images was added as part of the report. In the first Delphi round, all sections received more than a good rating (≥3). The overall mean score of the experts and the sum of score for structured report were 4.4 (range 1–5) and 1524 (mean value of 101.6 and standard deviation of 11.8). The Cα correlation coefficient was 0.89 in the first round. In the second Delphi round, all sections received more than an excellent rating (≥4). The overall mean score of the experts and the sum of scores for structured report were 4.9 (range 3–5) and 1694 (mean value of 112.9 and standard deviation of 4.0). The Cα correlation coefficient was 0.87 in this round. The highest overall means value, highest sum of scores of the panelists, and smallest standard deviation values of the evaluations in this round reflect the increase of the internal consistency and agreement among experts in the second round compared to first round. The accurate statement of imaging data given to referring physicians is critical for patient care; the information contained affects both the decision-making process and the subsequent treatment. The radiology report is the most important source of clinical imaging information. It conveys critical information about the patient’s health and the radiologist’s interpretation of medical findings. It also communicates information to the referring physicians and records this information for future clinical and research use. The present SR was generated based on a multi-round consensus-building Delphi exercise and uses standardized terminology and structures, in order to adhere to diagnostic/therapeutic recommendations and facilitate enrolment in clinical trials, to reduce any ambiguity that may arise from non-conventional language, and to enable better communication between radiologists and clinicians.","Granata, Vincenza; Pradella, Silvia; Cozzi, Diletta; Fusco, Roberta; Faggioni, Lorenzo; Coppola, Francesca; Grassi, Roberta; Maggialetti, Nicola; Buccicardi, Duccio; Lacasella, Giorgia Viola; Montella, Marco; Ciaghi, Eleonora; Bellifemine, Francesco; De Filippo, Massimo; Rengo, Marco; Bortolotto, Chandra; Prost, Roberto; Barresi, Carmelo; Cappabianca, Salvatore; Brunese, Luca; Neri, Emanuele; Grassi, Roberto; Miele, Vittorio",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432477/,158
20991,The Cross-Level Moderation Effect of Resource-Providing Leadership on the Demands—Work Ability Relationship,2021-08-28,"Polyurethanes are a very important group of polymers with an extensive range of applications in different branches of industry. In the form of foams, they are mainly used in bedding, furniture, building, construction, and automotive sectors. Due to human safety reasons, these applications require an appropriate level of flame retardance, often required by various law regulations. Nevertheless, without the proper modifications, polyurethane foams are easily ignitable, highly flammable, and generate an enormous amount of smoke during combustion. Therefore, proper modifications or additives should be introduced to reduce their flammability. Except for the most popular phosphorus-, halogen-, or nitrogen-containing flame retardants, promising results were noted for the application of clays. Due to their small particle size and flake-like shape, they induce a “labyrinth effect” inside the foam, resulting in the delay of decomposition onset, reduction of smoke generation, and inhibition of heat, gas, and mass transfer. Moreover, clays can be easily modified with different organic compounds or used along with conventional flame retardants. Such an approach may often result in the synergy effect, which provides the exceptional reduction of foams’ flammability. This paper summarizes the literature reports related to the applications of clays in the reduction of polyurethane foams’ flammability, either by their incorporation as a nanofiller or by preparation of coatings.","Hejna, Aleksander",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432671/,158

A diversity of treatment options as well as a rising population require novel diagnostic tools. The main goal of the research was to develop a novel complex colorectal cancer decision support system based on artificial intelligence. The developed system can classify eight classes of tissue and can identify the malignant areas. In order to allow the easiest and most intuitive interaction with clinicians, the corresponding application was also built. ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and ranks third worldwide in diagnosed malignant pathologies (1.36 million new cases annually). An increase in the diversity of treatment options as well as a rising population require novel diagnostic tools. Current diagnostics involve critical human thinking, but the decisional process loses accuracy due to the increased number of modulatory factors involved. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis system analyses each colonoscopy and provides predictions that will help the clinician to make the right decisions. Artificial intelligence is included in the system both offline and online image processing tools. Aiming to improve the diagnostic process of colon cancer patients, an application was built that allows the easiest and most intuitive interaction between medical staff and the proposed diagnosis system. The developed tool uses two networks. The first, a convolutional neural network, is capable of classifying eight classes of tissue with a sensitivity of 98.13% and an F1 score of 98.14%, while the second network, based on semantic segmentation, can identify the malignant areas with a Jaccard index of 75.18%.

Methods: questionnaires were completed by a culturally diverse sample of undergraduate students measuring locus-of-hope, individualist and collectivist relational tendencies, self-esteem, insecure attachment, and gender. Results: State and trait locus-of-hope were significantly correlated. Individualism showed positive correlations with internal and external—family locus-of-hope. Collectivism positively correlated with internal locus-of-hope and the three external locus-of-hope dimensions. Internal locus-of-hope was significantly predicted by self-esteem, relational self-esteem, individualism, and collectivism. External—spiritual locus-of-hope was not significantly predicted by the variables. External—family locus-of-hope was significantly predicted by relational self-esteem and collectivism and external—peer locus-of hope was significantly predicted by relational self-esteem, collectivism, and avoidant attachment style. No significant gender differences in locus-of-hope were found.

The five-factor structure (perceptual, emotional distress, behavioral, proposal to change, and fear of gaining weight) show adequate fit indices and validity, even though the obtained model does not completely correspond to that proposed by the authors of the scale, it continues to endorse the multifactorial component of body dissatisfaction. On the other hand, the factorial structure, the factor loadings, and the intercepts are considered invariant in both populations; however, there are differences between the populations for the means of the perceptual, emotional distress, and fear of gaining weight factors. This study serves as a premise for future research on the study of instruments for measuring body image in populations with different personal and cultural factors.","Nájera-Longoria, Raúl Josué; Blanco, José René; Jiménez-Lira, Carolina; Aguirre, Susana Ivonne; Blanco, Humberto; Conchas-Ramírez, Miguel; Rangel-Ledezma, Yunuen Socorro; Jurado-García, Perla Jannet",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470226/,158

We evaluated retrospectively the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) in such patients after switching from Free Style Libre 1 (FSL1) to Dexcom G4 (DG4) biosensors over 1 year. Patients (n = 21, 43 ± 15 years, BMI 25 ± 5, HbA1c 8.1 ± 1.0%) had severe hypoglycemia and/or HbA1c ≥ 8%. AGP metrics (time-in-range (TIR) 70–180 mg/dL, time-below-range (TBR) <70 mg/dL or <54 mg/dL, glucose coefficient of variation (%CV), time-above-range (TAR) >180 mg/dL or >250 mg/dL, glucose management indicator (GMI), average glucose) were collected the last 3 months of FSL1 use (M0) and of DG4 for 3, 6 (M6) and 12 (M12) months of use. Values were means ± standard deviation or medians [Q1;Q3]. At M12 versus M0, the higher TIR (50 ± 17 vs. 45 ± 16, p = 0.036), and lower TBR < 70 mg/dL (2.5 [1.6;5.5] vs. 7.0 [4.5;12.5], p = 0.0007), TBR < 54 mg/dL (0.7 [0.4;0.8] vs. 2.3 [0.8;7.0], p = 0.007) and %CV (39 ± 5 vs. 45 ± 8, p = 0.0009), evidenced a long-term effectiveness of the switch. Compared to M6, TBR < 70 mg/dL decreased, %CV remained stable, while the improvement on hyperglycemia exposure decreased (higher GMI, TAR and average glucose). This switch was a relevant therapeutic option, though a loss of benefit on hyperglycemia stressed the need for optimized management of threshold alarms. Nevertheless, few patients attained the recommended values for AGP metrics, and the reasons why some patients are “responders” vs. “non-responders” warrant to be investigated.","Préau, Yannis; Galie, Sébastien; Schaepelynck, Pauline; Armand, Martine; Raccah, Denis",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473395/,158

In this day and age, there are no more relevant, pressing, or internationally ubiquitous news stories than those related to COVID-19. For L2 learners to have a seat at the global table, it is necessary to learn languages using news stories. Hence, the current study applied text mining techniques to explore and identify patterns among news stories related to COVID-19. In the study, a corpus collecting online news reports about COVID-19 was analyzed. A number of R packages including readtext, tidytext, ggplot2, and ggraph were jointly employed to extract key phrases and construct a graphic model underlying the news corpus. A popular term-extraction method often used in text mining—term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)—was utilized to extract the key phrases from the news reports on the COVID-19 virus. A wordnet structure was then established to uncover potentially salient thematic components. The pedagogical implications for language education and vocabulary assessment are further discussed.","Tseng, Wen-Ta",English Teaching & Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7749745/,158

These cells each bear a single actin-rich rod-like apical projection extending 5–10 μm from the epithelial surface. Live imaging with a ubiquitous Lifeact-RFP label indicates that the olfactory rods can oscillate. Olfactory rods arise within a few hours of the olfactory pit opening, increase in numbers and size during larval stages, and can develop in the absence of olfactory cilia. Olfactory rod cells differ in morphology from the known classes of olfactory sensory neuron, but express reporters driven by neuronal promoters. A sub-population of olfactory rod cells expresses a Lifeact-mRFPruby transgene driven by the sox10 promoter. Mosaic expression of this transgene reveals that olfactory rod cells have rounded cell bodies located apically in the olfactory epithelium and have no detectable axon. We offer speculation on the possible function of these cells in the Discussion.","Cheung, King Yee; Jesuthasan, Suresh J.; Baxendale, Sarah; van Hateren, Nicholas J.; Marzo, Mar; Hill, Christopher J.; Whitfield, Tanya T.",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7952648/,158

51439,"Item Reduction, Psychometric and Biometric Properties of the Italian Version of the Body Perception Questionnaire—Short Form (BPQ-SF): The BPQ-22",2021-04-06,"Background: It is well known that the quality of social relationships is related to mental health, particularly in the face of adversity. Social relationships are complex and can perhaps not be fully understood from a purely individual perspective. Recent contributions have highlighted the need for a societal or ecological approach (Ajduković, 2013; Bryant, 2016; Maercker & Hecker, 2016). In this study, we expand on previous social relationships research by investigating generalized trust (the belief that most other people can be trusted) during the COVID-19 pandemic, which we conceptualize as a slow-motion disaster. Not only close relationships, but also generalized trust, are associated with better physical and mental health, prosperity, and well-being (Dinesen, 2012). As such, generalized trust is an asset that may help people to cope with adversities. The knowledge about generalized trust in disasters is very limited, but a few studies have indicated that the external threat and the display of mutual aid may stimulate increased connectedness and a sense of community in the general population (Cassar, Healy, & Von Kessler, 2017; Sibley et al., 2020). Directly exposed individuals, however, may feel marginalized and expelled. In this study, we investigate the potential impact of the pandemic on generalized trust. Objectives: The objectives of the current study were to assess whether generalized trust had increased in an early pandemic phase compared to pre-pandemic levels, and whether trust was lower in individuals who felt particularly threatened or were particularly burdened in the pandemic. Methods: We compared levels of generalized trust in a population-representative Norwegian sample (n = 1041) with pre-pandemic levels measured in the European Social Survey (ESS). Age- and gender-adjusted expected scores were compared to observed scores, using weighted data. Secondly, we tested whether indicators of pandemic-related strains, perceived health risk, or pandemic-related worry were associated with a reduced level of generalized trust. This cross-sectional study was conducted in an early opening-up phase (May 2020). Results: The observed levels of generalized trust in an early pandemic phase did not differ significantly from expected levels based on pre-pandemic measures. Increased trust was found for individuals who reported personal experience with COVID-19 (tested positive, admitted to hospital, or lost someone to the disease). Pandemic-related worry and a high perceived health threat were both associated with a lower level of generalized trust. Conclusions: Individuals who had personal experience with the disease may have had first-hand experiences with kindness and helpfulness from medical personnel or from other people, which may have generalized into increased trust in other people. People who feel particularly vulnerable or worried may lose trust in others, which constitutes a loss of a potentially protective factor. Our results suggest that generalized trust in other people may be affected by disasters and adversity, both positively and negatively, depending on the individual’s personal disaster experiences. Generalized trust may be an important, although often overlooked, protective factor for people who face trauma and adversity.","Thoresen, Siri; Blix, Ines; Wentzel-Larsen, Tore; Birkeland, Marianne Skogbrott",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8018358/,158

More than 2100 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported in this gene so far. Incidence and genotyping of CF are under-identified in Iraq. This study aims to determine the types and frequencies of certain CFTR mutations among a sample of Iraqi CF patients. Two groups of patients were included: 31 clinically confirmed CF patients in addition to 47 clinically suspected patients of CF. All confirmed patients had typical, moderate-severe clinical presentation and course of the disease. Molecular analysis was performed on the majority of enrolled patients using the CF-stripAssay® kit supplied by ViennaLab diagnostics, GmbH, Austria. RESULTS: The mutation-detection rate from the tested 34 mutations in this study was 19.5% and the 8 detected mutations were as follows: 3120+1G>A and W1282X were found in 3 (4.17%) patients each; F508del and R1162X were found in 2 (2.78%) patients each; 3272-26A>G, R347P, I507del, and 2183AA>G were found in 1 (1.38%) patient each. Polymorphic variants of IVS8, namely 5T, 7T, and 9T, were detected in ~ 70%. These results were nearly similar to what was reported in regional countries. CONCLUSION: Cystic fibrosis seems to be not rare as previously thought. 3120+1G>A and W1282X are the two most commonly detected mutations. F508del needs to be included in all future tests, while the I507del mutation was uniquely reported in this study but not in regional studies.","Abdul-Qadir, Asal Gailan; Al-Musawi, Bassam Musa; Thejeal, Rabab Farhan; Al-Omar, Saad Abdul-Baqi",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8110311/,158

Fused firms have higher levels of innovation in business processes, goods and services. Fused firms were also more likely to employ demographically diverse people, adding insights from the South African mix to the UK studies on disciplinary diversity.

53676,Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis: A Valuable Tool to Monitor Daily Body Hydration Dynamics at Altitude,2021-05-20,"Current discussions of the social phenomenon of “vaccine hesitancy” with regard to Covid-19 provide an opportunity to use hesitancy as a means to shift thinking about untimely and delayed responses to forecasts of hydrometeorological hazards. Hesitancy, that is, provides a paradigm through which such regrettably delayed responses to hydromet hazards might be better understood and effectively addressed. Without exaggeration, just about every hydromet event provides an example of how hesitancy hinders individual, community, and national government risk-reducing preventive and mitigative responses to forecasts of foreseeable, relatively near-term climate, water, or weather hazards. Reasons for such hesitancy (for vaccine and forecast use alike) include—among others—lack of trust in the science, lack of confidence in government, and persistent concern about the uncertainties that surround forecasting—both meteorological and public health. As such, a better understanding of the causes that lead to individual and group hesitancy can better inform hydromet forecasters and affected communities about ways in which beneficial actions in response to timely forecasts are often delayed. This better understanding will facilitate, where necessary, targeted interventions to enhance the societal value of forecasting by reducing this long-observed challenge of “forecast hesitancy.” First, this article focuses on incidents of “vaccine hesitancy” that, for various reasons, people around the world are even now experiencing with regard to several now-available, and confirmed efficacious, Covid-19 vaccines. Reports of such incidents of indecisiveness first increased dramatically over the first few months of 2021, despite the strong scientific confidence that vaccination would significantly lower personal risk of contracting as well as spreading the virus.

We aimed to examine changes in service provision and utilization during the pandemic in Uttar Pradesh, India and identify positive adaptations to service delivery. METHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys with frontline workers (FLW, n = 313) and mothers of children < 2 years (n = 659) in December 2019 (in-person) and July 2020 (by phone). We also interviewed block-level managers and obtained administrative data. We examined changes in service provision and utilization using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to pre-pandemic, service provision reduced substantially during lockdown (83–98 percentage points, pp), except for home visits and take-home-rations (∼30%). Most FLWs (68–90%) resumed service provision in July 2020, except for immunization and hot-cooked meals (< 10%). Administrative data showed similar patterns of disruption and resumption. FLW fears, increased workload, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), and manpower shortages challenged service delivery. Key adaptations made to provide services included: delivering services to beneficiary homes (∼40–90%), social distancing (80%), using PPE (40–50%), and telephones for communication (∼20%). On the demand side, service utilization also reduced substantially (40–80pp) during the lockdown, but about half of mothers received home visits and food supplementation. Utilization for most services did not improve after the lockdown, bearing challenges of limited travel (30%), non-availability of services (26%), fear of catching virus when leaving the house (22%) or meeting service providers (14%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected the provision and use of health and nutrition services despite efforts at service restoration and adaptations. Strengthening logistics support, capacity enhancement, performance management, and demand creation are needed to improve service provision and utilization during and post-COVID-19.

Acute myocarditis induced by thyrotoxicosis had been reported in a few studies. However, attention on its prevalence and underlying mechanisms is sorely lacking. Its long-term harm is often ignored, and it may eventually develop into dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. We report a case of Graves' disease with a progressive elevation of hypersensitive cardiac troponin-I at several days after discontinuation of the patient's anti-thyroid drugs. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) showed inflammatory edema of some cardiomyocytes (stranded enhanced signals under T2 mapping), myocardial necrosis (scattered enhanced signals under T1 late gadolinium enhancement) in the medial and inferior epicardial wall, with a decreased left ventricular systolic function (48%), which implied a possibility of acute myocarditis induced by thyrotoxicosis. The patient was then given a transient glucocorticoid (GC) treatment and achieved a good curative effect.

Several safety and tolerability concerns arise regarding adverse drug reactions and specific subpopulations. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between dissociative and psychometric measures in course of intravenous ketamine treatment in TRD inpatients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. This study result represents safety data in a population of 49 inpatients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder subjects receiving eight 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine intravenous infusions, with a duration of 40 min each, as an add-on treatment to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, registered in the naturalistic observational protocol of the tertiary reference unit for mood disorders (NCT04226963). The safety psychometrics assessed dissociation and psychomimetic symptomatology with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The significant differences in CADSS scores between measurements in course of the treatment were observed (P = .003). No significant differences between BPRS measurements were made after infusions. In each case, both BPRS and CADSS values dropped to the “absent” level within 1 hour from the infusion. Neither CADSS nor BPRS scores were associated with the treatment outcome. The study demonstrates a good safety profile of intravenous ketamine as an add-on intervention to current psychotropic medication in TRD. The abatement of dissociation was observed in time with no sequelae nor harm. The study provides no support for the association between dissociation and treatment outcome. This study may be underpowered due to the small sample size.

This method, which relieves patients from the severe morbidities of invasive surgical procedures, is performed in both malign (T1-T2) and benign lesions. Difficulty of suturation after TAMIS emerges as the most important factor to prolong the procedure. We aimed to analyse the efficacy of TAMIS procedure with partial thickness resection without suturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective study. The study was conducted in a Turkish Education and Research Hospital in 2016. Data of 10 patients who diagnosed with benign rectal masses were included in the study. Patients who were suspected for muscularis propria invasion and lymph node positivity in magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively excluded from the study. All lesions were resected with TAMIS and the mucosal defects were not closed in any patients. Demographic features, lesion's distances to anal verge, excised lesion's size, histopathological report, operation times, duration of hospital stay and complications were recorded RESULTS: Six male and 4 female patients were treated. The mean distance to the anal werge of the lesions was 8.5 (5-12) cm. The longest diameters of the lesions ranged from 1-4 cm in length. All the patients were discharged the day after the surgery. Operation times were found to be 46.1 ± 5 min (30-70). Histopathological examinations of the removed lesions revealed villous adenomas in 3 patients, villous adenoma and Tis adenocarcinoma in 5 patients, villous adenoma and T1 adenocarcinoma in 1 patient and neuroendocrine tumor in 1 patient. There were no early complications such as bleeding, and late complications such as perforation, anal incontinence or anorectal dysfunction in any patient. No evidence of recurrence was found in any of the patients under control rectosigmoidoscopy and pelvic MRI examinations. CONCLUSION Partial thickness resection of rectal benign lesions by TAMIS method is safe. After resection some surgeons suggest to close the defect by suture or stapler. In our study resection without closure of the defect is found safe and feasible with limited patient prejudice.

200364,Awareness and Knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Dental Professionals According to the Turkish National Dental Guidelines,2021,"Gastroenteritis is one of the most common illnesses of humans, and many different viruses have been causally associated with this disease. Of those enteric viruses that have been established as etiologic agents of gastroenteritis, only the human caliciviruses cannot be cultivated in vitro. The cloning of Norwalk virus and subsequently of other human caliciviruses has led to the development of several new diagnostic assays. Antigen detection enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) using polyclonal hyperimmune animal sera and antibody detection EIAs using recombinant virus-like particles have supplanted the use of human-derived reagents, but the use of these assays has been restricted to research laboratories. Reverse transcription-PCR assays for the detection of human caliciviruses are more widely available, and these assays have been used to identify virus in clinical specimens as well as in food, water, and other environmental samples. The application of these newer assays has significantly increased the recognition of the importance of human caliciviruses as causes of sporadic and outbreak-associated gastroenteritis.","Atmar, R L; Estes, M K",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11148001/,158
201822,Spatiotemporal Distribution of Zika Virus and Its Spatially Heterogeneous Relationship with the Environment,2021,"BACKGROUND The major factor affecting morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation (LTX) is bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Earlier studies have suggested a connection between the presence of viral agents and morbidity in this patient group, but data are somewhat conflicting. The objective of this study was to investigate the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and graft loss after LTX in relation to the presence of respiratory viruses during the first year after LTX. METHOD The study is a retrospective cohort study of 39 LTX recipients 11Y13 years after surgery. Patients were operated between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The presence of virus in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients during the first year after surgery was analyzed retrospectively using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction test capable of detecting 15 respiratory agents. The time to BOS or graft loss was analyzed in relation to the positive findings in BAL during the first year after LTX. RESULTS Patients with one or more viruses detected in BAL during the first year after transplantation demonstrated a significantly faster development of BOS (P=0.005) compared with patients with no virus detected. No significant difference in graft survival was found. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the long-term prognosis after LTX may be negatively affected by viral respiratory tract infections during the first year after LTX.","Magnusson, Jesper; Westin, Johan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Brittain-Long, Robin; Riise, Gerdt C",Transplantation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23444472/,158

SETTING: We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of coinfected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. METHODS: Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Through telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men and 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 33.0-56.3), mean age 42.4 years, and range 25-66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The 10th person on ART was a 56-year-old man who died at home early in the outbreak when health care services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, aged 25 and 37 years; both were ART-naive until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 coinfected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. CONCLUSION: Twelve coinfected persons were identified in Wuhan; 9 of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms. Our case series suggests the value of ART for potential mitigation of COVID-19 coinfection.","Hu, Yifei; Ma, Juntao; Huang, Haojie; Vermund, Sten H",,,158

206099,The Gender Gap in the Diagnostic-Therapeutic Journey of the Infertile Couple,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related critical illness and acute illness are associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness and acute illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. METHODS: ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel and applied strict management strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel included 3 patient representatives. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline-development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 19 August 2020). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 2 recommendations. The panel issued conditional recommendations in favor of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation over intermediate-intensity or therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness or acute illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations were based on very low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for high-quality, randomized controlled trials comparing different intensities of anticoagulation. They will be updated using a living recommendation approach as new evidence becomes available.","Cuker, Adam; Tseng, Eric K; Nieuwlaat, Robby; Angchaisuksiri, Pantep; Blair, Clifton; Dane, Kathryn; Davila, Jennifer; DeSancho, Maria T; Diuguid, David; Griffin, Daniel O; Kahn, Susan R; Klok, Frederikus A; Lee, Alfred Ian; Neumann, Ignacio; Pai, Ashok; Pai, Menaka; Righini, Marc; Sanfilippo, Kristen M; Siegal, Deborah; Skara, Mike; Touri, Kamshad; A Akl, Elie; Bou Akl, Imad; Boulos, Mary; Brignardello-Petersen, Romina; Charide, Rana; Chan, Matthew; Dearness, Karin; Darzi, Andrea J; Kolb, Philipp; Colunga-Lozano, Luis E; Mansour, Razan; Morgano, Gian Paolo; Morsi, Rami Z; Noori, Atefeh; Piggott, Thomas; Qiu, Yuan; Roldan, Yetiani; Schünemann, Finn; Stevens, Adrienne; Solo, Karla; Ventresca, Matthew; Wiercioch, Wojtek; Mustafa, Reem A; Schünemann, Holger J",Blood Adv,,158

A Rapid Exploration of Emerging Evidence Regarding the Care of Older People during COVID19,2020,"Resumo Fundamento O SARS-CoV-2 é um vírus de RNA emergente associado à doença respiratória aguda grave conhecida como COVID-19. Embora a COVID-19 seja predominantemente uma doença pulmonar, alguns pacientes apresentam graves danos cardiovasculares. Realizamos uma síntese de evidências quantitativas de dados clínicos, biomarcadores de lesão miocárdica e complicações cardíacas associadas ao óbito hospitalar em pacientes com COVID-19. Métodos Buscamos nas bases de dados PubMed, Embase e Google Scholar para identificar estudos que comparassem dados clínicos, biomarcadores de lesão miocárdica e complicações cardíacas entre pacientes sobreviventes e não sobreviventes da COVID-19. Os tamanhos dos efeitos foram apresentados como diferença média ou diferença média padronizada para variáveis contínuas e razão de risco para variáveis dicotômicas, com intervalos de confiança de 95%. Foi utilizado um modelo de efeitos aleatórios para agrupar os resultados. Resultados Foram incluídos seis estudos retrospectivos que relataram dados de 1.141 pacientes (832 sobreviventes e 309 não sobreviventes). Verificamos que condições cardiovasculares subjacentes; elevação de troponina cardíaca I de alta sensibilidade; N-terminal do pró-hormônio do peptídeo natriurético do tipo B e creatina quinase-MB; e complicações cardíacas foram associadas ao aumento do risco de óbito em pacientes com infecção por SARS-CoV-2. Conclusões A confirmação de que condições cardiovasculares subjacentes, elevação de biomarcadores de lesão miocárdica durante a infecção por COVID-19 e descompensação cardiovascular aguda são preditores de mortalidade na infecção por SARS-CoV-2 deve incentivar novas pesquisas para esclarecer possíveis mecanismos e testar tratamentos adequados.

219540,Analysis of Interurban Mobility in University Students: Motivation and Ecological Impact,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Data relating to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the Middle East remains sparse. This study examines the public's perceptions of the pandemic, assesses the extent to which participants have adhered to a range of recommended health-protective behaviours to prevent infection and evaluates whether anxiety about COVID-19 or perceptions related to the pandemic are associated with greater adherence to these behaviours. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, survey-based design was used. Data were collected using an electronic survey distributed to students, staff and faculty at universities in the three major cities of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi, Al Ain and Dubai, between the 23rd and 31st of April 2020. A total of 634 participants were included in the analysis. METHODS: Participants reported whether they had adhered to health-protective behaviours such as spatial distancing, increased hygiene and disinfection and diminished time spent outside their homes. They also reported the perceived efficacy of a range of behaviours aimed at reducing risk for contracting COVID-19. Data relating to perception of risk, negative consequences of contracting the disease, perceived longevity of the illness and perceptions of the accuracy of the information read about COVID-19 were collected. Anxiety related to COVID-19 was also assessed, as well as a range of demographic variables. Binary logistic regressions were used to examine whether the demographic variables, perceived efficacy ratings and the perception variables were associated with overall adherence. RESULTS: A total of 44.8% of the sample reported adherence to all the examined behaviours. Participants who were employed, those with some or completed postsecondary education and those with a chronic illness diagnosis were more likely to adhere to the precautionary behaviours. The perception of personal risk of infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.98), perception of substantial life consequences of becoming infected (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-0.10) and the perception that the public health information was clear (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83) were all positively related with behavioural adherence. The health-protective behaviours were all perceived as being highly efficacious in combating infection, and these efficacy ratings were also positively associated with greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.41-0.77). Having read the official government public health information was related to greater behavioural adherence (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.23-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Dissemination of reliable public health information during a public health crisis is essential. This study's results highlight the importance of providing the public with information that is clear and consistent and, moreover, emphasises the efficacy of the recommended behaviours as this is likely to improve adherence. When individuals perceive themselves to be at personal risk and are aware of the severity of the consequences posed by the illness, they are more likely to adopt caution. However, in this sample, the trustworthiness of the information portrayed in the media and the perceived duration of the pandemic - whether this would resolve soon or persist well into the future - did not impact adherence.","Vally, Z",Public Health,,158

Mechanisms have been proposed for both beneficial and detrimental effects. Recent studies have focused on mortality with no literature having examined length of hospital stay. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of ACEi and ARBs on COVID-19 mortality and length of hospital stay. Methods: COPE (COVID-19 in Older People) is a multicenter observational study including adults of all ages admitted with either laboratory or clinically confirmed COVID-19. Routinely generated hospital data were collected. Primary outcome: mortality; secondary outcomes: Day-7 mortality and length of hospital stay. A mixed-effects multivariable Cox's proportional baseline hazards model and logistic equivalent were used. Results: 1371 patients were included from eleven centres between 27th February to 25th April 2020. Median age was 74 years [IQR 61-83]. 28.6% of patients were taking an ACEi or ARB. There was no effect of ACEi or ARB on inpatient mortality (aHR=0.85, 95%CI 0.65-1.11). For those prescribed an ACEi or ARB, hospital stay was significantly reduced (aHR=1.25, 95%CI 1.02-1.54, p=0.03) and in those with hypertension the effect was stronger (aHR=1.39, 95%CI 1.09-1.77, p=0.007). Conclusions: Patients and clinicians can be reassured that prescription of an ACEi or ARB at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis is not harmful. The benefit of prescription of an ACEi or ARB in reducing hospital stay is a new finding.","Braude, Philip; Carter, Ben; Short, Roxanna; Vilches-Moraga, Arturo; Verduri, Alessia; Lyndsay Pearce, Miss; Angeline Price, Miss; Quinn, Terence J; Stechman, Michael; Collins, Jemima; Bruce, Eilidh; Einarsson, Alice; Rickard, Frances; Mitchell, Emma; Holloway, Mark; Hesford, James; Barlow-Pay, Fenella; Clini, Enrico; Kyaw Myint, Phyo; Moug, Susan; McCarthy, Kathryn; Hewitt, Jonathan",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,,158

A great variety of drugs has been used to treat viral diseases, which are not always safe and effective and may induce adverse effects, indicating the need for new antiviral drugs extracted from natural sources. Propolis is a bee-made product exhibiting many biological properties. An overview of viruses, antiviral immunity, propolis safety and its immunomodulatory and antiviral action is reported, as well as perspectives for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. PubMed platform was used for data collection, searching for the keywords ""propolis"", ""virus"", ""antiviral"", ""antimicrobial"" and ""coronavirus"". KEY FINDINGS: Propolis is safe and exerts antiviral and immunomodulatory activity; however, clinical trials should investigate its effects on individuals with viral diseases, in combination or not with antiviral drugs or vaccines. SUMMARY: Regarding COVID-19, the effects of propolis should be investigated directly on the virus in vitro or on infected individuals alone or in combination with antiviral drugs, due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action. Propolis administration simultaneously with vaccines should be analyzed, due to its adjuvant properties, to enhance the individuals' immune response. The search for therapeutic targets may be useful to find out how propolis can help to control COVID-19.","Ripari, Nicolas; Sartori, Arthur Alves; da Silva Honorio, Mariana; Conte, Fernanda Lopes; Tasca, Karen Ingrid; Santiago, Karina Basso; Sforcin, José Maurício",J Pharm Pharmacol,,158

Rapid and accurate identification of suspected cases is critical in slowing spread of the virus that causes the disease. We aimed to highlight discrepancies in the various criteria used by international agencies and highly impacted individual countries around the world. METHODS: We reviewed the criteria for identifying a suspected case of COVID-19 used by two international public health agencies and 10 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America. The criteria included information on the clinical causes of illness and epidemiological risk factors. Non-English language guidelines were translated into English by a co-author who is fluent in that particular language. RESULTS: Although most criteria are modifications of World Health Organization recommendations, the specific clinical features and epidemiological risks for triggering evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 differed widely among countries. The rationale for these differences may be related to each country's resources, politics, experience with previous outbreaks or pandemics, health insurance system, COVID-19 outbreak severity, and other undetermined factors. CONCLUSION: We found no consensus regarding the best diagnostic criteria for identifying a suspected case of COVID-19.","Atsawarungruangkit, Amporn; Yuan, Jin; Kodama, Takamitsu; Cheng, Ming-Tai; Mansouri, Mohammad; Han, Boram; Kongkamnerd, Jarinrat; Riegg, Fabian; Menon, Anupama; Moss, Steven F",J Int Med Res,,158

In Singapore, majority of the infected individuals are foreign workers residing in dormitories. A retrospective review conducted over two weeks (April 13 to April 26, 2020) of migrant workers admitted to a public hospital in Singapore revealed that a significant number of them developed hypokalemia. The purpose of this study was to examine any association that might exist between COVID-19 and hypokalemia. Fifty patients in this study had hypokalemia, translating to a prevalence of 28.4% (95% CI: 21.9-35.7). Gastrointestinal (GI) loss was a significant cause of hypokalemia with a prevalence of GI symptoms in the study group (diarrhea, vomiting, poor oral intake) of 5.7% (95% CI: 2.8-10.2). Clinicians should consider screening for hypokalemia in COVID-19 patients and initiate potassium replacement to mitigate any potential arrhythmias.","Cheong, N. W. W.; Aravamudan, V.

255893,Flu Vaccinations in Pharmacies-A Review of Pharmacists Fighting Pandemics and Infectious Diseases,2020,"Mountain riparian zones are excellent buffers for protecting aquatic ecosystems from nutrient runoff in nitrogen deposition processes due to fertilization and manure. Denitrification is a critical process for transferring soil N to the atmosphere. Denitrifying bacterial communities in soil are indicative of the soil quality of a functional ecosystem. We investigated the effects of physicochemical properties of soil on the diversity and activity of denitrifiers in the top-soil and sub-soil of two typical montane riparian meadows: a multi-colored and a flood-plain meadow. Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile. Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed that the diversity and community composition of denitrifying bacteria were strongly associated with most of the soil properties. Therefore, physicochemical soil properties, and particularly the organic carbon, nitrate, and ammonium contents, influence the diversity and abundance of denitrifiers in soil.","Han, Xiaoli; Huang, Chunguo; Khan, Shahbaz; Zhang, Yunxiang; Chen, Yinglong; Guo, Jinping",,,158

258228,The Impact of Signals Transmission on Patients' Choice through E-Consultation Websites: An Econometric Analysis of Secondary Datasets,2021,"Purpose: Fostering the skills necessary for self-directed learning (SDL) competence could be considered the most essential goal of formal education, especially due to uncertainty and changing conditions – exampled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, SDL competence can afford a person the ability to adapt to changing social contextual conditions, thus facilitating personal growth and development – even in the face of volatile and rapidly changing social contextual conditions. The aim of this study is to explore, theoretically, the contextual quality of educational experience necessary for learners to secure adaptive meaning-making: in order to meet the demands of our changing world. Design/methodology/approach: To date, research has failed to comprehensively identify exactly what type of educational experience is necessary for such an adaptive meaning-making process during SDL. The present theoretical paper attempts to redress this concern. Findings: Highly contextualized educational experience is necessary to enable contextual-specific, adaptable, meaning-making. Two constituents of contextualized educational experience are proposed: contextual-specific information available during the educational experience;and contextual-specific meaning schemes resultant from the educational process. Originality/value: This novel work presents an important argument that education should encourage learners to construct knowledge that is adaptable and transferable to their context, rather than automatized knowledge that is not adaptable or transferable. This is a key concern for persons who face rapidly changing social contextual conditions and therefore should be given consideration in both the design of education and in further research on SDL. Like a vaccine in an arm provides a certain protection against COVID-19, fostering our populations’ SDL competence is fundamental for affording persons with an ability to meet the demands of our rapidly changing world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Morris, T.

To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32 years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized beta = .51 for PCL and standardized beta = .55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized beta = .44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized beta = .53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others. There is a growing importance to protect HCWs mental health, including those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and proactively counter psychosocial consequences of healthcare crises.","MacKenzie, Megan; Daviskiba, Sydney; Dow, Miriam; Johnston, Peyton; Balon, Richard; Javanbakht, Arash; Arfken, Cynthia L",Psychiatr. q,,158

The aim of this study was to objectively investigate olfactory dysfunction in two cohorts of patients at two different stages: during acute illness and after a median recovery of 4 months. METHODS: Twenty-five acutely ill patients and 26 recovered subjects were investigated. Acute patients had a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; recovered subjects had a positive antibody assay and a negative molecular test. A 33-item psychophysical olfactory identification test tailored for the Italian population was performed. RESULTS: Median time from symptoms onset to olfactory test was 33 days in acute patients and 122 days in recovered subjects. The former scored a significantly higher number of errors at psychophysical testing (median [IQR]: 8 [13] vs 3 [2], p < 0.001) and were more frequently hyposmic (64% vs 19%, p = 0.002). Recovered subjects reported a variable time to subjective olfactory recovery, from days up to 4 months. Participants included in the study reported no significant nasal symptoms at olfactory testing. Among recovered subject who reported olfactory loss during acute COVID-19, four (27%) were still hyposmic. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not show significant associations with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-severe hospitalized patients showed a high level and frequency of olfactory dysfunction compared to recovered subjects. In the latter group, subjects who reported persisting olfactory dysfunction showed abnormal scores on psychophysical testing, indicating that, at least in some subjects, persistent hyposmia may represent a long-term sequela of COVID-19.","Pasquini, Jacopo; Maremmani, Carlo; Salvadori, Stefano; Silani, Vincenzo; Ticozzi, Nicola",Neurol Sci,,158

272229,Strengthening Country Readiness for Pandemic-Related Mass Movement: Policy Lessons Learned,2021,"Despite the importance of function in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), current measures are outdated and insensitive. Moreover, COVID-19 has heighted the need for remote assessment in older people, who are at higher risk of being infection and are particularly advised to use social distancing measures, yet the importance of diagnosis and treatment of dementia remains unchanged. The emergence of remote measurement technologies (RMTs) allows for more precise and objective measures of function. However, RMT selection is a critical challenge. Therefore, this case study outlines the processes through which we identified relevant functional domains, engaged with stakeholder groups to understand participants' perspectives and worked with technical experts to select relevant RMTs to examine function. After an extensive literature review to select functional domains relevant to AD biomarkers, quality of life, rate of disease progression and loss of independence, functional domains were ranked and grouped by the empirical evidence for each. For all functional domains, we amalgamated feedback from a patient advisory board. The results were prioritized into: highly relevant, relevant, neutral, and less relevant. This prioritized list of functional domains was then passed onto a group of experts in the use of RMTs in clinical and epidemiological studies to complete the selection process, which consisted of: (i) identifying relevant functional domains and RMTs; (ii) synthesizing proposals into final RMT selection, and (iii) verifying the quality of these decisions. Highly relevant functional domains were, ""difficulties at work,"" ""spatial navigation and memory,"" and ""planning skills and memory required for task completion."" All functional domains were successfully allocated commercially available RMTs that make remote measurement of function feasible. This case study provides a set of prioritized functional domains sensitive to the early stages of AD and a set of RMTs capable of targeting them. RMTs have huge potential to transform the way we assess function in AD-monitoring for change and stability continuously within the home environment, rather than during infrequent clinic visits. Our decomposition of RMT and functional domain selection into identify, synthesize, and verify activities, provides a pragmatic structure with potential to be adapted for use in future RMT selection processes.","Owens, Andrew P; Hinds, Chris; Manyakov, Nikolay V; Stavropoulos, Thanos G; Lavelle, Grace; Gove, Dianne; Diaz-Ponce, Ana; Aarsland, Dag",Front Psychiatry,,158

Especially in countries that imposed a lockdown (mobility restrictions help reduce the spread of COVID-19), it becomes important to curtail the movement of vehicles as much as possible. For an effective visual traffic surveillance system, it is essential to detect vehicles from the images and classify the vehicles into different types (e.g., bus, car, and pickup truck). Most of the existing research studies focused only on maximizing the percentage of predictions, which have poor real-time performance and consume more computing resources. To highlight the problems of classifying imbalanced data, a new technique is proposed in this research article for vehicle type classification. Initially, the data are collected from the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset and the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset. In addition, adaptive histogram equalization and the Gaussian mixture model are implemented for enhancing the quality of collected vehicle images and to detect vehicles from the denoised images. Then, the Steerable Pyramid Transform and the Weber Local Descriptor are employed to extract the feature vectors from the detected vehicles. Finally, the extracted features are given as the input to an ensemble deep learning technique for vehicle classification. In the simulation phase, the proposed ensemble deep learning technique obtained 99.13% and 99.28% of classification accuracy on the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset and the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset. The obtained results are effective compared to the standard existing benchmark techniques on both datasets.","Jagannathan, Preetha Rajkumar Sujatha Frnda Jaroslav Divakarachari Parameshachari Bidare Subramani Prabu",Wireless Communications &amp; Mobile Computing (Online),,158

284487,"Psychotherapy via the Internet: What Programs Do Psychotherapists Use, How Well-Informed Do They Feel, and What Are Their Wishes for Continuous Education?",2020,"RATIONALE: Pathogeny of thrombosis in COVID-19 is related to interaction of SARS-Cov-2 with vascular wall through the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. This induces 2 pathways with immunothrombosis from activated endothelium (cytokine storm, leukocyte and platelet recruitment, and activation of coagulation extrinsic pathway), and rise of angiotensin II levels promoting inflammation. While thrombosis is widely described in COVID-19 patients admitted in intensive care unit, cerebrovascular diseases remains rare, in particular cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe 2 cases of women admitted during the spring of 2020 for intracranial hypertension signs, in stroke units in Great-east, a French area particularly affected by COVID-19 pandemia. DIAGNOSES: Cerebral imaging revealed extended CVT in both cases. The first case described was more serious due to right supratentorial venous infarction with hemorrhagic transformation leading to herniation. Both patients presented typical pneumonia due to SARS-Cov-2 infection, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab in only one. INTERVENTIONS: The first patient had to undergo decompressive craniectomy, and both patients were treated with anticoagulation therapy. OUTCOMES: Favorable outcome was observed for 1 patient. Persistent coma, due to bi thalamic infarction, remained for the other with more serious presentation. LESSONS: CVT, as a serious complication of COVID-19, has to be searched in all patients with intracranial hypertension syndrome. Data about anticoagulation therapy to prevent such serious thrombosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection are lacking, in particular in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.","Guendouz, Cécile; Quenardelle, Véronique; Riou-Comte, Nolwenn; Welfringer, Pascal; Wolff, Valérie; Zuily, Stéphane; Jager, Lavinia; Humbertjean Selton, Lisa; Mione, Gioia; Pop, Raoul; Gory, Benjamin; Richard, Sébastien",Medicine (Baltimore),,158

The outbreak has put enormous pressure on the medical establishment and even led to exhaustion of medical resources in the most affected areas. Other medical work has been significantly affected in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In order to reduce or avoid cross-infection with COVID-19, many hospitals have taken measures to limit the number of outpatient visits and inpatients. For example, emergency surgery can only be guaranteed, and most other surgeries can be postponed. Patients with cancer are one of the groups most affected by the epidemic because of their systematic immunosuppressive state and requirement of frequent admission to hospital. Consequently, specific adjustments for their treatment need to be made to cope with this situation.

METHODS: This is a retrospective review analyzing ED ultrasound exams performed by the radiology department of an urban healthcare system during the 8-week time period of the peak COVID-19 outbreak in NYC, compared to a time-matched period one year prior. Data regarding the examination type and indication were obtained in addition to patient demographics and indicators of outcomes including admission, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: There was a 58% decrease in ED ultrasounds performed by the radiology department during the COVID-19 time period. Exams performed during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period were more likely to be performed on men (28.3 vs 18.0%, p < 0.01), older patients (36 vs. 35 years, p = 0.02), and patients subsequently admitted (17.8 vs. 13.4%, p = 0.03). There was also a difference in the distribution of exam type (p = 0.01). There was no difference in death, rate of surgery/intervention performed, or distribution of clinical indication. When correcting for gender, there was only an increase in studies leading to hospital admission in the female-only group (14.9 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.05).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic reduction in the number of hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction or stroke and a larger time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact have been reported. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that there would also have been a reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease during the Italian lockdown. MATERIAL AND METHOD: s A multicenter, observational survey was conducted to collect data on hospital admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations throughout two-months (March 15th to May 15th); the years 2020 (COVID-19 Italian lockdown), 2019 and 2018 were compared. Cases were identified by ICD-9 codes 430, 431, 432.1, 432.9, 747.81 of each hospital database. The statistical significance of the difference between the event rate of one year versus the others was evaluated using Poisson Means test, assuming a constant population. RESULTS: During the 2020 lockdown, the total number of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 92 compared with 116 in 2019 and 95 in 2018. This difference was not significant. GCS upon admission was 3-8 in 44 % of cases in 2020 (41 patients), 39.7 % in 2019 (46 patients) and 28 % in 2018 (27 patients). CONCLUSION: Reduction of admissions for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease due to vascular malformations during the COVID-19 lockdown was not confirmed.

Several reports on epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been published. However, mortality and morbidity analyses, important for better understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, are scarce. We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19. Methods. The cohort consisted of 11 male and 3 female patients, with 9 patients aged 70 years or above, and nearly all had underlying diseases. Results. Fever with bilateral pneumonia was the main manifestation. Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest computed tomography scan. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested. In addition, this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in all 8 patients tested. Conclusions. The clinical and laboratory parameters in the cohort of fatal cases may be incorporated into future clinical prognosis models and will be of help in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease.","Tian, Sufang; Liu, Huan; Liao, Meiyan; Wu, Yingjie; Yang, Chunxiu; Cai, Yuxiang; Peng, Zhiyong; Xiao, Shu-Yuan",Open Forum Infect.

We aimed to investigate the possible roles of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) / Fn14 pathway and leukotrienes (LT) in uncontrolled immune response that occurs in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV - 2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 25 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID - 19 as well as 22 healthy volunteer. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum TWEAK, LTE4, and prostaglandin F2? (PGF2?) levels were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher in the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection without lung involvement. In the group of SARS - CoV - 2 infection with lung involvement, age, fibrinogen, sedimentation, C - reactive protein and ferritin, TWEAK, LTE4, and PGF2? levels were higher, and lymphocyte levels were lower compared with the asymptomatic group. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, TWEAK and LTE4 levels increased in cases with COVID -19. These results support that TWEAK / Fn14 pathway and LT may involved in the pathology of aberrant immune response against SARS - CoV - 2. Inhibition of each of these pathways may be a potential target in the treatment of COVID - 19.","YalÇin KehrIbar, Demet; CIhangIroGlu, Mustafa; Sehmen, EmIne; Avci, BahattIn; Çapraz, Mustafa; Boran, Maruf; GÜnaydin, Caner; Özgen, MetIn",,,158

306459,The Influence of Lockdown on the Gambling Pattern of Swiss Casinos Players,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has occupied the world agenda since December 2019. With no effective treatment yet, vaccination seems to be the most effective method of prevention. Recently developed vaccines have been approved for emergency use only and are currently applied to large populations. Considering both the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases (AIIRDs) and the immunosuppressive drugs used in treatment, vaccination for COVID-19 deserves special attention in such patients. In this article, we aimed to give simple messages to the clinicians for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs based upon the current evidence regarding the use of other vaccines in this patient group. For this purpose, we conducted a ""Pubmed search"" using the following keywords: Influenza, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal, and Shingles vaccines and the frequently used conventional and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Likewise, an additional search was performed for the COVID-19 immunization in patients with AIIRDs and considering such drugs. In summary, patients with AIIRDs should also be vaccinated against COVID-19, preferably when disease activity is under control and when there is no concurrent infection. Low-degree immunosuppression does not appear to decrease antibody responses to vaccines. Ideally, vaccinations should be done before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. Patients receiving rituximab should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks before or 6 months after treatment. Since tofacitinib may also reduce antibody responses, especially in combination with methotrexate, it may be appropriate to discontinue this drug before vaccination and to restart after 14 days of immunization. Key points * COVID-19 vaccinations should preferably be made during remission in patients with autoimmune/autoinflammatory rheumatological diseases. * Low-degree immunosuppression may not interfere with antibody response to vaccines. * Ideally, vaccinations should be made before the initiation of any biological DMARDs. * Timing of vaccination is especially important in the case of rituximab.","Soy, M.; Keser, G.; Atagunduz, P.; Mutlu, M.

In this paper we describe a low-cost exploration of magnetic multipoles. Using the field from ideal magnetic dipoles and a simple binomial approximation, we show that each multipole obeys $B \propto r^n$, with $n=-3, -4,-5,-6$ for a dipole, quadrupole, sextupole, and octupole, respectively. Using commercially available NdFeB magnets and the magnetic field sensor inside a smartphone, we experimentally verify the power-law dependence of the multipole configurations. Finally, the open-source Python library Magpylib can simulate the magnetic field of arbitrary permanent magnet distributions, which also shows the same power law dependence for the different multipole configurations.","Sen, Antara; Sullivan, M.

322070,Health Advertising during the Lockdown: A Comparative Analysis of Commercial TV in Spain,2021,"Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of the severe or critically ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and evaluate the impact of complicated myocardial injury on the prognosis of these patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who admitted to Tongji hospital from February 3, 2020 to February 24, 2020 and met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analyzed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined with 3 times higher serum cardiac troponin value. Results: The age of the 54 patients was 68.0(59.8, 74.3) years. Among all the patients, 24 (44.4%) patients were complicated with hypertension, 13 (24.1%) with diabetes, 8 (14.8%) with coronary heart disease, and 3 (5.6%) with previous cerebral infarction. During hospitalization, 24 (44.4%) of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 (48.1%) patients died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury (14 (60.9%) vs. 8 (25.8%), P=0.013). Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein (153.6 (80.3, 240.7) ng/L vs. 49.8 (15.9, 101.9) ng/L) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (852.0 (400.0, 2 315.3) ng/L vs. 197.0 (115.3, 631.0) ng/L) were significantly higher than patients without myocardial injury (all P<0.01). Conclusions: Prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients. Severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study suggests that it is important to monitor and manage the myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.","He, X W; Lai, J S; Cheng, J; Wang, M W; Liu, Y J; Xiao, Z C; Xu, C; Li, S S; Zeng, H S",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,158

334338,Physical Sports Activities and Exercise Addiction during Lockdown in the Spanish Population,2021,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the trend of reported case fatality rate (rCFR) of COVID-19 over time, using globally reported COVID-19 cases and mortality data. We collected daily COVID-19 diagnoses and mortality data from the WHO's daily situation reports dated January 1 to December 31, 2020. We performed three time-series models [simple exponential smoothing, auto-regressive integrated moving average, and automatic forecasting time-series (Prophet)] to identify the global trend of rCFR for COVID-19. We used beta regression models to investigate the association between the rCFR and potential predictors of each country and reported incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of each variable. The weekly global cumulative COVID-19 rCFR reached a peak at 7.23% during the 17th week (April 22-28, 2020). We found a positive and increasing trend for global daily rCFR values of COVID-19 until the 17th week (pre-peak period) and then a strong declining trend up until the 53rd week (post-peak period) toward 2.2% (December 29-31, 2020). In pre-peak of rCFR, the percentage of people aged 65 and above and the prevalence of obesity were significantly associated with the COVID-19 rCFR. The declining trend of global COVID-19 rCFR was not merely because of increased COVID-19 testing, because COVID-19 tests per 1,000 population had poor predictive value. Decreasing rCFR could be explained by an increased rate of infection in younger people or by the improvement of health care management, shielding from infection, and/or repurposing of several drugs that had shown a beneficial effect on reducing fatality because of COVID-19.","Hasan, Mohammad Nayeem; Haider, Najmul; Stigler, Florian L; Khan, Rumi Ahmed; McCoy, David; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard A; Uddin, Md Jamal",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,158

DESIGN: National survey. SETTING: UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Healthcare professionals working within maternity services. METHODS: A national electronic survey was developed to investigate local modifications to general and specialist maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of the contemporaneous national pandemic guidance. After a pilot phase, the survey was distributed through professional networks by the RCOG and co-authors. The survey results were presented descriptively in tabular and graphic formats, with proportions compared using chi-square tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Service modifications made during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 81 respondent sites, 42% of the 194 obstetric units in the UK, were included. They reported substantial and heterogeneous maternity service modifications. Seventy percent of units reported a reduction in antenatal appointments and 56% reported a reduction in postnatal appointments; 89% reported using remote consultation methods. A change to screening pathways for gestational diabetes mellitus was reported by 70%, and 59% had temporarily removed the offer of births at home or in a midwife-led unit. A reduction in emergency antenatal presentations was experienced by 86% of units. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey documents the extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternity services in the UK. More research is needed to understand the impact on maternity outcomes and experience. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: A national survey showed that UK maternity services were modified extensively and heterogeneously in response to COVID-19.","Jardine, J; Relph, S; Magee, L A; von Dadelszen, P; Morris, E; Ross-Davie, M; Draycott, T; Khalil, A",BJOG,,158

We reviewed the changes in our management protocol for these lesions as our disease understanding and preparedness evolved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study including patients with sellar-suprasellar and clival lesions presenting to us between March and October 2020. Management protocols were divided into three phases based on the prevalence of the disease and the number of mandatory preoperative COVID-19 tests being conducted. The surgical approach used was analyzed in relation to the preferred approach during pre-COVID times, and surgical outcomes and complications were noted. RESULTS: A total of 31 cases were operated during this period. During Phase I (low prevalence; no preoperative COVID testing) endonasal surgeries were largely abandoned in favor of transcranial approaches. In Phase II (medium prevalence; one preoperative COVID test) we gradually resumed endonasal surgeries for 'emergent' and 'essential' cases, and subsequently in Phase III (high prevalence; two preoperative COVID tests), we had no hesitation in performing 'elective' endonasal surgeries with additional barriers for prevention of aerosol transmission. No patient developed COVID-19 infection postoperatively. Eight HCWs in our department acquired the disease during this period, none of whom were directly involved in the surgeries for the above cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS: With a strict preoperative COVID testing protocol, adherence to proper drilling techniques and using additional barriers to prevent droplet and aerosol spread, endonasal surgeries for sellar-suprasellar lesions are safe during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Ankush; Goyal-Honavar, Abhijit; Jonathan, Gandham Edmond; Prabhu, Krishna; Varghese, George M; Rupali, Priscilla; Chacko, Ari George",Br J Neurosurg,,158

A series of department formulates and constant improvements were made, including elective operation cancellation, altered conventional outpatient service into online outpatient service, strict control of inter department consultation prevention and entering the department, improvements in operation and treatment processes, and strict ward management. As a result, 1 patient with hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage and deep vein thrombosis of the right lower extremity died suddenly due to pulmonary embolism during anticoagulation treatment. Two patients with deep coma gave up treatment and died. No patient was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in hospital. One doctor had a low fever and cough in January, and CT showed a small nodule in the lower left lung. After 2 weeks isolation and oral anti-infective drugs, the chest nodule disappeared. One nurse was isolated as a close contact with infected parents. One nurse was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in a mild symptom. She was discharged after being cured in the infected department. In conclusion, measures like sufficient theoretical training and protection upgrading for medical staff, continuous improvement on the understanding of COVID-19 characteristics and transmission routes, formulation of strict department management system, monitoring of patients and their families, could effectively deal with the epidemic situation in the neurosurgery department.","Sheng, Liuqing; Chen, Yingchun; Li, Huanhuan; Wang, Zhizhong; Bie, Bizhou; You, Huichao; Ye, Jianfeng; Feng, Juanjuan; Zhang, Chun; Li, Jun",J Craniofac Surg,,158

Even in the current pandemic, we should not reduce our attention towards the diagnosis and treatment of GDM. The purpose of this document is to provide a temporary guide for GDM screening, replacing the current guidelines when it is not possible to implement standard GDM screening because of an unfavorable risk/benefit ratio for pregnant women or when usual laboratory facilities are not available. DATA SYNTHESIS: At the first visit during pregnancy, we must exclude the presence of ""Overt diabetes"" in all women. The criteria for the diagnosis of overt diabetes are either fasting plasma glucose &#8805;126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose &#8805;200 mg/dL, or glycated hemoglobin &#8805;6.5%. When the screening procedure (OGTT) cannot be safely performed, the diagnosis of GDM is acceptable if fasting plasma glucose is &#8805; 92 mg/dL. In order to consider the impaired fasting glucose as an acceptable surrogate for the diagnosis of GDM, the fasting glucose measurement should be performed within the recommended time windows for the risk level (high or medium risk). CONCLUSIONS: The changes to the screening procedure for GDM reported below are specifically produced in response to the health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, these recommended changes should cease to be in effect and should be replaced by current national guidelines when the healthcare authorities declare the end of this emergency.","Torlone, Elisabetta; Festa, Camilla; Formoso, Gloria; Scavini, Marina; Sculli, Maria A; Succurro, Elena; Sciacca, Laura; Di Bartolo, Paolo; Purrello, Francesco; Lapolla, Annunziata",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,158

371736,"Characteristics and Outcomes of Pediatric COVID-19 Patients in Osaka, Japan",2021,"The initial public health response to the breakout of COVID-19 required fundamental changes in individual behavior, such as isolation at home or wearing masks. The effectiveness of these policies hinges on generalized public obedience. Yet, people's level of compliance may depend on their beliefs regarding the pandemic. We use original data from two waves of a survey conducted in March and April 2020 in eight Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (n = 21,649) to study gender differences in COVID-19-related beliefs and behaviors. We show that women are more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a very serious health problem, to agree with restraining public policy measures, and to comply with them. Gender differences in attitudes and behavior are sizable in all countries. They are accounted for neither by sociodemographic and employment characteristics nor by psychological and behavioral factors. They are only partially mitigated for individuals who cohabit or have direct exposure to the virus. We show that our results are not due to differential social desirability bias. This evidence has important implications for public health policies and communication on COVID-19, which may need to be gender based, and it unveils a domain of gender differences: behavioral changes in response to a new risk.","Galasso, Vincenzo; Pons, Vincent; Profeta, Paola; Becher, Michael; Brouard, Sylvain; Foucault, Martial",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,158

The overall stock market has declined. However, some sectors become highly vulnerable while others continue to perform well even in the crisis period. Given this new reality, we seek to investigate the initial volatility and the sectoral return. In this study, we analyse data for eight sectors such as, transportation, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, energy, food, real estate, telecommunications and technology of the Australian stock market. In doing so, we obtain data from Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and analysed them based on 'Event Study' method. Here, we use the 10-days window for the event of official announcement of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia on 27 February 2020. The findings of the study show that on the day of announcement, the indices for food, pharmaceuticals and healthcare exhibit impressive positive returns. Following the announcement, the telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors exhibit good performance, while poor performance is demonstrated by the transportation industry. The findings are vital for investors, market participants, companies, private and public policymakers and governments to develop recovery action plans for vulnerable sectors and enable investors to regain their confidence to make better investment decisions.","Alam, Md Mahmudul; Wei, Haitian; Wahid, Abu N M",Aust Econ Pap,,158

The current recommendation for testing is RT-PCR based tests of nasopharyngeal or alternatively nasal- and/or oropharyngeal swabs that detects infection with SARS-CoV-2 to diagnose acute infection. However, there is an urgent need for a quick and accurate antibody-based point-of-care test method to quickly identify evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who might be missed through active case finding and surveillance efforts.

The aim of this study is to report changes about numbers and reason for ENT consultations in emergency department (ED) during COVID-19 pandemic comparing with those occurred the previous year (2019). METHODS: Data about patients admitted to adult and pediatric ED were collected from March 1 to May 31, 2019 and 2020. Patients referred for urgency from general practitioners were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Global ED admission (except for dyspnea or COVID-19-related symptoms) dramatically decreased during pandemic (-50.9% among adults and -71.4% among pediatrics). At the same time, ENT consultancy significantly reduced too, by 71.5% (P < .01) among adults and 45.1% (P < .01) for pediatrics. Among adults, it was reported a statistically significant decrease in consultation for ear problems (-88.5%, P = .0146). Reduction in ENT referral for bone fracture (-40%, P = .059), vertigo (-77.8%, P = .637), and tonsillitis (-87.5%, P = .688) was consistent, but not significant. Among pediatric patients, it was observed an increase by 25% about foreign bodies (12 vs 15, P < .01). A reduction in numbers of consults for ear problem (-90.8%; P = .045), epistaxis (-80%; P = .196), and nasal fracture (-70%; P = .36) was also observed. CONCLUSION: Fear of infection and the forced lock down caused a significant decrease in the number of ED accesses and in ENT consultancy. These data may suggest that some ED referral usually could be deferred, but on the other hand, pandemic will cause a great diagnostic delay.","Campagnoli, Massimo; Cerasuolo, Michele; Renna, Martina; Dell039,; Era, Valeria; Valletti, Paolo Aluffi; Garzaro, Massimiliano",Ear Nose Throat J,,158

The disease presentation is similar to Kawasaki disease but has certain distinguishing features. The exact pathogenesis is still not clear but an aberrant immune response, antibody-mediated vascular damage and virus-mediated abnormal type I and III interferon-gamma response are thought to be responsible. Most children who are previously healthy present after 2-4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infections with febrile illness of short duration with prominent gastrointestinal, cardiac and hematologic manifestations, progressing to vasoplegic shock, requiring vasopressor therapy. Cardiovascular involvement is prominently marked by acute myocardial injury/myocarditis and the development of coronary artery aneurysms. Laboratory markers of inflammation are elevated uniformly.

Nowadays, digital contact tracing has promptly emerged as an indispensable asset in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The work at hand offers a meticulous study of all the official Android contact tracing apps deployed hitherto by European countries. Each app is closely scrutinized both statically and dynamically by means of dynamic instrumentation. Depending on the level of examination, static analysis results are grouped in two axes. The first encompasses permissions, API calls, and possible connections to external URLs, while the second concentrates on potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, including the use of trackers, in-depth manifest analysis, shared software analysis, and taint analysis. Dynamic analysis on the other hand collects data pertaining to Java classes and network traffic. The results demonstrate that while overall these apps are well-engineered, they are not free of weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations that may ultimately put the user security and privacy at risk.","Kouliaridis, Vasileios; Kambourakis, Georgios; Chatzoglou, Efstratios; Geneiatakis, Dimitrios; Wang, Hua",PLoS One,,158

The purpose of this study was evaluation of appropriate and safe disposal of sharps within a 730-bed acute district general hospital (DGH) in the UK. One hundred sharps containers were audited in November 2019 to assess whether they complied with the health and safety regulations across surgical, medical, and acute wards. Meetings with the appropriate staff members were organised and posters placed throughout the hospital to raise awareness. One hundred twenty-five sharps containers were re-audited in July 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic to ascertain if there was an improvement. In November 2019, a total of 56% of sharps containers were overfilled and hence were non-compliant with safety regulations. A re-audit performed in July 2020 found only 17% of sharps containers to be overfilled, which was a significant improvement (p = 0.0064) in practice. We noted that the overall compliance improved from being 44% in 2019 to 82.64 in the year 2020. This audit showed a significant improvement in the compliance of sharps bin containers in a DGH, signifying the increased awareness. It is necessary to audit sharps management regularly to accurately assess practice and prevent exposure to BBDs.","Hussain, Asfa; Shah, Yusra; Raval, Pradyumna; Deroeck, Nicholas",SN Compr Clin Med,,158

We aim to provide evidence for clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity by analyzing patients' clinical data and early laboratory results and exploring the correlation between laboratory results and clinical classification. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 283 cases of suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 from 16 hospitals in Jiangsu Province from January to April 2020. The routine laboratory blood examinations, T lymphocyte subsets, and biochemical and coagulation function among different populations were contrasted by t test and chi-square (&#967;²) test. RESULTS Cough, fever, and dyspnea could be helpful to diagnose COVID-19 infection (P<0.05). Patients who were older or had comorbidities tended to become severe and critical cases. Among all the patients, the most obvious abnormal laboratory results were higher neutrophil count, CRP, total bilirubin, BUN, CRE, APTT, PT, and D-dimer, and lower blood platelet and lymphocyte count. CD3âº T cell, CD4âº T cell, and CD8âº T cell counts gradually decreased with exacerbation of the disease (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Cough and fever were the most common symptom. Patients with comorbidities were in more serious condition.

438255,Application of EN 16615 (4-Field Test) for the Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Activity of the Selected Commercial and Self-Made Disinfectant Wipes,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has ever-increasing attributed deaths. Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously and remotely, outside of hospital facilities, recognising early clinical deterioration. We aim to determine the feasibility & acceptability of remote monitoring systems for quarantined individuals in a hotel suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: A pilot, proof-of-concept, feasibility trial was conducted in engineered hotels near London airports (May-June 2020). Individuals arriving to London with mild suspected COVID-19 symptoms requiring quarantine, as recommended by Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with COVID-19 symptoms unable to isolate at home were eligible. The SensiumVitals&#8482; patch, measuring temperature, heart & respiratory rates, was applied on arrival for the duration of their stay. Alerts were generated when pre-established thresholds were breeched; trained nursing staff could consequently intervene. RESULTS: Fourteen individuals (M = 7, F = 7) were recruited; the mean age was 34.9 (SD 11) years. Mean length of stay was 3 (SD 1.8) days. In total, 10 vital alerts were generated across 4 participants, resulting in telephone contact, reassurance, or adjustment of the sensor. No individuals required hospitalisation or virtual general practitioner review. DISCUSSION: This proof-of-concept trial demonstrated the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Benefits included reduced viral exposure to healthcare staff, with recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems can be applied to hotels to deliver healthcare safely in individuals suspected of COVID-19. Further work is required to evaluate this model on a larger scale.

455358,Is a Mask That Covers the Mouth and Nose Free from Undesirable Side Effects in Everyday Use and Free of Potential Hazards?,2021,"Scientific Background: Sphingolipids are a highly diverse group of lipids with respect to physicochemical properties controlling either structure, distribution, or function, all of them regulating cellular response in health and disease. Mass spectrometry, on the other hand, is an analytical technique characterizing ionized molecules or fragments thereof by mass-to-charge ratios, which has been prosperingly developed for rapid and reliable qualitative and quantitative identification of lipid species. Parallel to best performance of in-depth chromatographical separation of lipid classes, preconditions of precise quantitation of unique molecular species by preprocessing of biological samples have to be fulfilled. As a consequence, “lipid profiles” across model systems and human individuals, esp. complex (clinical) samples, have become eminent over the last couple of years due to sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory capability. Therefore, it is significance to consider the entire experimental strategy from sample collection and preparation, data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. Areas Covered: In this review, we outline considerations with clinical (i.e., human) samples with special emphasis on sample handling, specific physicochemical properties, target measurements, and resulting profiling of sphingolipids in biomedicine and translational research to maximize sensitivity and specificity as well as to provide robust and reproducible results. A brief commentary is also provided regarding new insights of “clinical sphingolipidomics” in translational sepsis research. Expert Opinion: The role of mass spectrometry of sphingolipids and related species (“sphingolipidomics”) to investigate cellular and compartment-specific response to stress, e.g., in generalized infection and sepsis, is on the rise and the ability to integrate multiple datasets from diverse classes of biomolecules by mass spectrometry measurements and metabolomics will be crucial to fostering our understanding of human health as well as response to disease and treatment.","Claus, R.

470726,Model for Taking Care of Patients with Early Childhood Caries during the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic,2020,"Locomotor and physiological performance of ectotherms are affected by temperature. Thermoregulation is achieved by changes in behavior and the selection of micro-habitats with adequate temperatures to maintain the body temperature (Tb) within a range of preference. Apart from this temperature dependence at spatial scales, ectotherms are also affected by temperature at temporal scale. For instance, ectotherms can only be active some months of the year, particularly in temperate environments. Tarantulas are ectotherms that live in burrows most of their life. Nevertheless, after the sexual maturation molt, males leave their refugia and start a wandering life searching for females to mate. The reproductive period varies among species. In some species walking males are seen in late spring or early summer, while in other species males are only seen during fall or winter. Apart from the differences in lifestyles after maturation, tarantulas exhibit sexual dimorphisms in longevity and body mass, having smaller, shorter-lived males. Thus, to optimize energetic budgets, decreasing thermoregulation costs, we hypothesize and examine a putative correlation between an individual's preferred body temperature (Tpref) and the environmental temperature during the reproductive period. Hence, we characterize Tpref in seven tarantula species and analyze which factors (i.e., time of day, body mass, and sex) correlated with it. Furthermore, we assess putative correlated evolution of Tpref with ambient temperature (minima, mean, and maxima) during the reproductive period by means of phylogenetic independent contrasts. We did not find differences in thermal preferences between sexes; and only one species, Acanthoscurria suina, exhibited diel differences in Tpref. We found evidence of correlated evolution between Tpref and minimum temperature during the reproductive period among all seven species studied herein. Our results show that the reproductive period is constrained by thermal preferences, dictating when males can start their wandering life to mate.","Montes de Oca, Laura; Pérez-Miles, Fernando; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina",J Therm Biol,,158

These HuNAbs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by competing with human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 for binding to the viral receptor binding domain (RBD). Prophylactic intraperitoneal or intranasal injection of individual HuNAb or DNA vaccination significantly reduces infection in the lungs but not in the nasal turbinates of hamsters intranasally challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Although postchallenge HuNAb therapy suppresses viral loads and lung damage, robust infection is observed in nasal turbinates treated within 1-3 days. Our findings demonstrate that systemic HuNAb suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and injury in lungs; however, robust viral infection in nasal turbinate may outcompete the antibody with significant implications to subprotection, reinfection, and vaccine.","Zhou, Dongyan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhou, Biao; Zhou, Runhong; Li, Shuang; Shan, Sisi; Liu, Li; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chen, Serena J; Chan, Chris Chung-Sing; Xu, Haoran; Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man; Yuan, Shuofeng; Li, Cun; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Cao, Jianli; Chan, Chun-Yin; Kwan, Ka-Yi; Du, Zhenglong; Lau, Thomas Tsz-Kan; Zhang, Qi; Zhou, Jie; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zhang, Linqi; Ho, David D; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",Cell Host Microbe,,158
471195,The Impact of E-Book Reading on Young Children's Emergent Literacy Skills: An Analytical Review,2021,"This paper highlights the major challenges and considerations for addressing COVID-19 in informal settlements. It discusses what is known about vulnerabilities and how to support local protective action. There is heightened concern about informal urban settlements because of the combination of population density and inadequate access to water and sanitation, which makes standard advice about social distancing and washing hands implausible. There are further challenges to do with the lack of reliable data and the social, political and economic contexts in each setting that will influence vulnerability and possibilities for action. The potential health impacts of COVID-19 are immense in informal settlements, but if control measures are poorly executed these could also have severe negative impacts. Public health interventions must be balanced with social and economic interventions, especially in relation to the informal economy upon which many poor urban residents depend. Local residents, leaders and community-based groups must be engaged and resourced to develop locally appropriate control strategies, in partnership with local governments and authorities. Historically, informal settlements and their residents have been stigmatized, blamed, and subjected to rules and regulations that are unaffordable or unfeasible to adhere to. Responses to COVID-19 should not repeat these mistakes. Priorities for enabling effective control measures include: collaborating with local residents who have unsurpassed knowledge of relevant spatial and social infrastructures, strengthening coordination with local governments, and investing in improved data for monitoring the response in informal settlements.","Wilkinson, Annie; Ali, Harris; Bedford, Juliet; Boonyabancha, Somsook; Connolly, Creighton; Conteh, Abu; Dean, Laura; Decorte, Filiep; Dercon, Bruno; Dias, Sonia; Dodman, David; Duijsens, Raimond; D’Urzo, Sandra; Eamer, Gwendolen; Earle, Lucy; Gupte, Jaideep; Frediani, Alex Apsan; Hasan, Arif; Hawkins, Kate; Herbst, Natalia; Kadihasanoglu, Aynur; Keil, Roger; Kibuchi, Eliud; Leach, Melissa; Lilford, Richard; Macarthy, Joseph; Mitlin, Diana; Napier, David; O’Donnell, Ian; Oyebode, Oyinlola; Ozano, Kim; Perera, Laxman; Rashid, Sabina; Ringwald, Beate; Ripoll, Santiago; Saleem, Amjad; Satterthwaite, David; Sellu, Sudie Austina; Siddique, Omar; Soesilo, Cynthia; Sommer, Kerstin; Steege, Rosie; Sverdlik, Alice; Tacoli, Cecilia; Taylor, John; Theobald, Sally; Tolhurst, Rachel; Walnycki, Anna; Watson, Samuel; Whittaker, Lana",Environ.

METHODS: In a mixed-methods study, Canadian mothers of children aged 0 to 8 years with (cases) and without (controls) food allergy provided demographic data and completed age-appropriate anxiety questionnaires between April 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. The cases also provided food allergy-related data and completed the Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire. In-depth interviews were subsequently conducted with purposefully selected cases. RESULTS: In a total of 580 participants, 5.5% were cases and 94.5% were controls. For mothers of children aged 0 to 1.5 years, anxiety levels did not differ between cases and controls. For mothers of children aged 1.5 to 8 years, anxiety levels were higher in cases vs controls (P < .05). Among the cases, neither overall nor domain-specific Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire scores differed between age groups (0-3 vs 4-7 years), even after adjustment for confounding variables, including childcare during the pandemic. Qualitatively, the following 3 themes were identified: unexpected challenges of food shopping; less food-related food anxiety during the pandemic; and differences and delays in food allergy testing and therapy. CONCLUSION: Mothers of children with food allergy reported high anxiety and poor health-related QoL. Yet, qualitatively, day-to-day food allergy management was better during the pandemic.","Protudjer, Jennifer L P; Golding, Michael; Salisbury, Marlee R; Abrams, Elissa M; Roos, Leslie E",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,,158

483490,Representations of Psychoactive Drugs' Use in Mass Culture and Their Impact on Audiences,2021,"Since the early spring of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) outbreak has hindered traditional face-to-face teaching and hands-on, traditional delivery of laboratory courses, forcing universities to migrate from the traditional way of teaching to a remote online approach. Although few studies addressed the pandemic's impact on educational outcomes, no studies are found to investigate the impact of the remote online teaching approach on laboratory courses. This paper highlights the impact of the online teaching approach, coupled with flipped learning pedagogy, as a substitute for traditional laboratories. The course learning outcomes and assessment tools are analyzed and discussed for 46 students enrolled in the Unit Operations Laboratory course in the chemical engineering program at Qatar University. Results show that the course learning outcomes are achieved effectively using the hybrid online-flipped learning pedagogy, which can be considered for computerized traditional laboratories as a moderation solution to alleviate pandemic COVID-19 confinement on learning outcome. This methodology can also be sustained in the future to facilitate the teaching of such lab courses, even in normal conditions, to optimize the resources and avail the delivery of such courses to a larger audience who may have various obstacles to attending traditional lab courses.","Elkhatat, Ahmed M.; Al-Muhtaseb, Shaheen A.",SN Social Sciences,,158
486418,On the Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a Temperate Climate,2021,"COVID-19 is a pandemic which has spread to more than 200 countries. Its high transmission rate makes it difficult to control. To date, no specific treatment has been found as a cure for the disease. Therefore, prediction of COVID-19 cases provides a useful insight to mitigate the disease. This study aims to model and predict COVID-19 cases. Eight countries: Italy, New Zealand, the USA, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa which are in different phases of COVID-19 distribution as well as in different socioeconomic and geographical characteristics were selected as test cases. The Alpha-Sutte Indicator approach was utilized as the modelling strategy. The capability of the approach in modelling COVID-19 cases over the ARIMA method was tested in the study. Data consist of accumulated COVID-19 cases present in the selected countries from the first day of the presence of cases to September 26, 2020. Ten percent of the data were used to validate the modelling approach. The analysis disclosed that the Alpha-Sutte modelling approach is appropriate in modelling cumulative COVID-19 cases over ARIMA by reporting 0.11%, 0.33%, 0.08%, 0.72%, 0.12%, 0.03%, 1.28%, and 0.08% of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the USA, Brazil, Italy, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and South Africa, respectively. Differences between forecasted and real cases of COVID-19 in the validation set were tested using the paired t-test. The differences were not statistically significant, revealing the effectiveness of the modelling approach. Thus, predictions were generated using the Alpha-Sutte approach for each country. Therefore, the Alpha-Sutte method can be recommended for short-term forecasting of cumulative COVID-19 incidences. The authorities in the health care sector and other administrators may use the predictions to control and manage the COVID-19 cases.","Attanayake, A M C H; Perera, S S N",Biomed Res Int,,158
486419,On the Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a Temperate Climate,2021,"The past few years have witnessed increasing interests in applying deep learning to video compression. However, the existing approaches compress a video frame with only a few number of reference frames, which limits their ability to fully exploit the temporal correlation among video frames. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Recurrent Learned Video Compression (RLVC) approach with the Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and Recurrent Probability Model (RPM). Specifically, the RAE employs recurrent cells in both the encoder and decoder. As such, the temporal information in a large range of frames can be used for generating latent representations and reconstructing compressed outputs. Furthermore, the proposed RPM network recurrently estimates the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the latent representation, conditioned on the distribution of previous latent representations. Due to the correlation among consecutive frames, the conditional cross entropy can be lower than the independent cross entropy, thus reducing the bit-rate. The experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art learned video compression performance in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM. Moreover, our approach outperforms the default Low-Delay P (LDP) setting of x265 on PSNR, and also has better performance on MS-SSIM than the SSIM-tuned x265 and the slowest setting of x265.","Yang, Ren; Mentzer, Fabian; Gool, Luc Van; Timofte, Radu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13560v2.pdf,158

Biochemical markers may help with management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients; however, their utility is still under investigation. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate, and high sensitivity troponin T (TnT) levels in 67 patients who were admitted to a Canadian tertiary care centre for management of COVID-19. Logistic, cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards, and accelerated failure time regression modelling were performed to assess the associations of initial analyte concentrations with in-hospital death and length of stay in hospital; joint modelling was performed to assess the associations of the concentrations over the course of the hospital stay with in-hospital death. RESULTS: Initial TnT and CRP concentrations were associated with length of stay in hospital. Eighteen patients died (27%), and the median initial TnT concentration was higher in patients who died (55 ng/L) than those who lived (16 ng/L; P < 0.0001). There were no survivors with an initial TnT concentration > 64 ng/L. While the initial TnT concentration was predictive of death, later measurements were not. Only CRP had prognostic value with both the initial and subsequent measurements: a 20% increase in the initial CRP concentration was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-29%) increase in the odds of death, and the hazard of death increased 14% (95% CI: 5-25%) for each 20% increase in the current CRP value. While the initial lactate concentration was not predictive of death, subsequent measurements were. CONCLUSION: CRP, lactate and TnT were associated with poorer outcomes and appear to be useful biochemical markers for monitoring COVID-19 patients.","Rutledge, Angela C; Choi, Yun-Hee; Karp, Igor; Bhayana, Vipin; Stevic, Ivan",Clin. biochem,,158
496494,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Occupational Groups from the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area, Colombia",2021,"Pandemic defines the global outbreak of a disease having a high transmission rate. The impact of a pandemic situation can be lessened by restricting the movement of the mass. However, one of its concomitant circumstances is an economic crisis. In this article, we demonstrate what actions an agent (trained using reinforcement learning) may take in different possible scenarios of a pandemic depending on the spread of disease and economic factors. To train the agent, we design a virtual pandemic scenario closely related to the present COVID-19 crisis. Then, we apply reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, that deals with how an individual (human/machine) should interact on an environment (real/virtual) to achieve the cherished goal. Finally, we demonstrate what optimal actions the agent perform to reduce the spread of disease while considering the economic factors. In our experiment, we let the agent find an optimal solution without providing any prior knowledge. After training, we observed that the agent places a long length lockdown to reduce the first surge of a disease. Furthermore, the agent places a combination of cyclic lockdowns and short length lockdowns to halt the resurgence of the disease. Analyzing the agent's performed actions, we discover that the agent decides movement restrictions not only based on the number of the infectious population but also considering the reproduction rate of the disease. The estimation and policy of the agent may improve the human-strategy of placing lockdown so that an economic crisis may be avoided while mitigating an infectious disease.","Ohi, Abu Quwsar; Mridha, M F; Monowar, Muhammad Mostafa; Hamid, Md Abdul",Sci Rep,,158

METHODS: This case-series study analyzed VAERS reports of thrombocytopenia after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of thrombocytopenia were identified among 18,841,309 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13 cases among 16,260,102 doses of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporting rate of thrombocytopenia was 0.80 per million doses for both vaccines. Based on an annual incidence rate of 3.3 ITP cases per 100,000 adults, the observed number of all thrombocytopenia cases, which includes ITP, following administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is not greater than the number of ITP cases expected.

Authorities have seen the calamities caused by the corona virus in China. So, when the trace of virus was found in India, the only possible way to stop the spread of the virus was to go into lockdown. In a country like India where a major part of the population depends on the daily wages, being in lockdown started affecting their life. People where tend to go out for getting the food items and other essentials, and this caused the spread of virus. Many were infected and many lost their life by this. Due to the pandemic, the whole world was affected and many people working in foreign countries lost their jobs as well. These people who came back to India caused further spread of the virus. The main reason for the spread is lack of hygiene and a proper system to monitor the symptoms. Even though our country was in lockdown for almost 6 months the number of COVID cases doesn't get diminished. It is not practical to extend the lockdown any further, and people have decided to live with the virus. But it is essential to take the necessary precautions while interacting with the society. Automated system for checking that all the COVID protocols are followed and early symptom identification before entering to a place are essential to stop the spread of the infection.

Insights from a Rapid Review of the Literature,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emergency physicians (EPs) perform critical actions while operating with diagnostic uncertainty. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is useful in evaluation of dyspneic patients. In prior studies, POCUS is often performed by ultrasound (US) teams without patient care responsibilities. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the effectiveness of POCUS in narrowing diagnostic uncertainty in dyspneic patients when performed by treating EPs vs. separate US teams. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective noninferiority cohort study investigated the effect of a POCUS performing team in patient encounters for dyspnea. Before-and-after surveys assessing medical decision-making were administered to attending physicians. Primary outcome was change in most likely diagnosis after POCUS. This was assessed for noninferiority between encounters where the primary or US team performed POCUS. Secondary outcomes included change in differential diagnosis, confidence in diagnosis, interventions considered, and image quality. RESULTS: There were 156 patient encounters analyzed. In the primary team group, most likely diagnosis changed in 40% (95% confidence interval 28-52%) of encounters vs. 32% (95% confidence interval 22-41%) in the US team group. This was noninferior using an a priori specified margin of 20% (p < .0001). Post-POCUS differential decreased by a mean 1.8 diagnoses and was equivalent within a margin of 0.5 diagnoses between performing teams (pâ¯=â¯0.034). Other outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: POCUS performed by primary teams was noninferior to POCUS performed by US teams for changing the most likely diagnosis, and equivalent when considering mean reduction in number of diagnoses. POCUS performed by treating EPs reduces cognitive burden in dyspneic patients.","Beyer, Alexander; Lam, Vivian; Fagel, Brian; Dong, Sheng; Hebert, Christopher; Wallace, Christopher; Theyyunni, Nik; Tucker, Ryan; Cover, Michael; Kessler, Ross; Cranford, James A; Huang, Robert; Majkrzak, Allen A; Seleno, Nicole R; Fung, Christopher M",J. emerg. med,,158

Rotavírus em cães são encontrados com baixa freqüência, tanto em cães com diarréia quanto sadios, mas sua importância como reservatório para a rotavirose humana já é conhecido. O CCoV, pertencente ao grupo 1 do gênero Coronavirus, ocorre sob a forma dos genótipos I e II, amplamente distribuídos mundialmente e implicados em diarréia moderada, mas podendo levar a elevada letalidade no caso de patótipos altamente patogênicos. No Brasil, a ocorrência de rotavírus do sorogrupo A em cães é um fato conhecido, mas, no caso do CCoV, existe, até o momento, apenas uma investigação relatando sua ocorrência, sem dados de diversidade molecular. A presente investigação teve por objetivos avaliar o papel de cães jovens com enterite sintomática, bem como sadios, como reservatórios de rotavírus, estudar a freqüência de ocorrência de Coronavírus canino (CCoV) em amostras fecais destes animais e estudar a diversidade molecular das amostras de CCoV encontradas. Para tato foram colhidas 100 amostras fecais de cães não vacinados, entre 1 e 180 dias de idade entre 2007 e 2008, sendo 50 com diarréia e 50 sem diarréia no momento da colheita, nos Municípios de São Paulo, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, São Caetano do Sul, Taboão da Serra, Itapecerica da Serra e uma aldeia indígena em Parelheiros. Às amostras foi aplicada a técnica de eletroforese em gel de poliacrilamida (PAGE) para a detecção de rotavírus e uma RT-PCR dirigida ao gene da proteína de membrana M do CCoV (nucleotídeos 337 a 746) para a detecção deste vírus, sendo os fragmentos detectados submetidos a seqüenciamento de DNA. As seqüencias obtidas, traduzidas em aminoácidos, foram utilizadas para a construção de uma árvore genealógica enraizada de distância com o algoritmo Neighbor-Joning e modelo de Poisson com 100 repetições de bootstrap. Nenhuma das amostras resultou positiva para rotavirus, enquanto que 47 foram positivas para CCoV, com freqüência significativamente superior nos animais com diarréia. Vinte e dois dos 47 fragmentos de DNA obtidos resultaram em seqüências viáveis de DNA, sendo 12 classificadas como CCoV Tipo I e 10 como Tipo II, tendo sido encontrada uma sublinhagem exclusivamente brasileira para o Tipo II. Em relação à amostra vacinal de CCoV submetida ao seqüenciamento de DNA, a maior identidade ocorreu com o grupo Tipo II sublinhagem 01, com um valor de 100%, seguido de 97,2% para o Tipo II sublinhagem 02 (a linhagem brasileira) e 93,2% para o Tipo I. Sugere-se que a diversidade de CCoV encontrada seja derivada da elevada freqüência de ocorrência deste vírus, o que pode aumentar a probabilidade de divergências e de possíveis falhas vacinais por diferenças entre a amostra vacinal (Tipo II) e as amostras de campo (Tipos I e II), e, dessa forma, a vacina não diminuiria a transmissão e novas linhagens de CCoV emergiriam. Conclui-se que cães jovens com enterite sintomática, bem como sadios, não tiveram papel como reservatório para rotavírus, considerando-se a região geográfica e o período de colheita de amostras. O CCoV ocorreu com uma freqüência de 47% na população canina estudada, com freqüência estatisticamente significativamente superior naqueles com diarréia do que naqueles sem diarréia.

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents&rsquo; intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS: Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS: The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between &ldquo;German&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland were found for parents&rsquo; intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p &lt;0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents&rsquo; intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; Switzerland. The Swiss government and public health organisations can leverage these regional results to promote influenza vaccination among children for the coming seasons.","Seiler, Michelle; Goldman, Ran D; Staubli, Georg; Hoeffe, Julia; Gualco, Gianluca; Manzano, Sergio",Swiss Med Wkly,,158

590665,How Do Pharmaceutical Companies Overcome a Corporate Productivity Crisis? Business Diversification into Medical Devices for Growth Potential,2021-01-25,"The current rise of protectionism has become the main uncertainty associated with global energy, economy, and the environment. Furthermore, the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth is crucial for implementing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). These INDCs would be discounted if decreasing carbon emissions would require sacrificing economic growth. This study explored the effect of protectionism (by measuring trade openness based on available data) on the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth. For this, the heterogenous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions were investigated using in data of 182 countries from 1990 to 2015. The results show that trade openness decreased carbon emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, while having no significant impact on carbon emissions of lower-middle-income countries; even worse, for low-income countries, trade openness increased carbon emissions. The heterogeneous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions indicate that trade openness positively impacts the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission in rich countries, but negatively impacts poor countries. In addition, increasing individual incomes and population distort the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. Renewable energy and high oil prices contributed to the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. These effects are similar in all countries. Targeted policy implications are presented that enable the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions for countries with different income levels.","Wang, Qiang; Zhang, Fuyu",J Clean Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123838; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262033883X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095965262033883X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863606/,158

591955,Seasonality of Suicidal Behavior,2012-02-14,"Deferoxamine B is an outstanding molecule which has been widely studied in the past decade for its ability to bind iron and many other metal ions. The versatility of this metal chelator makes it suitable for a number of medicinal and analytical applications, from the well-known iron chelation therapy to the most recent use in sensor devices. The three bidentate hydroxamic functional groups of deferoxamine B are the centerpiece of its metal binding ability, which allows the formation of stable complexes with many transition, lanthanoid and actinoid metal ions. In addition to the ferric ion, in fact, more than 20 different metal complexes of deferoxamine b have been characterized in terms of their chemical speciation in solution. In addition, the availability of a terminal amino group, most often not involved in complexation, opens the way to deferoxamine B modification and functionalization. This review aims to collect and summarize the available data concerning the complex-formation equilibria in solutions of deferoxamine B with different metal ions. A general overview of the progress of its applications over the past decade is also discussed, including the treatment of iron overload-associated diseases, its clinical use against cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and its role as a diagnostic tool.","Bellotti, Denise; Remelli, Maurizio",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071479/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26113255,158

Despite the resurgences in positive cases after reopening businesses in May, the country is seeing a shift in mindset surrounding the pandemic as people have been eagerly trickling out from federally-mandated quarantine into restaurants, bars, and gyms across America. History can teach us about the past, and today’s pandemic is no exception. Without a vaccine available, three lessons from the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic may arm us in our fight against COVID-19. First, those who survived the first wave developed immunity to the second wave, highlighting the potential of passive immunity-based treatments like convalescent plasma and cell-based therapy. Second, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are unknown. Slow-progressive cases of the Spanish flu have been linked to bacterial pneumonia and neurological disorders later in life, emphasizing the need to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Third, the Spanish flu killed approximately 17 to 50 million people, and the lack of human response, overcrowding, and poor hygiene were key in promoting the spread and high mortality. Human behavior is the most important strategy for preventing the virus spread and we must adhere to proper precautions. This review will cover our current understanding of the pathology and treatment for COVID-19 and highlight similarities between past pandemics. By revisiting history, we hope to emphasize the importance of human behavior and innovative therapies as we wait for the development of a vaccine.

The current study aimed to identify the challenges faced by Israeli Air Force (IAF) career personnel. METHOD: A survey was conducted on 550 participants during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. The participants completed a questionnaire that dealt with unique challenges (personal, family, and command). RESULTS: Of 550 respondents, 54% reported low mood and irritability, 44% reported a constant feeling of anxiety, and 29% reported having sleep problems. Most of them (66%) were mainly concerned about infecting their family. The shift from normal work conditions to an unfamiliar capsule configuration concerned 58% of respondents. Functional continuity concerned 55% of respondents. Managing subordinates concerned 50% of the participants. Of the three types of challenges analyzed (personal, family, and command), the command challenge was the only one where the personal variables (military role, rank, and marital status) made no difference. Finally, about 30% of all respondents reported they needed professional support in dealing with the new circumstances. Their preferred platform was an easily accessible hotline. CONCLUSIONS: Life under the COVID-19 threat increased stress factors in the military career population. While reporting greater challenges and higher levels of stress, most of the respondents preferred a brief, focused consultation adjusted to the situation rather than conventional psychological help. The command challenge and the perceived responsibility stood above and beyond all variables examined in the present study.","Gordon, Shirley; Garbi, Dror; Ben Bassat, Shahar; Shapira, Shachar; Shelef, Leah",Mil Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210718/; https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa424,158

Unlike previous research, our analysis distinguishes seekers of health information into those who use only non-Internet sources and those who use the Internet and possibly non-Internet sources. By comparing the frequencies of physician visits among the two groups of health information seekers and non-seekers, we infer the net association between online health information and the demand for physician services while partially controlling for the effects of concurrent seeking of offline health information. The following are the two key findings: (1) individuals’ health status and sociodemographic factors shape online and offline health information seeking patterns in similar ways; and (2) the demand for physician services is positively associated with offline health information seeking and not with online health information. The net association with online health information would be even smaller after controlling for the effect of concurrent offline health information seeking. These results suggest that extending the availability of online health information would potentially reinforce the unequal access to health information, which could create greater variation in individuals’ health management skills and benefits from health care in the long term.

After virus budding into the Golgi luminal space, virus-containing vesicles are transported to the plasma membrane via trafficking pathways that are not well defined. Using the New World hantavirus, Andes virus, we have investigated the role of various Rab proteins in the release of hantavirus particles from infected cells. Rabs 8 and 11 were found to colocalize with Andes virus proteins in virus infected cells and when expressed from cDNA, implicating the recycling endosome as an organelle important for hantavirus infection. Small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of Rab11a alone or Rab11a and Rab11b together resulted in a decrease in infectious virus particle secretion from infected cells. Downregulation of Rab8a did not alter infectious virus release but reduction of both isoforms did. These data implicate the recycling endosome and the Rab proteins associated with vesicular transport to or from this intracellular organelle as an important pathway for hantavirus trafficking to the plasma membrane.","Rowe, Regina K.; Suszko, Jason W.; Pekosz, Andrew",Virology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2648827?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208005977; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208005977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951604/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.021,158

Large outbreaks can occur periodically resulting in significant morbidity. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at analyzing the available influenza C clinical samples from two widely separated states of Australia, collected over a 7‐year period and to compare them with influenza C viruses detected in other parts of the world in recent years. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between 2008 and 2014, 86 respiratory samples that were influenza C positive were collected from subjects with influenza‐like illness living in the states of Victoria and Western Australia. A battery of other respiratory viruses were also tested for in these influenza C‐positive samples. Virus isolation was attempted on all of these clinical samples, and gene sequencing was performed on all influenza C‐positive cultures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Detections of influenza C in respiratory samples were sporadic in most years studied, but higher rates of infection occurred in 2012 and 2014. Many of the patients with influenza C had coinfections with other respiratory pathogens.

Its intense politicization constantly made headlines, especially regarding the use of face masks as a safety precaution. However, the extent to which public opinion is polarized on wearing masks has remained anecdotal and the verbal representation of this polarization has not been explored. This study examined the types, themes, temporal trends, and exchange patterns of hashtags about mask wearing posted from March 1 to August 1, 2020 by Twitter users based in the United States. On the one hand, we found a stark rhetorical polarization in terms of semantic antagonism between pro- and anti-mask hashtags, exponential frequency increases of both types of hashtags during the period under study, in parallel to growing COVID-19 case counts, state mask mandates, and media coverage. On the other hand, the results showed an asymmetric participatory polarization in terms of a predominance of pro-mask hashtags along with an “echo chamber” effect in the dominant pro-mask group, which ignored the subversive rhetoric of the anti-mask minority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, this study provides a nuanced account of the digital polarization of public opinion on mask wearing.

Data were from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Renal Data System. Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25%–100% could result in excess deaths of wait‐listed (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119–478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID‐19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity. Considering that more than 700 000 Americans have ESRD with 100 000 awaiting a kidney transplant, our highest annual estimate of 478 excess total deaths from postponing kidney transplantation seems modest.","Peters, Thomas G.; Bragg‐Gresham, Jennifer L.; Klopstock, Annie C.; Roberts, John P.; Chertow, Glenn; McCormick, Frank; Held, Philip J.",Clin Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33749935/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14292,158

Design: Cross-sectional online survey analyzed using univariable tests and a multivariable logistic regression model. Setting: The United States during the week of March 30, 2020. Participants: Convenience sample of 1,965 American adults using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. Participants reporting household food insecurity prior to the pandemic were excluded from analyses. Results: 1,517 participants reported household food security before the COVID-19 outbreak. Among this subset, 30% reported food insecurity after the COVID-19 outbreak, 53% were women and 72% were white. On multivariable analysis, race, income, relationship status, anxiety, and depression were significantly associated with incident household food insecurity. Black respondents, Hispanic/Latino respondents, and respondents with annual income less than $100,000 were significantly more likely to experience incident household food insecurity. Individuals experiencing incident household food insecurity were 2.09 (95% CI 1.58-2.83) times more likely to screen positively for anxiety and 1.88 (95% CI 1.37-2.52) times more likely to screen positively for depression. Conclusions: Food insecurity due to the COVID-19 pandemic is common, and certain populations are particularly vulnerable. There are strong associations between food insecurity and anxiety/depression.

The banners that have emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic which was also the subject of a national-level driven policy, have been involved in a nation-wide public debate over the language styles of banners used to urge people to stay indoors. Based on the analysis of the early COVID-19 banners and the related online comments, this article analyzes the language style patterns of the banners and the mode of banner circulation. The study found that the manner in which the banners are circulated goes beyond a unidirectional path of on-site instant communication. This process is facilitated by social networks and mass media, which, during circulation, twice created a banner upgrade. The upgrades created decontextualization and function extension of the banners, whereas audience feedback triggered an adaptive adjustment of the language style of the banners. This article suggests that the study of the use and spread of banners, especially the early COVID-19 banners, sheds light on the study of mass communication and discourse style, and also how measures to contain pandemics such as COVID-19 can be communicated.","Dong, Hongjie; Zhou, Minli; Che, Dewei; Bodomo, Adams",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371512/,158

Risk factors related to higher mortality are age over 65 years, cardiovascular, pulmonary and kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes. There is limited scientific literature on COVID-19 infection and previous kidney disease, specifically in patients with glomerular and tubular kidney disease. The aim of this study was to determine general characteristics, analytical parameters and clinical evolution of patients with kidney disease who have undergone kidney biopsy and who presented infection or high suspicion of infection by COVID-19. Identify mortality and associated risk factors. METHOD: we studied patients with high clinical suspicion of infection or confirmed infection by COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 15, 2020 of all patients who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital between January 2013 and December 2019. RESULTS: 39 of the 553 patients have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection since March 2020. The average age was 63±15 years and 48.7% were male. Hypertension was present in 79.5% of patients, chronic kidney disease without renal replacement therapy in 76.9%, and cardiovascular disease in 64.1%. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 26 patients; older patients (p=0.01), patients with hypertension (p=0.005), immunosuppression (p=0.01), use of RAS-blocking drugs (p=0.04) and gastrointestinal symptoms (p=0.02) were more likely to be tested for COVID-19. 22 patients required hospitalization and 15.4% died. In the bivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (p=0.03), cardiovascular disease (p=0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p=0.05) and low hemoglobin levels (p=0.006). Adjusted Cox regression showed that low hemoglobin levels (10.12±1.89g/dL) at admission had 1.81 greater risk of mortality [1.04-3.13; p=0.04]. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 infection and kidney disease confirmed by kidney biopsy presented mortality of 15.4%.

We discuss the ability of a novel mobile health (mhealth) platform to be effectively adapted to improve health access for vulnerable displaced populations. In a preliminary analysis of 200 Syrian refugee women, we found positive user feedback and uptake of an mhealth application to increase access to preventive maternal and child health services for Syrian refugees under temporary protection in Turkey. Rapid adaptation of this application was successfully implemented during a global pandemic state to perform symptomatic assessment, disseminate health education, and bolster national prevention efforts.

In particular, commonly used alignment-based methods are not ideal choices for detecting new viral species. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species. By combining k-mer embedding-based encoding, hierarchically organized CNNs, and carefully trained rejection layer, CHEER is able to assign correct taxonomic labels for reads from new species.

Pour assurer la continuité des soins durant cette période, les pharmaciens d’officine ont eu l’opportunité de recourir au télésoin et de proposer des téléconsultations avec un médecin à leurs patients. Nous établissons ici un bilan des pratiques de télésanté menées à cette occasion dans une officine de quartier, participant aux activités d’une maison de santé pluridisciplinaire multisite (MSP). Matériel et méthodes Après analyse de situation, les pharmaciens de cette officine ont proposé aux patients concernés soit une téléconsultation, soit un télésoin. Les médecins sollicités ont été ceux de la MSP, ceux du territoire et ceux d’une plate-forme de téléconsultation. Des outils numériques ont permis, d’une part, la communication entre médecins, patients et pharmaciens, et d’autre part, ont permis au pharmacien d’assister le médecin lors de la téléconsultation, tout en garantissant la confidentialité et la protection des données relatives aux patients. Résultats Treize téléconsultations et 22 télésoins pharmaceutiques ont été réalisés. Quatre types de situations ont motivé le déclenchement de téléconsultations assistées par le pharmacien et trois celui d’un télésoin pharmaceutique. La mise en œuvre de la télésanté dans cette officine a nécessité des modifications au niveau de l’organisation et du management au sein de l’officine, la formation de l’équipe officinale ainsi qu’une communication plus étroite avec les médecins de la MSP.

Introduction The COVID-19 health crisis precipitated the use of telehealth. To ensure continuity of care, during this period, pharmacists had the opportunity to use telecare and to offer teleconsultations with a physician to their patients. We report here on telehealth practices in a local pharmacy participating in the activities of a multidisciplinary health center (MSP). Material and methods After analyzing a situation, the pharmacists of this dispensary offered teleconsultation or telecare to the patients. The doctors solicited were those from the MSP, those from the territory and those from a teleconsultation platform. Digital tools have enabled communication between doctors, patients and pharmacists on the one hand and enabled the pharmacist to assist the doctor during the teleconsultation, while ensuring the confidentiality and protection of patient data. Results Thirteen teleconsultations and 22 telepharmacy consultations were performed. Four types of situations motivated the triggering of pharmacist-assisted teleconsultations and three of pharmaceutical telecare. The implementation of telehealth in this pharmacy required changes in the organization and management of the pharmacy, training of the pharmacy team, and closer communication with the MSP physicians.

The N protein consists of two structural domains interspersed between intrinsically disordered regions and dimerizes through the C-terminal structural domain (CTD). A key activity of the protein is the ability to oligomerize during capsid formation by utilizing the dimer as a building block, but the structural and mechanistic bases of this activity are not well understood. By disulfide trapping technique we measured the amount of transient oligomers of N protein mutants with strategically located cysteine residues and showed that CTD acts as a primary transient oligomerization domain in solution. The data is consistent with the helical oligomer packing model of N protein observed in crystal. A systematic study of the oligomerization behavior revealed that altering the intermolecular electrostatic repulsion through changes in solution salt concentration or phosphorylation-mimicking mutations affects oligomerization propensity. We propose a biophysical mechanism where electrostatic repulsion acts as a switch to regulate N protein oligomerization.","Chang, Chung-ke; Chen, Chia-Min Michael; Chiang, Ming-hui; Hsu, Yen-lan; Huang, Tai-huang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23717688/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0065045,158

METHODS: We recruited 50 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection with or without pneumonia. We selected candidate predictors through group comparison and punitive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. A stepwise logistic regression model was used to distinguish patients with and without pneumonia. Finally, we used a decision-tree method and randomly selected 50% of the patients 1000 times from the same specimen to verify the effectiveness of the model. RESULTS: We found that the percentage of eosinophils, a high–fluorescence-reticulocyte ratio, and creatinine had better discriminatory power than other factors. Age and underlying diseases were not significant for discrimination. The model correctly discriminated 77.1% of patients. In the final validation step, we observed that the model had an overall predictive rate of 81.3%. CONCLUSION: We developed a laboratory model for COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. In the clinical setting, the model will be able to predict and differentiate pneumonia vs nonpneumonia before any lung computed tomography findings. In addition, the percentage of eosinophils, a high–fluorescence-reticulocyte ratio, and creatinine were considered protective factors against lung infection in patients without pneumonia.","Li, Jiaxia; Wan, Li; Feng, Yuan; Zuo, Huilin; Zhao, Qian; Ren, Jiecheng; Zhang, Xiaochu; Xia, Mingwu",Lab Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165563/; https://doi.org/10.1093/labmed/lmab015,158

613184,Characterizing Breakthrough Cancer Pain Using Ecological Momentary Assessment with a Smartphone App: Feasibility and Clinical Findings,2021-06-03,"AIMS: Angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2. Animal studies suggest that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers might increase the expression of ACE2 and potentially increase the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of ACE inhibitor (ACEI) treatment on the pneumonia incidence in non‐COVID‐19 patients (25 studies, 330 780 patients) was associated with a 26% reduction of pneumonia risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.74, P < .001). Pneumonia‐related death cases in ACEI‐treated non‐COVID‐19 patients were reduced by 27% (OR: 0.73, P = .004). However, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) treatment (10 studies, 275 621 non‐COVID‐19 patients) did not alter pneumonia risk in patients. Pneumonia‐related death cases in ARB‐treated non‐COVID‐19 patients was analysed only in 1 study and was significantly reduced (OR, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72). Results from 11 studies (8.4 million patients) showed that the risk of getting infected with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus was reduced by 13% (OR: 0.87, P = .014) in patients treated with ACEI, whereas analysis from 10 studies (8.4 million patients) treated with ARBs showed no effect (OR, 0.92, P = .354). Results from 34 studies in 67 644 COVID‐19 patients showed that RAAS blockade reduces all‐cause mortality by 24% (OR = 0.76, P = .04). CONCLUSION: ACEIs reduce the risk of getting infected with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. Blocking the RAAS may decrease all‐cause mortality in COVID‐19 patients. ACEIs also reduce the risk of non‐COVID pneumonia. All‐cause mortality due to non‐COVID pneumonia is reduced by ACEI and potentially by ARBs.","Chu, Chang; Zeng, Shufei; Hasan, Ahmed A.; Hocher, Carl‐Friedrich; Krämer, Bernhard K.; Hocher, Berthold",Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217033/,158

The present study examined the psychological consequences of COVID-19 in Bangladesh during the lockdown period. METHODS: : A nationwide online cross-sectional survey study recruited 10,067 individuals covering all 64 districts in Bangladesh via social media (April 1-10, 2020). The survey comprised questions concerning socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behavior towards COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation. Logistic regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were performed to identify the risk factors depression and suicidal ideation. Geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis was used to identify district-wise susceptibility to depression and suicidal ideation. FINDINGS: : The prevalence rate of depression and suicidal ideation related to COVID-19 was 33% and 5%. Common risk factors for suicidal ideation and depression included being young, being female, being a cigarette smoker, having comorbid diseases, having high scores on the Fear COVID-19 Scale, and having insomnia symptoms. GIS-based maps detected high depression and suicidal ideation in the capital of Bangladesh and the districts near the capital as well as coastal areas where COVID-19 prevalence was high, as compared with districts with no reported cases. LIMITATIONS: : Self-reported scales and cross-sectional design of our study. CONCLUSION: : COVID-19 is associated with major psychological impact across Bangladesh, underlining the need of strategically located psychological support measures and improved access to mental health services, especially among women and younger people.","Mamun, Mohammed A.; Sakib, Najmuj; Gozal, David; Bhuiyan, AKM Israfil; Hossain, Sahadat; Bodrud-Doza, Md.; Mamun, Firoj Al; Hosen, Ismail; Safiq, Mariam Binte; Abdullah, Abu Hasnat; Sarker, Md.

614349,The Utility of Virtual Patient Simulations for Clinical Reasoning Education,2020-07-24,"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a common respiratory virus that causes moderately severe infections. We have previously shown that the virus uses heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment factors, facilitating viral entry into the cell. In the present study, we show that the membrane protein (M) of HCoV-NL63 mediates this attachment. Using viruslike particles lacking the spike (S) protein, we demonstrate that binding to the cell is not S protein dependent. Furthermore, we mapped the M protein site responsible for the interaction with HSPG and confirmed its relevance using a viable virus. Importantly, in silico analysis of the region responsible for HSPG binding in different clinical isolates and the Amsterdam I strain did not exhibit any signs of cell culture adaptation. IMPORTANCE It is generally accepted that the coronaviral S protein is responsible for viral interaction with a cellular receptor. Here we show that the M protein is also an important player during early stages of HCoV-NL63 infection and that the concerted action of the two proteins (M and S) is a prerequisite for effective infection. We believe that this study broadens the understanding of HCoV-NL63 biology and may also alter the way in which we perceive the first steps of cell infection with the virus.

614918,The Impact of Internet Usage and Knowledge-Intensive Activities on Households’ Healthcare Expenditures,2020-06-22,"Abstract For many diseases, the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is a threshold parameter for disease extinction or survival in isolated populations. However no human population is fully isolated from other human or animal populations. We use compartmental models to derive simple rules for the basic reproduction number in populations where an endemic disease is sustained by a combination of local transmission within the population and exposure from some other source: either a reservoir exposure or imported cases. We introduce the idea of a reservoir-driven or importation-driven disease: diseases that would become extinct in the population of interest without reservoir exposure or imported cases (since R 0 < 1 ), but nevertheless may be sufficiently transmissible that many or most infections are acquired from humans in that population. We show that in the simplest case, R 0 < 1 if and only if the proportion of infections acquired from the external source exceeds the disease prevalence and explore how population heterogeneity and the interactions of multiple strains affect this rule. We apply these rules in two case studies of Clostridium difficile infection and colonisation: C. difficile in the hospital setting accounting for imported cases, and C. difficile in the general human population accounting for exposure to animal reservoirs. We demonstrate that even the hospital-adapted, highly-transmissible NAP1/RT027 strain of C. difficile had a reproduction number <1 in a landmark study of hospitalised patients and therefore was sustained by colonised and infected admissions to the study hospital. We argue that C. difficile should be considered reservoir-driven if as little as 13.0% of transmission can be attributed to animal reservoirs.","McLure, Angus; Glass, Kathryn",Theor Popul Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304644/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580920300319; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040580920300319; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2020.04.002,158

The scale of the global COVID-19 pandemic, its spreading rate, and deaths are increasing regularly. Computed tomography (CT) scans can be used carefully to detect and analyze COVID-19 cases. In CT images/scans, ground-glass opacity (GGO) is found in the early stages of infection. While in later stages, there is a superimposed pulmonary consolidation. METHODS: This research investigates the quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches for the analysis of COVID-19 images. The recent developments in quantum computing have led researchers to explore new ideas and approaches using QML. The proposed approach consists of two phases: in phase I, synthetic CT images are generated through the conditional adversarial network (CGAN) to increase the size of the dataset for accurate training and testing. In phase II, the classification of COVID-19/healthy images is performed, in which two models are proposed: CML and QML. RESULT: The proposed model achieved 0.94 precision (Pn), 0.94 accuracy (Ac), 0.94 recall (Rl), and 0.94 F1-score (Fe) on POF Hospital dataset while 0.96 Pn, 0.96 Ac, 0.95 Rl, and 0.96 Fe on UCSD-AI4H dataset.

METHODS: Prospective study evaluating 51 canine faecal samples submitted at a reference laboratory for the presence of Giardia spp. Kappa statistics, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by comparing the new tests to the combined results of ZnSO(4) and SNAP tests. RESULTS: There was fair (Single Rapid, j=0·434) to good (Triple Rapid, j =0·797) agreement with the reference tests. At this study's prevalence (59 to 61%), specificities and PPV were high (1·00) with both Rapid tests, but sensitivities and NPV were lower for the Single than for the Triple (0·48 vs 0·83 and 0·55 vs 0·80) tests. At lower prevalence rates, both tests exhibited a high PPV (1·00), but the NPV were higher with the Triple (0·96 to 0·99) than the Single (0·88 to 0·96) Rapid test. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Both tests exhibited excellent PPV values at all prevalence rates but an excellent NPV only at low prevalence. As the prevalence is likely to be low (<15%) in clinical settings, we propose that these tests may be helpful in the in‐house diagnosis of Giardia spp infection. However, they exhibit lower sensitivity than the combined sensitivity of ZnSO(4) and SNAP tests, particularly in high prevalence settings.","Costa, M.; Clarke, C.; Mitchell, S.; Papasouliotis, K.",J Small Anim Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251310/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12475,158

High-risk patients presenting with progressing symptomatic disease have only hospitalization treatment with its high mortality. An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed. Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin. Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials have been registered in outpatients. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and outpatient trials results are not expected until September. Early outpatient illness is very different than later hospitalized florid disease and the treatments differ. Evidence about use of hydroxychloroquine alone, or of hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin in inpatients, is irrelevant concerning efficacy of the pair in early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including two controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin has been used as standard-of-care in more than 300,000 older adults with multicomorbidities, with estimated proportion diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmias attributable to the medications 47/100,000 users, of which estimated mortality is <20%, 9/100,000 users, compared to the 10,000 Americans now dying each week.

Compared with mildly or moderately diseased patients, those with severe or critical COVID-19 disease were more likely to have pre-infection vitamin D deficiency of less than 20 ng/mL (OR=14.30, 95%, 4.01-50.9; p < .001); be older (OR=1.039 for each year, 95% CI for OR, 1.017-1.061; p< .01), and have diabetes (OR=2.031, 95% CI for OR, 1.04-3.36; p= 0.038). Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher rates of mortality (p<0.001) and comorbidities including COPD (p=0.006), diabetes (p=0.026), and hypertension (p =0.016). Conclusions: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D was associated with increased disease severity and mortality.","Dror, A.

We utilize the 2013 tax reform that lowered the price subsidy for long-term savings in order to obtain causal identification. Our difference-in-difference analysis illustrates that there is a considerable heterogeneity in the individual responses to the subsidy cut—with middle-income taxpayers responding much more than their high-income counterparts. Among the middle-income group, we also find that the subsidy reduction has larger effects on decisions of smaller contributors. Our findings shed light on the heterogeneity of individual responses which are crucial for policymakers who consider an incremental change in the existing tax incentive scheme.

However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and R(0) are debated. We developed an inference approach to control for confounding factors in data collection, such as underreporting and changes in surveillance intensities, and fitted a mathematical model to infection and death count data collected from eight European countries and the US. In all countries, the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19–0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4–3.7 days). This suggests a highly infectious virus with an R(0) likely between 4.0 and 7.1. We show that similar levels of intervention efforts are needed, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment.

Indeed, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna are Italian regions with both the highest level of virus lethality in the world and one of Europe’s most polluted area. Based on this correlation, this paper analyzes the possible link between pollution and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death. We provide evidence that people living in an area with high levels of pollutant are more prone to develop chronic respiratory conditions and suitable to any infective agent. Moreover, a prolonged exposure to air pollution leads to a chronic inflammatory stimulus, even in young and healthy subjects. We conclude that the high level of pollution in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area.","Conticini, Edoardo; Frediani, Bruno; Caro, Dario",Environ Pollut,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120320601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268945/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120320601,158

Data on clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Japan are limited in the literature. This study aimed to describe the clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. Methods This is a single-center case series study. Patients with COVID-19 treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) were reviewed retrospectively. Data on baseline characteristics, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were collected. Results Between February 2, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were treated with MV. Most patients were male and had comorbidities, especially hypertension or diabetes; 35.7% were overweight and 21.4% were obese. The majority of the patients had dyspnea on admission. The median duration of MV was 10.5 days, and the 28-day mortality rate was 35.7%. In the four patients with COVID-19 who died, the cause of death was respiratory failure. Conclusions As in previous reports from other countries, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care remains high in Tokyo.

Because BCG vaccine evades lysosomal fusion in antigen presenting cells (APCs), leading to an inefficient production of peptides and antigen presentation required to activate CD4 T cells, we sought to boost its efficacy using novel agonists of RIG-I and NOD2 as adjuvants. We recently reported that the dinucleotide SB 9200 (Inarigivir) derived from our small molecule nucleic acid hybrid (SMNH)(®) platform, activated RIG-I and NOD2 receptors and exhibited a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against hepatitis B and C, Norovirus, RSV, influenza and parainfluenza. Inarigivir increased the ability of BCG-infected mouse APCs to secrete elevated levels of IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-β, and Caspase-1 dependent IL-1β cytokine. Inarigivir also increased the ability of macrophages to kill MTB in a Caspase-1-, and autophagy-dependent manner. Furthermore, Inarigivir led to a Capsase-1 and NOD2- dependent increase in the ability of BCG-infected APCs to present an Ag85B-p25 epitope to CD4 T cells in vitro. Consistent with an increase in immunogenicity of adjuvant treated APCs, the Inarigivir-BCG vaccine combination induced robust protection against tuberculosis in a mouse model of MTB infection, decreasing the lung burden of MTB by 1-log10 more than that afforded by BCG vaccine alone. The Inarigivir-BCG combination was also more efficacious than a muramyl-dipeptide-BCG vaccine combination against tuberculosis in mice, generating better memory T cell responses supporting its novel adjuvant potential for the BCG vaccine.","Khan, Arshad; Singh, Vipul K.; Mishra, Abhishek; Soudani, Emily; Bakhru, Pearl; Singh, Christopher R.; Zhang, Dekai; Canaday, David H.; Sheri, Anjaneyulu; Padmanabhan, Seetharamaiyer; Challa, Sreerupa; Iyer, Radhakrishnan P.; Jagannath, Chinnaswamy",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33365029/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.592333,158

628865,Understanding the Challenges and Uncertainties of Seroprevalence Studies for SARS-CoV-2,2021-04-27,"IMPORTANCE: Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Severe pneumonia associated with hypoxemia requires oxygen therapy; however, access remains unreliable in low- and middle-income countries. Solar-powered oxygen delivery (solar-powered O(2)) has been shown to be a safe and effective technology for delivering medical oxygen. Examining the cost-effectiveness of this innovation is critical for guiding implementation in low-resource settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of solar-powered O(2) for treating children in low-resource settings with severe pneumonia who require oxygen therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An economic evaluation study of solar-powered O(2) was conducted from January 12, 2020, to February 27, 2021, in compliance with the World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective (WHO-CHOICE) guidelines. Using existing literature, plausible ranges for component costs of solar-powered O(2) were determined in order to calculate the expected total cost of implementation. The costs of implementing solar-powered O(2) at a single health facility in low- and middle-income countries was analyzed for pediatric patients younger than 5 years who required supplemental oxygen. EXPOSURES: Treatment with solar-powered O(2). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of solar-powered O(2) was calculated as the additional cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved. Sensitivity of the ICER to uncertainties of input parameters was assessed through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The ICER of solar-powered O(2) was estimated to be $20 (US dollars) per DALY saved (95% CI, $2.83-$206) relative to the null case (no oxygen). Costs of solar-powered O(2) were alternatively quantified as $26 per patient treated and $542 per life saved. Univariate sensitivity analysis found that the ICER was most sensitive to the volume of pediatric pneumonia admissions and the case fatality rate. The ICER was insensitive to component costs of solar-powered O(2) systems. In secondary analyses, solar-powered O(2) was cost-effective relative to grid-powered concentrators (ICER $140 per DALY saved) and cost-saving relative to fuel generator-powered concentrators (cost saving of $7120). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this economic evaluation suggest that solar-powered O(2) is a cost-effective solution for treating hypoxemia in young children in low- and middle-income countries, relative to no oxygen. Future implementation should prioritize sites with high rates of pediatric pneumonia admissions and mortality. This study provides economic support for expansion of solar-powered O(2) and further assessment of its efficacy and mortality benefit.","Huang, Yiming; Mian, Qaasim; Conradi, Nicholas; Opoka, Robert O.; Conroy, Andrea L.; Namasopo, Sophie; Hawkes, Michael T.",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.14686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165579/,158

METHODS: Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (n = 10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. RESULTS: On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES‐D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one‐third of respondents had CES‐D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID‐19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. CONCLUSIONS: In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID‐19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M.; Harris, Casey; Drawve, Grant",Depress Anxiety,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667117/; https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23080,158

The practical challenges, however, have often led to testing only symptomatic individuals and their close contacts. As many countries plan for a cautious relaxation of social restrictions, more effective approaches for widescale testing are increasingly important. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratories in several countries demonstrated the feasibility of detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection by pooled testing, which combines the specimens from several individuals. Since no further testing is needed for individuals in a negative pool, there is potential for greater efficiency of testing. Despite validations of the accuracy of the results and the efficiency in testing specific groups, the benefits of pooling are less acknowledged as a population surveillance strategy that can detect new disease outbreaks without posing restrictions on entire societies. Pooling specimens from natural clusters, such as school classes, sports teams, workplace colleagues and other social networks, would enable timely and cost-effective widescale testing for SARS-CoV-2. The initial result would be readily translatable into action in terms of quarantine and isolation policies. Clusters of uninfected individuals would be quickly identified and immediate local lockdown of positive clusters would be the appropriate and sufficient action while retesting those individuals. By adapting to the social networks of a population, pooled testing offers a cost-efficient surveillance system that is synchronized with quarantine policies that are rational, risk-based and equitable.","Reilly, Marie; Chohan, Bhavna",Bull World Health Organ,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.283093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621088/,158

The Imperial College model trusted by the British Government predicted peak mortalities above 170 deaths per million in the United States, and above 215 deaths per million in Great Britain, after more than 2 months from the outbreak, and a length for the outbreak well above 4 months. These predictions drove the world to adopt harsh distancing measures and forget the concept of herd immunity. China had peak mortalities of less than 0.1 deaths per million after 40 days since first deaths, and an 80-day-long outbreak. Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, or Great Britain flattened the curve at 13.6, 28.6, 9.0, 10.6, and 13.9 deaths per million after 40, 39, 33, 44, and 39 days from first deaths, or 31, 29, 24, 38, and 29 days since the daily confirmed deaths reached 0.1 per million people, respectively. The declining curve is much slower for Italy, the Netherlands, or Great Britain than Belgium or Sweden. Opposite to Great Britain, Italy, or Belgium that enforced a complete lockdown, the Netherlands only adopted an “intelligent” lockdown, and Sweden did not adopt any lockdown. However, they achieved better results. Coupled to new evidence for minimal impact of Covid-19 on the healthy population, with the most part not infected even if challenged, or only mild or asymptomatic if infected, there are many good reasons to question the validity of the specific epidemiological model simulations and the policies they produced. Fewer restrictions on the healthy while better protecting the vulnerable would have been a much better option, permitting more sustainable protection of countries otherwise at risk of second waves as soon as the strict measures are lifted.","Boretti, Alberto",Health Serv Res Manag Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1177/2333392820932324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596417/,158

Numerous drug design and repositioning projects have been launched to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting drug candidates have often failed due to the misprediction of their target-bound structures. The determination of water positions of such structures is particularly challenging due to the large number of possible drugs and the diversity of their hydration patterns. To answer this challenge and help correct predictions, we introduce a new protocol HydroDock, which can build hydrated drug–target complexes from scratch. HydroDock requires only the dry target and drug structures and produces their complexes with appropriately positioned water molecules. As a test application of the protocol, we built the structures of amantadine derivatives in complex with the influenza M2 transmembrane ion channel. The repositioning of amantadine derivatives from this influenza target to the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein was also investigated. Excellent agreement was observed between experiments and the structures determined by HydroDock. The atomic resolution complex structures showed that water plays a similar role in the binding of amphipathic amantadine derivatives to transmembrane ion channels of both influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. While the hydrophobic regions of the channels capture the bulky hydrocarbon group of the ligand, the surrounding waters direct its orientation parallel with the axes of the channels via bridging interactions with the ionic ligand head. As HydroDock supplied otherwise undetermined structural details, it can be recommended to improve the reliability of future design and repositioning of antiviral drug candidates and many other ligands with an influence of water structure on their mechanism of action.","Zsidó, Balázs Zoltán; Börzsei, Rita; Szél, Viktor; Hetényi, Csaba",J Chem Inf Model,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313421/,158

We show that under idealistic assumptions 70% of transmission may be averted, but under realistic assumptions only 7% may be averted. We show that programs that overwhelm laboratory capacity or reduce isolation of those with minor symptoms have increased transmission compared with those that do not: programs need to be designed to avoid these issues.

638978,A Clinical-Epidemiological and Geospatial Study of Tuberculosis in a Neglected Area in the Amazonian Region Highlights the Urgent Need for Control Measures,2021-02-02,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has extensively impacted global health. The causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a transmembrane metallo-carboxypeptidase that is expressed in both membrane-anchored (mACE2) and soluble (sACE2) forms in the lung. Tobacco use has been speculated as a vulnerability factor for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent disease severity, whilst electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been shown to induce harmful proteomic and immune changes in the lungs of vapers. We therefore tested the hypothesis that combustible tobacco (e.g. cigarettes) and non-combustible e-cigarettes could affect ACE2 activity and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed that sACE2 activity was significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from both smokers and vapers compared to age-matched non-smokers. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased ACE2 levels, mACE2 activity, and sACE2 in primary bronchial epithelial cultures. Finally, treatment with either cigarette smoke condensate or JUUL e-liquid increased infections with a spike-coated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these observations suggest that tobacco product use elevates ACE2 activity and increases the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection through enhanced spike protein binding.","Ghosh, Arunava; Girish, Vishruth; Yuan, Monet Lou; Coakley, Raymond D.; Alexis, Neil E.; Sausville, Erin L.; Vasudevan, Anand; Chait, Alexander R.; Sheltzer, Jason M.; Tarran, Robert",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.04.447156,158

646550,Modeling the Heterogeneity of Dengue Transmission in a City,2018-05-31,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is especially severe in aged populations(1). Resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has been advanced by the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility(2). The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially in aged populations. Here, we describe the isolation of a new set of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a novel therapeutic drug useful in infections of aged animals. Initially, we show that many of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (at positions 417, 484, 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern (VOC)(2). Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for their selection. Similar to the human infection, aged mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 develop more severe disease than young mice. In murine SARS, in which severity is also age-dependent, we showed that elevated levels of an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD(2)) and of a phospholipase, PLA(2)G2D, contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice(3,4). Using our virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that infection of middle-aged mice lacking expression of DP1, a PGD(2) receptor, or PLA(2)G2D are protected from severe disease. Further, treatment with a DP1 antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from a lethal infection. DP1 antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, and demonstrates that the PLA(2)G2D-PGD(2)/DP1 pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions.","Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Zheng, Jian; Wilhelmsen, Kevin; Li, Kun; Ortiz, Miguel E.; Schnicker, Nicholas J.; Pezzulo, Alejandro A.; Szachowicz, Peter J.; Klumpp, Klaus; Aswad, Fred; Rebo, Justin; Narumiya, Shuh; Murakami, Makoto; Meyerholz, David K.; Fortney, Kristen; McCray, Paul B.; Perlman, Stanley",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907749/,158

It is essential to consider, especially for resource-limited nations, strategizing the coordinated response to handle this crisis effectively and preparing for the upcoming emergence of calamity caused by this yet-to-know disease entity. Relevant epidemiological data were retrieved from currently available online reports related to COVID-19 patients. The correlation coefficient was calculated by plotting dependant variables - the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths due to COVID 19 on the Y-axis and independent variables - critical-care beds per capita, the median age of the population of the country, the number of COVID-19 tests per million population, population density (persons per square km), urban population percentage, and gross domestic product (GDP) expense on health care - on the X-axis. After analyzing the data, both the fatality rate and the total number of COVID-19 cases were found to have an inverse association with the population density with the variable - the number of cases of COVID-19 - achieving a statistical significance (p-value 0.01). The negative correlation between critical care beds and the fatality rate is well-justified, as intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators are the critical elements in the management of complicated cases. There was also a significant positive correlation between GDP expenses on healthcare by a country and the number of COVID-19 cases being registered (p-value 0.008), although that did not affect mortality (p-value 0.851). This analysis discusses the overview of various epidemiological determinants possibly contributing to the variation in patient outcomes across regions and helps improve our understanding to develop a plan of action and effective control measures in the future.","Roy, Sayak; Khalse, Maneesha",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523858/,158
649843,Consumer Choices and Habits Related to Coffee Consumption by Poles,2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND: To explore the association of thrombo-inflammatory biomarkers with severity in coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we measured antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and calprotectin in sera of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-ß2-glycoprotein I antibodies were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex flow immunoassay (MFIA) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N = 105) and healthy controls (N = 38). Anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies, calprotectin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also measured. We assessed the potential correlation between calprotectin levels and various laboratory parameters that were measured during the hospitalization period. After stratifying COVID-19 patients into two groups by their oxygenation status or acute respiratory distress syndrome presentation, the discriminatory performance of each biomarker was evaluated. RESULTS: A high proportion of COVID-19 patients (29.5%, 31/105) had low aCL IgM titers that were detectable by ELISA but mostly below the detection limit of MFIA. Calprotectin levels in severe groups of COVID-19 were significantly higher than those in non-severe groups, while CRP levels revealed no significant differences. Serum calprotectin levels showed strong to moderate degree of correlation with other routinely used parameters including peak levels of CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin, BUN, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, but a negative correlation with minimal lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cells. The discriminatory performance was highest for calprotectin in discriminating severe groups of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Serum calprotectin levels were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 cases. The prevalence of clinically significant aPL did not differ. The link between calprotectin and inflammatory pathway in COVID-19 may help improve the management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients.","Lee, Anna; Nahm, Chung Hyun; Lee, Jin-Soo; Lee, Mi-Kyeong; Lee, Kyoung-Ryul",J Clin Lab Anal,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.24004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608677/,158

652249,Efficiency of Human Resources in Public Hospitals: An Example from the Czech Republic,2021-04-28,"Small RNA viruses have evolved many mechanisms to increase the capacity of their short genomes. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel open reading frame (ORF4) encoded by the murine norovirus (MNV) subgenomic RNA, in an alternative reading frame overlapping the VP1 coding region. ORF4 is translated during virus infection and the resultant protein localizes predominantly to the mitochondria. Using reverse genetics we demonstrated that expression of ORF4 is not required for virus replication in tissue culture but its loss results in a fitness cost since viruses lacking the ability to express ORF4 restore expression upon repeated passage in tissue culture. Functional analysis indicated that the protein produced from ORF4 antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-Beta. Apoptosis in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was also increased during virus infection in the absence of ORF4 expression. In vivo analysis of the WT and mutant virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 demonstrated an important role for ORF4 expression in infection and virulence. STAT1-/- mice infected with a virus lacking the ability to express ORF4 showed a delay in the onset of clinical signs when compared to mice infected with WT virus. Quantitative PCR and histopathological analysis of samples from these infected mice demonstrated that infection with a virus not expressing ORF4 results in a delayed infection in this system. In light of these findings we propose the name virulence factor 1, VF1 for this protein. The identification of VF1 represents the first characterization of an alternative open reading frame protein for the calicivirus family. The immune regulatory function of the MNV VF1 protein provide important perspectives for future research into norovirus biology and pathogenesis.","McFadden, Nora; Bailey, Dalan; Carrara, Guia; Benson, Alicia; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Shortland, Amita; Heeney, Jonathan; Yarovinsky, Felix; Simmonds, Peter; Macdonald, Andrew; Goodfellow, Ian",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174679/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002413,158

A Socioeconomic Analysis of Gender Disparity in Obesity in Urban China,2020-09-24,"Background: To end the COVID-19 pandemic, a large part of the world must be immune to the virus by vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to gauge intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 among ordinary people and to identify attitudes towards vaccines and barriers for vaccine acceptance. Methods: The study population comprises 1880 people residing in different countries that answer a prepared questionnaire. The questionnaire topics are demographics, historical issues, participants’ attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccines, concerns, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Attitudes and beliefs relating to vaccines in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine, were ascertained. Overall, 66.81% of the contributors would like to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while %33.19 did not intend to be vaccinated. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding vaccine side effects, fear of getting sick from the uptake of the vaccine, and the absence of accurate vaccine promotion news. Individuals with higher education believe that India (68.6%) produces the best vaccine (P <0.001), while healthcare workers think the Chinese vaccine (44.2%) is the best (P =0.020). Individuals with higher education have not been vaccinated, not be healthcare workers, and females were the most contributors to effective of the vaccine in reducing mortality from COVID-19 disease. Conclusion: Given the degree of hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccination, a multifaceted approach to facilitate vaccine uptake that includes vaccine education, behavioral change strategies, and health promotion, is paramount.","Asadi Faezi, Nasim; Gholizadeh, Pourya; Sanogo, Moussa; Oumarou, Amadou; Mohamed, Maad Nasser; Cissoko, Yacouba; Saliou Sow, Mamadou; Keita, Bakary Sayon; Baye, Youssouf AG Mohamed; Pagliano, Pasquale; Akouda, Patassi; Soufiane, Sid'Ahmed; Iknane, Akory Ag; Safiatou Diallo, Mamadou Oury; Gansane, Zakaria; Ali Khan, Barkat; Köse, Şükran; Allahverdipour, Hamid; Ganvarov, Khudaverdi; Soumaré, Mariam; Asgharzadeh, Mohammad; Dao, Sounkalo; Samadi Kafil, Hossein",Health Promot Perspect,https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2021.21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195040/,158

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Nurses (n = 241) in an acute care hospital completed the survey including the Factors Influencing Adherence to Standard Precautions Scale (FIASPS) (total possible scores in each domain ranged from 5 to 25) and the Compliance with Standard Precautions Scale (CSPS) (total possible scores ranged from 0 to 20). RESULTS: Results showed moderate influence of the judgement (mean = 14.04, SD = 4.04), leadership (M = 14.58, SD 3.78), and culture/practice (M = 12.61, SD = 3.18) factors; high score on contextual cues (M = 15.77, SD = 3.60); and low score on justification (M = 5.76, SD = 4.57). The overall mean CSPS score was 76.68% (SD 13.82). There was a significant negative relationship between justification for non-use of standard precautions and nurses' adherence with standard precautions (r = −0.24, p < 0.001). A significant positive relationship was reported between the leadership factor (r = 0.25, p < 0.001), cultural practice factor in FIASPS (r = 0.24, p < 0.001) and nurse' adherence with standard precautions.

Several coronaviruses, such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are of medical importance, with high mortality rates and, in the case of SARS-CoV, significant pandemic potential. Other coronaviruses, such as Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Avian coronavirus, are important livestock pathogens. Ribosome profiling is a technique which exploits the capacity of the translating ribosome to protect around 30 nucleotides of mRNA from ribonuclease digestion. Ribosome-protected mRNA fragments are purified, subjected to deep sequencing and mapped back to the transcriptome to give a global “snap-shot” of translation. Parallel RNA sequencing allows normalization by transcript abundance. Here we apply ribosome profiling to cells infected with Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59 (MHV-A59), a model coronavirus in the same genus as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The data obtained allowed us to study the kinetics of virus transcription and translation with exquisite precision. We studied the timecourse of positive and negative-sense genomic and subgenomic viral RNA production and the relative translation efficiencies of the different virus ORFs. Virus mRNAs were not found to be translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; rather, virus translation dominates host translation at later time points due to high levels of virus transcripts. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of translated reading frames and revealed several translated short open reading frames upstream of, or embedded within, known virus protein-coding regions. Ribosome pause sites were identified in the virus replicase polyprotein pp1a ORF and investigated experimentally. Contrary to expectations, ribosomes were not found to pause at the ribosomal frameshift site. To our knowledge this is the first application of ribosome profiling to an RNA virus.","Irigoyen, Nerea; Firth, Andrew E.; Jones, Joshua D.; Chung, Betty Y.-W.; Siddell, Stuart G.; Brierley, Ian",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919232/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005473,158

For example, in the US, estimate the proportion P(t) = N/330 where N is the US total who have ever been infected (in millions)at time t (months, t =0 being March 20). This is important for decisions on social restrictions, and allocation of medical resources, etc. However, the demand for extensive testing has not produced good estimates. In the US, the CDC has used the blood supply to sample for anti-bodies. Anti-bodies do not tell the whole picture, according to the Karolinska Instituet , many post infection cases show T-cell immunity, but no anti-bodies. We introduce a method based on a difference-differential equation (dde) for P(t). We emphasize that this is just for the present, with no prediction on how the pandemic will evolve. The dde uses only x=x(s), which is the number/million testing positive, and y=y(s), the number/million who have been tested for all time 0 < s < t (months), with no assumptions on the dynamics of the pandemic. However, we need two parameters. First, R , the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infected cases. Second, T , the period of active infection when the virus can be detected. Both are random variables with distribution which can be estimated. For fixed R, we prove uniform bounds (1+ R) x/(y +1) < P(t) < (1+ R) x(t) , are best possible, with range depending on T . One advantage of our theory is being able to estimate P for many regions and countries where x and y is the only information available.","Hamilton, D.

The majority of people in the nation receive health care via employment‐based health insurance from providers in a competitive market. However, neither employment‐based health care nor a competitive health care market can adequately provide treatment during a global pandemic. Employment‐based health care will fail to provide care for a large number of people in any destabilizing economic event, including a pandemic. Competitive for‐profit health care systems distribute limited goods based on markets rather than health care needs. If a global pandemic results in unusually high demand for specific medical supplies, then these will be distributed suboptimally. The combined risk of suboptimal distribution of needed goods and a significant drop in health care access in a global pandemic indicates that the U.S. health care system has serious vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.","Kolmes, Sara",Hastings Cent Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596914/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1126,158

RESULTS: Overall, the recommendations consider three phases; review of the first wave, preparation for the next wave, and during the next wave. International and national policies will drive most of the management. The recommendations focus on the preparation phase and, in particular, the actions that the individual surgeon needs to undertake to continue with, and practice, elective arthroplasty during the next wave, as well as planning their personal and their family’s lives. The recommendations expect rigorous data collection during the next wave, so that a cycle of continuous improvement is created to take account of any future waves. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations for planning to continue elective hip and knee arthroplasty during a new phase of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic provide a framework to reduce the risk of a complete shutdown of elective surgery. This involves engaging with hospital managers and other specialities in the planning process. Individuals have responsibilities to themselves, their colleagues, and their families, beyond the actual delivery of elective arthroplasty.","Donell, Simon T.; Thaler, Martin; Budhiparama, Nicolaas C.; Buttaro, Martin A.; Chen, Antonia F.; Diaz-Ledezma, Claudio; Gomberg, Bruce; Hirschmann, Michael T.; Karachalios, Theofilos; Karpukhin, Alexey; Sandiford, Nemandra Amir; Shao, Hongyi; Tandogan, Reha; Violante, Bruno; Zagra, Luigi; Kort, Nanne P.",Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00167-020-06213-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803277/,158

662402,Acceptance of Illness and Compliance with Therapeutic Recommendations in Patients with Hypertension,2020-09-17,"Adults experiencing homelessness are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder compared to adults in the general population. Although shelter-based treatments are common, completion rates tend to be poor, suggesting a need for more effective approaches that are tailored to this understudied and underserved population. One barrier to developing more effective treatments is the limited knowledge of the triggers of alcohol use among homeless adults. This paper describes the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify predictors of “imminent drinking” (i.e., drinking within the next 4 h), among a sample of adults experiencing homelessness and receiving health services at a homeless shelter. A total of 78 mostly male (84.6%) adults experiencing homelessness (mean age = 46.6) who reported hazardous drinking completed up to five EMAs per day over 4 weeks (a total of 4557 completed EMAs). The study used machine learning techniques to create a drinking risk algorithm that predicted 82% of imminent drinking episodes within 4 h of the first drink of the day, and correctly identified 76% of nondrinking episodes. The algorithm included the following 7 predictors of imminent drinking: urge to drink, having alcohol easily available, feeling confident that alcohol would improve mood, feeling depressed, lower commitment to being alcohol free, not interacting with someone drinking alcohol, and being indoors. The research team used the results to develop intervention content (e.g., brief tailored messages) that will be delivered when imminent drinking is detected in an upcoming intervention phase. Specifically, we created three theoretically grounded message tracks focused on urge/craving, social/availability, and negative affect/mood, which are further tailored to a participant’s current drinking goal (i.e., stay sober, drink less, no goal) to support positive change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop tailored intervention messages based on likelihood of imminent drinking, current drinking triggers, and drinking goals among adults experiencing homelessness.","Walters, Scott T.; Businelle, Michael S.; Suchting, Robert; Li, Xiaoyin; Hébert, Emily T.; Mun, Eun-Young",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134874/,158

Vulnerable blood (‘thrombogenicity’) comprises complex interactions between cellular components and plasma factors (inflammatory, procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic factors). The extent of thrombogenicity may determine the progression of atheroma and the clinical manifestation of atherothrombotic events, with the highest thrombogenicity in African Americans and lowest in East Asians. Inherent thrombogenicity may influence clinical efficacy and safety of specific antithrombotic treatments in high-risk patients, which may in part explain the observation that East Asian patients have reduced anti-ischemic benefits and elevated bleeding risk with antithrombotic therapy compared to Caucasian patients. In this review, we discuss available evidence regarding the racial differences in thrombogenicity and its impact on clinical outcomes among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Kim, Hyun Kuk; Tantry, Udaya S.; Park, Hyun-Woong; Shin, Eun-Seok; Geisler, Tobias; Gorog, Diana A.; Gurbel, Paul A; Jeong, Young-Hoon",Korean Circ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655720/; https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2020.0537,158

In this study, we aim to determine risk factors which effect severity and mortality rates in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in KSA. METHOD: We reviewed medical records of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 positive results via reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests at Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital, Riyadh between May and August 2020. Data were obtained for patient’s demography, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities. Additional data on patients that required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and clinical outcomes were recorded and analyzed with Python Pandas. RESULTS: A total of 565 COVID-19 positive patients were inducted in the study out of which, 63 (11.1%) patients died while 101 (17.9%) patients required ICU admission. Disease incidences were significantly higher in males and non-Saudi nationals. Patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal diseases displayed significantly higher association with ICU admissions (p<0.001) while mortality rates were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and neurological diseases. Univariate cox proportional hazards regression model showed that COVID-19 positive patients requiring ICU admission [Hazard’s ratio, HR=4.2 95% confidence interval, CI 2.5–7.2); p<0.001] with preexisting cardiovascular [HR=4.1 (CI 2.5–6.7); p<0.001] or respiratory [HR=4.0 (CI 2.0–8.1); p=0.010] diseases were at significantly higher risk for mortality among the positive patients. There were no significant differences in mortality rates or ICU admissions among males and females, and across different age groups, BMIs and nationalities. Hospitalized patients with cardiovascular comorbidity had the highest risk of death (HR=2.9, CI 1.7–5.0; p=0.020). CONCLUSION: Independent risk factors for critical outcomes among COVID-19 in KSA include cardiovascular, respiratory and renal comorbidities.","Shaikh, Fatema S; Aldhafferi, Nahier; Buker, Areej; Alqahtani, Abdullah; Dey, Subhodeep; Abdulhamid, Saema; AlBuhairi, Dalal Ali Mahaii; Alkabour, Raha Saud Abdulaziz; Atiyah, Waad Sami O; Bachar Chrouf, Sara; Alshehri, Abdussalam; Olatunji, Sunday Olusanya; Almuhaideb, Abdullah M; Alshahrani, Mohammed S; AlMunsour, Yousof; Abdul-Salam, Vahitha B",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s317884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408431/,158

(Autoimmunity Reviews 19 (2020) 102597) The reports of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) are increasing too, but mainly is an immune dysregulation setting. Cases: here we report two cases of AIHA in a non immune dysregulation setting. Two females, 35 and 58 years old, presented to emergency service due severe anemic syndrome, severe pallor, dyspnea and mild fever. Work up was started and warm IgG - C3d autoantibodies AIHA was diagnosed. Extension studies included chest X-rays that showed basal infiltrates in both patients; lung CT scan were performed and revealed interstitial pneumonia predominantly in both lung bases. The PCR fo SARS-COV2 was positive for both patients. Treatment with methylprednisolone 1 gr per day for three days and IgG IV 1 gr/kg days 1 and 3. Treatment for COVID-19 was started according to institutional protocols. The evolution in both patients were to partial remission and needs prednisone 20 mg/day and still in it at the time of these report. Images show lung infiltrates and increased 56% reticulocytes count from one of the patients. Conclusion: the exact etiology of autoimmune diseases still unknown, but there are various factors, including viral infections, that contributes to the trigger of these type of diseases. AIHA has been associated with COVID-19 and it is postulated that molecular mimicry between Ankyrin-1 in the erythrocyte surface and the viral protein spike as the precipitating event. (Br J Haematol 2020;190:e92-e93) There are scanty cases of AIHA in the setting of COVID-19, the majority in the previously immune dysregulated patients (lymphoid neoplasias and autoimmune diseases); only two previously cases of AIHA with no underlaying disorder. We suggest that the work up for every patient with AIHA would include a lung CT Scan and PCR for SARS-COV2. There are not guidelines for treatment, but the lowest dose and time of steroids with IgG IV could be an option as recommended in guidelines for primary immune thrombocytopenia in the setting of COVID-19 infection.

Mice are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to low-affinity binding to the murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. Here, we evaluated the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in male and female mice expressing the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18 promoter (K18). In contrast to nontransgenic mice, intranasal exposure of K18-hACE2 animals to 2 different doses of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in acute disease, including weight loss, lung injury, brain infection, and lethality. Vasculitis was the most prominent finding in the lungs of infected mice. Transcriptomic analysis from lungs of infected animals showed increases in transcripts involved in lung injury and inflammatory cytokines. In the low-dose challenge groups, there was a survival advantage in the female mice, with 60% surviving infection, whereas all male mice succumbed to disease. Male mice that succumbed to disease had higher levels of inflammatory transcripts compared with female mice. To our knowledge, this is the first highly lethal murine infection model for SARS-CoV-2 and should be valuable for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and for the assessment of MCMs.","Golden, Joseph W.; Cline, Curtis R.; Zeng, Xiankun; Garrison, Aura R.; Carey, Brian D.; Mucker, Eric M.; White, Lauren E.; Shamblin, Joshua D.; Brocato, Rebecca L.; Liu, Jun; Babka, April M.; Rauch, Hypaitia B.; Smith, Jeffrey M.; Hollidge, Bradley S.; Fitzpatrick, Collin; Badger, Catherine V.; Hooper, Jay W.",JCI insight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841215/; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.142032,158

We aimed to investigate whether a shorter symptom onset to admission time (SOAT) could improve outcomes of COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: A single‐center retrospective study combined with a meta‐analysis was performed. The meta‐analysis identified studies published between 1 December 2019 and 15 April 2020. Additionally, clinical data of COVID‐19 patients diagnosed between January 20 and February 20, 2020, at the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China were retrospectively analyzed. SOAT and severity of illness in patients with COVID‐19 were used as effect measures. The random‐effects model was used to analyze the heterogeneity across studies. Propensity score matching was applied to adjust for confounding factors in the retrospective study. Categorical data were compared using Fisher's exact test. We compared the differences in laboratory characteristic varied times using a two‐way nonparametric, Scheirer–Ray–Hare test. RESULTS: In a meta‐analysis, we found that patients with adverse outcomes had a longer SOAT (I (2) = 39%, mean difference 0.88, 95% confidence interval = 0.47–1.30). After adjusting for confounding factors, such as age, complications, and treatment options, the retrospective analysis results also showed that severe patients had longer SOAT (mean difference 1.13 [1.00, 1.27], p = 0.046). Besides, most biochemical marker levels improved as the hospitalization time lengthened without the effect of disease severity or associated treatment (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Shortening the SOAT may help reduce the possibility of mild patients with COVID‐19 progressing to severe illness.","Guan, Yingchao; Chen, Chaojin; Guo, Anping; Wei, Jingru; Cai, Jiahui; Han, Hua; Hei, Ziqing; Tan, Haizhu; Li, Xiaoyun",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347302/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27253,158

Es una infección respiratoria con complicaciones a nivel cardiaco, hematológico, digestivo, neurológico y renal. El fracaso renal agudo (FRA) en pacientes hospitalizados por COVID-19 se presenta en el 0,5-25% y es un factor de mal pronóstico. Los mecanismos de afectación renal no están completamente aclarados. Presentamos la evolución clínica de pacientes ingresados por COVID-19 con FRA que requirieron atención por nefrología en un hospital terciario de la comunidad de Madrid, España. Métodos: Éste es un estudio observacional prospectivo de todos los casos que ingresaron por COVID-19 entre el 6 de marzo y el 12 de mayo de 2020 y requirieron atención por Nefrología.

Background and aim: In December 2019, a coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, took place in Wuhan and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Methods: This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. Results: We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 36.6%. 56.1% of patients presented with sever pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. 48.8% of patients required renal replacement therapy (RRT). Median length of stay was 12 days (interquartilic range 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, Lactate dehydrogenase-LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent intensive care unit-ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and RRT requirement. Conclusions: Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers as well as individualized fluid management can play a key role in AKI prevention.","Tarragón, Blanca; Valdenebro, María; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Maroto, Alba; Llópez-Carratalá, MR; Ramos, Antonio; Rubio, Esther; Huerta, Ana; Marques, María; Portolés, Jose",Nefrologia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0211699520301405?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162225/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nefro.2020.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0211699520301405,158

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among medical and nursing students aged > 18 years in their clinical years in Israel between 27 August and 28 September 2020. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to predict acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: A total number of 628 participants completed the survey. Medical students expressed higher intentions of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 than nursing students (88.1% vs. 76.2%, p < 0.01). The integrated model based on HBM and TPB was able to explain 66% of the variance (adjusted R(2) = 0.66). Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers, cues to action, attitude, self-efficacy and anticipated regret. Two interaction effects revealed that male nurses had a higher intention of getting vaccinated than did female nurses and that susceptibility is a predictor of the intention of getting vaccinated only among nurses. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that both models considered (i.e., HBM and TPB) are important for predicting the intention of getting a COVID-19 vaccine among medical and nursing students, and can help better guide intervention programs, based on components from both models. Our findings also highlight the importance of paying attention to a targeted group of female nurses, who expressed low vaccine acceptance.","Rosental, Hila; Shmueli, Liora",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9070783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34358199/,158
671454,Corona-Triggered Global Macroeconomic Crisis of the Early 2020s,2020-12-15,"Several lines of existing evidence support the possibility of airborne transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, quantitative information on the relative importance of transmission pathways of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains limited. To evaluate the relative importance of multiple transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2, we developed a modeling framework and leveraged detailed information available from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak that occurred in early 2020. We modeled 21,600 scenarios to generate a matrix of solutions across a full range of assumptions for eight unknown or uncertain epidemic and mechanistic transmission factors. A total of 132 model iterations met acceptability criteria (R(2) > 0.95 for modeled vs. reported cumulative daily cases and R(2) > 0 for daily cases). Analyzing only these successful model iterations quantifies the likely contributions of each defined mode of transmission. Mean estimates of the contributions of short-range, long-range, and fomite transmission modes to infected cases across the entire simulation period were 35%, 35%, and 30%, respectively. Mean estimates of the contributions of larger respiratory droplets and smaller respiratory aerosols were 41% and 59%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that aerosol inhalation was likely the dominant contributor to COVID-19 transmission among the passengers, even considering a conservative assumption of high ventilation rates and no air recirculation conditions for the cruise ship. Moreover, close-range and long-range transmission likely contributed similarly to disease progression aboard the ship, with fomite transmission playing a smaller role. The passenger quarantine also affected the importance of each mode, demonstrating the impacts of the interventions.","Azimi, Parham; Keshavarz, Zahra; Cedeno Laurent, Jose Guillermo; Stephens, Brent; Allen, Joseph G.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015482118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536312/,158

By strictly separating team workflows and implementing vigorous testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections for all patients and staff members irrespective of clinical symptoms, we were successful in maintaining a comprehensive hematology/oncology service to allow for the continuation of treatment for our patients. Notably, this was achieved without introducing or further transmitting SARS-CoV-2 infections within the unit and the entire center. Although challenging, our approach appears safe and feasible and may help others to set up or optimize their procedures for cancer treatment or for other exceedingly vulnerable patient cohorts.","Hemmati, Philipp G.; Fischer, Dorothea; Breywisch, Frank; Wohlfarth, Sabine; Kramer, Matthias; Paland, Matthias; Tometten, Lukas; Badakhshi, Harun; Ripberger, Gerald; Maschmeyer, Georg",Oncol Res Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33940575/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000515828,158
678372,Prevalence of Suicide Thoughts and Behaviours among Female Garment Workers Who Survived the Rana Plaza Collapse: An In-Depth Inquiry,2021-06-11,"Sweden stands out among the other European countries by the degree of restrictive measures taken towards handling the 2019 coronavirus outbreak, associated with the CoViD-19 pandemic. While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown in order to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In the present contribution, the impact of this strategy will be observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during the associated period. The data used are recorded during a campaign of over a full year of noise level measurements at a building façade situated in a busy urban intersection in central Stockholm, Sweden. The noise level reductions, observed during the period of restrictions, are shown to be comparable to those found for the two most popular public holidays in Sweden with a peak reduction occurring during the first half of April 2020. Contrary to what has been recently discussed in public media, the spread of the virus, the recommendations, and the restrictions imposed during the ongoing pandemic clearly have had a significant effect on the transport and other human-related activities in Stockholm. In this unique investigation, the use of distributed acoustic sensors has thus shown to be a viable solution not only to enforce regulations but also to monitor the effectiveness of their implementation.","Rumpler, Romain; Venkataraman, Siddharth; Göransson, Peter",Sustain Cities Soc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901217/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670720306892; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720306892?v=s5,158
683468,Does Being Ill Improve Acceptance of Medical Technology?—A Patient Survey with the Technology Usage Inventory,2021-09-05,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to cancellation of all elective surgeries for a time period in the vast majority of the United States. We compiled a questionnaire to determine the physical and mental toll of this delay on elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) patients. METHODS: All patients whose primary or revision total hip or knee arthroplasty was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic-private practice were identified. An11-question survey was administered to these patients via email. All data was de-identified and stored in a REDCAP database. RESULTS: Of 367 total patients identified, 113 responded to the survey. Seventy-seven percent of patients had their surgery postponed at least 5 weeks, and 20% were delayed longer than 12 weeks. Forty-one percent of patients reported an average VAS pain score greater than 7.5. Forty percent of respondents experienced increased anxiety during the delay. Thirty-four percent of patients felt their surgery was not elective. Sixteen percent experienced a fall during the delay, and 1 patient sustained a hip fracture. Level of pain reported was significantly associated with negative emotions, negative effects of delay, and whether patients felt their surgery was indeed elective. 76% reported trust in their surgeon’s judgement regarding appropriate timing of surgery. Communication was listed as the number one way in which patients felt their surgeon could have improved during this time. CONCLUSION: Surgical delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased pain and anxiety many total joint arthroplasty patients. While the majority of patients maintained trust in their surgeon during the delay, methods to improve communication may benefit the patient experience in future delays.

683551,"Building Capacity in Monitoring Urban Liveability in Bangkok: Critical Success Factors and Reflections from a Multi-Sectoral, International Partnership",2021-07-08,"2′-5′-Oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) are innate immune sensors of cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and play a critical role in limiting viral infection. dsRNA binding induces allosteric structural changes in OAS1 that reorganize its catalytic center to promote synthesis of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate and thus activation of endoribonuclease L. Specific RNA sequences and structural motifs can also enhance activation of OAS1 through currently undefined mechanisms. To better understand these drivers of OAS activation, we tested the impact of defined sequence changes within a short dsRNA that strongly activates OAS1. Both in vitro and in human A549 cells, appending a 3′-end single-stranded pyrimidine (3′-ssPy) can strongly enhance OAS1 activation or have no effect depending on its location, suggesting that other dsRNA features are necessary for correct presentation of the motif to OAS1. Consistent with this idea, we also find that the dsRNA binding position is dictated by an established consensus sequence (WWN(9)WG). Unexpectedly, however, not all sequences fitting this consensus activate OAS1 equivalently, with strong dependence on the identity of both partially conserved (W) and non-conserved (N(9)) residues. A picture thus emerges in which both specific RNA features and the context in which they are presented dictate the ability of short dsRNAs to activate OAS1.","Schwartz, Samantha L; Park, Esther N; Vachon, Virginia K; Danzy, Shamika; Lowen, Anice C; Conn, Graeme L",Nucleic Acids Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32678884/,158

683838,A Laissez-Faire Strategy Marked by Blinkers to Fulfill Established Pandemic Goals—The Case of Sweden,2021-09-10,"Rotaviruses (RVs) are important enteric pathogens of newborn humans and animals, causing diarrhea and in rare cases death, especially in very young individuals. Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies. Although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model, our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against RV in humans as well as in various animal species.","Meier, Anita F.; Suter, Mark; Schraner, Elisabeth M.; Humbel, Bruno M.; Tobler, Kurt; Ackermann, Mathias; Laimbacher, Andrea S.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212334/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms18020431,158

Progress in this area has been hampered by a lack of consensus definitions and the limited number of published clinical trials. OBJECTIVES: To develop consensus definitions for rhinosinusitis and outline strategies useful in clinical trials. METHODS: Five national societies, The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; The American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy; The American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery; The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the American Rhinologic Society formed an expert panel from multiple disciplines. Over two days, the panel developed definitions for rhinosinusitis and outlined strategies for design of clinical trials. RESULTS: Committee members agreed to adopt the term “rhinosinusitis” and reached consensus on definitions and strategies for clinical research on acute presumed bacterial rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, and classic allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Symptom and objective criteria, measures for monitoring research progress, and use of symptom scoring tools, quality-of-life instruments, radiologic studies, and rhinoscopic assessment were outlined for each condition. CONCLUSION: The recommendations from this conference should improve accuracy of clinical diagnosis and serve as a starting point for design of rhinosinusitis clinical trials.","Meltzer, Eli O.; Hamilos, Daniel L.; Hadley, James A.; Lanza, Donald C.; Marple, Bradley F.; Nicklas, Richard A.; Bachert, Claus; Baraniuk, James; Baroody, Fuad M.; Benninger, Michael S.; Brook, Itzhak; Chowdhury, Badrul A.; Druce, Howard M.; Durham, Stephen; Ferguson, Berrylin; Gwaltney, Jack M.; Kaliner, Michael; Kennedy, David W.; Lund, Valerie; Naclerio, Robert; Pawankar, Ruby; Piccirillo, Jay F.; Rohane, Patricia; Simon, Ronald; Slavin, Raymond G.; Togias, Alkis; Wald, Ellen R.; Zinreich, S.

685883,Organizational-Level Moderators Impacting Tobacco-Related Knowledge Change after Tobacco Education Training in Substance Use Treatment Centers,2021-07-16,"COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health crisis threatening humanity at this point in time. Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase – Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1–2 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.","Sankar, Jhuma; Dhochak, Nitin; Kabra, S.

Inundation with American history, news, and culture around race and racism imbues Canadians with a false impression of egalitarianism, resulting in a lack of critical national reflection. While this is true in instances, the cruel reality of inequity, injustice and racism is rampant within the Canadian sexual and reproductive health and rights realm. Indeed, the inequitable health outcomes for Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) are rooted in policy, research, health promotion and patient care. Built by colonial settlers, many of the systems currently in place have yet to embark on the necessary process of addressing the colonial, racist, and ableist structures perpetuating inequities in health outcomes. The mere fact that Canada sees itself as better than America in terms of race relations is an excuse to overlook its decades of racial and cultural discrimination against Indigenous and Black people. While this commentary may not be ground-breaking for BIPOC communities who have remained vocal about these issues at a grassroots level for decades, there exists a gap in the Canadian literature in exploring these difficult and often underlying dynamics of racism. In this commentary series, the authors aim to promote strategies addressing systemic racism and incorporating a reproductive justice framework in an attempt to reduce health inequities among Indigenous, Black and racialized communities in Canada.","El-Mowafi, Ieman M.; Yalahow, Abdiasis; Idriss-Wheeler, Dina; Yaya, Sanni",Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01117-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750408/,158

The ferret is also used to study cystic fibrosis and various cancers, as well as reproductive biology and physiology. However, the range of reagents available to measure the ferret immune response is very limited. To address this deficiency, high-throughput real time RT-PCR TaqMan assays were developed to measure the expression of fifteen immune mediators associated with the innate and adaptive immune responses (IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, IL1α, IL1β, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12p40, IL17, Granzyme A, MCP1, TNFα), as well as four endogenous housekeeping genes (ATF4, HPRT, GAPDH, L32). These assays have been optimized to maximize reaction efficiency, reduce the amount of sample required (down to 1 ng RNA per real time RT-PCR reaction) and to select the most appropriate housekeeping genes. Using these assays, the expression of each of the tested genes could be detected in ferret lymph node cells stimulated with mitogens or infected with influenza virus in vitro. These new tools will allow a more comprehensive analysis of the ferret immune responses following infection or in other disease states.","Carolan, Louise A.; Butler, Jeff; Rockman, Steve; Guarnaccia, Teagan; Hurt, Aeron C.; Reading, Patrick; Kelso, Anne; Barr, Ian; Laurie, Karen L.",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24797460/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414001748; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.04.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414001748,158

METHODS A total of 535 individuals aged 52 years and above from the previous cohort and interventional studies in Peninsular Malaysia were contacted during the Movement Control Order (MCO) issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephonic interviews were conducted to obtain participant information concerning socio-demography, physical activity, subjective well-being (SWB) as assessed using flourishing scale, coping strategies, and general psychological health (GHQ-12). Simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with GHQ-12. The associated factors were further analysed using mediation analysis to determine the potential of coping strategies as a mediator. RESULTS It was observed that participants had a low mean GHQ-12 score (M = 0.80, SD = 2.19), indicating good psychological health. Living arrangement, physical activity, and flourishing scale were associated with psychological health (R2 = 0.412, p < 0.05) in MLR. Positive reinterpretation, emotional support, instrumental support, humour, denial, and self-blame appear to partially mediate the relationship between socio-demography, physical activity, flourishing scale and GHQ-12, with lower coefficient values. CONCLUSION Middle-aged and older adults in Malaysia had good psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when living with family, physically active, and having good subjective well-being.
