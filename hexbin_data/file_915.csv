114713,Usefulness of 3D High-resolution Vessel Wall MRI in Diffuse Nonaneurysmal SAH Patients.,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to assess reperfusion and clinical outcome of treatment with the self-expanding retrievable Separator 3D in revascularization of acute ischemic stroke. The three-dimensional (3D) device secures thrombus with direct aspiration and supports debulking of the clot. METHODS At two centers, 129 consecutive stroke patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores ≥5 were treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Separator 3D as a component of the Penumbra System within 8 h of symptom onset; modified Treatment in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) revascularization scores, NIHSS score on admission and discharge, mortality rates, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes at 90 days were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 129 vessels in 129 patients were treated. Occlusions were located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA, 48%), internal carotid artery (ICA, 33%), cervical ICA-MCA (3%), and vertebrobasilar arteries (16%). Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given to 78% of patients. Median NIHSS was 15 prior to treatment. Reperfusion to mTICI 2b or 3 was successful in 96/129 (74%) target arterial lesions, with more than half of cases (51%) achieving mTICI 3. The mean time from arterial puncture to revascularization was 65 min. At 90 days, the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 4%, all cause mortality was 32%, and 43/99 patients (43%) achieved functional independence with an mRS score of ≤2. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the Separator 3D enables safe and effective revascularization of occluded large arteries in acute stroke intervention, leading to a high rate of functional independence at 90 days.","Behme, Daniel; Kowoll, Annika; Mpotsaris, Anastasios; Hader, Claudia; Hechelhammer, Lukas; Weber, Johannes; Weber, Werner",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366355/,915

134634,An Integrated Analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs Microarray Profiles to Screen miRNA Signatures Involved in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.,2020,"INTRODUCTION The novel coronavirus pandemic has caused significant mortality throughout the world. This study was done as there is scarce data on mortality predictors in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to ICU in the Indian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to tertiary care center during June-October 2020. The records of patients admitted to ICU were collected and data included demography, symptoms, comorbidites and vital parameters. Laboratory parameters included complete hemogram, random blood sugar, S.Ferritin, S.LDH, renal function test, liver function test. Treatment-associated information such as the use of remdesivir, timing of initiating rem-desivir after the symptom onset, the use of steroids, use of anticoagulants, use of HFNC, NIV, ventilator were collected. 30 days mortality data post-discharge was collected via telephonic interview. RESULTS 4,012 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted to hospital, of which 560 (13.95%) with severe pneumonia were included in the study. Mean age was 57.75 ± 13.96 years. The mortality rates were 54.64% among severe COVID-19 cases and 5% among mild to moderate COVID-19 cases. The Cox multinominal regression analysis identified SpO2/FiO2 < 400, age > 50 years, duration of symptom > 4 days, serum ferritin > 450 µg/L, respiratory rate > 23/min, the presence of comorbidities and non-usage of remdesivir were independently associated with increased mortality. Mortality rate at 30 days was 56.60%. CONCLUSION Severe COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with very high mortality, especially in a resource-constrained setting. The use of remdesivir may have to be considered early in the course of disease to prevent excess mortality related to COVID-19.","Mahendra, M; Nuchin, Abhishek; Kumar, Ranjith; Shreedhar, S; Mahesh, Padukudru Anand",Advances in respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2021.0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33966261/,915
380828,Hitting rock bottom: The descent from predatory journals and conferences to the predatory PhD,2020,"This study aimed to assess the relationship between the maxillary incisors and the incisive canal (IC) using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Archived CBCTs from 120 subjects (60 males and 60 females, mean age: 34.2±13.1 years) were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. The following variables were measured: incisor/palatal plane (PP), IC/PP angles, palatal alveolar bone width (PABW) at apex, IC width, inter-root width at apex and IC level to incisor apex. The relationship between the incisors and IC with respect to sex and age was calculated using one-way analysis of variance, independent samples t-test, and regression analysis. The confidence level was set at 95%. Results showed that half of the study population exhibited IC palatal opening at the level of the maxillary incisor apices. Significant associations were observed between IC/PP and incisor/PP angles and between IC width and PABW at the apical level (p<0.05), and between age and IC width in the sagittal and axial perspectives and age and IC level relative to the incisor apices. A significant association was observed between sex and IC/PP angle, IC width in the sagittal perspective, and PABW at the apical level. The association was found between IC and maxillary incisors angulations but not between IC width and inter-root distance. Age showed varied associations while sex was significantly associated with most variables assessed.","Linjawi, A I; Marghalani, H Y A",Folia morphol. (Warszawa),,915
453432,An Integrated Analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs Microarray Profiles to Screen miRNA Signatures Involved in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,2020,"This study was designed to evaluate the cross-resistance of Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 19585 (STWT), ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhimurium (STCIP), and clinically isolated S. Typhimurium CCARM 8009 (STCLI) serially exposed to a half MIC of ceftriaxone (CEF), ciprofloxacin (CIP), polymyxin B (POL), or tetracycline (TET), followed by 1 MIC of CEF, CIP, POL, and TET. The viability changes of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to different classes of antibiotics were measured to evaluate the development of cross-resistance. The relative fitness was also estimated to evaluate the reproductive success of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI consecutively exposed to a half and 1 MIC of CEF, CIP, POL, or TET. The expression levels of efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were evaluated by using a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The MIC of CIP against STCIP was increased by 128-fold compared to STWT. STCLI was highly resistant to POL (MICâ¯=â¯8â¯µg/ml) and TET (MICâ¯=â¯256â¯µg/ml). STWT exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1] than CEF [1], CIP [1], and TET [1], STCIP exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to CEF [1] and POL [1], and STCLI exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1]. STCIP was cross-resistant to CEF [1/2]-CIP [1], CIP [1/2]-CIP [1], POL [1/2]-CIP [1], and TET [1/2]-CIP (Ochoa et al., 2020) [1]. The efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were overexpressed in STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments, which was related to the development of cross-resistance. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments are worth understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and developing effective therapeutic regimens against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Dawan, Jirapat; Ahn, Juhee",Microb Pathog,,915
