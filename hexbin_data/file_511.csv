Although some countries incorporate mandatory vaccination programs, no particularly efficient strategies for addressing vaccine avoidance have so far been identified. Within this study we investigated perceptions and reasoning of vaccine hesitant parents from Croatia where child vaccination is mandatory. The aims were to reveal different strategies by which they avoid mandatory vaccination schedules and hypothetical situations in which they would reconsider vaccinating, as well as to identify features of related decision-making. We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with vaccine hesitant parents and analyzed the data using the framework of thematic analyses. The identified themes were related to the parents’ decision-making process, reflection as well as justification of their decision, avoidance behavior of mandatory vaccination schedules and related consequences, dealing with outcomes of the decision and reconsidering vaccinating. The results support and extend previous findings regarding vaccine reasoning, linking hesitancy with the experientially intuitive thinking style and social intuitionist model of moral reasoning. The findings provide important insights into vaccination avoidance and potential for reconsideration, as well as dealing with related risks. Furthermore, we offer a general framework as well as practical guidelines that may help the development of strategies aimed at increasing vaccination rates.

METHODS: Twenty-five patients (46 eyes) with a diagnosis of DON between 2008 and 2015 were included in the study. The first group (7 patients, 16 eyes) consisted of patients with a steroid-pulse treatment only and the second group (18 patients, 30 eyes) included patients with medical and surgical decompression. RESULTS: Twenty patients were female; five patients were male. After the diagnosis of DON, all patients were treated with steroid-pulse treatment (intravenous 500 mg prednisolon twice/week for 4 weeks, 250 mg twice/week for 2 weeks) as a first-line treatment (medical decompression). In 30 eyes (18 patients) out of 46 eyes, (25 patients) an orbital decompression was needed to preserve the optic nerve function. In those therapy-resistant cases (surgical decompression group), the orbital decompression led to statistically significant improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), protan and tritan value of the color vision (p = 0.007, p < 0.0001, p = 0.019, respectively, comparison of first visit to last visit). CONCLUSION: According to our data, the mild cases of DON with better initial visual acuity (in our case series mean: 0.3 logMAR) seem to respond well to steroid treatment. However, therapy-resistant cases with an impaired initial BCVA (in our case series, mean: 0.6 logMAR) seem to need the surgery to preserve the optic nerve function. In conclusion, this retrospective study confirms the effectiveness of surgical decompression in therapy-resistant cases of DON.","Garip Kuebler, Aylin; Wiecha, Caroline; Reznicek, Lukas; Klingenstein, Annemarie; Halfter, Kathrin; Priglinger, Siegfried; Hintschich, Christoph",Eye (Lond),511,1

Findings will inform recommendations by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. METHODS: We searched five databases (to January 24, 2020), trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists for English and French literature published since 1996. Screening, study selection, and risk of bias assessments were independently undertaken by two reviewers, with consensus for final decisions. Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by another for accuracy and completeness. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. The Task Force and content experts provided input on determining thresholds for important effect sizes and on interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Of 41 included studies, 17 and 11 reported on benefits and harms of screening, respectively, and 14 reported on patient preferences. Universal screening for CT in general populations 16 to 29 years of age, using population-based or opportunistic approaches achieving low screening rates, may make little-to-no difference for a female’s risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (2 RCTs, n=141,362; 0.3 more in 1000 [7.6 fewer to 11 more]) or ectopic pregnancy (1 RCT, n=15,459; 0.20 more per 1000 [2.2 fewer to 3.9 more]). It may also not make a difference for CT transmission (3 RCTs, n=41,709; 3 fewer per 1000 [11.5 fewer to 6.9 more]). However, benefits may be achieved for reducing PID if screening rates are increased (2 trials, n=30,652; 5.7 fewer per 1000 [10.8 fewer to 1.1 more]), and for reducing CT and NG transmission when intensely screening high-prevalence female populations (2 trials, n=6127; 34.3 fewer per 1000 [4 to 58 fewer]; NNS 29 [17 to 250]). Evidence on infertility in females from CT screening and on transmission of NG in males and both sexes from screening for CT and NG is very uncertain. No evidence was found for cervicitis, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility in males from CT screening, or on any clinical outcomes from NG screening. Undergoing screening, or having a diagnosis of CT, may cause a small-to-moderate number of people to experience some degree of harm, mainly due to feelings of stigmatization and anxiety about future infertility risk. The number of individuals affected in the entire screening-eligible population is likely smaller. Screening may make little-to-no difference for general anxiety, self-esteem, or relationship break-up. Evidence on transmission from studies comparing home versus clinic screening is very uncertain. Four studies on patient preferences found that although utility values for the different consequences of CT and NG infections are probably quite similar, when considering the duration of the health state experiences, infertility and chronic pelvic pain are probably valued much more than PID, ectopic pregnancy, and cervicitis. How patients weigh the potential benefits versus harms of screening is very uncertain (1 survey, 10 qualitative studies); risks to reproductive health and transmission appear to be more important than the (often transient) psychosocial harms. DISCUSSION: Most of the evidence on screening for CT and/or NG offers low or very low certainty about the benefits and harms. Indirectness from use of comparison groups receiving some screening, incomplete outcome ascertainment, and use of outreach settings was a major contributor to uncertainty. Patient preferences indicate that the potential benefits from screening appear to outweigh the possible harms. Direct evidence about which screening strategies and intervals to use, which age to start and stop screening, and whether screening males in addition to females is necessary to prevent clinical outcomes is scarce, and further research in these areas would be informative. Apart from the evidence in this review, information on factors related to equity, acceptability, implementation, cost/resources, and feasibility will support recommendations made by the Task Force.

Closure to efficient causation, or the need for all specific catalysts used by an organism to be produced internally, implies that a true model of an organism cannot exist, though this does not exclude the possibility that some characteristics can be simulated. Such simulations indicate that there is a limit to how small a self-organizing system can be: much smaller than a bacterial cell, but around the size of a typical virus particle. All current theories of life incorporate, at least implicitly, the idea of catalysis, but they largely ignore the need for metabolic regulation.","Cornish-Bowden, Athel; Cárdenas, María Luz",Theory Biosci,511,22

However, for the same P/F ratio, a patient on a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may have more severe lung injury than one on a lower PEEP. OBJECTIVES: We designed a new formula, the P/FP ratio, incorporating PEEP into the P/F ratio and multiplying with a correction factor of 10 [(PaO(2)*10)/(FiO(2)*PEEP)], to evaluate if it better predicts hospital mortality compared to the P/F ratio post-intubation and to assess the resultant changes in severity classification of ARDS. METHODS: We categorized patients from a dataset of seven ARDS network trials using the thresholds of ≤ 100 (severe), 101–200 (moderate), and 201–300 (mild) for both P/F (mmHg) and P/FP (mmHg/cmH(2)O) ratios and evaluated hospital mortality using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). RESULTS: Out of 3,442 patients, 1,057 (30.7%) died. The AUC for mortality was higher for the P/FP ratio than the P/F ratio for PEEP levels > 5 cmH(2)O: 0.710 (95% CI 0.691–0.730) versus 0.659 (95% CI 0.637–0.681), P < 0.001. Improved AUC was seen with increasing PEEP levels; for PEEP ≥ 18 cmH(2)O: 0.963 (95% CI 0.947–0.978) versus 0.828 (95% CI 0.765–0.891), P < 0.001. When the P/FP ratio was used instead of the P/F ratio, 12.5% and 15% of patients with moderate and mild ARDS, respectively, were moved to more severe categories, while 13.9% and 33.6% of patients with severe and moderate ARDS, respectively, were moved to milder categories. The median PEEP and FiO(2) were 14 cmH(2)O and 0.70 for patients reclassified to severe ARDS, and 5 cmH(2)O and 0.40 for patients reclassified to mild ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The multifactorial P/FP ratio has a greater predictive validity for hospital mortality in ARDS than the P/F ratio. Changes in severity classification with the P/FP ratio reflect both true illness severity and the applied PEEP strategy. Trial registration: ClinialTrials.gov–NCT03946150.

Several arrhythmogenic autoantibodies have been identified, cross-reacting with different types of surface proteins critically involved in the cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, primarily ion channels (autoimmune cardiac channelopathies). Specifically, some of these autoantibodies can prolong the action potential duration leading to acquired long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition known to increase the risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). The most investigated form of autoimmune LQTS is associated with the presence of circulating anti-Ro/SSA-antibodies, frequently found in patients with autoimmune diseases (AD), but also in a significant proportion of apparently healthy subjects of the general population. Accumulating evidence indicates that anti-Ro/SSA-antibodies can markedly delay the ventricular repolarization via a direct inhibitory cross-reaction with the extracellular pore region of the human-ether-a-go-go-related (hERG) potassium channel, resulting in a higher propensity for anti-Ro/SSA-positive subjects to develop LQTS and ventricular arrhythmias/TdP. Recent population data demonstrate that the risk of LQTS in subjects with circulating anti-Ro/SSA antibodies is significantly increased independent of a history of overt AD, intriguingly suggesting that these autoantibodies may silently contribute to a number of cases of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest in the general population. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge in this topic providing complementary basic, clinical and population health perspectives.","Lazzerini, Pietro Enea; Laghi-Pasini, Franco; Boutjdir, Mohamed; Capecchi, Pier Leopoldo",Front Med (Lausanne),511,1

One hundred and fifty-five adults (BMI: Kg/m(2) = 43.8 [6.8]) attending a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for weight loss were randomized into two conditions: ACT and CBT. Demographical, physical, and clinical data were assessed at the beginning of the program (t(0)), at discharge (t(1)), and at 6-month follow-up (t(2)). The following measures were administered: The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II) and the Clinical Outcome in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Generalized linear mixed models were performed to assess differences between groups. Moderation effects for gender and Eating Disorders (ED) have been considered. From baseline to discharge, no significant differences between interventions were found, with the only exception of an improvement in the CORE-OM total score and in the CORE-OM subjective wellbeing subscale for those in the CBT condition. From discharge to follow-up, ACT group participants showed significant results in terms of weight loss maintenance, CORE-OM total score, and CORE-OM and AAQ-II wellbeing, symptoms, and psychological problems subscales. Gender moderated the effects of time and intervention on the CORE-OM subscale reporting the risk for self-harm or harm of others. The presence of an eating disorder moderated the effect of time and intervention on the CORE-OM total score, on the CORE-OM symptoms and psychological problems subscales, and on the AAQ-II. Patients who received the ACT intervention were more likely to achieve a ≥5% weight loss from baseline to follow-up and to maintain the weight loss after discharge. The ACT intervention was thus effective in maintaining weight loss over time.","Cattivelli, Roberto; Guerrini Usubini, Anna; Manzoni, Gian Mauro; Vailati Riboni, Francesco; Pietrabissa, Giada; Musetti, Alessandro; Franceschini, Christian; Varallo, Giorgia; Spatola, Chiara A.

The extended maintenance of the laboratory mouse over a number of generations under controlled and increasingly sophisticated laboratory animal housing conditions with veterinary oversight and effective infection control measures has markedly reduced the likelihood that zoonotic agents would be encountered in a modem animal care and use environment. Wild caught mice that are maintained in naturalistic housing environments in the laboratory, laboratory mice that have contact with wild or feral mice, and mice kept as pets in the home environment are examples of animal management conditions that would be conducive to the expression and transmission of zoonotic diseases and other mouse-associated hazards. In addition to the zoonoses, mice are capable of inflicting bites on inadequately trained personnel and are a rich source of allergens for a substantial number of persons predisposed to develop mouse-associated allergic sensitivities.

Given the role of the EU in wine supply, the aim of this paper is to present the design, the rationale and the potential effect of the proposed reform with specific reference to wine sector. To better understand the forthcoming process, it is firstly presented how CAP and its wine policy evolved in terms of objectives and tools over time. The EU wine policy is a paradigmatic example of a combination between the horizontal measures, valid for all agricultural sectors, and vertical measures, peculiarly encompassing the whole wine supply chain. The reform proposal confirms, with some interesting modifications, the set of tools already operating in the sector; however, it calls for a planning of the implementation of the available tools for all products in a unitary frame represented by a national CAP Strategic Plan, applying a lean administrative procedure. In the hypothesis that the COVID-19 outbreak will not cause a radical change in the global agri-food system, the proposed planning process should stimulate shared strategies. These are intended to effectively coordinate, according to the principle of complementarity, the implementation of available policy tools, in order to obtain a better use of resources and a more balanced achievement of all policy objectives.","Pomarici, Eugenio; Sardone, Roberta",Agric Econ,511,24

In this paper, I explore how data journey in case reports, with particular focus on the earliest stages of the process, namely from creation and publication of case reports to the initial re-uses of them and data within them. I investigate key themes relating to case reporting and re-use, including factors which seem to smooth the path along which the data captured by a case report journey via broader citation patterns and detailed qualitative analysis of highly re-used case reports. This analysis reveals some of the key factors associated with the case reports whose data have greater amounts of journeying including publication in a general medical journal; that the data have broader implications and evidential value for topical or even urgent issues for instance in public health; and use in the case report of multiple research methods or concepts from diverse subfields.

They infer global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the transition relation of a system, while employing SMT-based procedures, such as interpolation, to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for better generalization. Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms. To this end, we extend the SMT-IC3 paradigm with three novel rules, designed to mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality. We instantiate these rules for the theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic and implement them on top of Spacer solver in Z3.

METHODS: We present a case series of patients from February and March 2020 who were admitted to our trauma center at Rajaee Hospital Trauma Center, in Shiraz, Iran and had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or chest CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 and were admitted to the specific ICU for COVID-19. RESULTS: Eight COVID-19 patients (6 male) with mean age of 40 (SD = 16.3) years old, were presented. All patients were cases of trauma injuries, with multiple injuries including chest trauma and lung contusion, admitted to our trauma center for management of their injuries, but they were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well. Two of them had coinfection of influenza type-B and SARS-CoV-2. All patients were treated for COVID-19 and three of them died; the rest were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: Since PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is not always sensitive enough to confirm the cause of pneumonia, chest CT manifestations can be helpful, though, they are not always differentiable from lung contusion. Therefore, both the CT scan and the clinical and paraclinical presentation and course of improvement can be beneficial in diagnosing COVID-19 in the trauma setting.","Sabetian, Golnar; Feiz, Farnia; Shakibafard, Alireza; Fard, Hossein Abdolrahimzadeh; Sefidbakht, Sepideh; Jafari, Seyed Hamed; Abbasi, HamidReza; Zare, Masoomeh; Roudgari, Amir; Zand, Farid; Masjedi, Mansoor; Paydar, Shahram",Trauma,511,12

Eine rasante Entwicklung hat in den letzten Jahren auch die Stammzelltransplantation genommen, sodass diese heute bei zahlreichen systemischen malignen und nichtmalignen Erkrankungen als kurative Therapieoption eingesetzt werden kann. Heute überleben etwa 80% der krebskranken Kinder und Jugendlichen, und die meisten von ihnen führen ein weitgehend normales Leben von guter Qualität. Galten noch um 1960 viele der soliden Tumoren lediglich durch radikale chirurgische Maßnahmen als behandelbar, hat sich das Bild heute gänzlich gewandelt. Nach dem Vorbild der Leukämien wurden von der Gesellschaft für pädiatrische Onkologie (GPO; heute Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie, GPOH) kooperative Arzneimittelstudien und Register organisiert, die mittlerweile alle wichtigen soliden Tumoren erfassen und den Stellenwert von Chemotherapie, Strahlentherapie und Chirurgie systematisch erforscht und definiert haben. Zum einen ist es gelungen, aus unheilbaren Erkrankungen heilbare zu machen, zum anderen, Nebenwirkungen und Folgen der Therapien zu reduzieren. Hirntumoren im Kindesalter weisen in Bezug auf ihr histologisches Spektrum und ihre Häufigkeit, aber auch aufgrund ihrer teils günstigeren Prognose erhebliche Unterschiede im Vergleich zu denen Erwachsener auf. Die Lebensqualität, die intellektuelle Leistungsfähigkeit und das psychosoziale Verhalten von Kindern mit Hirntumoren werden häufig durch Folgen der Tumorerkrankung, aber auch durch die Therapie beeinträchtigt. Ziel der Therapie ist neben der Heilung des Kindes auch eine weit möglichst normale Entwicklung. Eltern tumorkranker Kinder fällt es oft schwer, ihre Handicaps zu akzeptieren und damit umzugehen. Nur durch eine optimale Erkennung von Defiziten und deren Rehabilitation kann es gelingen, dass überlebende Kinder trotz ihrer Defizite einen Platz in der Mitte unserer Gesellschaft finden.","Henze, G.; Klingebiel, T.; Rutkowski, S.; Schlegel, P.-G.",P&#x000e4;diatrie,511,24

Theoretical, empirical and testimonial evidence was consulted to support the model, and 15 frameworks disseminated in the last 20 years were synthesized. The article shows the diversity of perspectives and the complexity involved in establishing the dimensions to be considered in a proposal that is useful to apply to human resources for health policies. The proposed model includes four categories of components: factors of the external context, organizational factors, employment and work conditions, and individual factors. The boundaries between the components -as well as the weight and influence of each one- vary according to the interrelationship among them and the interaction with the environment, and thus its interpretation must be adapted to the context in which it is intended to be applied. Based on this conceptual model, the design and evaluation of interventions aimed at increasing the availability of health personnel -particularly at the primary care level in rural and remote areas of the Region of the Americas- should emerge from an interaction between health and employment policies, and the realities and expectations of workers and the communities.","Antonietti, Laura; Ortiz, Zulma; Esandi, María Eugenia; Duré, Isabel; Cho, Malhi",Rev Panam Salud Publica,511,5

However, studies on the association between the dose of human milk and BPD in China are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent effects of human milk on BPD and other neonatal morbidities in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of preterm infants was conducted on preterm infants of gestational age ≤ 34 weeks and birth weight < 1500 g admitted to the multicenter clinical research database for breastfeeding quality improvement in Jiangsu province. The multivariate analysis was performed to compare the effect outcomes of daily graded doses [1–24 mL/(kg · day), 25–49 mL/(kg · day), and ≥ 50 mL/(kg · day) of body weight] of human milk on neonatal outcomes throughout the first 4 weeks of life versus a reference group receiving no human milk. The models were adjusted for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Of 964 included infants, 279 (28.9%) received exclusive preterm formula, 128 (13.3%) received 1–24 ml/(kg · day), 139 (14.4%) received 25–49 ml/(kg · day), and 418 (43.4%) received ≥50 ml/(kg · day) human milk for the first 4 weeks of life. Compared with infants receiving exclusive formula, those receiving the highest volume of human milk daily [≥50 mL/(kg · day)] had lower incidences of BPD [27.5% in ≥50 mL/(kg · day) vs 40.1% in 0 mL/(kg · day) human milk, P = 0.001)], moderate and severe BPD [8.9% in ≥50 mL/(kg · day) vs 16.1% in 0 mL/(kg · day), P = 0.004], necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC; 3.8% in ≥50 mL/(kg · day) vs 10.8% in 0 mL/(kg · day), P = 0.001], late-onset sepsis [LOS; 9.3% in ≥50 mL/(kg · day) vs 19.7% in 0 mL/(kg · day), P <0.01], and extrauterine growth retardation [EUGR; 38.5% in ≥50 mL/(kg · day) vs 57.6% in 0 mL/(kg · day), P <0.01)]. The logistic regression indicated that those receiving ≥50 ml/kg · day human milk had lower odds of BPD [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.453; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.309, 0.666], moderate and severe BPD (AOR 0.430; 95% CI: 0.249, 0.742), NEC (AOR 0.314; 95% CI: 0.162, 0. 607), LOS (AOR 0.420; 95% CI: 0.263, 0.673), and EUGR (AOR 0.685; 95% CI: 0.479, 0.979). CONCLUSIONS: A daily threshold amount of ≥50 ml/(kg · day) human milk in the first 4 weeks of life was associated with lower incidence of BPD as well as NEC, LOS, and EUGR in VLBW infants.

In response, a growing number of higher educational institutions is introducing competency-based education. This is particularly true for health science programs, which have a tradition of applying a case-based or problem-based learning approach. The effort to merge a problem- or case-based online learning approach with competency-based education offers various opportunities, while facing numerous challenges. To support these efforts, this paper aims at identifying suitable practices, as well as challenges for online course design and online learning activities for higher education health science programs, when integrating competency-based education with an online problem-based and/or case-based learning approach.

Social prescribing models focus on enhancing individual wellbeing, guided by the policy of universal personalised care. However, they largely neglect the capacity of communities to meet individual need, particularly in the wake of a decade of austerity. We propose a model of community enhanced social prescribing (CESP) which has the potential to improve both individual and community wellbeing. CESP combines two evidence-informed models – Connected Communities and Connecting People – to address both community capacity and individual need. CESP requires a literacy of community which recognises the importance of communities to individuals and the importance of engaging with, and investing in, communities. When fully implemented the theory of change for CESP is hypothesised to improve both individual and community wellbeing.","Morris, David; Thomas, Paul; Ridley, Julie; Webber, Martin",Int,511,16

Clinical RSV isolates can be divided into several known genotypes. RSV genotype BA, characterised by a 60-nucleotide duplication in the G glycoprotein gene, emerged in 1999 and quickly disseminated globally replacing other RSV group B genotypes. Continual molecular epidemiology is critical to understand the evolutionary processes maintaining the success of the BA viruses. We analysed 735 G gene sequences from samples collected from paediatric patients in Kilifi, Kenya, between 2003 and 2017. The virus population comprised of several genetically distinct variants (n = 56) co-circulating within and between epidemics. In addition, there was consistent seasonal fluctuations in relative genetic diversity. Amino acid changes increasingly accumulated over the surveillance period including two residues (N178S and Q180R) that mapped to monoclonal antibody 2D10 epitopes, as well as addition of putative N-glycosylation sequons. Further, switching and toggling of amino acids within and between epidemics was observed. On a global phylogeny, the BA viruses from different countries form geographically isolated clusters suggesting substantial localized variants. This study offers insights into longitudinal population dynamics of a globally endemic RSV genotype within a discrete location.","Kamau, Everlyn; Otieno, James R.; Lewa, Clement S.; Mwema, Anthony; Murunga, Nickson; Nokes, D.

To this end, we identified aspects of online learning that students experienced beneficial/impeding (study 1) and analyzed their relation to the positive/negative experience of students and their goal orientation (study 2). In study 1 (n = 75), we asked students for aspects of online learning that they experienced as beneficially/impeding for their perceived learning gain (open data & materials: https://osf.io/7knhj/). The study was pre-registered before data collection (https://osf.io/438p6/). We identified 39 aspects by means of qualitative content analysis.

Combination therapy demonstrated a promising strategy to target hard-to-treat cancers and sensitize cancer cells to conventional anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin. This study aimed to establish molecular profiling and therapeutic efficacy assessment of chloroquine and/or tioconazole (TIC) combination with doxorubicin (DOX) as anew combination model in MCF-7 breast cancer. The drugs are tested against apoptotic/autophagic pathways and related redox status. Molecular docking revealed that chloroquine (CQ) and TIC could be potential PI3K and ATG4B pathway inhibitors. Combination therapy significantly inhibited cancer cell viability, PI3K/AkT/mTOR pathway, and tumor-supporting autophagic flux, however, induced apoptotic pathways and altered nuclear genotoxic feature. Our data revealed that the combination cocktail therapy markedly inhibited tumor proliferation marker (KI-67) and cell growth, along with the accumulation of autophagosomes and elevation of LC3-II and p62 levels indicated autophagic flux blockage and increased apoptosis. Additionally, CQ and/or TIC combination therapy with DOX exerts its activity on the redox balance of cancer cells mediated ROS-dependent apoptosis induction achieved by GPX3 suppression. Besides, Autophagy inhibition causes moderately upregulation in ATGs 5,7 redundant proteins strengthened combinations induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with Beclin-1 upregulation leading to cytodestructive autophagy with overcome drug resistance effectively in curing cancer. Notably, the tumor growth inhibition and various antioxidant effects were observed in vivo. These results suggest CQ and/or TIC combination with DOX could act as effective cocktail therapy targeting autophagy and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and hence, sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment and combat its toxicity.","El-Gowily, Afnan H.; Loutfy, Samah A.; Ali, Ehab M.

Our aim was to expeditiously remove rivaroxaban preoperatively. After 8 h of hemoadsorption, the rivaroxaban blood plasma concentration (RBPC) did not decrease below 42.1 μg/l. Intraoperatively, hemoadsorption was repeated during extracorporeal circulation. Sixteen hours after surgery and a total of 13 h of hemoadsorption, the RBPC was 40.1 μg/l. Thereafter, the RBPC spontaneously decreased to 24.7 μg/l within 14 h. In our patient, hemoadsorption may have enhanced rivaroxaban removal at higher RBPC (cutoff value 40–50 μg/l). At lower RBPC, the removal of rivaroxaban may depend solely on the natural drug elimination process. The evolution of the RBPC under hemoadsorption in vivo warrants a thorough investigation.

This paper applies the interval evidential reasoning approach and the interval-valued hesitant fuzzy TODIM (IVHF-TODIM) method to tackle the dynamic emergency decision-making problem. We introduce a function to obtain the gain and loss degrees through the geometric area method. The gain and loss matrices of the interval belief degrees are found probabilistically. A new approach to obtaining the dominance degree matrix is proposed. From the IVHF-TODIM method, the overall dominance degree is established to provide the ranking of the decision alternatives. A recent case of selecting an emergency decision alternative for a large bushfire is used to validate the proposed method, followed by a comparative analysis.","Ding, Quanyu; Goh, Mark; Wang, Ying-Ming",Soft comput,511,21

This paper mainly studies the mechanism of dopaminergic neurotransmission in different doses of morphine addiction and stress-induced depression. In the experiment, 40 male SD rats were selected. The experiment established a rat model of chronic stress depression. The rats used in this model are all raised in a single cage, and there will be various stimuli every day for 21 days, but high-intensity continuous stimuli must be avoided, and the same stimuli will not appear continuously. The experiment established a depression animal model through chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), combined with the conditioned position preference (CPP) model of morphine addiction to detect the establishment of CPP in such animals, so as to explore certain stress stimuli or depression, the influence on morphine addiction, and the relationship between them. The second or third branches of pyramidal neurons were selected to analyze the PL and CA3 regions. When analyzing the density of dendrites, each animal selected at least 8 dendrites in order to count the number of dendrites and selected a length of 20 μm on each branch to record the number of dendrites. All measured values are expressed as average ± standard deviation and analyzed by SPSS17.0 statistical software, and Levene test is used in the scattered consistency test. The average NIV of PEN before injection was 11.92 ± 2.90 Hz, and the average latency was 0.16 ± 0.03 s. The results indicate that CUMS may reduce the conditioned learning and memory ability by damaging the learning loop, rather than affecting the reward loop to weaken the establishment of morphine-dependent CPP.","Ji, Qing; Li, Xin",J Healthc Eng,511,27

METHOD: A total of 362 consecutive VMC patients in Fujian Medical University Affiliated First Quanzhou Hospital between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2019, were included. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was used to detect the risk factors that most consistently and correctly predicted early death in VMC. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility. RESULT: 9 factors were screened by LASSO regression analysis for predicting the early death of VMC. Combined with the actual clinical situation, the heart failure (HF) (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: 2.76–5.95), electrocardiogram (ECG) (OR: 6.11, 95% CI: 1.05–8.66), pneumonia (OR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.43–9.85), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (OR: 4.66, 95% CI: 3.07–24.06), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 0.19–9.39) were finally used to construct the nomogram. The nomogram's C-index was 0.908 in the training cohort and 0.924 in the validation cohort. And the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the nomogram was 0.91 in the training cohort and 0.924 in the validating cohort.

In the general population, COVID-19 has most notably affected those who are female, in younger age groups, black Asian and ethnic minority groups (BAME). A significant proportion of rheumatology patients are ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’, classed as high-risk of COVID under current national guidance. While it is recognised that extra precautionary measures in this group, such as stringent social distancing (shielding), adversely impacts these patients mental health, other risk factors, for patients with rheumatic disease whose health related quality of life (HRQoL) scores are most impacted, have not being explored. In our large cohort of rheumatology patients under secondary care follow up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust we assessed HRQoL scores at the 4-week point following the introduction of lockdown measures. Methods We distributed a web-based survey via a linked mobile-phone SMS message, to all rheumatology patients, with a validated mobile number, under follow-up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust. We assessed patient’s HRQoL by Short Form-12 version 2 (SF12); data were analysed using SPSS version 26. Results There were 7,911 active follow up patients with linked mobile numbers. Survey responses were received from 1,828/7,911 (23%) and of these 1,727 completed all aspects of the SF12. Responders were mostly white British 1,711/1828 (94%) and female 1,276 (70%); inflammatory arthritis was the predominant diagnosis (1,275, 70%). 858 (47%) were at high-risk of COVID (advised to follow shielding guidance) and 72 (4%) reported having suffered COVID-19 infection. Mental SF-12 (MCS) component scores were significantly lower in: COVID vs non-COVID patients (mean differences: -3.8, P < 0.001); BAME vs Caucasian patients (-1.5, P = 0.04); Females vs Males (-1.3, P = 0.001). Importantly, there were no differences in physical component scores (PCS) in these groups. Patients considered at high risk of COVID had lower MCS (-2.1) and PCS (-3.1) (both P < 0.001). Older patients had lower PCS (-2.7, P < 0.001) but not MCS. Conclusion We found significantly worse mental health scores in female patients, BAME patients and those patients that had suffered the COVID infection. Clinically extremely vulnerable patients had worse mental and physical health scores. There was no significant difference in mental health scores between patients in different ages groups, while, as might be expected, physical health scores were significantly worse in the older age groups. These data indicate a focus on adverse psychological consequences in specific patient groups may be required for future increases in COVID infection rates.

Methods Eighty-two patients referred to the Complex Musculoskeletal Clinic in the Rheumatology Department with a resulting diagnosis of fibromyalgia were included in the audit. Data was collected retrospectively via Electronic Patient Records over the study period of December 2017 to March 2020. Variables assessed included patient demographics, clinical presentation at assessment and management. Statistical analyses were conducted using Excel 2019 and the Excel Analysis ToolPak. Results The majority of the patients were female 77/82(94%), and the mean age was 43.2yrs (SD = 12.6). Co-morbidities were common: 31/82 (38%) had a further painful musculoskeletal condition, 40/82 (49%) were obese and 46/82 (56%) had an active mental health problem. Alongside chronic widespread pain, patients reported fatigue 64/82 (78%), waking unrefreshed 69/82 (84%), and cognitive disturbance 31/82 (38%). Compared to a 2014 audit conducted in the same population and department, more patients had received pharmacological treatment (71/82 [87%] vs 34/50 [68%]; z = 2.64, p = 0.008), had received physiotherapy (28/82 [34%] vs 5/50 [10%]; z = 3.0, p = 0.002) and psychological input (16/82 [20%] vs 3/50 [6%]; z = 2.20, p = 0.03) prior to referral to secondary care. At secondary care consultation, all patients received an assessment of their pain and function, and 64/82 (78%) were assessed for psychosocial context. Fifty-three (65%) patients received information in the form of a website recommendation, leaflet or verbal education. After clinician assessment, the majority were referred to a multidisciplinary pain management programme, in a significant increase from 2014 (64/82 [78%] vs 4/50 [8%]; z = 8.04, p < 0.0001). All medication recommendations were made according to 2017 EULAR guidelines. Alongside multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation, patients were referred to physiotherapy 21/82 (26%), physical activity 26/82 (26%), sleep hygiene 9/82 (11%) and psychological 7/82 (9%) treatment options. Conclusion Multidisciplinary treatment and first-line, non-pharmacological approaches have become the standard management approach in secondary care, alongside EULAR compliant pharmacological recommendations. EULAR’s non-pharmacological recommendations of assessing not only pain, but function and psychosocial context occurs for the majority of patients. The limitation of consultation duration likely plays a role in whether psychosocial context is adequately assessed. Providing patients with information about their condition, though occurring for approximately 2/3 of patients, was recognized as an area for improvement. The high rate of co-morbidities combined with the demographics of Fibromyalgia patients emphasizes the importance of early, multimodal management. Follow-up audits are warranted to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of the upcoming 2021 NICE guidance for chronic pain. Disclosure Y. Kang: None. R. Smith: None. A.

BACKGROUND: Reports from countries affected by the COVID 19 pandemic demonstrate a reduction in ACS hospitalizations and invasive procedures. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on ACS patient hospitalizations and related invasive procedures in a country with low COVID 19 incidence and without changes in Cardiology hospital services. METHODS: We conducted a retrograde study collecting data for ACS hospitalizations including ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non- ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA) and related invasive and revascularization procedures from March 9th 2020 (first COVID 19 case in our country) to April 30th (period of total lockdown) compared with the same period of 2019 in our center. RESULTS: Hospital admissions for ACS declined during 2020 (COVID 19 period) from a total of 550 patients in 2019 to 321 patients hospitalization in 2020 representing a 41.6% reduction (p < 0.001). The reduction was observed for all types of ACS, the greatest reduction was for UA 58% (p < 0.001) followed by NSTEMI 32% (p < 0.001) and for STEMI 28% reduction (p < 0.009). Compared to 2019 the proportion of patients presented with STEMI was higher in 2020 (48.6% vs 39.5% p = 0.01) and lower with UA (43.3% vs 31.5% p = 0.0002) Reduction was observed also in coronary angiography by 43% (p < 0.001) and in percutaneous coronary interventions with 42% (p < 0.001). Compared to 2019 the proportion of patients with 3 vessels coronary disease(CAD)and left main (LM) was higher during COVID 19 pandemic, respectively 33% vs 40% p = 0.032 and 8% vs 13% p = 0.046 CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations and related invasive procedures for ACS significantly dropped during COVID 19 pandemic. Patients admitted to hospital during pandemic presented more with STEMI and had more 3 vessels CAD and LM. Measures should be taken to ensure patients for the safety of health services and encouraged not to neglect cardiac consultations and treatments.","Simoni, L; Alimehmeti, I; Ceka, A; Tafaj, E; Gina, M; Dibra, A; Goda, A",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,511,22

Its discovery more than a century ago resulted from the identification of rickets as due to deficient sunshine in latitudes far from the equator, exacerbated by the air pollution, factory work and indoor living. Rickets resulted from defective endocrine control of blood calcium, and was accompanied by epidemic tuberculosis from failure of the D3-dependent first-line immune system. The influenza pandemic of 2018 revealed the need for D3 to fight viruses. Half a century later the systemic hormone role of 1,25(OH)D3 of renal origin, under control of PTH, was a major stimulus to understanding the mechanism of action via the VDR-RXR heterodimer. It was soon realised that 1,25(OH)D3 is also produced and acts locally in many organs and tissues provided that there are adequate reserves of the (protein-bound) blood storage form, 25(OH)D. This is the common pool for 1-hydroxylation by any cells that need local activation of VDR for induction of specific genes. In the case of the immune system, the trigger is foreign proteins recognised as ‘non-self’. Local production and action of 1,25(OH)D, and then its local destruction by 24-hydroxylation must all occur below the ‘endocrine radar’, so as not to interfere with systemic calcium control. Coronaviruses through their ‘spike’ protein are internalised by interacting with the ACE-2 receptor, which in turn is down-regulated by Vitamin D. In the process, 25(OH)D is hydroxylated to the active 1,25(OH)D, which must later be degraded to 1,24,25(OH)D. So it is to be expected that when 25(OH)D reserves are low at the onset of infection, they will fall further, allowing virus to enter the cells and trigger a cytokine storm and other damage. Blood PTH will rise to claim any residual 25(OH)D for the dominating systemic role in calcium homeostasis. It follows that intake of vitamin D3 should always be much more than the minimum claimed by the globally-active endocrine system. Unfortunately, the UK’s Specialised Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), does not recognise this. It is dominated by nutritionists, even though food sources of D3 are for most non-existent, and of D2, the vegetable substitute, highly variable. The 400IU of D3 reluctantly recommended for those ‘at risk’, based on endocrinology alone, is grossly inadequate; 4,000IU daily is needed to maintain a blood 25(OH)D at more than 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l), and provide sufficient reserve for its many autocrine and paracrine functions. The dangers of letting the dominant endocrine function of 1,25(OH)D in ionic calcium control dictate the level of D3 supplements, have once again been underlined by the Covid-19 disaster.","Anderson, David Coussmaker; Grimes, David S",J Endocr Soc,511,1

Set aside from social distancing and self-isolating, the British Society for Rheumatology proposed pragmatic guidance for different groups of patients for shielding. Clinical presentation, epidemiology, and potential treatment opinions of the management of COVID-19 patients with rheumatic disease had been reported, but a few reports which show a comparison between survivors and non-survivors in relation to their co-morbidities. Methods We collected data from a search identifying 1,200 patients testing positive for SARS-COV-2 with an identified rheumatological condition until 31st April 2020 at Imperial College NHS Trust. A positive laboratory finding is defined as one or more positive result for SARS-COV-2 PCR on nasopharyngeal swab done for inpatients. Results Among 1,200 patients, 39 patients had underlying rheumatological diseases.12 patients died, and 27 patients were discharged. 50% of the patients who died had chronic kidney disease as an existing comorbidity (OR 26, 95%CI ( 2.6-258.1), p value 0.001) compared with only 3% of patients who survived. All the patients with heart failure in this sample died in hospital (33%, OR 29, 95%CI (1.4-597.4, p value 0.006). Regarding drug therapy, 50% of patients who died were receiving more than one immunosuppressant compared with 37% of those who survived. There was a significant association linking non-survivors with a high CRP value (54% , OR 25.2, 95% CI ( 2.44-258.2), p value 0.009) compared with only 4.5% in patients who survived. 70% of patients who died had d-dimer of (>2000ng/ml) compared with 16% of those who survived (OR 11.6, 95% CI ( 1.86-73.06), p value 0.011). Creatinine level also had a significant link with non-survival. 58% patients who died had an initial creatinine (>140umol/l) compared with 18% of survivors (p value 0.0232). Additionally the patients with an elevated creatinine prior to deterioration (which is an indication of acute kidney injury) represented 32% of the total sample and of those, 66% did not survive compared with 13% who did (p value 0.007).We also reviewed the medication adjustment according to NICE guideline. In our study, it was observed that medications were properly adjusted after discussion with rheumatologist. Conclusion Patients with chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease should be strictly shielded as a same priority as patient who are taking high dose of immunosuppressive therapy. Follow-up could only be considered for remote consultation in virtual clinic apart from severity of sickness that require for hospital admission. I believe many questions remain for the rheumatology society: How will we continue better rheumatology service during and beyond the pandemic?

SARS-COV2 (COVID-19), an RNA coronavirus that started a global pandemic in December 2019 has been linked mostly to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there have been increasing reports of its effect on other organ systems. We present a case of a 32-year-old female recovering from COVID-19, only to develop silent thyroiditis afterwards. Clinical Case: A 32-year-old female with anxiety disorder but otherwise in excellent health was diagnosed with COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR after experiencing low grade fever and cough. She quarantined at home and was on her way to recovery when, a few weeks later, she began to experience increasing bouts of chest pain with no relation to activity, intermittent headaches and lower extremity edema. This prompted her to visit the emergency department. Work-up done at that time was unremarkable and her symptoms were attributed mostly to anxiety. She was advised to follow-up as an outpatient with a cardiologist. One month later, due to the persistence of her fatigue, low exercise tolerance and tremors, she decided to seek consult with a cardiologist. An electrocardiogram done during that visit showed normal sinus rhythm with poor-R wave progression and early repolarization changes. Both the echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitoring, which were subsequently done, were unremarkable. Blood work-up, however, revealed a significantly low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 0.17 mU/L, for which she was referred to an endocrinologist. A month later, she sought consult with an endocrinologist. Thyroid gland was non-tender on palpation. Repeat blood work-up showed an elevated TSH level (23.50 mU/L) with a low Free T4 (0.42 ng/dL) and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) level (900 mU/mL), indicative of subacute thyroiditis, but without associated neck pain. Thyroid sonography done showed diffusely heterogeneous thyroid lobes with no evidence of a dominant mass or nodule. A decision was made to start her on low dose levothyroxine. Two months into treatment, she underwent repeat thyroid hormone levels. Normal TSH and normal free T4 were observed. However, TPO-Ab was still elevated. It was decided to continue her therapy for one more month before gradually tapering her levothyroxine dose. She was told to follow-up in a month for further monitoring. Conclusion: Subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 infection has become a more common occurrence as more cases of COVID-19 are noted worldwide. Our patient followed the usual course of subacute thyroiditis, initially presenting with a thyrotoxicosis phase which typically lasts 4-10 weeks, then subsequently developing hypothyroidism, inadvertently needing thyroid hormone replacement. What made this case more intriguing was that she did not have severe anterior neck pain, the classic clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis. While there is a very strong association between COVID-19 and respiratory failure, there is paucity of evidence linking COVID-19 to dysfunction of other body systems. This case of thyroiditis presenting post COVID-19 illness, buttresses the versatility of COVID-19. Physicians should keep this in mind when evaluating a COVID-19 survivor who continue to present with persistent tachycardia or palpitations with or without anterior neck pain even after a month or two from infection. Routine follow-up TSH assay on COVID-19 survivors may be a valuable consideration.","Chan, Marvyn Allen G; Teweldemedhin, Bisrat T; Demigillo, Josemaria M; Demigillo, Ma Pamella G; Benjamin, Patrick; Pisano, Richard R; Jesmejian, Stephen H",J Endocr Soc,511,1

We aimed to evaluate clinical features and antibody mediated immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in subjects with autoimmune disease, compared to those without. Methods Patients who developed COVID-19 were identified through the audit department/clinician identification. In total, there were 48 subjects with autoimmune disease and confirmed COVID-19. Of these patients, 6 had sadly died. In recruited patients, clinical data regarding COVID-19 symptoms, treatment and outcomes were collected. Blood was taken for quantitative serology testing against SARS-CoV-2 using the Mologic test kit. A binary logistic regression was used to compare serology results in subjects with and without autoimmune diagnoses. Results Our sample included 103 participants. 26 subjects with autoimmune disease and confirmed COVID-19 were recruited, the most common diagnoses being rheumatoid arthritis (27%), psoriatic arthritis (19%) and inflammatory bowel disease (15%). 21 of 28 participants were on immunomodulatory medications including 16 on conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), four on biologic DMARDs and one on tacrolimus. We age- and gender-matched these subjects to 26 without autoimmune disease with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 17 further subjects reported viral-symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic but had negative serology. 30 subjects had rheumatic conditions but denied symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. 4 of the asymptomatic patients tested positive for COVID-19 on serology. 23 stored serum samples, obtained before 2019, were all negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, clinical features and serology were compared in those with and without autoimmune disease. Logistic regression showed a significant impact of COVID-19 severity on antibody titres in people with and without autoimmune disease (p = 0.003 and <0.001 respectively). In both mild and severe disease, autoimmunity had no effect on antibody titres (p = 0.253 and 0.119 respectively). Conclusion People with and without autoimmune disease presented with similar symptoms of COVID-19. In our sample, subjects with autoimmune disease were less likely to be hospitalised or require respiratory support. Serology revealed no difference in antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 in participants with and without autoimmune disease. Disclosure K. Biddle: None. S. Koushesh: None. D. Clark: None. S.

CARE-PWS, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, has evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of intranasal carbetocin, a selective oxytocin receptor agonist, in participants with PWS.

The primary endpoint assessed changes from baseline to week 8 in Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) or Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) scores for the carbetocin 9.6 mg arm vs placebo, and the first secondary endpoint assessed changes from baseline to week 8 in HQ-CT or CY-BOCS scores for the carbetocin 3.2 mg arm vs placebo. Additional secondary endpoints included changes from baseline to week 8 in PWS Anxiety and Distress Questionnaire (PADQ) scores, and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scores evaluating the overall change in severity of PWS symptoms at week 8. Due to COVID-19, enrollment was closed early with 119 evaluable participants for the primary analysis. In the carbetocin 9.6 mg arm, trends toward numerically greater improvements in HQ-CT and CGI-C scores relative to placebo were observed but did not reach statistical significance; however, the carbetocin 3.2 mg arm demonstrated a significant improvement in HQ-CT scores (LS mean improvement vs placebo -3.14 points, p=0.016). In the 3.2 mg arm, additional consistent evidence of improvements versus placebo was seen in multiple secondary endpoints, including CGI-C (p=0.027) and PADQ (p=0.027). Numeric trends toward improvement in CY-BOCS scores were observed in each dose arm, but did not reach statistical significance versus placebo. During the subsequent long-term follow-up period of the study, both carbetocin arms have experienced continued numeric improvements from baseline across multiple endpoints. Intranasal carbetocin was generally well-tolerated; the most frequently reported adverse event was flushing, which was generally mild and transient. In conclusion, results of the CARE-PWS study support that intranasal carbetocin appears to be safe and well tolerated, and reduces hyperphagia and anxiety and distress behaviors in PWS.","Ryman, Davis; Deal, Cheri L",J Endocr Soc,511,24

Myalgia is a widely publicised feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, more severe muscle injury can occur. There are several case reports of rhabdomyolysis with marked elevation in creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobinuria, leading to acute renal failure, but also reports of myositis characterised by weakness, mildly raised CK and muscle oedema on MRI. We present a systematic literature search to evaluate the clinical characteristics of skeletal muscle involvement. Methods A systematic search for terms related to ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""myalgia"", ""myositis"", ""rhabdomyolysis"" or ""muscle"" was performed across four search engines (Web of Science, Pubmed, Mednar and Medrxiv) on 10/09/2020. Only original research published or translated in English was included. Information relating to skeletal muscle injury in confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was summarised. Results The search protocol identified 980 articles of which 200 were appropriate for abstract review. 21 case reports covering 22 patients with rhabdomyolysis were found. Other muscular pathology not defined as rhabdomyolysis by authors, included 1 case of acute myositis leading to compartment syndrome, 2 cases of myositis with classical proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase and proximal muscle oedema on imaging, and one series of 7 patients with paraspinal myositis on MRI imaging. A histopathological study found evidence of incidental myositis in 2 cases. Critical care myopathy and polyneuropathy are described, along with many other neurological manifestations. While 91 cohort studies were identified, none looked in detail at skeletal muscle involvement. There are 8 meta-analyses which find the prevalence of myalgia between 19-33%. The age of rhabdomyolysis patients appears lower than expected for covid-19 admissions at 46.7 years, but ranged from 16 to 88. Baseline characteristics mirror those at higher risk of severe covid-19: half had either hypertension, type 2 diabetes or obesity and 86.4% were male. Common accompanying symptoms were myalgia (81.8%), fever (68.2%), cough (59.1%), dyspnoea (40.9%). Median peak CK was 22,511IU/L. 68.2% had changes consistent with covid-19 on chest imaging. Intravenous haemofiltration or mechanical ventilation were each required by 4 patients. Short term prognosis showed 18 (81.8%) being discharged, 2 deaths (9.1%) and 2 unknown outcomes. Conclusion Severe skeletal manifestations such rhabdomyolysis occur in covid-19. More research is needed to discover if this is through direct viral invasion of the tissues, or indirectly via systemic cytokine release, hyperlactataemia and hypo-oxygenation. CK should be routinely checked in those critically unwell or with severe myalgia or weakness to identify treatable rhabdomyolysis early. Chronic autoimmune conditions such as the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies may have viral environmental triggers, and one case tested positive for a myositis specific antibody. Whether patients with acute covid-19 related myositis experience ongoing long-term muscle inflammation has not yet been reported. Disclosure J.R. Hannah: None. S. Ali: None. J. Galloway: None. P.

We previously reported on a 52-week, phase 3, pivotal study that demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in annualized growth velocity (AGV) when vosoritide was compared to placebo in children with achondroplasia aged 5-18 years (Savarirayan et al, Lancet, 2020). This is an analysis of data after an additional 52 weeks of treatment in the ongoing phase 3 extension study. Methods: After completion of the phase 3 placebo-controlled study, 119 children were enrolled into the extension study, where they all receive open label 15 μg/kg/day vosoritide. AGV, height Z-score and body proportion ratio were analyzed to assess efficacy of vosoritide in children who were treated with vosoritide for up to 2 years. Fifty-eight continued treatment with vosoritide and 61 switched from placebo to vosoritide. Two participants on continuous vosoritide treatment discontinued before the Week 52 timepoint. Four participants on continuous vosoritide treatment and 7 participants who switched from placebo to vosoritide missed the Week 52 assessment due to Covid-19. Results: In children randomized to receive daily vosoritide, baseline mean (SD) AGV was 4.26 (1.53) cm/year. After the first 52 weeks of treatment, mean (SD) AGV was 5.67 (0.98) cm/year. Mean (SD) AGV over the second year was 5.57 (1.10) cm/year. Mean (SD) change from baseline in height Z-score improved by +0.24 (0.31) at Week 52 in the pivotal study and +0.45 (0.56) at Week 52 in the extension study. Mean (SD) upper-to-lower body segment ratio improved with a change from baseline of -0.03 (0.11) at Week 52 in the pivotal study and -0.09 (0.11) at Week 52 in the extension study. In children who switched from placebo to vosoritide after 52 weeks, baseline AGV was 4.06 (1.20) cm/year and 3.94 (1.07) cm/year after 52 weeks on placebo. In the second year, after receiving 52 weeks of vosoritide, mean AGV was 5.65 (1.47) cm/year, the mean (SD) change in height Z-score was +0.24 (0.34), and the change in upper-to-lower body segment ratio was -0.03 (0.08). No new adverse events associated with vosoritide treatment were detected with up to 2 years of continuous daily, subcutaneous treatment. Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were attributed to vosoritide. The most common adverse event remains mild and transient injection site reactions. Conclusions: The effect of vosoritide administration on growth as measured through AGV and height Z-score was maintained for up to 2-years in children with achondroplasia aged 5 to 18 years, with an improvement of body proportions.","Savarirayan, Ravi; Tofts, Louise; Irving, Melita; Wilcox, William; Bacino, Carlos A; Hoover-Fong, Julie; Font, Rosendo Ullot; Harmatz, Paul; Rutsch, Frank; Bober, Michael B; Polgreen, Lynda; Ginebreda, Ignacio; Mohnike, Klaus; Charrow, Joel; Hoernschemeyer, Daniel; Ozono, Keiichi; Alanay, Yasemin; Arundel, Paul; Kagami, Shoji; Yasui, Natsuo; White, Klane; Saal, Howard; Leiva-Gea, Antonio; Luna-González, Felipe; Mochizuki, Hiroshi; Basel, Donald; Porco, Dania; Jayaram, Kala; Fisheleva, Elena; Han, Lynn; Day, Jonathan",J Endocr Soc,511,24

The diagnosis is generally reserved for a specific type of thyroiditis characterized by granulomatous inflammation and the presence of giant cells. We hereby present a case of a woman with a COVID-19 diagnosis, and a compatible biopsy result for subacute thyroiditis. On 06/03/2020, a 28 year old woman with previous history of ankylosing spondylitis managed with certolizumab pegmol, presented with fatigue, headache, odynophagia, and fever (38.1°C). 2 days later an oropharyngeal swab (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 turned out positive. On the 4th day the fever spiked to 39°C with added malaise. Acetaminophen 1 gr PO TID was prescribed. The patient denied dyspnea, and thorax CT-Scan was normal. Complete remission was achieved in 3 weeks. On 08/01/20 she returned to work after a negative swab test. On 08/04/20, she presented with fever (38.7°C), malaise, distal tremors, anorexia, tachycardia, myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue. 2 days later anterior neck pain that radiated to the jaw, and diffuse goiter was noticed. A thyroid function panel reported Total T4: 24 µg/dL (4.5-12.5), fT4 5.2 ng/dl (0.8-1.8), TSH: 0.001 mUI/L (0.37-4.7), thyroglobulin 135 ng/ml (3-42). TPO-Ab <35 IU/mL and TgAb <20 IU/mL. A neck US showed increased volume in the right lobe with multiple hypoechoic regions on both lobes, and diminished vascularization at color Doppler. I-131 scan showed no uptake. A biopsy of the right lobe reported fibrosis with inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and scarce neutrophils. Some cells with epithelioid appearance and a multinucleated giant cell were also found. Residual thyroid follicles showed colloid depletion and degenerative changes to the epithelium, which was consistent with a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Treatment was initiated with prednisone 10 mg PO QD, propranolol 20 mg PO BID for 2 weeks, and acetaminophen 1 gr PO TID PRN. Fever and pain were intermittent for 6 weeks, but the rest of the symptoms subsided within 2 weeks. On 11/15/20, the patient attended a check-up with lab results that were consistent with hypothyroidism, negative IgM, and positive IgG SARS-CoV-2. Replacement therapy with levothyroxine 88 mcg per day was initiated. This case, which confirms the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis via biopsy, among the others reported worldwide suggests that there’s an increased risk for women for subacute thyroiditis associated with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm risk factors for the development of the disease.","Maldonado, Francisco Javier López; Cota Arreola, Rene Arturo",J Endocr Soc,511,20
53322,53322,53322,374 Simulation and the Surgeon during COVID-19: The Double 2s Surgical Emergencies Course,17.997316,5.7734513,2021-05-04,"Background: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a serious inflammatory response to a prior coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), characterized by fever, inflammation, and multiorgan dysfunction. Current literature does not indicate a relationship between pediatric diabetes and risk of developing MIS-C. Here, we report a case of pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2D) with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe multi-organ dysfunction with SARS-CoV-2 serology positivity. Clinical Case: A 13-year-old African American female with obesity (Body Mass Index >99(th) %) and poorly controlled T2D (HbA1c 12.8%) presented to the emergency department for one week of sore throat, headache, and abdominal pain. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was confirmed by PCR. The next day, she was found unconscious at home. She was diagnosed with DKA and was directly admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. IV insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation were initiated and her DKA resolved over the next 72 hrs. However, she exhibited continued altered mental status with slurred speech and significant respiratory distress requiring respiratory support. Due to the severe presentation and multi-organ involvement, a multi-disciplinary care team was formed. Further workup confirmed acute respiratory distress syndrome with pneumonia; severe acute kidney injury (AKI, creatinine of 4.56 mg/dL); presumed myocarditis (ST elevation on EKG, troponin 4.47 ng/mL, BNP 129.8 pg/mL); punctuate intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the splenium of the corpus callosum; transaminitis (AST 188 u/L, ALT 100 u/L); pancreatitis (amylase 651 u/L, lipase >9500 u/L); thrombocytopenia with consumptive coagulopathy (platelet 81 X 10(3)/µL, d-dimer 5.91 mcg FEU/mL), increased inflammatory markers (ESR 53 mm/hr, ferritin 127 ng/mL), and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. A presumed diagnosis of MIS-C was made per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition and she was started on dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). While consideration was given to the possibility of acute COVID-19 infection in combination with DKA, she was not a candidate for remdesivir due to AKI. On day 12, she developed new dysarthria, dyspraxia and behavioral changes. Encephalopathy workup was negative (CSF Encephalopathy autoimmune panel negative, NMDA receptor negative) and she was restarted on dexamethasone and IVIG. She was discharged on day 28. Conclusion: There is a paucity of literature of MIS-C associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric diabetes. Our case highlights several novel aspects of MIS-C with concurrent poorly controlled diabetes and DKA, including severe central nervous system manifestations and prolonged hospitalization. Further studies are warranted to elucidate an association between pediatric diabetes and MIS-C and to develop guidelines for management of MIS-C in poorly controlled pediatric diabetes.","Dye, Alyssa M; Arnold, Sandra R; Finkel, Terri H; Kim, Ahlee",J Endocr Soc,511,22

The COVID-19 pandemic forced departments to implement changes to the delivery of outpatient services at unprecedented speed. Here we present our community-based department’s experience of offering telephone and video consultations to new patients during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods All new patients (excluding those with suspected early inflammatory arthritis or other conditions triaged as urgent) offered an appointment with a consultant or extended scope physiotherapist in the rheumatology service from 11 May 2020 were offered a choice of a telephone or video consultation. Data were collected on the choice of appointment, provisional diagnosis, final diagnosis and need for a subsequent F2F assessment. Surveys to assess patient and staff experience were distributed and analysed. Results Between 11/05/2020 and 24/07/2020, 215 virtual consultations were booked. 124 patients (57.7%) opted for a video consultation and 91 (42.3%) chose a telephone consultation. The 'Did Not Attend' rate was 5.1%. Following the initial assessment, 68% of patients were discharged, 16% were booked for a F2F appointment and 16% required further investigations prior to a management decision. The discharge rates between video (70%) and telephone (65%) consultations were similar. Patients with non-inflammatory conditions such as fibromyalgia, hypermobility and osteoarthritis were more likely to be discharged after a virtual consultation. The staff survey highlighted that most clinicians had no prior experience or training in conducting virtual consultations. However, confidence in these modalities rapidly grew, with the majority of respondents happy to deliver a varying proportion of consultations remotely post pandemic. The first 20 patient surveys returned showed that remote consultations were generally well received. 16 patients (80%) agreed or strongly agreed that the consultation met their needs and was a suitable replacement for a F2F appointment. However, only 60% stated that they would be happy to have remote appointment after the pandemic. Conclusion Telephone and video consultations for rheumatology new patients were successfully adopted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for non-inflammatory conditions. Although clinicians had limited experience and training in remote consultations prior to the crisis, most adapted rapidly and would consider continuing with them after the pandemic. The majority of patients were happy with their virtual consultation during the first wave, although were less certain of their acceptability in the future. A further analysis and patient survey is underway to ascertain any differences during the second wave. We propose a hybrid model in the post-pandemic future to offer patients a choice of F2F, telephone or video consultations. Disclosure C. Rao: None. S. Horton: None. E.

AIMS: To safely perform angioplasties in acute coronary syndromes with very low contrast volume using Cordis diagnostic catheters and thereby improve the cardiovascular and renal outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1432 patients (1857 lesions/ 2148 stents) with acute coronary syndromes, angioplasty was performed with Cordis 6F diagnostic catheters. Primary angioplasty was performed in 457 cases. In 76% of cases, iodixanol was used. All contrast injections were given by hand. A regular follow-up of the patients was performed 30 days after the procedure. All the procedures were performed through the femoral route. Tirofiban was used in 99% cases with adjusted dosages based on the creatinine values. The mean contrast volume used per patient was 28 ml (±6 ml) including the angiogram prior to the angioplasty. Ninety one patients had creatinine more than 2mg/dl before the angioplasty procedures. Left main angioplasty was performed in 37 patients using single stents. 70 patients had cardiogenic shock at presentation. 76% of the cases had diabetes. IVUS was used in only two patients. A variety of coronary stents from various companies were used. Buddy wires were used in 36 cases. Ticagrelor was used in 92 cases, and in other cases clopidogrel was used. Mild reversible nephropathy (CIN) was observed in six patients. Four patients were already on dialysis, and dialysis was continued thereafter. Switch-over of angioplasty to the radial route was performed in five cases due to associated aortic/iliac obstructive lesions. 26 deaths in total were observed in this series; 16 of these patients had cardiogenic shock (7 late presenters), and three patients expired after discharge due to possible acute stent thrombosis. Groin haematoma was seen in five cases requiring one unit of blood transfusion. Proximal mild edge dissection in the deployed stent was seen in 3 cases which were treated with stents. Wire breakages were not seen. Acute in-hospital stent thrombosis was seen in 6 cases, which were managed with balloon dilatations and stents. Covid19 was positive in 16 cases by RT PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty and stenting can be performed safely in patients with acute coronary syndromes using Cordis diagnostic catheters and a very low volume of contrast with improved clinical outcomes.","Arokiaraj, MC",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,511,16

We present an algorithm and results for safely and equitably restarting surgery at COVID-light sites. METHOD: An MDT applied the COVID-19 Algorithm for Resuming Elective Surgery (CARES) on 1169 patients awaiting elective orthopaedic surgery. It assessed safety, procedural efficacy, and biopsychosocial factors, to prioritise patients. They were assigned to five categories and underwent surgery at one of three COVID-light sites (1. access to HDU/ITU/Paediatrics/specialist equipment, 2. an NHS elective surgical unit and 3. a private elective surgical unit). RESULTS: 21 ‘Urgent’ patients received expedited care; 118 were Level 1/2; 222 were Level 3; 808 were Level 4. In 6 weeks, 355 surgeries were performed, with Urgent and Level 1/2 cases performed soonest (mean 18 days, p < 0.001). 33 high-risk/complex/paediatric patients had surgery at Site 1 and the rest at Sites 2 and 3. No patients contracted COVID-19 within 2 weeks of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We validated a widely generalisable model to facilitate resumption of elective surgery in COVID-light sites. It enabled surgery for patients in most suffering, undergoing the most efficacious procedures and/or at highest risk of deterioration, without compromising patient-safety.","Subbiah Ponniah, H; Ahmed, M; Edwards, T; Cobb, J; Dean, E; Clark, C; Logishetty, K",Br J Surg,511,1

In NHS, around 36,000 cancer operations have been estimated to be cancelled during the peak time alone. This regional study evaluated the risk of COVID-19 in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer during the peak time. METHOD: This prospective multicentre observational study conducted in four busy district hospitals included 52 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery during the COVID lockdown period (23(rd) March to 5(th) May). PCR swab testing was used to detect COVID. Data was collected from patient notes, MDT files and pathology results. RESULTS: 73% (38/52) underwent elective procedures, 90% with curative intent. Overall, mean (SD) age was 70 (12.2) years, 50% were female. 60% (32/52) had left sided cancers and a total of 48% (25/52) patients had stage 3 or above. 27% (14/52) had post-operative complications, with 4% (2/52) being Grade 3 Clavien-Dindo. Total mortality was 6% (3/52) of which 1 was elective patient. Only one patient developed COVID infection during the inpatient stay. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggests, local policies to prevent COVID spread have been effective. Local lockdown in case of second peak may be a reasonable option. Improvement in COVID testing could have major impact on outcomes.","Kumar, L; Mahfooz Buksh, M; Merali, N; Hammer, C; Nagendram, S; Kenny, R; Chakravartty, S; Madan, R",Br J Surg,511,1

Our empirical analysis uses yearly data covering the period 1970–2014 for 12 selected EMU member countries. We have found that this common component has a significant impact on public revenues in the majority of the countries. We highlight this common pattern in a dynamic factor model (DFM). Since this factor is unobservable, it is difficult to agree on what it represents. We argue that the latent factor that emerges from the two different empirical approaches used might have a composite nature, being the result of both the more general convergence of the economic cycles of the countries in the area and the increasingly better tuned tax structure. However, the original aspect of our paper is the use of a back-propagation neural networks (BPNN)-DF model to test the results of the time-series. At the level of computer programming, the results obtained represent the first empirical demonstration of the latent factor’s presence.","Magazzino, Cosimo; Mele, Marco",Ital Econ J,511,18

SvC19 disproportionately impacts the elderly, who are also at risk for micronutrient deficiency. After observing a beneficial response to micronutrient repletion (MR) in a 69 year-old male with SvC19, we hypothesized that nutritional deficiencies were linked to the pathogenesis and that correcting them could be beneficial. In this report we detail a case series of 18 older patients with SvC19 treated with MR. METHODS: All patients had SvC19 requiring mechanical ventilation, elevated levels of CRP, D-dimer and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. MR consisted of daily parenteral ascorbate, thiamine, pyridoxine and multivitamins, as well as daily ergocalciferol, zinc and carnitine via nasogastric tube. RESULTS: The average age was 63.3 years. Six patients were male, 12 female. Disease severity was comparable based on SOFA score. A partial response was observed in 10 of the 18 patients (55.5%). Six (33.3%) were able to wean off blood pressure support. Five (27.7%) had improvement in gas exchange. Four (22.2) were able to wean off ventilator support. Three patients (37.5%) showed improvement in renal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: MR shows potential promise as an adjunctive treatment for severe COVID-19, particularly in older patients or those with chronic illness in whom nutritional deficiencies are more probable.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on stress, physical distress, job burnout, work engagement, and empathy for health and social care education. METHODS: Students (N = 124) from postgraduate programs in social work, counseling, and family therapy were recruited. Sixty-four students participated in an 8-week MBSR program as an elective course. Sixty students were recruited from other elective courses in the same cohort as control group participants. All participants completed self-report assessments. RESULTS: The results suggested that MBSR was associated with significant improvements in perceived efficacy and vigor and significant reductions in physical distress, total job burnout, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization of clients compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the growing body of literature highlighting the potential use of mindfulness practice to improve students’ personal well-being and professional growth in health and social care education. Mindfulness practice should be further promoted in health and social care education and training.","Lo, Herman Hay Ming; Ngai, Sowa; Yam, Kong",Mindfulness (N Y),511,33

Filamentous acid phosphatase is a multimeric protein complex composed of many subunits assembled in a linear highly glycosylated filament, which is secreted in vast amounts into the culture supernatant via the flagellar pocket of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. This suggested that the protein could be used as a carrier for the Surface Antigen1 protein of a Toxoplasma gondii (SAG1) for easy purification to generate a protein with multiple SAG1 subunits suitable for immunisation. SAG1 has an immunodominant structure that is involved in binding to host cells. Previous studies used this surface protein for vaccination for its immunological importance for triggering a type 1 immune response in the host. This study aims to determine the production of recombinant filamentous protein carried subunits of the surface protein of Toxoplasma gondii for vaccination purposes. Leishmania codon-optimised SAG1 was cloned as a fusion construct into pLEXSY-ble2.1 plasmid and introduced into Leishmania tarentolae to generate recombinant cell lines expressing a filamentous fusion protein called SAP2SAG1. PCR confirmed the correct integration into the small ribosomal subunit RNA gene locus of Leishmania tarentolae. Immunofluorescences and Immunoblot analyses were used to detect the fusion protein in the sediment of culture supernatants of recombinant L. tarentolae promastigotes after purification by ultracentrifugation.

The influence of impregnation process of porous 2D carbon fibre substrate with resin and pyrocarbon deposited by CVD technique on mechanical properties of formed composites was studied. The results indicate that using P-CVI method large pores remain in the matrix resulting in lower mechanical strength. This fraction does not undergo any changes during thermal treatment. The flexural modulus of C/C composites depends mainly on the type of reinforcing fibres. The values of moduli measured in composites obtained by both methods do not differ significantly. Comparison of two methods of fabrication of C/C composite show that much better strengths can be achieved by forming the carbon matrix in solid state.,"Michalowski, J.; Mikociak, D.; Konsztowicz, K.

This study collated the expectations regarding pragmatic trial design of integrative medicine (IM) for diabetes and kidney diseases among patients and physicians. Dissonance between users' perspective and existing pragmatic trial design was identified. The association between risk of bias and pragmatism of study design was assessed. Method: A 10-group semi-structured focus group interview series [21 patients, 14 conventional medicine (ConM) and 15 Chinese medicine (CM) physicians] were purposively sampled from private and public clinics in Hong Kong. Perspectives were qualitatively analyzed by constant comparative method. A systematic search of four databases was performed to identify existing IM pragmatic clinical trials in diabetes or kidney disease. Primary outcomes were the pragmatism, risk of bias, and rationale of the study design. Risk of bias and pragmatism were assessed based on Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and PRECIS-2, respectively. The correlation between risk of bias and pragmatism was assessed by regression models with sensitivity analyses. Results: The subtheme on the motivation to seek IM service was analyzed, covering the perceived limitation of ConM effect, perceived benefits of IM service, and assessment of IM effectiveness. Patients expected IM service to retard disease progression, stabilize concomitant drug dosage, and reduce potential side effects associated with ConM. In the systematic review, 25 studies from six countries were included covering CM, Korean medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, and western herbal medicine. Existing study designs did not include a detailed assessment of concomitant drug change and adverse events. Majority of studies either recruited a non-representative proportion of patients as traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) diagnosis was used as inclusion criteria, or not reflecting the real-world practice of TCIM by completely dropping TCIM diagnosis in the trial design. Consultation follow-up frequency is the least pragmatic domain. Increase in pragmatism did not associate with a higher risk of bias. Conclusion: Existing IM pragmatic trial design does not match the patients' expectation in the analysis of incident concomitant drug change and adverse events. A two-layer design incorporating TCIM diagnosis as a stratification factor maximizes the generalizability of evidence and real-world translation of both ConM and TCIM.","Chan, Kam Wa; Lee, Pak Wing; Leung, Crystal Pui-sha; Law, Yee Kwan; Gao, Lucy; Chan, Gary Chi-wang; Yiu, Wai Han; Lam, Tai Pong; Tang, Sydney Chi-wai",Front Med (Lausanne),511,1

This cross-sectional study aimed to provide an understanding for the development of the functional motor areas of the upper extremity muscles by studying healthy right-handed children (6-9 years, n=10), preadolescents (10-12 years, n=13), adolescents (15-17 years, n=12), and adults (22-34 years, n=12). The optimal representation site and resting motor threshold (rMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) were assessed in both hemispheres using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Motor mapping was performed at 110% of the rMT while recording the EMG of six upper limb muscles in the hand and forearm. The association between the motor map and manual dexterity (box and block test, BBT) was examined. The mapping was well-tolerated and feasible in all but the youngest participant whose rMT exceeded the maximum stimulator output. The centers-of-gravity (CoG) for individual muscles were scattered to the greatest extent in the group of preadolescents and centered and became more focused with age. In preadolescents, the CoGs in the left hemisphere were located more laterally, and they shifted medially with age. The proportion of hand compared to arm representation increased with age (=0.001); in the right hemisphere, this was associated with greater fine motor ability. Similarly, there was less overlap between hand and forearm muscles representations in children compared to adults (p<0.001). There was a posterior-anterior shift in the APB hotspot coordinate with age, and the APB coordinate in the left hemisphere exhibited a lateral to medial shift with age from adolescence to adulthood (p=0.006). Our results contribute to the elucidation of the developmental course in the organization of the motor cortex and its associations with fine motor skills. It was shown that nTMS motor mapping in relaxed muscles is feasible in developmental studies in children older than seven years of age.","Säisänen, Laura; Könönen, Mervi; Niskanen, Eini; Lakka, Timo; Lintu, Niina; Vanninen, Ritva; Julkunen, Petro; Määttä, Sara",NeuroImage,511,11

Methods A retrospective study was conducted in Wuhan, China, between February 8, 2020, and March 9, 2020. Based on underlying diseases, patients were assigned to either the comorbidity group or the non-comorbidity group. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 were analyzed and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to evaluate the prognosis predictive value of each comorbidity. Results During the study period, 278 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, 175 (62.95%) were assigned to the comorbidity group, and 103 (37.05%) to the non-comorbidity group. Of the patients in the comorbidity group, 34.86% were classified as critical. Further, patients in the comorbidity group had lower lymphocyte cell counts, and higher concentrations of D-dimer, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and serum ferritin as well as higher critical illness severity scores than patients in the non-comorbidity group (P<0.05). Patients in the comorbidity group also had higher mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ventilation treatment rates than patients in the non-comorbidity group (P<0.05). The length of hospital stay was longer in the comorbidity group than in the non-comorbidity group (P<0.05). The most common underlying diseases included hypertension (40.65%), diabetes mellitus (20.5%), and cardiovascular disease (19.42%). Patients with comorbidities were more likely to develop cardiovascular sequelae associated with COVID-19, shock, acute kidney injury, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (30.86% vs. 12.62%, P=0.001; 18.86% vs. 8.74%, P=0.023; 24.57% vs. 11.65%, P=0.009; 33.71% vs. 14.56%, P=0.000, respectively). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, older patients (¡Ý65 years) (log-rank test: χ2=4.202, P=0.040) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (log-rank test: χ2=4.839, P=0.028) or diabetes mellitus (log-rank test: χ2=4.377, P=0.036) had shorter survival than those without comorbidities. Conclusions Patients with comorbidities were more severely affected and had a higher mortality rate.

We hypothesized that extracranial vasoconstriction explains the effect of phenylephrine on ScO2. METHODS We measured ScO2 and internal and external carotid as well as vertebral artery blood flow in 7 volunteers (25 [SD 4] years) by duplex ultrasonography during IV infusion of phenylephrine, together with middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity, forehead skin blood flow, and mean arterial blood pressure. RESULTS During phenylephrine infusion, mean arterial blood pressure increased, while ScO2 decreased by -19% ± 3% (mean ± SE; P = 0.0005). External carotid artery (-27.5% ± 3.0%) and skin blood flow (-25.4% ± 7.8%) decreased in response to phenylephrine administration, and there was a relationship between ScO2 and forehead skin blood flow (Pearson r = 0.55, P = 0.042, 95% confidence interval [CI], = 0.025-0.84; Spearman r = 0.81, P < 0.001, 95% CI, 0.49-0.94) and external carotid artery conductance (Pearson r = 0.62, P = 0.019, 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.86; Spearman r = 0.64, P = 0.012, 95% CI, 0.17-0.88).

However, there is uncertainty regarding which equation is most appropriate for this population and the impact of different creatinine assays. METHODS Measured isotopic glomerular filtration rate results from 120 oncology patients were used to evaluate and compare all four versions of the Wright equation, Cockcroft and Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration and the Janowitz and Williams formula; using eight different creatinine assays (five Jaffe, three enzymatic). RESULTS The enzymatic version of the Wright equation without creatine kinase performed better than the other versions for all eight creatinine assays. However, MDRD and Janowitz and Williams gave the best overall performance in this patient population. Performance was highly dependent on the creatinine assay used, for example, the percentage of results within 30% of the isotopic glomerular filtration rate (P30) ranged from 90.8% to 60.8% for MDRD. CONCLUSION The performance of any equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate is highly dependent on the creatinine assay used.

Enteroviral 2C is the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and possesses the RNA helicase activity that plays pivotal roles during enteroviral life cycles, which makes 2C an attractive target for developing the anti-enteroviral drugs. In this study, we designed a peptide, named 2CL, based on the structure of EV-A71 2C. This peptide effectively impaired the oligomerization of EV-A71 2C protein, and inhibited the RNA helicase activities of 2C proteins encoded by EV-A71 and CVA16, and both of which belong to EV-A, and showed potent antiviral efficacy against EV-A71 and CVA16 in cells. Moreover, the 2CL treatment elicited a strong in vivo protective efficacy against lethal EV-A71 challenge. Besides, the antiviral strategy of targeting the 2C helicase activity can be applied to inhibit the replication of EV-B. Either 2CL or B-2CL, the peptide redesigned based on the 2CL-corresponding sequence of EV-Bs, exerted effective antiviral activity against two important EV-Bs, Coxsackievirus B3 and Echovirus 11. Together, our findings demonstrated that targeting the helicase activity of 2C by rationally designed peptide is an efficient antiviral strategy against enteroviruses, and the 2CL and B-2CL showed promising clinical potentials to be further developed as broad-spectrum anti-enteroviral drugs.ImportanceEnteroviruses are a large group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, and include numerous human pathogens, such as enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses. However, no approved antiviral drug is available. Enteroviral 2C is the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and contains the RNA helicase activity critical for the viral life cycle. Herein, according to the structure of EV-A71 2C, we designed a peptide that effectively inhibited the RNA helicase activities of EV-A71-and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16)-encoded 2C proteins. Moreover, this peptide exerted potent antiviral effects against EV-A71 and CVA16 in cells and elicited therapeutic efficacy against lethal EV-A71 challenge in vivo Furthermore, we demonstrated that the strategy of targeting the 2C helicase activity can be used to other relevant enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 and echovirus 11. In summary, our findings provide compelling evidence that the designed peptides targeting the helicase activity of 2C could be broad-spectrum antiviral for enteroviruses.","Fang, Yuan; Wang, Chang; Wang, Chong; Yang, Ruyi; Bai, Peng; Zhang, Xue-Yi; Kong, Jing; Yin, Lei; Qiu, Yang; Zhou, Xi",Journal of virology,511,31

However, the effects of GPR40 full agonism on liver parameters are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of a GPR40 full agonist, SCO-267, on liver parameters in a non-diabetic mouse model with early-stage nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). SCO-267 was orally administered to mice, which were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), a mouse model for NAFLD. An oral dose of SCO-267 increased levels of circulating glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 in CDAHFD-fed mice. In a chronic dose experiment, effects of SCO-267 were compared with those of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (alogliptin) and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin). SCO-267 decreased liver triglyceride content, weight, and collagen content, and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels without affecting food intake or glucose levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Furthermore, SCO-267 decreased levels of liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), markers of oxidative stress. Alogliptin and dapagliflozin had no effect on liver weight or levels of triglyceride, collagen, plasma ALT, and liver TBARS. SCO-267 elevated mRNA levels of molecules with roles in mitochondrial function and beta-oxidation, while inhibiting those with roles in lipogenesis, inflammation, reactive oxygen species generation, and fibrosis in the liver, all of which were less evident with alogliptin and dapagliflozin. This is the first study to show that the GPR40 full agonist, SCO-267, improves liver parameters without affecting glucose or body weight in a mouse model of NAFLD.

Three additional farms were recruited via a press release published in agricultural newsletters. Of 76 farms contacted, 37 chose to participate in this study from June to July 2020.Results: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, dairies have implemented or increased biosecurity measures and COVID-19 precautions. Dairies reported adequate personal protective equipment for their workers, though face masks were not required on most dairies (n=32, 86%). Producers were concerned about the safety of their families, maintaining a healthy workforce, and keeping their farms profitable. Access to healthcare was not perceived to be an issue for their workers. One-quarter of dairies reported COVID-19 infections on their farms. Even though the majority had an isolation protocol in place if someone on the farm were to become ill, less than half of respondents felt their farm was protected against COVID-19. Two-thirds of producers have not had to decrease production, and a majority of operations have not furloughed or terminated employees due to COVID-19.Conclusions: Our data suggest that dairy farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin have implemented biosecurity and safety measures in response to COVID-19. These measures can be improved. Farms would benefit from additional guidance and education on implementation of personal protective measures and disease prevention strategies to keep workers employed and safe.","Mung Ting Yung, Sally; Vázquez, Rosa Chela; Liebman, Amy; Brihn, Auguste; Olson, Anna; Loken, Delaney; Contreras-Smith, Ana; Bender, Jeff; Kirsch, Jonathan",Journal of agromedicine,511,1

Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier-relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode-locked laser, and sub-picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group-IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.","Mu, Haoran; Liu, Yani; Bongu, Sudhakara Reddy; Bao, Xiaozhi; Li, Lei; Xiao, Si; Zhuang, Jincheng; Liu, Chen; Huang, Yamin; Dong, Yemin; Helmerson, Kristian; Wang, Jiaou; Liu, Guanyu; Du, Yi; Bao, Qiaoliang",Advanced materials,511,33

Widespread use of cloth face coverings has not been studied among the U.S. population, and therefore, little is known about encouraging the public to adopt this behavior. Immediately following the recommendation, an Internet survey sampled 503 adults during April 7-9 to assess their use of cloth face coverings and the behavioral and sociodemographic factors that might influence adherence to this recommendation. The same survey was administered 1 month later, during May 11-13, to another sample of 502 adults to assess changes in the prevalence estimates of use of cloth face coverings from April to May. Within days of the release of the first national recommendation for use of cloth face coverings, a majority of persons who reported leaving their home in the previous week reported using a cloth face covering (61.9%). Prevalence of use increased to 76.4% 1 month later, primarily associated with increases in use among non-Hispanic white persons (54.3% to 75.1%), persons aged ≥65 years (36.6% to 79.2%), and persons residing in the Midwest (43.7% to 73.8%). High rates were observed in April and by May, increased further among non-Hispanic black persons (74.4% to 82.3%), Hispanic or Latino persons (77.3% to 76.2%), non-Hispanic persons of other race (70.8% to 77.3%), persons aged 18-29 years (70.1% to 74.9%) and 30-39 years (73.9% to 84.4%), and persons residing in the Northeast (76.9% to 87.0%). The use of a cloth face covering was associated with theory-derived constructs that indicate a favorable attitude toward them, intention to use them, ability to use them, social support for using them, and beliefs that they offered protection for self, others, and the community. Research is needed to understand possible barriers to using cloth face coverings and ways to promote their consistent and correct use among those who have yet to adopt this behavior.","Fisher, Kiva A; Barile, John P; Guerin, Rebecca J; Vanden Esschert, Kayla L; Jeffers, Alexiss; Tian, Lin H; Garcia-Williams, Amanda; Gurbaxani, Brian; Thompson, William W; Prue, Christine E",MMWR.

However, risks for cognitive impairment may contribute to some patients' refusal of ECT. METHODS The present study examined galantamine as a pharmacological intervention to reduce cognitive adverse effects from ECT. Thirty-nine inpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder; bipolar disorder, depressed type; or schizoaffective disorder, depressed type and admitted for ECT were randomized to galantamine or placebo. Study drugs were initiated 24 to 48 hours before starting ECT and continued throughout the course of ECT. A neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline and 24 to 48 hours after completing a course of ECT treatments. Depression severity was monitored using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Clinical Global Impression Scale at baseline, weekly, and end point. Self-rated adverse effects were monitored weekly. RESULTS Thirty participants (12 patients in the galantamine group, 18 patients in the placebo group) had both pretreatment and posttreatment neuropsychological ratings. Those in the galantamine group scored significantly higher at discharge for delayed memory (t28 = 2.44, P < 0.05). Hierarchical regressions examined if treatment condition predicted changes in delayed memory scores from baseline to discharge. Inclusion of the treatment condition in the final model made a significant incremental improvement in prediction (ΔR = 0.12, F1,27 change = 4.65, P < 0.05; β = 0.37, t = 2.16, P < 0.05). Galantamine was well tolerated with no clinically significant bradycardia or prolonged paralysis when administered with ECT. CONCLUSIONS Galantamine may be protective against impairment in retention of new learning. Galantamine exhibited minimal adverse effects and was safe when administered during ECT. The present findings require replication by future researchers using larger samples before broad conclusions can be drawn.","Matthews, John D; Siefert, Caleb J; Blais, Mark A; Park, Lawrence T; Welch, Charles A; Dubois, Christina M; van Nieuwenhuizen, Adrienne O; Rooney, Kathryn O; Seabrook, Rita C; Durham, Lauren E; Adams, Heather C; Fava, Maurizio",The journal of ECT,511,16

From this point of view, this paper summarizes first the mechanisms of conjugation and transformation, two important processes of horizontal gene transfer, and then discusses the approaches for disarming virulent pathogenic bacteria, that is, virulence factor inhibitors. In contrast to antibiotics, anti-virulence drugs do not impose a high selective pressure on a bacterial population, and repress the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Disarmed virulence factors make virulent pathogens avirulent bacteria or pathobionts, so that we human will be able to coexist with these disarmed bacteria peacefully.","Ogawara, Hiroshi",The Journal of antibiotics,511,16

We aimed to determine internal medicine (IM) and paediatric (PD) residents' responses and the impact on the residents following patient deaths, and to compare any differences between IM and PD residents. We also aimed to determine whether sufficient resources and measures were in place to support residents through their grief process. METHODS This is a single-centre, cross-sectional study involving residents from IM and PD programmes from an academic tertiary hospital in Singapore. The residents completed a questionnaire regarding their responses and emotions after experiencing patient deaths. RESULTS A total of 122 residents (85 IM and 37 PD, equally distributed between year 1 to year 4 of residency training) participated, with 100% response rate. Only half (57%) felt they would be comfortable treating a dying patient and 66.4% reported feeling sad following their patient's death. Most (79.5%) were not aware of support resources that were available and 82% agreed that formal bereavement training should be included in the residency curriculum. PD residents had more negative symptoms than IM residents, with poor concentration (PD 35.1% vs IM 16.5%, p=0.02) and lethargy (PD 35.1% vs IM 9.4%, p<0.01) being the most common. CONCLUSION In our Asian context, residents are negatively affected by patient deaths, especially the PD residents. There is a need to incorporate relevant bereavement training for all residents.","Tan, Teresa; Koh, Pei Lin; Levetown, Marcia; Wong, Lisa; Lee, Joanne; Yong, Woon Chai; Yap, Eng Soo",BMJ supportive & palliative care,511,1

This review synthesised the available literature on SRH intervention delivery in conflict settings to inform potential priorities for further research and additional guidance development. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and SRH. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing an SRH intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated, but no meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS 110 publications met our eligibility criteria. Most focused on sub-Saharan Africa and displaced populations based in camps. Reported interventions targeted family planning, HIV/STIs, gender-based violence and general SRH. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics by doctors and nurses. Delivery barriers included security, population movement and lack of skilled health staff. Multistakeholder collaboration, community engagement and use of community and outreach workers were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. DISCUSSION There is limited relevant literature on adolescents or out-of-camp populations and few publications reported on the use of existing guidance such as the Minimal Initial Services Package. More interventions for gender-based violence were reported in the grey than the indexed literature, suggesting limited formal research in this area.

However, recent studies have detailed that the overall distribution of therapeutic nanoparticles (NP) following CED remains poor due to tissue inhomogeneity and anatomical barriers present in the brain, which has limited its translational applicability. Using probe NP, we first demonstrate that a significantly improved brain distribution is achieved by infusing small, non-adhesive NP via CED in a hyperosmolar infusate solution. This multimodal delivery strategy minimizes the hindrance of NP diffusion imposed by the brain extracellular matrix and reduces NP confinement within the perivascular spaces. We further recapitulate the distributions achieved by CED of this probe NP using a most widely explored biodegradable polymer-based drug delivery NP. These findings provide a strategy to overcome several key limitations of CED that have been previously observed in clinical trials.","Zhang, Clark; Mastorakos, Panagiotis; Sobral, Miguel; Berry, Sneha; Song, Eric; Nance, Elizabeth; Eberhart, Charles G; Hanes, Justin; Suk, Jung Soo",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,511,7

Research regarding SAP appropriateness for specific orthopedic procedures is limited and is required to facilitate targeted orthopedic prescriber behavior change. OBJECTIVES To describe SAP prescribing and appropriateness for orthopedic procedures in Australian hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, national, quality improvement study with retrospective analysis of data collected from Australian hospitals via Surgical National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (Surgical NAPS) audits from January 1, 2016, to April 15, 2019, were analyzed. METHODS Logistic regression identified hospital, patient and surgical factors associated with appropriateness. Adjusted appropriateness was calculated from the multivariable model. Additional subanalyses were conducted on smaller subsets to calculate the adjusted appropriateness for specific orthopedic procedures. RESULTS In total, 140 facilities contributed to orthopedic audits in the Surgical NAPS, including 4,032 orthopedic surgical episodes and 6,709 prescribed doses. Overall appropriateness was low, 58.0% (n = 3,894). This differed for prescribed procedural (n = 3,978, 64.7%) and postprocedural doses (n = 2,731, 48.3%). The most common reasons for inappropriateness, when prophylaxis was required, was timing for procedural doses (50.9%) and duration for postprocedural prescriptions (49.8%). The adjusted appropriateness of each orthopedic procedure group was low for procedural SAP (knee surgery, 54.1% to total knee joint replacement, 74.1%). The adjusted appropriateness for postprocedural prescription was also low (from hand surgery, 40.7%, to closed reduction fractures, 68.7%). CONCLUSIONS Orthopedic surgical specialties demonstrated differences across procedural and postprocedural appropriateness. The metric of appropriateness identifies targets for quality improvement and is meaningful for clinicians. Targeted quality improvement projects for orthopedic specialties need to be developed to support optimization of antimicrobial use.","Ierano, Courtney E; Thursky, Karin; Marshall, Caroline; Koning, Sonia; James, Rodney; Johnson, Sandra; Imam, Nabeel; Worth, Leon J; Peel, Trisha",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,511,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The clinical and CT data of 238 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our two hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred sixty-six patients (103 males; age 43.8 ± 12.3 years) were allocated in the training cohort and 72 patients (38 males; age 45.1 ± 15.8 years) from another independent hospital were assigned in the validation cohort. The primary composite endpoint was admission to an intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was constructed based on the combination of clinical and CT features, and its prognostic performance was externally tested in the validation group. The predictive value of the combined model was compared with models built on the clinical and radiological attributes alone. RESULTS Overall, 35 infected patients (21.1%) in the training cohort and 10 patients (13.9%) in the validation cohort experienced adverse outcomes. Underlying comorbidity (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-6.71; p < 0.001), lymphocyte count (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.38; p < 0.001) and crazy-paving sign (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.03-4.48; p = 0.042) were the independent factors. The nomogram displayed a concordance index (C-index) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88), and its prognostic value was confirmed in the validation cohort with a C-index of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.96).

We hypothesized that women giving birth to large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants differed in longitudinal changes in lipoproteins, CETP activity and HDL-C and that placentas from women with higher or lower circulating HDL-C displayed differential expression of mRNAs involved in cholesterol/nutrient transport, insulin signaling, inflammation/ extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Circulating lipids and CETP activity was measured during pregnancy, NMR lipidomics in late pregnancy, and associations with LGA and SGA infants investigated. RNA sequencing was performed in 28 placentas according to higher and lower maternal HDL-C levels. Lipidomics revealed high triglycerides in large VLDL and lipids/cholesterol/cholesteryl esters in small HDL in women giving birth to SGA infants. Placentas from women with higher HDL-C had decreased levels of CETP expression which was associated with mRNAs involved in cholesterol/nutrient transport, insulin signaling and inflammation/ECM remodeling. Both placental and circulating CETP levels were associated with growth of the fetus. Low circulating CETP activity at 36-38 weeks was associated with giving birth to SGA infants. Our findings suggest a link between increased maternal HDL-C levels, low CETP levels both in circulation and placenta, and SGA infants.","Roland, Marie Cecilie Paasche; Godang, Kristin; Aukrust, Pål; Henriksen, Tore; Lekva, Tove",Scientific reports,511,19

Here we use single-cell analysis to elucidate the cell types, development, renewal and evolution of the alveolar capillary endothelium. We show that alveolar capillaries are mosaics; similar to the epithelium that lines the alveolus, the alveolar endothelium is made up of two intermingled cell types, with complex 'Swiss-cheese'-like morphologies and distinct functions. The first cell type, which we term the 'aerocyte', is specialized for gas exchange and the trafficking of leukocytes, and is unique to the lung. The other cell type, termed gCap ('general' capillary), is specialized to regulate vasomotor tone, and functions as a stem/progenitor cell in capillary homeostasis and repair. The two cell types develop from bipotent progenitors, mature gradually and are affected differently in disease and during ageing. This cell-type specialization is conserved between mouse and human lungs but is not found in alligator or turtle lungs, suggesting it arose during the evolution of the mammalian lung. The discovery of cell type specialization in alveolar capillaries transforms our understanding of the structure, function, regulation and maintenance of the air-blood barrier and gas exchange in health, disease and evolution.","Gillich, Astrid; Zhang, Fan; Farmer, Colleen G; Travaglini, Kyle J; Tan, Serena Y; Gu, Mingxia; Zhou, Bin; Feinstein, Jeffrey A; Krasnow, Mark A; Metzger, Ross J",Nature,511,5

We introduce herein a new convenient and secure invagination procedure for pancreaticojejunostomy. METHODS We performed our new procedure during pancreatoduodenectomy in 15 consecutive patients (7 men, 8 women). The features of the procedure are as follows. First, it is performed using only four sutures. Second, the pancreas stump is invaginated into the jejunum, mainly by two sutures that penetrate the parenchyma and are continuously purse-string sutured to the jejunum. Third, all needle holes on the surface of the pancreas are covered with the jejunal wall. RESULTS Eight patients were classified as showing no pancreatic fistula, and seven displayed a grade A fistula, according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula criteria. The median operating time for these 15 patients using the present procedure was about 60 min shorter than that for the previous nine patients who underwent duct-to-mucosa pancreaticogastrostomy in our hospital.

Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is best accomplished by combining clinical judgment with diagnostic test results, the criterion standard of which is the throat culture. Penicillin (either oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice, because it is cost-effective, has a narrow spectrum of activity, and has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to penicillin have not been documented. For penicillin-allergic individuals, acceptable alternatives include a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin, oral clindamycin, or various oral macrolides or azalides. The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention). The recommended duration of prophylaxis depends on the number of previous attacks, the time elapsed since the last attack, the risk of exposure to GAS infections, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or a macrolide or azalide are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic individuals. This report updates the 1995 statement by the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee.

Here, we test whether this pattern held during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that disproportionately put older adults at risk. We additionally examine potential moderating effects of daily activity and social connectedness, which have been shown to benefit mental health across the life span. We regularly assessed a large sample of adults ages 18-89 using online surveys. As preregistered for this report (https://osf.io/tb4qv), we focus on self-reported measures of affect, depression, stress, and worry as well as self-reported daily activity and perception of social isolation during two time windows for adults in the United States: early (mid-March to early April) and later (mid-April to early May) periods during the spring phase of the pandemic. Increased age benefited emotional well-being for multiple metrics during both time windows assessed. Furthermore, the results confirmed that exercise and perception of social connectedness can buffer against negative mental health outcomes across all ages, although the beneficial effects of age remained even when controlling for these influences. The one exception was worry about one's own health: Once exercise and social connectedness were controlled, increased age was associated with more worry. The results overall suggest that, at least among adults with access to technology, older age was associated with greater resilience during the spring phase of the pandemic. Thus, increased resilience of older adults demonstrated previously extends to the context of the onset of a pandemic.

Our results supported Gebauer et al.'s original conclusions that mind-body practices increase self-enhancement. Although the self-centrality effects were not clearly replicated in either experiment, we found evidence that measurement and sampling differences may explain this discrepancy. Moreover, an integrative data analysis of the original and the replication data strongly supported all of Gebauer et al.'s conclusions.

We find evidence that the ARRA increase in SNAP benefits is associated with healthier weight outcomes in three of the four age groups examined.

Pleural effusions continue to be a complication that affect many surgical patients and are associated with increased morbidity, many times requiring readmission and additional invasive procedures. The risks for development of pleural effusion after hospital discharge are ill-defined, which leads to uncertainty related to strategies for prevention. Our primary objective was to determine, in patients with CHD requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, the prevalence of post-surgical pleural effusions leading to readmission. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with post-surgical pleural effusions requiring readmission. We identified 4417 citations; 10 full-text articles were included in the final review. Of the included studies, eight focused on single-ventricle palliation, one looked at Tetralogy of Fallot patients, and another on pleural effusion in the setting of post-pericardiotomy syndrome. Using a random-effect model, the overall prevalence of pleural effusion requiring readmission was 10.2% (95% CI 4.6; 17.6). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 91%). In a subpopulation of patients after single-ventricle palliation, the prevalence was 13.0% (95% CI 6.0;21.0), whereas it was 3.0% (95% CI 0.4;6.75) in patients mostly with biventricular physiology. We were unable to accurately assess risk factors. A better understanding of this complication with a focus on single-ventricle physiology will allow for improved risk stratification, family counseling, and earlier recognition of pleural effusion in this patient population.","Hughes, Alana; Carter, Kerri; Cyrus, John; Karam, Oliver",Pediatric cardiology,511,1

We hypothesize that preconditioning with sevoflurane is a protective factor against ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS In this randomized controlled trial, patients ASA I-II undergoing breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flaps were allocated into two groups and analyzed: group BAL included patients who received balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane for 30 min before removal of the flap and throughout the surgery. The TCI group included patients who received a total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil. We evaluated regional tissue oximetry at the end of the surgery and at 4, 12 and 20 h after surgery. Other assessed parameters were: blood lactate clearance, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase. RESULTS In total 54 patients, twenty-seven per group, were analyzed. There was a significant increase of the average value of regional tissue oximetry measured 4 h after surgery in the BAL group compared to the TCI group: BAL: 84.05 % (8.96 SD); TCI : 76.17 % (12.92 SD) (P = 0.03), but not at the other time frames. The creatine phosphokinase value was significantly lower in the BAL group at the end of surgery, but not at the other time-frames. There were no significant differences in blood levels of other markers. CONCLUSIONS From our results, the positive preconditioning impact of sevoflurane on ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing free flap surgery is expressed in the early postoperative hours, but it does not persist in the long-term.

Increase thickness of TiO2 nanowires layer lowers the driving potential of the entire ECDs accompanied with reduced potential at the EC layer electrode, which further leads to decreased optical contrast and switching speed of the ECDs. Meanwhile, it can be found that the EC layer electrodes possess larger charge densities than those of TiO2 nanowire electrodes during the electrochemical redox process of these ECDs. However, the intrinsic injection and extraction charge densities of each single electrode are similar, which appears that the intrinsic charge balance of EC layer and TiO2 nanowires electrodes play more important role in the cycling stability of the ECDs. ECD with an optimum thickness of the TiO2 nanowires layer exhibits good electrochromic properties in term of high optical contrast (~45%), fast switching speed (3.23 s) and good cycling stability (which has nearly no decay after 5000 cycles). This study explores the effects of thickness of TiO2 Nanowires layer on electrode potentials and electrochromic properties of electrochromic devices (ECDs), providing a potentially new direction for the preparation of ECDs with good integrated performance.","Lv, Xiaojing; Xu, Xinjia; Zhang, Yujian; Wright, Dominic S; Zhang, Yongfu; Zhang, Cheng",Nanotechnology,511,1

Under these particular circumstances, this fiction becomes striking, and it can no longer be swept under the rug. As health emergencies can happen anywhere, anytime, the patient prioritization in circumstances of limited resources should be accepted. Medical law and ethics should back away from strict commitment to placing paramount emphasis on the value of human life. It is time for medical law and ethics to leave taboo-related hypocritical attitudes, and venture to make a historic compromise. To do so, three principles should be met: subsidiarity, proportionality, and consensus and social proof.","Voultsos, Polychronis P",African journal of reproductive health,511,31

Identifying the challenges that general practitioners (GPs) face during public health crises of infectious diseases will help to improve prepandemic planning. In this integrative systematic review, we identified research-based evidence to (1) challenges that GPs have when participating in pandemics or epidemics and (2) whether GPs from different countries encountered different challenges. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases during October to November 2012 to identify studies relevant to experience by GPs during epidemics or pandemics. RESULTS Six quantitative, 2 mixed method, and 2 qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The challenges identified were not exclusive to specific countries and encompassed different responses to outbreaks. These challenges included difficulties with information access; supply and use of personal protective equipment; performing public health responsibilities; obtaining support from the authorities; appropriate training; and the emotional effects of participating in the response to an infectious disease with unknown characteristics and lethality. CONCLUSION GPs' response to public health crises in different countries presents potential for improving pandemic preparedness.","Kunin, Marina; Engelhard, Dan; Piterman, Leon; Thomas, Shane",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,511,22

PURPOSE Our aim was to analyze the outcomes after flow diversion of ruptured intracranial aneurysms. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of 3 databases was performed for studies published from 2006 to 2018. STUDY SELECTION According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included studies (from 2010 to 2018) reporting acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diversion. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following: aneurysm occlusion rate, complications, rebleeding, and factors influencing the studied outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 20 studies evaluating 223 patients with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverter stents. Immediate angiographic occlusion was obtained in 32% (29/86; 95% CI, 15.4%-48%; I2 = 79.6%) of aneurysms, whereas long-term complete/near-complete aneurysm occlusion was 88.9% (162/189; 95% CI, 84%-93.5%; I2 = 20.9%) (mean radiologic follow-up of 9.6 months). The treatment-related complication rate was 17.8% (42/223; 95% CI, 11%-24%; I2 = 52.6%). Complications were higher in the posterior circulation (16/72 = 27%; 95% CI, 14%-40%; I2 = 66% versus 18/149 = 11.7%; 95% CI, 7%-16%; I2 = 0%) (P = .004) and after treatment with multiple stents (14/52 = 26%; 95% CI, 14%-45%; I2 = 59%) compared with a single stent (20/141 = 10%; 95% CI, 5%-15%; I2 = 0%) (P = .004). Aneurysm rebleeding after treatment was 4% (5/223; 95% CI, 1.8%-7%; I2 = 0%) and was higher in the first 72 hours. LIMITATIONS Small and retrospective series. CONCLUSIONS Flow-diversion treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms yields a high rate of long-term angiographic occlusion with a relatively low rate of aneurysm rebleeding. However, treatment is associated with a complication rate of 18%. When coiling or microsurgical clipping are not feasible strategies, anterior circulation ruptured aneurysms can be effectively treated with a flow-diversion technique, minimizing the number of stents deployed. Given the 27% rate of complications, flow diversion for ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms should be considered only in selected cases not amenable to other treatments.","Cagnazzo, F; di Carlo, D T; Cappucci, M; Lefevre, P-H; Costalat, V; Perrini, P",AJNR.

Our goal was to investigate whether the cow hitch can withstand equal strength in comparison with the Pulvertaft and to see if there is a difference in bulk, which could enhance gliding function and reduce friction and adhesion formation. Methods: Sheep tendons were used to perform 10 cow-hitch and 10 Pulvertaft repairs. Tensile strength was obtained with a cyclic loading tensile testing machine and tendon width and height measurements were obtained through digital analysis by photographs of the repairs. Results: The cow hitch showed significantly better ultimate strength and had less bulk. There was no statistical difference in displacement, defined as gain in total length of the tendon.

The treatment outcomes of drugs for neuropathic pain, physical therapy or epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are still unclear, especially in elderly patients. There is currently no consensus on pain management. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the short-term outcomes of epidural steroid injections among elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a retrospective study. The sample consisted of 44 patients aged 65 or older who underwent epidural steroid injections secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis between 2014 and 2016 at a single center. Data were collected using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Istanbul Low Back Pain Disability Index (ILBPDI) before and at 3-month follow-up visit. RESULTS Participants had lower mean scale scores at all times after ESI administration than before. Four patients (9.1%) needed additional injections while two (4.5%) needed operation. No minor or major ESI-related complications were observed. CONCLUSION Epidural steroid injections are an effective nonsurgical option for pain relief and improvement of physical function in elderly patients. The NRS, ODI, and ILBPDI are reliable and valid scales that can be used to evaluate the outcomes of ESIs in a selected group of elderly patients.","Tasdogan, Ali Muhittin; Tarikci Kilic, Ebru",Turkish neurosurgery,511,1

Data on reactogenicity (vaccine side effects) in this population are limited. AIMS To assess reactogenicity among nursing home (NH) residents. To provide a plausible proxy for predicting vaccine response among this population. METHODS We enrolled and sampled NH residents and community-dwelling healthcare workers who received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, to assess local or systemic reactogenicity and antibody levels (immunogenicity). RESULTS NH residents reported reactions at a much lower frequency and lesser severity than the community-dwelling healthcare workers. These reactions were mild and transient with all subjects experiencing more local than systemic reactions. Based on our reactogenicity and immunogenicity data, we developed a linear regression model predicting log-transformed anti-spike, anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD), and neutralizing titers, with a dichotomous variable indicating the presence or absence of reported reactions which revealed a statistically significant effect, with estimated shifts in log-transformed titers ranging from 0.32 to 0.37 (all p < 0.01) indicating greater immunogenicity in subjects with one or more reported reactions of varying severity. DISCUSSION With a significantly lower incidence of post-vaccination reactions among NH residents as reported in this study, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine appears to be well-tolerated among this vulnerable population. If validated in larger populations, absence of reactogenicity could help guide clinicians in prioritizing vaccine boosters. CONCLUSIONS Reactogenicity is significantly mild among nursing home residents and overall, subjects who reported post-vaccination reactions developed higher antibody titers.","Oyebanji, Oladayo A; Wilson, Brigid; Keresztesy, Debbie; Carias, Lenore; Wilk, Dennis; Payne, Michael; Aung, Htin; Denis, Kerri St; Lam, Evan C; Rowley, Christopher F; Berry, Sarah D; Cameron, Cheryl M; Cameron, Mark J; Schmader, Kenneth E; Balazs, Alejandro B; King, Christopher L; Canaday, David H; Gravenstein, Stefan",Aging clinical and experimental research,511,31

Control of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) requires the collaboration of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, with CD8(+) T cells providing direct perforin and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-mediated antiviral activity. To distinguish bystander from direct antiviral contributions of CD4(+) T cells in virus clearance and pathology, memory CD4(+) T cells purified from wild type (wt), perforin-deficient (PKO), and IFN-gamma-deficient (GKO) immune donors were transferred to immunodeficient SCID mice prior to CNS challenge. All three donor CD4(+) T-cell populations controlled CNS virus replication at 8 days postinfection, indicating IFN-gamma- and perforin-independent antiviral function. Recipients of GKO CD4(+) T cells succumbed more rapidly to fatal disease than untreated control infected mice. In contrast, wt and PKO donor CD4(+) T cells cleared infectious virus to undetectable levels and protected from fatal disease. Recipients of all CD4(+) T-cell populations exhibited demyelination. However, it was more severe in wt CD4(+) T-cell recipients. These data support a role of CD4(+) T cells in virus clearance and demyelination. Despite substantial IFN-gamma-independent antiviral activity, IFN-gamma was crucial in providing protection from death. IFN-gamma reduced neutrophil accumulation and directed macrophages to white matter but did not ameliorate myelin loss.","Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Hinton, David R; Ransohoff, Richard M; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of virology,511,1

Evolutionary genomics of viruses revealed many unexpected connections but the general scenario(s) for the evolution of the virosphere remains a matter of intense debate among proponents of the cellular regression, escaped genes, and primordial virus world hypotheses. A comprehensive sequence and structure analysis of major virion proteins indicates that they evolved on about 20 independent occasions, and in some of these cases likely ancestors are identifiable among the proteins of cellular organisms. Virus genomes typically consist of distinct structural and replication modules that recombine frequently and can have different evolutionary trajectories. The present analysis suggests that, although the replication modules of at least some classes of viruses might descend from primordial selfish genetic elements, bona fide viruses evolved on multiple, independent occasions throughout the course of evolution by the recruitment of diverse host proteins that became major virion components.","Krupovic, Mart; Koonin, Eugene V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,511,16

This is a term popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, the term 'social distancing' can be misleading, as it may imply that individuals should stop socializing. However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term 'distant socializing' as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","Pandi-Perumal, Seithikurippu R; Vaccarino, Sophie R; Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Zaki, Nevin F W; BaHammam, Ahmed S; Manzar, Dilshad; Maestroni, G J M; Suchecki, Deborah; Moscovitch, Adam; Zizi, Ferdinand; Jean-Louis, Girardin; Narasimhan, Meera; Ramasubramanian, Chellamuthu; Trakht, Ilya; Seeman, Mary V; Shneerson, John M; Maes, Michael; Reiter, Russel J; Kennedy, Sidney H",Pathogens and global health,511,1

The specimen was extracted through a 4-cm Pfannenstiel incision. In the second and third cases, a GelPOINT access was placed through a 5-cm Pfannenstiel incision, and two additional 3-mm trocars were inserted. The specimens were extracted without additional skin incisions. In all cases, the endoscope and vessel-sealing device were inserted through the GelPOINT access.

METHODS Three schools (N = 2279, 1 year-round) participated in this natural experiment. Children's BMI z-score (zBMI) and CRF (PACER laps) were measured from 2017 to 2019 each May/August. Mixed effects regression estimated monthly zBMI and CRF change during school/summer. Secondary analyses examined differences by weight status and race. Spline regression models estimated zBMI and CRF growth from kindergarten-sixth grade. RESULTS Compared to traditional school, children attending a year-round school gained more zBMI (difference = 0.015; 95CI = 0.002, 0.028) during school, and less zBMI (difference = -0.029; 95CI = -0.041, -0.018), and more CRF (difference = 0.834; 95CI = 0.575, 1.093) monthly during summer. Differences by weight status and race were observed during summer and school. Growth models demonstrated that the magnitude of overall zBMI and CRF change from kindergarten-sixth grade was similar for year-round or traditional school children. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to traditional school children zBMI increased during the traditional 9-month school calendar and zBMI decreased during the traditional summer vacation for year-round school children. Structured summer programming may mitigate accelerated summer BMI gain and CRF loss especially for overweight or obese, and/or Black children.","Weaver, Robert Glenn; Hunt, Ethan; Armstrong, Bridget; Beets, Michael W; Brazendale, Keith; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle; Pate, Russell R; Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto; Saelens, Brian; Youngstedt, Shawn D; Dugger, Roddrick; Parker, Hannah; von Klinggraeff, Lauren; Jones, Alexis; Burkhart, Sarah; Ressor-Oyer, Layton",Pediatric obesity,511,31

The operation time, postoperative hospital stay, operation success rate, stone clearance rate, and surgical complications were evaluated between the two groups.For the RPUL and URL groups, respectively, the average operation time was 74.5 ± 24.6 minutes and 54.5 ± 13.2 minutes; the postoperative hospital stay was 5.8 ± 1.4 days and 3.2 ± 1.2 days; the operation success rate was 96.0% (144/150) and 85.3% (116/136); the incidence rate of complications was 3.5% (5/144) and 17.5% (18/103); and the stone clearance rate was 100% (144/144) and 88.8% (103/116), which were all statistically significant (P < .05).Both RPUL and URL had the advantages of low trauma and fast recovery rate for patients with upper ureteral calculi. However, patients who underwent RPUL showed higher success and fewer complication rate. RPUL might be a safe and effective laparoscopic method for the treatment of patients with upper ureteral calculi.","Gao, Sheng-Lin; Wu, Hao; Su, Quan-Xin; Zhang, Zi-Yi; Zhang, Ze; Lu, Chao; Zhang, Li-Feng; Zuo, Li",Medicine,511,1

STUDY DESIGN Animal cohort. SETTING Academic hospital laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Three skin grafts were created using a pneumatic microtome on the dorsum of 12 rats. Rats were evenly divided into experimental (n = 6) and control (n = 6) groups. The experimental group received a thin layer of fibrin glue between the graft and wound bed, and the control group was secured with standard bolsters. Adherence strength of the skin graft was tested by measurement of force required to sheer the graft from the recipient wound. Adhesion strength measurements were taken on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, and 3. RESULTS The experimental group required an average force of 719 g on POD1, 895 g on POD2, and 676 g on POD3, while the average force in the control group was 161 g on POD1, 257 g on POD2, and 267 g on POD3. On each of the 3 PODs, there was a significant difference in adherence strength between the experimental and control groups (P = .036, P = .029, P = .024). CONCLUSION There is a significant difference in the adhesion strength of skin grafts to the wound bed in the early postoperative period of the 2 groups. In areas of high mobility, using the fibrin sealant can keep the graft immobile during the critical phases of early healing.","Balceniuk, Mark D; Wingate, Nicholas A; Krein, Howard; Curry, Joseph; Cognetti, David; Heffelfiner, Ryan; Luginbuhl, Adam",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,511,33

METHODS Patients with known or suspected stage I NSCLC were enrolled in a prospective pilot trial for lesion localization and SLN mapping via NB-guided NIR marking. Successful localization, SLN detection rates, histopathologic status of SLN versus overall nodes, and concordance to initial clinical stage were measured. Ex vivo confirmation of NIR+ SLNs and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS Twelve patients underwent NB-guided marking with indocyanine green of lung lesions ranging in size from 0.4 to 2.2 cm and located 0.1 to 3 cm from the pleural surface. An NIR+ ""tattoo"" was identified in all cases. Ten patients were diagnosed with NSCLC and 9 SLNs were identified in 8 of the 10 patients, resulting in an 80% SLN detection rate. SLN pathologic status was 100% sensitive and specific for overall nodal status with no false-negative results. Despite previous nodal sampling, one patient was found to have metastatic disease in the SLN alone, a 12.5% rate of disease upstaging with NIR SLN mapping. SLN were detectable for up to 3 hours, allowing time for obtaining a tissue diagnosis and surgical resection. There were no adverse events associated with NB-labeling or indocyanine green dye itself. CONCLUSIONS NB-guided NIR lesion localization and SLN identification was safe and feasible. This minimally invasive image-guided technique may permit the accurate localization and nodal staging of early stage lung cancers.","Hachey, Krista J; Digesu, Christopher S; Armstrong, Katherine W; Gilmore, Denis M; Khullar, Onkar V; Whang, Brian; Tsukada, Hisashi; Colson, Yolonda L",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,511,1

We introduce a metapopulation SEIR model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in 10 of the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. Derived from cell phone data, our mobility networks map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighborhoods (census block groups, or CBGs) to points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 57k CBGs to 553k POIs with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in population behavior over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of ""superspreader"" POIs account for a large majority of infections and that restricting maximum occupancy at each POI is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2-8 solely from differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce mobility as sharply, and that the POIs they visit are more crowded and therefore higher-risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19.","Chang, Serina; Pierson, Emma; Koh, Pang Wei; Gerardin, Jaline; Redbird, Beth; Grusky, David; Leskovec, Jure",Nature,511,1

However, replicating vaccines are administered in and around pregnancy, either inadvertently because of unknown pregnancy status or when recommended.The historical cases of Ebola virus, yellow fever, and rubella demonstrate that contradictory messages around the safety of live vaccines in pregnancy have critical public health costs. First, restricting study or use of replicating vaccines in pregnancy may delay or deny access to the only available protection against deadly diseases.

Over 40% of patients in diabetes remission after gastric bypass surgery may redevelop diabetes within 5 years. Metformin, the first-line drug for diabetes, has low bioavailability and slow, incomplete gastrointestinal absorption. We hypothesized that gastric bypass would further reduce the absorption and bioavailability of metformin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a nonblinded, single-dose pharmacokinetic study, 16 nondiabetic post-gastric bypass patients and 16 sex- and BMI-matched control subjects (mean age 40 years and BMI 39.2 kg/m(2)) were administered two 500-mg metformin tablets. Plasma metformin levels were sampled at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h. Metformin absorption, estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma drug concentrations from time 0 to infinity (AUC(0-∞)), was the primary outcome, and metformin bioavailability, assessed by measuring 24-h urine metformin levels, was a secondary outcome. RESULTS Compared with control subjects, metformin AUC(0-∞) was increased in gastric bypass subjects by 21% (13.7 vs. 11.4 μg/mL/h; mean difference 2.3 [95% CI -1.3 to 5.9]) and bioavailability was increased by 50% (41.8 vs. 27.8%; 14.0 [4.1-23.9]). Gastric bypass patients had significantly lower AUC glucose levels over 8 h compared with control subjects (35.8 vs. 41.7 μg/mL/h; 5.9 [3.1-8.8]), but this was likely a result of differences in baseline fasting glucose and not metformin absorption. CONCLUSIONS Metformin absorption and bioavailability seem to be higher after gastric bypass, and this may have implications on dosing and toxicity risk. Studies are needed to confirm these findings and delineate potential mechanisms.","Padwal, Raj S; Gabr, Raniah Q; Sharma, Arya M; Langkaas, Lee-Ann; Birch, Dan W; Karmali, Shahzeer; Brocks, Dion R",Diabetes care,511,5

P2Y12 inhibitors may have pleiotropic effects to induce cardioprotection against acute myocardial IRI beyond their inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation. We compared the cardioprotective effects of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor on infarct size in an in vivo rat model of acute myocardial IRI, and investigated the effects of the P2Y12 inhibitors on enzymatic infarct size (48-h area-under-the-curve (AUC) troponin T release) and clinical outcomes in a retrospective study of STEMI patients from the CONDI-2/ERIC-PPCI trial using propensity score analyses.

However, most existing studies did not consider the simultaneous impact of social isolation and loneliness on biological outcomes. Further, they only assessed one biological outcome at a time and did not test any moderation by age, despite empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the plausibility of this hypothesis. To address these gaps in the literature, we tested the associations between two indicators of social isolation (living status and frequency of social contacts) and loneliness and daily cortisol secretion and two markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) in a sample of adults aged between 25 and 75 years old. Data were drawn from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Refresher study (N = 314). We found that, above and beyond loneliness, living alone was associated with a flattened diurnal cortisol slope (i.e., reduced changes in cortisol levels during waking hours that are indicative of a dysregulated HPA axis) and higher CRP levels. On the other hand, higher loneliness was associated with higher IL-6 levels, above and beyond our measures of social isolation. Loneliness did not mediate any of the effects of social isolation on either cortisol or CRP, and age did not moderate any of the relationships reported above. Our findings support the idea that social isolation and loneliness have unique and independent endocrine and immune effects despite being linked to each other. Understanding the specific biological pathways through which these aspects of social well-being exert their effects on health across the lifespan has critical consequences for both intervention development and public health policies.","Zilioli, Samuele; Jiang, Yanping",Psychoneuroendocrinology,511,1

Development of insecticide resistance in the vector is a major concern as its control mainly relies on the use of biocides. Data on the species' resistance status are essential for efficient and sustainable control. To date the insecticide resistance status of Ae. albopictus populations from Greece against major insecticides used in vector control remains largely unknown. METHODS We investigated the insecticide resistance status of 19 Ae. albopictus populations from 11 regions of Greece. Bioassays were performed against diflubenzuron (DFB), Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), deltamethrin and malathion. Known insecticide resistance loci were molecularly analysed, i.e. voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance; presence and frequency of carboxylesterases 3 (CCEae3a) and 6 (CCEae6a) gene amplification associated with organophosphate (OP) resistance and; chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1) for the possible presence of DFB resistance mutations. RESULTS Bioassays showed full susceptibility to DFB, Bti and deltamethrin, but resistance against the OP malathion (range of mortality: 55.30-91.40%). VGSC analysis revealed a widespread distribution of the mutations F1534C (in all populations, with allelic frequencies between 6.6-68.3%), and I1532T (in 6 populations; allelic frequencies below 22.70%), but absence of V1016G. CCE gene amplifications were recorded in 8 out of 11 populations (overall frequency: 33%).

CONCLUSIONS The results indicate: (i) the suitability of larvicides DFB and Bti for Ae. albopictus control in Greece; (ii) possible incipient pyrethroid resistance due to the presence of kdr mutations; and (iii) possible reduced efficacy of OPs, in a scenario of re-introducing them for vector control. The study highlights the need for systematic resistance monitoring for developing and implementing appropriate evidence-based control programmes.","Balaska, Sofia; Fotakis, Emmanouil A; Kioulos, Ilias; Grigoraki, Linda; Mpellou, Spyridoula; Chaskopoulou, Alexandra; Vontas, John",Parasites & vectors,511,17

While MHC binding is mostly influenced by the identity of the so-called anchor positions of the peptide, secondary interactions from nonanchor positions are known to play a role in complex stability. However, current MHC-binding prediction methods lack an analysis of the major conformational states and might underestimate the impact of secondary interactions. In this work, we present an atomically detailed analysis of peptide-MHC binding that can reveal the contributions of any interaction toward stability. We propose a simulation framework that uses both umbrella sampling and adaptive sampling to generate a Markov state model (MSM) for a coronavirus-derived peptide (QFKDNVILL), bound to one of the most prevalent MHC receptors in humans (HLA-A24:02). While our model reaffirms the importance of the anchor positions of the peptide in establishing stable interactions, our model also reveals the underestimated importance of position 4 (p4), a nonanchor position. We confirmed our results by simulating the impact of specific peptide mutations and validated these predictions through competitive binding assays. By comparing the MSM of the wild-type system with those of the D4A and D4P mutations, our modeling reveals stark differences in unbinding pathways. The analysis presented here can be applied to any peptide-MHC complex of interest with a structural model as input, representing an important step toward comprehensive modeling of the MHC class I pathway.","Abella, Jayvee R; Antunes, Dinler; Jackson, Kyle; Lizée, Gregory; Clementi, Cecilia; Kavraki, Lydia E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,511,33

Many factors hinder treatment attendance, and language discordance with the provider may present an additional obstacle to attending therapy. This study evaluates factors associated with voice therapy attendance at a language-diverse, safety-net hospital. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review METHODS: Retrospective review of adult patients referred to speech language pathology for treatment of voice disorders from January, 2018 to April, 2019. Primary spoken language, interpreter collaboration, and patient demographics were obtained from medical records. Multivariate analysis compared patient factors with voice therapy attendance versus nonattendance. RESULTS Of 422 patients, 219 (52%) attended at least one therapy session, whereas 203 (48%) did not attend (n = 120) or schedule therapy (n = 83). In multivariate analysis, only the association between public insurance and nonattendance was statistically significant (P = .016). After adjusting for interpreter use and interval between referral and first appointment, patients with private health insurance were 2.35 times more likely to attend therapy compared to those with public insurance (95% confidence interval: 1.18-4.71). Non-English language; interpreter collaboration; distance from hospital; and patient demographics, including age, gender, ethnicity, and birthplace, did not significantly correlate with attendance. CONCLUSIONS In a culturally and language-diverse cohort of dysphonic patients, individuals with public health insurance were significantly less likely to attend voice therapy. Language-discordant therapy and interpreter collaboration was not a statistically significant barrier to therapy attendance. Additional investigation is warranted to optimize allocation of voice therapy resources for those with public health insurance and for diverse speakers of all languages.

In this paper, such novel 3,7-diacylquercetin, quercetin 6''-acylgalactoside, and quercetin 2'',6''-diacylgalactoside analogues of lead compound 1 were prepared to assess their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. The significant enzymatic inhibition of both Escherichia coli DNA gyrase and Staphylococcus aureus topoIV suggest that these compounds are dual inhibitors. Most of the investigated compounds exhibited pronounced inhibition with MIC values ranging from 0.13 to 128 μg/mL toward the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin sensitive S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), vancomycin intermediate S. aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial strains. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that the acyl moiety was absolutely essential for activity against Gram-positive organisms. The most active compound 5i was 512-fold more potent than vancomycin and 16-32-fold more potent than 1 against VRE strains. It also has realistic in situ intestinal absorption in rats and showed very low acute toxicity in mice.

Some vaccines have already received emergency authorization from Health Agencies, but growing skepticism and vaccine hesitancy will probably affect COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. In the attempt to shed light on this issue, we conducted an online survey in a population of parents referring to 4 pediatric practices in Naples, Italy in whom we evaluated potential vaccine acceptability in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, perception of personal health and of the impact of COVID-19, and attitudes toward general vaccination practices. Vaccination rates were analyzed also in the corresponding pediatric population.Almost 27% of participants declared they were in favor of vaccinations, and in fact real life vaccination rates in children exceeded the national mean. Only 26.5% of respondents declared they would receive COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine refusal was attributed to safety concerns in 76% of parents. Specific vaccine attributes further reduced the acceptance rate. Female gender, younger age and lower education level were associated with non-adherence to vaccination. Among extrinsic factors of COVID-19 vaccination, only information from National Health Authorities was significantly associated to vaccine acceptance.The rate of potential COVID-19 vaccine acceptability was very poor in our population of parents. Vaccine hesitancy was mainly due to safety concerns. Demographic and educational factors were correlated to vaccine acceptability.

Results: Next, we describe how essential components in attaining existential maturity come together. (1) Because people experience absent attachment to important people as very similar to dying, attending to those experiences of relationship is essential. (2) That entails an internal working through of important relationships, knowing their incompleteness, until able to ""hold them inside,"" and invest in these and other connections. (3) And what allows that is making a meaningful connection with someone around the experience of absence or death.

DESIGN The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Surveillance Definition Working Group in September 2011. Working Group members included representatives of stakeholder societies and organizations and federal partners. MAIN RESULTS The Working Group finalized a three-tier, adult surveillance definition algorithm for ventilator-associated events. The algorithm uses objective, readily available data elements and can identify a broad range of conditions and complications occurring in mechanically ventilated adult patients, including but not limited to VAP. The first tier definition, ventilator-associated condition (VAC), identifies patients with a period of sustained respiratory deterioration following a sustained period of stability or improvement on the ventilator, defined by changes in the daily minimum fraction of inspired oxygen or positive end-expiratory pressure. The second tier definition, infection-related ventilator-associated complication (IVAC), requires that patients with VAC also have an abnormal temperature or white blood cell count, and be started on a new antimicrobial agent. The third tier definitions, possible and probable VAP, require that patients with IVAC also have laboratory and/or microbiological evidence of respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS Ventilator-associated events surveillance was implemented in January 2013 in the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network. Modifications to improve surveillance may be made as additional data become available and users gain experience with the new definitions.","Magill, Shelley S; Klompas, Michael; Balk, Robert; Burns, Suzanne M; Deutschman, Clifford S; Diekema, Daniel; Fridkin, Scott; Greene, Linda; Guh, Alice; Gutterman, David; Hammer, Beth; Henderson, David; Hess, Dean; Hill, Nicholas S; Horan, Teresa; Kollef, Marin; Levy, Mitchell; Septimus, Edward; VanAntwerpen, Carole; Wright, Don; Lipsett, Pamela",Critical care medicine,511,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate the hemodynamic and respiratory effects during intraperitoneal cavity exploration through 3 different natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) access locations compared with laparoscopy. DESIGN AND SETTING Survival experiments using 40 female pigs randomized to transgastric, transcolonic, transvaginal, and laparoscopic peritoneoscopy. INTERVENTIONS On-demand endoscopic insufflation of CO(2) with feedback pressure regulation was used in NOTES with a maximum pressure of 14 mm Hg. In the laparoscopy group, the IAP was maintained at 14 mm Hg. NOTES procedures were performed by an endoscopist (with the assistance of a gynecologist in the transvaginal group and a second endoscopist in the transgastric and transrectal groups) and laparoscopy by 2 surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Invasive hemodynamic and respiratory data. Blood samples were drawn for gas analyses. RESULTS All experiments except one in the transrectal group were completed. The IAP was significantly lower in all NOTES groups compared with the laparoscopy group. A significant increase in mean systemic arterial blood pressure was observed in the laparoscopy group at 15 and 30 minutes of intraperitoneal cavity exploration, but it remained unchanged during all NOTES procedures. An increase in airway pressures was observed at 15 and 30 minutes of peritoneoscopy in the animals undergoing laparoscopy, whereas those parameters remained unchanged in the NOTES groups. The laparoscopy group showed a significant impairment in pulmonary gas exchange (decrease in Pao(2), increase in Paco(2), and decrease in arterial pH) after 30 minutes of peritoneoscopy, whereas only a slight increase in Paco(2) was observed in the transrectal and transvaginal groups.

Additionally, we sought to determine if topical 1.0% morphine applied to the equine cornea would result in ocular or systemic absorption. ANIMAL STUDIED Six healthy horses. PROCEDURE Morphine sulfate (1.0%) was applied topically to one eye every four hours for 72 h before horses were euthanized. Serum samples were collected at varying time points during the study and aqueous and vitreous humor were collected immediately after euthanasia. Morphine quantification in serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor was performed by ELISA. Treated and control corneas were submitted for histopathology. Horses were monitored for adverse ocular and systemic effects throughout the study period. RESULTS All horses developed mild mucoid ocular discharge in the treated eye. One horse developed a fever during treatment. Morphine was detected in the aqueous humor of the treated eye for all horses with mean ± standard deviation of 165.18 ng/mL ± 87.69 ng/mL. Morphine was detected in vitreous humor of the treated eye of 5 of 6 horses with mean ± standard deviation of 4.87 ± 4.46 ng/mL. Morphine was detected in the serum of 5 of 6 horses at varying time points. Maximum systemic concentration reached in a single horse was 6.98 ng/mL.

Here we studied the coevolutionary development of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and cardiac myocytes representing the major target cells of CVB3 in the heart in a newly established persistently CVB3-infected murine cardiac myocyte cell line, HL-1(CVB3). CVB3 persistence in HL-1(CVB3) cells represented a typical carrier-state infection with high levels (10(6) to 10(8) PFU/ml) of infectious virus produced from only a small proportion (approximately 10%) of infected cells. CVB3 persistence was characterized by the evolution of a CVB3 variant (CVB3-HL1) that displayed strongly increased cytotoxicity in the naive HL-1 cell line and showed increased replication rates in cultured primary cardiac myocytes of mouse, rat, and naive HL-1 cells in vitro, whereas it was unable to establish murine cardiac infection in vivo. Resistance of HL-1(CVB3) cells to CVB3-HL1 was associated with reduction of coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) expression. Decreasing host cell CAR expression was partially overcome by the CVB3-HL1 variant through CAR-independent entry into resistant cells. Moreover, CVB3-HL1 conserved the ability to infect cells via CAR. The employment of a soluble CAR variant resulted in the complete cure of HL-1(CVB3) cells with respect to the adapted virus. In conclusion, this is the first report of a CVB3 carrier-state infection in a cardiomyocyte cell line, revealing natural coevolution of CAR downregulation with CAR-independent viral entry in resistant host cells as an important mechanism of induction of CVB3 persistence.","Pinkert, Sandra; Klingel, Karin; Lindig, Vanessa; Dörner, Andrea; Zeichhardt, Heinz; Spiller, O Brad; Fechner, Henry",Journal of virology,511,12

As E is essential for the production of infectious progeny but dispensable for assembly and release of virus-like particles, it probably mediates virus entry into cells, putatively in concert with the GP2b/GP3/GP4 complex. The E protein contains a central hydrophobic domain and a conserved potential site for N-terminal myristoylation, a hydrophobic modification usually pivotal for membrane targeting of the modified protein. Here, it was shown by radiolabelling that E is myristoylated at glycine-2, both in transfected cells as a fusion protein with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and in virus particles. Biochemical fractionation revealed that E-YFP with an inactivated acylation site was still completely membrane-bound, indicating that the putative transmembrane domain of E mediates membrane targeting. Confocal microscopy showed that both myristoylated and non-myristoylated E-YFP were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, the membranes from which EAV buds. The presence of a myristoylation inhibitor during replication of EAV, whilst completely blocking E acylation, reduced virus titres by 1.5 log(10). Similarly, a mutant EAV with non-myristoylatable E grew to a titre five- to sevenfold lower than that of the wild-type virus and exhibited a reduced plaque size. Western blotting of cell-culture supernatants showed that N and M, the major structural proteins of EAV, are released in similar amounts by cells transfected with wild-type and mutant genomes. Thus, E myristoylation is not required for budding of particles and probably has a function during virus entry.","Thaa, Bastian; Kabatek, Aleksander; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Snijder, Eric J; Herrmann, Andreas; Veit, Michael",The Journal of general virology,511,20

Approaches to virtual care that are successful for people without IDD may need to be adapted for adults with IDD. OBJECTIVE The aim of this scoping review was to examine what is known about virtual health care for adults with IDD and in particular, the impact of virtual delivery on access to care for this population. METHODS A comprehensive search was conducted of the academic and grey literature. A two-stage screening process was conducted by two independent reviewers and a structured data extraction template was populated for each included study. Findings were analyzed thematically using Access to Care Framework domains. RESULTS In total, 22 studies met inclusion criteria. The majority were published in the past three years and focused on specialized IDD services. A subset of 12 studies reported findings on access to care for adults with IDD. Participants generally reported high acceptability of virtual care, though some preferred face-to-face encounters. Initial results on effectiveness were positive, though limited by small sample sizes. Challenges included internet quality and technical skill or comfort. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests that it is possible to deliver accessible, high quality virtual care for adults with IDD, however, relatively little research has been conducted on this topic.

DESIGN Controlled application of increased intra-abdominal pressure at two positive end-expiratory pressure levels (1 and 10 cm H2O) in an anesthetized porcine model of controlled ventilation. SETTING Large animal laboratory of a university-affiliated hospital. SUBJECTS Eleven deeply anesthetized swine (weight 46.2 ± 6.2 kg). INTERVENTIONS Air-regulated intra-abdominal hypertension (0-25 mm Hg). MEASUREMENTS Esophageal pressure, tidal compliance, bladder pressure, and end-expiratory lung aeration by gas dilution. MAIN RESULTS Functional residual capacity was significantly reduced by increasing intra-abdominal pressure at both positive end-expiratory pressure levels (p ≤ 0.0001) without corresponding changes of end-expiratory esophageal pressure. Above intra-abdominal pressure 5 mm Hg, plateau airway pressure increased linearly by ~ 50% of the applied intra-abdominal pressure value, associated with commensurate changes of esophageal pressure. With tidal volume held constant, negligible changes occurred in transpulmonary pressure due to intra-abdominal pressure. Driving pressures calculated from airway pressures alone (plateau airway pressure--positive end-expiratory pressure) did not equate to those computed from transpulmonary pressure (tidal changes in transpulmonary pressure). Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure shifted the predominantly negative end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure at positive end-expiratory pressure 1 cm H2O (mean -3.5 ± 0.4 cm H2O) into the positive range at positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H2O (mean 0.58 ± 1.2 cm H2O). CONCLUSIONS Despite its insensitivity to changes in functional residual capacity, measuring transpulmonary pressure may be helpful in explaining how different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure influence recruitment and collapse during tidal ventilation in the presence of increased intra-abdominal pressure and in calculating true transpulmonary driving pressure (tidal changes of transpulmonary pressure). Traditional interpretations of respiratory mechanics based on unmodified airway pressure were misleading regarding lung behavior in this setting.","Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Gard, Kenneth E; Adams, Alexander B; Faltesek, Katherine A; Anderson, Christopher P; Dries, David J; Marini, John J",Critical care medicine,511,1

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PsychExtra, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for any paper from 2019 onwards that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on imprisoned people and prison staff. A grey literature search focused on international and government sources and professional bodies representing healthcare, public health and prison staff was also performed. We also performed hand searching of the reference lists of included studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES All papers, regardless of study design, were included if they examined the mental health of imprisoned people or prison staff specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Imprisoned people could be of any age and from any countries. All languages were included. Two independent reviewers quality assessed appropriate papers. RESULTS Of 647 articles found, 83 were eligible for inclusion, the majority (58%) of which were opinion pieces. The articles focused on the challenges to prisoner mental health. Fear of COVID-19, the impact of isolation, discontinuation of prison visits and reduced mental health services were all likely to have an adverse effect on the mental well-being of imprisoned people. The limited research and poor quality of articles included mean that the findings are not conclusive. However, they suggest a significant adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of those who live and work in prisons.

In 1881, Felix Semon proposed that this phenomenon was due to a selective injury of nerve fibers supplying the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) and supported this with postmortem proof of selective PCA atrophy. In recent decades, evidence has emerged that the RLN regenerates after injury but does not always result in useful motion of the vocal folds. It has been proposed that this is caused by laryngeal synkinesis. Laryngeal synkinesis describes a random distribution of regenerated nerve fibers to opposing vocal fold muscles. This study was conducted to clarify the relative contribution of these two potential pathomechanisms in our patient population. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case analysis. METHODS Retrospective analysis of laryngeal EMG results from cases with RLN paralysis of at least 6 months duration seen at our neurolaryngology clinic. RESULTS Out of 118 PCA EMGs, there was not a single normal or near-normal tracing, whilst 33.3% of TA EMGs indicated normal or near normal innervation. PCA EMGs showed signs of persistent high-grade partial denervation (41.5%) as a sign of atrophy, moderate or strong synkinesis (21.2%), or a combination of both (37.3%). CONCLUSIONS In chronic RLN paralysis the intrinsic laryngeal muscles are affected to different extents either by atrophy or synkinesis or a combination of both. The PCA is always affected. The lesser damage to TA innervation explains the commonly seen maintenance of vocal fold muscle bulk.

The SNPs rs17111495 and rs17843626 were significantly associated with FGF23 level, with the former near PCSK9 gene and the latter near HLA-DQA1 gene (P = 1.04 × 10-10 and 1.80 × 10-8 respectively). SNP rs2798631, located within the TGFB2 gene, was suggestively associated with serum FGF23 level (P = 4.97 × 10-7). Additional adjustment for BMI yielded similar results. For FGF23, further adjustment for eGFR had similar results. We conducted the first GWAS of circulating FGF21 levels to date. Novel candidate genetic loci associated with circulating FGF21 or FGF23 levels were found. Further replication and functional studies are needed to support our findings.","Chuang, Gwo-Tsann; Liu, Pi-Hua; Chyan, Tsui-Wei; Huang, Chen-Hao; Huang, Yu-Yao; Lin, Chia-Hung; Lin, Jou-Wei; Hsu, Chih-Neng; Tsai, Ru-Yi; Hsieh, Meng-Lun; Lee, Hsiao-Lin; Yang, Wei-Shun; Robinson-Cohen, Cassianne; Hsiung, Chia-Ni; Shen, Chen-Yang; Chang, Yi-Cheng",Scientific reports,511,16

Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation.","Liu, Piper Liping; Huang, Lei Vincent","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",511,31

The effect of directionality of the program was also explored. METHODS A systematic search was conducted using multiple databases. Inclusion criteria were systematic review of text message programs for adults with T2DM, evaluated A1C, and English language. Quality assessment was completed using AMSTAR-2 guidelines. Data were extracted by multiple coders, and results were synthesized. RESULTS The final sample included 9 systematic reviews published between 2011 and 2019, with 72 unique international studies. Text message programs focused on diabetes self-management and reducing health risks through educational and motivational content with some providing personalized feedback. A meta-analysis of program effect on A1C was conducted in 5 reviews with a pooled difference in A1C from -0.38% to -0.8%. Adults with T2DM of shorter duration and lower A1C had better treatment effects. Evidence on unidirectional versus bidirectional programs is conflicting; however, both improve outcomes. Evidence of text message programs targeting medication engagement was inconclusive. Some programs improved blood pressure, lipids, self-management, self-efficacy, and health behaviors. High satisfaction and an average of 9.6% to 18.7% attrition was reported. CONCLUSIONS Text messaging programs can improve T2DM outcomes, are a highly accessible mode of communication, are relatively inexpensive, and are an underutilized adjunct to clinical care.","Whittemore, Robin; Siverly, Lauren; Wischik, Dora Lendvai; Whitehouse, Christina R",The Diabetes educator,511,1

PPMO complementary to the Junín virus genome were designed to interfere with viral RNA synthesis or translation or both. However, only PPMO designed to potentially interfere with translation were effective in reducing virus replication. PPMO complementary to sequences that are highly conserved across the arenaviruses and located at the 5' termini of both genomic segments were effective against Junín virus, Tacaribe virus, Pichinde virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected cell cultures and suppressed viral titers in the livers of LCMV-infected mice.

TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2 O3 , are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224 - 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s-1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one-time passwords, which is ideal for the internet-of-everything. The superior stability of the h-BN-based TRNG is related to the presence of few-atoms-wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h-BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.","Wen, Chao; Li, Xuehua; Zanotti, Tommaso; Puglisi, Francesco Maria; Shi, Yuanyuan; Saiz, Fernan; Antidormi, Aleandro; Roche, Stephan; Zheng, Wenwen; Liang, Xianhu; Hu, Jiaxin; Duhm, Steffen; Roldan, Juan B; Wu, Tianru; Chen, Victoria; Pop, Eric; Garrido, Blas; Zhu, Kaichen; Hui, Fei; Lanza, Mario",Advanced materials,511,1

The aims of this study were to: (i) determine the independent contributions of body mass, force production capabilities and tendon dimensions to tendon stiffness during childhood; and (ii) descriptively document age-related changes in tendon mechanical properties and dimensions. Achilles tendon mechanical and material properties were determined in 52 children (5-12 years) and 19 adults. Tendon stiffness and Young's modulus (YM) were calculated as the slopes of the force-elongation and stress-strain curves, respectively. Relationships between stiffness vs. age, mass and force, and between YM vs. age, mass and stress were determined by means of polynomial fits and multiple regression analyses. Mass was found to be the best predictor of stiffness, whilst stress was best related to YM (< 75 and 51% explained variance, respectively). Combined, mass and force accounted for up to 78% of stiffness variation. Up to 61% of YM variability could be explained using a combination of mass, stress and age. These results demonstrate that age-related increases in tendon stiffness are largely attributable to increased tendon loading from weight-bearing tasks and increased plantarflexor force production, as well as tendon growth. Moreover, our results suggest that chronic increases in tendon loading during childhood result in microstructural changes which increase the tendon's YM. Regarding the second aim, peak stress increased from childhood to adulthood due to greater increases in strength than tendon cross-sectional area. Peak strain remained constant as a result of parallel increases in tendon length and peak elongation. The differences in Achilles tendon properties found between adults and children are likely to influence force production, and ultimately movement characteristics, which should be explicitly examined in future research.","Waugh, C M; Blazevich, A J; Fath, F; Korff, T",Journal of anatomy,511,12

Data on patient demographics, perioperative data and tumor histology were collected and further analyzed statistically. RESULTS Each group consisted of 15 patients. Baseline characteristics were comparable in each group. When compared to LTPN, LRPN was associated with significantly shorter operative time (OT) (115 min versus 199 min, p < 0.05). No significant differences were detected in the other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS LRPN is associated with a significantly shorter OT compared to LTPN for posterior cT1 RMs. Both surgical approaches are safe, feasible and credible, demonstrating optimal results.","Ferakis, Nikolaos; Katsimantas, Antonios; Charalampogiannis, Nikolaos; Paparidis, Spyridon; Rassweiler, Jens Jochen; Gozen, Ali Serdar","Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",511,1

METHOD In this single group multi-site feasibility study, trained, supervised non-clinically qualified graduates (facilitators) delivered NIDUS-Family to family carer and people living with dementia dyads. We recruited participants from GP practices and memory services in London and Bradford. We completed quantitative outcomes pre- and post-intervention; and conducted qualitative interviews with participants and facilitators. Our pre-specified main outcomes were proportion of potential participants approached who agreed to participate, intervention adherence and acceptability to family carers, and facilitator fidelity to the manual. RESULTS We recruited 16 dyads (57% of those approached); 12 (75%) completed the intervention. Of 12 participants rating intervention acceptability, 9 (75%) agreed or strongly agreed that it had helped; 2 (18%) neither agreed nor disagreed and 1 (8%) disagreed. Mean facilitator fidelity was high (81.5%). Dyads set on average 3.9 goals; these most commonly related to getting out and about and increasing activity/hobby participation (n = 10); carer wellbeing (n = 6), managing physical complaints (n = 6); meal preparation/cooking (n = 5); and reducing irritability, frustration or aggression (n = 5). Almost all secondary outcomes changed in a direction indicating improvement.

Whether vitamin D3 supplementation reduces severe childhood asthma exacerbations is unclear. Objective To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation improves the time to a severe exacerbation in children with asthma and low vitamin D levels. Design, Setting, and Participants The Vitamin D to Prevent Severe Asthma Exacerbations (VDKA) Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin D3 supplementation to improve the time to severe exacerbations in high-risk children with asthma aged 6 to 16 years taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids and with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. Participants were recruited from 7 US centers. Enrollment started in February 2016, with a goal of 400 participants; the trial was terminated early (March 2019) due to futility, and follow-up ended in September 2019. Interventions Participants were randomized to vitamin D3, 4000 IU/d (n = 96), or placebo (n = 96) for 48 weeks and maintained with fluticasone propionate, 176 μg/d (6-11 years old), or 220 μg/d (12-16 years old). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. Secondary outcomes included the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants in whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced halfway through the trial, and the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Results Among 192 randomized participants (mean age, 9.8 years; 77 girls [40%]), 180 (93.8%) completed the trial. A total of 36 participants (37.5%) in the vitamin D3 group and 33 (34.4%) in the placebo group had 1 or more severe exacerbations. Compared with placebo, vitamin D3 supplementation did not significantly improve the time to a severe exacerbation: the mean time to exacerbation was 240 days in the vitamin D3 group vs 253 days in the placebo group (mean group difference, -13.1 days [95% CI, -42.6 to 16.4]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.85]; P = .63). Vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, likewise did not significantly improve the time to a viral-induced severe exacerbation, the proportion of participants whose dose of inhaled corticosteroid was reduced, or the cumulative fluticasone dose during the trial. Serious adverse events were similar in both groups (vitamin D3 group, n = 11; placebo group, n = 9). Conclusions and Relevance Among children with persistent asthma and low vitamin D levels, vitamin D3 supplementation, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve the time to a severe asthma exacerbation. The findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 supplementation to prevent severe asthma exacerbations in this group of patients.

Results: After the COVID-19 lockdown in National Health Service Forth Valley, Emergency Eye Care Treatment Centers have been set up where optometrists are the first point of contact for patients in the community. Live teleophthalmology link has enabled the optometrist in the community to connect directly with local ophthalmologists. From March 23 to June 15, 2020, five referrals were taken for a suspected retinal detachment, and one for submacular hemorrhage.

On the molecular level, the modification of serine residues requires a composite active site formed by PARP1 or PARP2 together with a specificity-determining factor, HPF1; this represents a new paradigm not only for PARPs but generally for post-translational modification (PTM) catalysis.

Compelling links between diet and the gut microbiome suggest key roles for various macronutrients, including lipids, yet how individual classes of dietary lipids interact with the microbiome remains largely unknown. Sphingolipids are bioactive components of most foods and are also produced by prominent gut microbes. This makes sphingolipids intriguing candidates for shaping diet-microbiome interactions. Here, we used a click chemistry-based approach to track the incorporation of bioorthogonal dietary omega-alkynyl sphinganine (sphinganine alkyne [SAA]) into the murine gut microbial community (Bioorthogonal labeling). We identified microbial and SAA-specific metabolic products through fluorescence-based sorting of SAA-containing microbes (Sort), 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the sphingolipid-interacting microbes (Seq), and comparative metabolomics to identify products of SAA assimilation by the microbiome (Spec). Together, this approach, termed Bioorthogonal labeling-Sort-Seq-Spec (BOSSS), revealed that SAA assimilation is nearly exclusively performed by gut Bacteroides, indicating that sphingolipid-producing bacteria play a major role in processing dietary sphinganine. Comparative metabolomics of cecal microbiota from SAA-treated mice revealed conversion of SAA to a suite of dihydroceramides, consistent with metabolic activities of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Additionally, other sphingolipid-interacting microbes were identified with a focus on an uncharacterized ability of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium to metabolize dietary sphingolipids. We conclude that BOSSS provides a platform to study the flux of virtually any alkyne-labeled metabolite in diet-microbiome interactions.","Lee, Min-Ting; Le, Henry H; Johnson, Elizabeth L",Journal of lipid research,511,28

Surgical correction is the standard treatment for lumbar hernia, and either an open or laparoscopic procedure can be performed with equivalent success. However, open repairs are most commonly performed. Here, we present a case of a primary lumbar hernia that was successfully treated laparoscopically and discuss surgical modalities of treatment reported in the literature. There are two laparoscopic approaches: transabdominal and extraperitoneal. The main advantage of the laparoscopic approach is that it helps the surgeon to precisely locate and evaluate the characteristics of the defect. It also has a lower morbidity rate, shorter length of hospital stay, less postoperative pain, and an earlier return to daily routine activities than the open approach. In the present study, a patient with a superior lumbar hernia was treated laparoscopically by the transabdominal approach. Laparoscopic repair in such cases is feasible and achieves a good result when done by an experienced laparoscopic hernia surgeon.","Sarwal, Ankush; Sharma, Anil; Khullar, Rajesh; Soni, Vandana; Baijal, Manish; Chowbey, Pradeep",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,511,30

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that supine positioning for open repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures would be safe, with low wound and neurologic complication rates. METHODS Supine position safety in acute Achilles tendon repair was investigated. Consecutive cases of supine Achilles tendon surgical repair performed by one surgeon from 2010 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were included if they were surgically treated with primary repair in the supine position within 15 days of injury and did not undergo concomitant surgery. A paramedian incision 1 cm medial to the Achilles sheath was used. Initial chart review identified 161 patients who underwent any type of Achilles tendon surgery in the supine position, of whom 45 patients met the inclusion criteria. This group included 39 men and 6 women with an average age of 41 years (range, 20-66 years). Median length of follow-up was 116 days (range, 25-1,589 days). Average body mass index was 29 kg/m2 (range, 23-36 kg/m2). RESULTS There were no infections, sural nerve injuries, or reruptures.

Guanylate-binding proteins (GBP) belong to interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases and defend the mammalian cell interior against diverse invasive pathogens. Previously, we identified five tree shrew GBP genes (tGBP1, tGBP2, tGBP4, tGBP5, and tGBP7) and found that tGBP1 showed antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and type 1 herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infections. Here, we showed that the anti-VSV activity of tGBP1 was independent of its GTPase activity and isoprenylation. In response to VSV infection, instead of regulating IFN expression and autophagy, tGBP1 competed with the VSV nucleocapsid (N) protein in binding to the VSV phosphoprotein (VSV-P), leading to the repression of the primary transcription of the VSV genome. These observations constitute the first report of the potential mechanism underlying the inhibition of VSV by GBP1.","Gu, Tianle; Yu, Dandan; Xu, Ling; Yao, Yu-Lin; Zheng, Xiao; Yao, Yong-Gang",Cytokine,511,16

Expectancy and value are important components of the MCT. This study aimed to analyze sociodemographic and academic factors related to MCT in Chilean nursing students. This study is an analytical-correlational, cross-sectional study conducted with 478 nursing students in Chile. The data were collected using an online questionnaire. The Critical Thinking Motivation Scale was used to measure MCT. Pearson's square, Chi-square, means comparison test, and binomial logistic regression were used to analyze the data. The expectancy component of the MCT had the lowest scores on the scale. Age was associated with the cost subcomponent (p < .03), and high school was associated with the interest subcomponent (p < .01). Academic factors contributing to MCT were problem-based learning, professor motivation, and the inclusion of MCT in nursing disciplinary subjects. Strategies that improve CT and MCT should be implemented and evaluated periodically from the beginning of a nursing career.

Both the microbial turnover time (MTT) and metabolic efficiency are closely related to RPE. However, changes in MTT, metabolic efficiency and RPE in response to nitrogen (N) fertilization at different levels and the associations between these factors during plant growth are unknown. The effects of N fertilization at different levels (0, 150 and 300 kg N ha-1) on RPE and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in maize (Zea mays L.) grown in paddy soil using a 13Carbon (C) natural abundance method. The RPE varied from -1.49 to 15.93 mg C kg-1 soil day-1, with significant effects at different levels of N fertilization, growth stages and interactions between these factors. Nitrogen fertilization reduced microbial C:N imbalance and soil pH. During the plant growth periods, the RPE was initially low because the microbes preferentially utilized plant-derived C, but later increased due to trade-offs between microbial N acquisition and acidity stress alleviation under N fertilization. The soil microbes altered their MTT and metabolic efficiency with changes in the microbial community structure to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis and adapt to acidity stress. RPE was lowest whereas MTT and metabolic efficiency were highest with N fertilization at 150 kg N ha-1. Changes in MTT and metabolic efficiency explained 84.5% of the variations in the RPE, and the latter had greater impact (55.8%) than the former (28.7%). Changes in MTT and metabolic efficiency to cope with microbial resource acquisition and acidity stress under N fertilization represent an important pathway for RPE regulation in paddy soil. These findings highlight the significance of MTT and metabolic efficiency in RPE regulation for optimization of the N fertilization level to mitigate soil C losses.","Chen, Pengfei; Mo, Chaoyang; He, Chao; Cui, Hao; Lin, Jingdong; Yang, Jingping",The Science of the total environment,511,1

The sgRNA is introduced to the CRISPRa/i plasmids from a double stranded oligonucleotide by in vivo homology-directed repair, allowing rapid transcriptional modulation of new target genes without cloning. The CRISPRa/i toolkit was characterized by alteration of expression of fluorescent protein-encoding genes under two different promoters allowing expression alterations up to ~ 2.5-fold. Furthermore, we demonstrated the usability of the CRISPRa/i toolkit by improving the tolerance towards wheat straw hydrolysate of our industrial production strain.

This highlight summarizes our continuing efforts towards the effective utilization of renewable resources for new chemicals, fuels and soft materials, and selected successful stories in that direction.

These soft architectures were fully characterized by using different techniques. In another example, amygdalin, a by-product of the apricot industry, was used to develop novel amphiphiles, which showed unprecedented gelation properties in a wide range of solvents. To take these soft nanomaterials to a second level, we successfully demonstrated the utility of these hydrogels as drug delivery vehicles.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), the current standard of care, has a high failure rate. High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has potential additional benefits such as CO 2 clearance, the ability to communicate and comfort. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine whether HFNT in AT2RF improves 1) PaCO 2, 2) clinical and patient-centred outcomes and 3) to assess potential harms. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (January 1999-January 2021). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing HFNT with low flow nasal oxygen (LFO) or NIV were included. Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias. We used Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and Ottawa-Newcastle scale for cohort studies. Results: From 727 publications reviewed, four RCTs and one cohort study (n=425) were included. In three trials of HFNT vs NIV, comparing PaCO 2 (kPa) at last follow-up time point, there was a significant reduction at four hours (1 RCT; HFNT median 6.7, IQR 5.6 - 7.7 vs NIV median 7.6, IQR 6.3 - 9.3) and no significant difference at 24-hours or five days. Comparing HFNT with LFO, there was no significant difference at 30-minutes. There was no difference in intubation or mortality. Conclusions: This review identified a small number of studies with low to very low certainty of evidence. A reduction of PaCO 2 at an early time point of four hours post-intervention was demonstrated in one small RCT. Significant limitations of the included studies were lack of adequately powered outcomes and clinically relevant time-points and small sample size. Accordingly, systematic review cannot recommend the use of HFNT as the initial management strategy for AT2RF and trials adequately powered to detect clinical and patient-relevant outcomes are urgently warranted.","Alnajada, Asem Abdulaziz; Blackwood, Bronagh; Mobrad, Abdulmajeed; Akhtar, Adeel; Pavlov, Ivan; Shyamsundar, Murali",F1000Research,511,22

Goal-directed therapy has been shown to improve outcomes when commenced in the early postoperative period, yet the economic impact remains unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the cost effectiveness of goal-directed therapy as part of postoperative management. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine short and long term clinical and financial benefits. A decision tree was constructed to determine short-term ""in-hospital"" costs, based on outcome data derived from a previous study. For a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis, we created a simulation model to estimate life expectancy (quality-adjusted) and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of major noncardiac surgical patients. Cost and outcome comparisons were made between postoperative goal-directed therapy and best standard therapy and described as cost/hospital survivor and cost/patient for the short-term analysis and as incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year for the long-term model. One-way, multiway, and probabilistic analyses were performed to address uncertainties in the model input values, and results were presented graphically in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. SETTING Simulation of a tertiary care department in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS A hypothetical cohort of high risk surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS Patients undergoing high-risk surgery were stratified to receive goal-directed therapy or standard best practice to improve tissue oxygenation in the postoperative setting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In our short-term model, goal-directed therapy decreased costs by £2,631.77/patient and by £2,134.86/hospital survivor. The most sensitive variables were relative risk of complication and length of stay. When assuming the worst-case scenario (prolonged ICU and in-hospital stay, highest complication costs, and maximum cost for monitoring), goal-directed therapy still achieved cost savings (£471.70). Our findings also predict that goal-directed therapy not only prolongs quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.83 yr or 9.8 mo) but also leads to incremental cost savings over a lifetime projection of £1,285.77, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of - £1,542.16/quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION The implementation of goal-directed therapy is both clinical and cost-effective. Additional implementation expenditures can be offset by savings due to reduced costs accrued from a reduction in complication rates and hospital length of stay. We conclude that goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to clinical and financial outcomes.","Ebm, Claudia; Cecconi, Maurizio; Sutton, Les; Rhodes, Andrew",Critical care medicine,511,33

Placental pathology in the setting of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains a topic of great interest as earlier studies have shown mixed results. OBJECTIVE -To ascertain whether maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with any specific placental histopathology, and to evaluate the virus's propensity for direct placental involvement. DESIGN -Placentas from 65 women with polymerase chain reaction-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent histologic evaluation using Amsterdam consensus group criteria and terminology. Another 85 placentas from women without SARS-CoV-2 constituted the negative control group. Sixty-four of the placentas from the SARS-CoV-2-positive group underwent immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. RESULTS -Pathologic findings were divided into maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, chronic inflammatory lesions, amniotic fluid infection sequence, increased perivillous fibrin, intervillous thrombi, increased subchorionic fibrin, meconium-laden macrophages within fetal membranes, and chorangiosis. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of any specific placental histopathology between the SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative groups.

Fifteen patients with colorectal liver metastases were measured twice with a T1 weighted multislice 2D FLASH sequence for DCE-MRI (time resolution 1.2 s). AIFs were automatically derived from contrast inflow in the aorta of each patient. Thereafter, SSIM identified motion corrupted images of the liver were removed from the DCE dataset. From this corrected data set Ktrans and its reproducibility were determined. Using the SSIM algorithm a median fraction of 46% (range 37-50%) of the liver images in DCE time series was labeled as motion distorted. Rejection of these images resulted in a significantly lower median Ktrans (p < 0.05) and lower coefficient of repeatability of Ktrans in liver metastases compared with an analysis without correction. SSIM correction improves the reproducibility of the DCE-MRI parameter Ktrans in liver metastasis and reduces contamination of Ktrans values of lesions by that of surrounding normal liver tissue.","Ter Voert, Edwin E G W; Heijmen, Linda; Punt, Cornelis J A; de Wilt, Johannes H W; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; Heerschap, Arend",NMR in biomedicine,511,1

This study sought to establish efficacy of a mindfulness-based group intervention for adolescents with mixed mental health disorders. METHOD One hundred and eight adolescents (ages 13-18) were recruited from community mental health clinics and randomised into two groups (control vs. treatment). All participants received treatment-as-usual (TAU) from clinic-based therapists independent of the study. Adolescents in the treatment condition received TAU plus a 5-week mindfulness-training programme (TAU+Mi); adolescents in the control group received only TAU. Assessments including parent/carer reports were conducted at baseline, postintervention and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS At postintervention, adolescents in the mindfulness condition experienced significant decrease in mental distress (measured with the DASS-21) compared to the control group (Cohen's d = 0.43), and these gains were enhanced at 3-month follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.78). Overall outcomes at 3 months showed significant improvement for adolescents in the mindfulness condition; in self-esteem, mindfulness, psychological inflexibility and mental health, but not resilience. Parents/carers also reported significant improvement in their adolescent's psychological functioning (using the CBCL). Mediation analyses concluded mindfulness mediated mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Increase in mindful awareness after training leads to improvement in mental health and this is consistent with mindfulness theory.

Little research is performed to investigate the relevant mechanism mediated by HuR to promote the progress of ovarian cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was retrieved to calculate the correlation between HuR and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 44 (TIMM44) expression. HuR expression plasmid, TIMM44 expression plasmid, siRNA HuR, and TIMM44 siRNAs were further transfected into A2780 and SKOV3 cells. The 3'UTR of TIMM44 fragment was cloned into the back of Renilla luciferase in the pSicheck2 dual fluorescent reporter to indicate the interaction between HuR and TIMM44. Cell count and MTT assay were performed to assay the proliferation ability of A2780 and SKOV3 cells. High-level HuR expression in 56 ovarian cancer patients recruited in Zibo Central Hospital was positively correlated with metastasis status and poor prognosis revealed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Both HuR and TIMM44 can promote the proliferation of SKOV3 and A2780 cells. A high correlation of HuR and TIMM44 expression was testified in the TCGA data. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that HuR could bind to TIMM44 to maintain the mRNA stability. TIMM44 siRNA administration inhibited the proliferation of SKOV3 cells, which could not be rescued. All of these indicate that the main function of HuR on ovarian cancer proliferation is mediated by TIMM44 through mRNA stability regulation, and HuR/TIMM44 complex can be used as a target to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.","Yu, Xiaohui; Li, Yujiao; Ding, Yumei; Zhang, Hong; Ding, Ning; Lu, Ming",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,511,29

We report an outbreak of influenza A H3N2 in a vaccinated population of adults in the Regional Virology Laboratory in Glasgow. This investigation was carried out to confirm the epidemiological link between cases. METHODS AND RESULTS Staff with clinical symptoms of influenza-like illness were included. Samples were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Staff were interviewed to obtain information regarding symptom onset and vaccination status. Eight confirmed cases and six clinically diagnosed cases were reported, which all occurred within 4 days of a lunchtime Christmas quiz. The eight samples subtyped as H3 virus. The haemagglutinin gene in the confirmed cases was sequenced and shown to be identical. Most of the attendees had been immunised against influenza with the same vaccine batch at least 6 weeks earlier. CONCLUSION This outbreak appears to have been an isolated incident, which arose due to a social event that provided the ideal conditions for transmission of a respiratory disease. It may have been compounded by low-vaccine effectiveness this season. Sequence data supported the epidemiological link.","Bradley-Stewart, A; Miller, R S; Maclean, A; Aitken, C; Whittaker, L; Gregory, V; Daniels, R; Gunson, R",Scottish medical journal,511,25

During the surgery, the gross quality of the seal, the stickiness of the forceps to the tissues, bleeding/oozing from the stump and the need for a subsequent application in already severed spermatic cord were assessed for haemostasis quality. After surgery, physical parameters (appearance of the mucous membranes, quality of the peripheral pulse, heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and blood dripping from the incisions), haematology or packed cell volume and total protein were monitored to assess signs of bleeding or any other condition. For cleanliness and asepsis assessment, signs of surgical infection were recorded. Complications during surgery were mild degree of sticking of the LSA forceps to the tissues and dulling of the blade. There was no need to reapply LSA a second time except in one horse. This means a haemostasis complication rate of 2.85 per cent of the horses. No postoperative bleeding was detected. Only two horses with fever had associated signs of surgical site infection.

Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) is a viable and safe technique; however, there are no single-institution studies comparing outcomes of SILC for colon cancer with well-established minimally invasive techniques. We evaluated the short-term outcomes following SILC for cancer compared to a group of well-established minimally invasive techniques. Methods. Fifty consecutive patients who underwent SILC for colon cancer were compared to a control group composed of 50 cases of minimally invasive colectomies performed with either conventional multiport or hand-assisted laparoscopic technique. The groups were paired based on the type of procedure. Demographics, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes were assessed. Results. With the exception of BMI, demographics were similar between both groups. Most of the procedures were right colectomies (n = 33) and anterior resections (n = 12). There were no significant differences in operative time (127.9 versus 126.7 min), conversions (0 versus 1), complications (14% versus 8%), length of stay (4.5 versus 4.0 days), readmissions (2% versus 2%), and reoperations (2% versus 2%). Oncological outcomes were also similar between groups. Conclusions. SILC is an oncologically sound alternative for the management of colon cancer and results in similar short-term outcomes as compared with well-established minimally invasive techniques.","Pedraza, Rodrigo; Aminian, Ali; Nieto, Javier; Faraj, Chadi; Pickron, T Bartley; Haas, Eric M",Minimally invasive surgery,511,31

Risk factors associated with unfavourable outcome were assessed. 3113 consecutive patients with disorders of vertigo and dizziness were recruited prospectively between March 2010 and February 2012. Patients were clinically assessed and treated according to their diagnosis. Standardized instruments were used at baseline and at 2-year follow-up [Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Quality of Life Questionnaire, General Depression Scale, Stait-Trait Anxiety Index], as well as a custom health-related questionnaire. The primary outcome variable of this observational study was the change in DHI after 2 years. Patients suffered from phobic postural vertigo (23%), benign peripheral paroxysmal vertigo (14.4%), unilateral vestibulopathy (10.5%), central vestibular disorders (8%), Menière's disease (9.8%), vestibular migraine (6.9%), bilateral vestibulopathy (5.5%), and vestibular paroxysmia (3.1%). Mean disease duration was 4.6 ± 6.3 years. 1272 patients were available for follow-up, 1159 completed the DHI score. 72.1% of patients improved in DHI score from baseline to 2 years follow-up. Mean reduction in DHI score was 14 points (p = 0.02). Long-term outcome following diagnosis and treatment in a specialized tertiary care centre is good and persistent after 2 years. Risk factors for an unfavourable outcome were advanced age, severe disability, constant vertigo or dizziness, and concomitant back pain, while depression and anxiety did not contribute to this risk considerably.","Obermann, Mark; Bock, Eva; Sabev, Nikolay; Lehmann, Nils; Weber, Ralph; Gerwig, Marcus; Frings, Markus; Arweiler-Harbeck, Diana; Lang, Stephan; Diener, Hans-Christoph",Journal of neurology,511,29

An investigation is taking place to understand the cases and their triggers. The vaccine will be administered to a large number of individuals worldwide and concerns raised for severe adverse events might occur. With the current information, the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) states its position for the following preliminary recommendations that are to be revised as soon as more data emerges. To minimize the risk of severe allergic reactions in vaccinated individuals, it is urgently required to understand the specific nature of the reported severe allergic reactions, including the background medical history of the individuals affected and the mechanisms involved. To achieve this goal all clinical and laboratory information should be collected and reported. Mild and moderate allergic patients should not be excluded from the vaccine as the exclusion of all these patients from vaccination may have a significant impact on reaching the goal of population immunity. Health care practitioners vaccinating against COVID-19 are required to be sufficiently prepared to recognise and treat anaphylaxis properly with the ability to administer adrenaline. A mandatory observation period after vaccine administration of at least 15 minutes for all individuals should be followed. The current data has not shown any higher risk for patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or asthma and this message should be clearly stated by physicians to give our patients trust. The benefit of the vaccination clearly outweighs the risk of severe COVID-19 development including the more than 30% of the population suffering from allergic diseases.","Klimek, Ludger; Jutel, Marek; Akdis, Cezmi A; Bousquet, Jean; Akdis, Mübeccel; Torres-Jaen, Maria; Agache, Ioana; Canonica, Giorgio W; Del Giacco, Stefano; O'Mahony, Liam; Shamji, Mohamed H; Pawankar, Ruby; Untersmayr, Eva; Ring, Johannes; Bedbrook, Anna; Worm, Margitta; Zuberbier, Torsten",Allergy,511,1

The predictors of TMIP after LSD remain unclear. The aim of this prospective study was to explore the predictive and risk factors for TMIP after LSD in cirrhotic patients with PH caused only by hepatitis B virus. METHODS From September 2014 to March 2017, we enrolled 115 patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis and PH who successfully underwent LSD. Patients were subdivided into a TMIP group and a non-TMIP group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted on 24 items of demographic and preoperative data, to explore the risk factors of TMIP. RESULTS Twenty-nine (25.22%) patients developed TMIP on postoperative day (POD) 7 and 26 (22.81%) patients developed TMIP on POD 30. From POD 7 to POD 30, 12 patients who did not have TMIP at POD 7 were newly diagnosed with TMIP, with portal vein diameter 15.05 ± 2.58 mm. Another 14 patients in whom TMIP had resolved had portal vein diameter 14.02 ± 1.76 mm. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression revealed that portal vein diameter ≥ 13 mm [relative risk (RR) 5.533, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.222-25.042; P = 0.026] and portal vein diameter ≥ 15 mm (RR 3.636, 95% CI 1.466-9.021; P = 0.005) were significant independent risk factors for TMIP on POD 7 and 30, respectively. CONCLUSION Portal vein diameter ≥ 13 mm and ≥ 15 mm were significant independent predictors for TMIP after LSD in patients with hepatitis B cirrhosis and PH on POD 7 and POD 30, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 1249 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Predictors of ACI and AKI were investigated. Multivariable-logistic regression models were used to determine the association of ACI (or AKI) with severity and mortality. RESULTS Median age of patients was 36 years and 61.9% were male. ACI and AKI were observed in 53 (4.2%) and 91 (7.3%) of patients, respectively. Patients with age > 60 years, chronic heart disease, decreased lymphocyte and increased CRP, PCT, and ESR on hospital admission, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use showed higher odds of ACI. Patients with age > 60 years, male, obesity, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, decreased lymphocyte and increased CRP, PCT, and ESR on hospital admission showed higher odds of AKI. Increased Hs-cTnI (> 300 ng/L), Pro-BNP (> 2500 pg/ml) and decreased e-GFR (< 60 ml/min) revealed higher adjusted mortality.

In adults, dynamic preload indices have been shown to be more reliable for guiding fluid resuscitation, but these indices have not been useful in children undergoing surgery. The aim of this study was to introduce frequency-analyzed photoplethysmogram (PPG) and arterial pressure waveform variables and to study the ability of these parameters to detect early bleeding in children during surgery. METHODS We studied 20 children undergoing spinal fusion. Electrocardiogram, arterial pressure, finger pulse oximetry (finger PPG), and airway pressure waveforms were analyzed using time domain and frequency domain methods of analysis. Frequency domain analysis consisted of calculating the amplitude density of PPG and arterial pressure waveforms at the respiratory and cardiac frequencies using Fourier analysis. This generated 2 measurements: The first is related to slow mean arterial pressure modulation induced by ventilation (also known as DC modulation when referring to the PPG), and the second corresponds to pulse pressure modulation (AC modulation or changes in the amplitude of pulse oximeter plethysmograph when referring to the PPG). Both PPG and arterial pressure measurements were divided by their respective cardiac pulse amplitude to generate DC% and AC% (normalized values). Standard hemodynamic data were also recorded. Data at baseline and after bleeding (estimated blood loss about 9% of blood volume) were presented as median and interquartile range and compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; a Bonferroni-corrected P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS There were significant increases in PPG DC% (median [interquartile range] = 359% [210 to 541], P = 0.002), PPG AC% (160% [87 to 251], P = 0.003), and arterial DC% (44% [19 to 84], P = 0.012) modulations, respectively, whereas arterial AC% modulations showed nonsignificant increase (41% [1 to 85], P = 0.12). The change in PPG DC% was significantly higher than that in PPG AC%, arterial DC%, arterial AC%, and systolic blood pressure with P values of 0.008, 0.002, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively. Only systolic blood pressure showed significant changes (11% [4 to 21], P = 0.003) between bleeding phase and baseline. CONCLUSIONS Finger PPG and arterial waveform parameters (using frequency analysis) can track changes in blood volume during the bleeding phase, suggesting the potential for a noninvasive monitor for tracking changes in blood volume in pediatric patients. PPG waveform baseline modulation (PPG DC%) was more sensitive to changes in venous blood volume when compared with respiration-induced modulation seen in the arterial pressure waveform.","Alian, Aymen A; Atteya, Gourg; Gaal, Dorothy; Golembeski, Thomas; Smith, Brian G; Dai, Feng; Silverman, David G; Shelley, Kirk",Anesthesia and analgesia,511,27

RECENT FINDINGS A small but growing literature documents cases of new onset neuro-ophthalmic disease, in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 have experienced acute onset vision loss, optic neuritis, cranial neuropathies, and Miller Fisher syndrome. In addition, COVID-19 increases the risk of cerebrovascular diseases that can impact the visual system. SUMMARY The literature on COVID-19 continues to evolve. Although COVID-19 primarily impacts the respiratory system, there are several reports of new onset neuro-ophthalmic conditions in COVID-infected patients. When patients present with new onset neuro-ophthalmic issues, COVID-19 should be kept on the differential. Testing for COVID-19 should be considered, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are also present. When screening general patients for COVID-19-associated symptoms, frontline physicians can consider including questions about diplopia, eye pain, pain with extraocular movements, decreased vision, gait issues, and other neurologic symptoms. The presence of these symptoms may increase the overall probability of viral infection, especially when fever or respiratory symptoms are present. More research is needed to establish a causal relationship between COVID-19 and neuro-ophthalmic disease, and better understand pathogenesis.","Tisdale, Alanna K; Chwalisz, Bart K",Current opinion in ophthalmology,511,29

Conventional carotid artery sacrifice with detachable coils alone often requires numerous coils to complete occlusion. OBJECTIVE To describe the initial human experience with balloon-augmented Onyx and coil vessel sacrifice based on our previous experience with animals. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent carotid artery sacrifice between 2008 and 2012 in accordance with local investigational review board approval. Two methods were used to occlude carotid arteries-namely, combined Onyx and coil embolization and traditional coil embolization. We compared the two methods for the cost of embolizate, time to occlude the vessels, and the number of coils. RESULTS Eight consecutive patients (combined group n=3, traditional group n=5) were assessed. The median cost of embolic material was $6321 in the combined Onyx and coil embolization group and $29 996 in the traditional coil embolization group. The median time from first coil placement to achievement of vessel occlusion was 52 min in the Onyx group and 113 min in the coil embolization group. The median number of coils used was 4 in the Onyx group and 35 in the coil embolization group (p<0.05). No symptomatic complications or recurrences were seen in the combined group. CONCLUSIONS Balloon-augmented Onyx endovascular ligation may reduce costs and fluoroscopy times during vessel sacrifice. Further studies in a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings.","Osanai, Toshiya; Bain, Mark D; Toth, Gabor; Hussain, M Shazam; Hui, Ferdinand K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,511,1

Patient-specific risk assessment may be improved with the inclusion of doses to cardiac substructures. The purpose of this work was to use automatic segmentation to evaluate substructure doses and develop predictive models for these based on the dose to the whole heart. Material and methods Automatic segmentation was used to delineate cardiac substructures in a Danish breast cancer trial (DBCG HYPO) dataset comprising over 1500 Danish women treated between 2009 and 2014. Trends in contouring practices and cardiac doses over time were investigated, and models to predict substructure doses from whole heart dose parameters were fit to the data. Results: Manual contouring consistency improved over the study period when compared with automatic segmentation; systematic differences between automatically and manually defined heart volume decreased from 106 cm3 to 12.0 cm3. Doses to the heart and cardiac substructures also decreased. Mean whole heart doses for left-sided treatments in 2009 and 2014 were 1.94±1.19 Gy and 1.29±0.69 Gy (average ± SD), respectively. Prediction of mean substructure doses is accurate, with R2 scores in the range 0.45-0.95 (average 0.77), depending on the particular structure.

The injured tubular epithelial cells may undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It will loss epithelial phenotypes and express the mesenchymal characteristics. The formation of scar tissue in the interstitial space during renal remodeling is caused by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components and induced fibrosis. This study investigated the effect of caffeic acid ethanolamide (CAEA), a novel caffeic acid derivative, on renal remodeling after injury. The inhibitory role of CAEA on EMT was determined by western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry staining. Treating renal epithelial cells with CAEA in TGF-β exposed cell culture successfully maintained the content of E-cadherin and inhibited the expression of mesenchymal marker, indicating that CAEA prevented renal epithelial cells undergo EMT after TGF-β exposure. Unilateral renal I/R were performed in mice to induce renal remodeling models. CAEA can protect against I/R-induced renal remodeling by inhibiting inflammatory reactions and consecutively inhibiting TGF-β-induced EMT, characterized by the preserved E-cadherin expression and alleviated α-SMA and collagen expression, as well as the alleviated of renal fibrosis. We also revealed that CAEA may exhibits biological activity by targeting TGFBRI. CAEA may antagonize TGF-β signaling by interacting with TGFBR1, thereby blocking binding between TGF-β and TGFBR1 and reducing downstream signaling, such as Smad3 phosphorylation. Our data support the administration of CAEA after I/R as a viable method for preventing the progression of acute renal injury to renal fibrosis.","Huang, Cheng-Wei; Lee, Shih-Yi; Wei, Tzu-Tang; Kuo, Yueh-Hsiung; Wu, Shao-Tung; Ku, Hui-Chun",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,511,1

A semirigid ring may be preferred in patients whose native mitral saddle shape is well maintained. We present our experience of using semirigid rings for mitral valve repair. METHODS We routinely measured the annular height-to-commissural width ratio by 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography prior to mitral repair. We generally chose a semirigid (Memo 3D) ring in patients whose annular height-to-commissural width ratio was normal (≥ 15%). The same semirigid ring with an additional chordal guiding system (Memo 3D ReChord) was selected for patients with anterior leaflet or bileaflet pathology. Over an 18-month period, 66 patients with severe degenerative (n = 60) or functional (n = 6) mitral regurgitation had Memo 3D (n = 32) or Memo 3D ReChord (n = 34) rings implanted. RESULTS Postoperative 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography was completed in all patients (mean follow-up 7 ± 5 months). The majority of patients had no or mild residual mitral regurgitation; only two had moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. There was no mortality at 30-days or on midterm follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our series represents the first Asian clinical experience using the Memo 3D ReChord ring. Although the long-term durability of mitral repair with this type of semirigid annuloplastic ring warrants further validation, our current clinical data are encouraging.","Wan, Song; Lee, Alex Pw; Attaran, Saina; Yu, Peter Sy; Au, Sylvia Sw; Kwok, Micky Wt; Lau, Rainbow Wh; Wong, Randolph Hl; Wan, Innes Yp; Ng, Siu-Keung; Underwood, Malcolm J",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,511,28

Recent data have shown that incorporating weight loss procedures into the treatment of reflux may improve overall outcomes. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 28 obese and morbidly obese patients who presented from December 2007 through July 2013 with large or recurrent type 3 or 4 paraesophageal hernia. All of the patients underwent combined paraesophageal hernia repair and partial longitudinal gastrectomy. Charts were retrospectively reviewed, and the patients were contacted to determine symptomatic relief. RESULTS Mean preoperative body mass index was 38.1 ± 4.9 kg/m(2). Anatomic failure of prior fundoplication occurred in 7 patients (25%). The remaining 21 had primary paraesophageal hernia, 3 of which were type 4. Postoperative complications included pulmonary embolism (n = 1), pulmonary decompensation (n = 2), and wound infection (n = 1). Mean hospital stay was 5 ± 3 days. Upper gastrointestinal esophagogram was performed in 21 patients with no immediate recurrence or staple line dehiscence. Mean excess weight loss was 44 ± 25%. All of the patients surveyed experienced near to total resolution of their preoperative symptoms within the first month. At 1 year, symptom scores decreased significantly. At 27 months, however, there was a mild increase in the scores. Return of severe symptoms occurred in 2 patients, both of whom underwent conversion to gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS Combined laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with longitudinal partial gastrectomy offers a safe, feasible approach to the management of large or recurrent paraesophageal hernia in well-selected obese and morbidly obese patients. Short-term results were promising; however, intermediate results showed increasing rates of reflux symptoms that required medical therapy or conversion to gastric bypass.","Davis, Matthew; Rodriguez, John; El-Hayek, Kevin; Brethauer, Stacy; Schauer, Philip; Zelisko, Andrea; Chand, Bipan; O'Rourke, Colin; Kroh, Matthew",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,511,11

Currently available vaccines are expensive, cumbersome to produce and require intensive immunization and booster schemes to induce and maintain protective immunity. In the present study, we describe the development of candidate recombinant subunit rabies vaccines based on the glycoprotein G of the prototype rabies virus (RABV-G) expressed either as a monomer (RABV-mG) or in its native trimeric configuration (RABV-tG), with or without Matrix-M™ adjuvant. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the respective candidate vaccines were tested in outbred NIH Swiss albino mice. The RABV-tG candidate vaccine proved to be superior to the RABV-mG vaccine candidate both in terms of immunogenicity and efficacy. The relatively poor immunogenicity of the RABV-mG vaccine candidate was greatly improved by the addition of the adjuvant. A single, low dose of RABV-tG in combination with Matrix-M™ induced high levels of high avidity neutralizing antibodies and protected all mice against challenge with a lethal dose of RABV. Consequently RABV-tG used in combination with Matrix-M™ is a promising vaccine candidate that overcomes the limitations of currently used vaccines.","Koraka, Penelope; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Cox, Manon; Chubet, Rick; Amerongen, Geert van; Lövgren-Bengtsson, Karen; Martina, Byron E E; Roose, Jouke; Rottier, Peter J M; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",Vaccine,511,16

Functional deficits in glutamatergic cortico-limbic areas are hypothesized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Consistently, the clinical antidepressant efficacy of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine gives hope for a new class of glutamatergic rapid-acting antidepressants. In this context, metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors have received attention as interesting targets for new antidepressants. AREAS COVERED The present review summarizes the preclinical evidence supporting the antidepressant effect of the pharmacological modulation of mGlu receptors. Antidepressant properties in animal models of mGlu1 antagonists, mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), mGlu2/3 agonists, PAMs, orthosteric antagonists and NAMs, mGlu4 and mGlu7 PAMs are reviewed. To date, orthosteric mGlu2/3 antagonists are the most promising compounds in development as antidepressants. EXPERT OPINION Although accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence concur to confirm a primary role of glutamate transmission modulation for the induction of a rapid antidepressant effect, very little is still known about the cellular mechanisms involved. More mechanistic studies are required to understand the role of glutamate in depression and the therapeutic potential of drugs directly targeting the glutamate synapse.","Musazzi, Laura",Expert opinion on drug discovery,511,27

We investigated which definition best identifies cerebral hemorrhages that alter long-term functional outcome in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) trials. METHODS We analyzed 4 candidate hemorrhage definitions for which the NINDS tPA trials public data set had relevant data. For each, we identified tPA-treated patients having that hemorrhage type and compared their actual functional outcomes at 90 days with their predicted outcomes had they not received tPA and not had the hemorrhage. Projected outcomes without tPA were based on a 17-variable prognostic model derived from the NINDS tPA trials placebo group. RESULTS Among the 312 patients treated with intravenous tPA, 33 (10.6%) experienced any radiological intracerebral hemorrhage <36 hours of treatment, 16 (5.1%) a radiological parenchymal hematoma, 20 (6.4%) a NINDS tPA trials-defined symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, 12 (3.8%) an European-Australian Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 2 (ECASS2)-defined symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, and 6 (1.9%) a modified version of the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study (mSITS-MOST)-defined symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The ECASS2 and mSITS-MOST definitions identified the largest hemorrhage-related change in 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores (2.26-0.32=1.94, P=0.0001; 2.81-0.63=2.18, P=0.0002, respectively). These definitions also distinguished the largest hemorrhage-related change in 90-day mortality (64.7%-7.6%=57.1%; P=0.0004 for ECASS2; 68.4%-19.5%=48.9%; P=0.0152 for mSITS-MOST). CONCLUSIONS The ECASS2 and mSITS-MOST symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage definitions, which combine radiological features and occurrence of substantial early neurological deterioration, best identify tPA hemorrhages that alter final patient outcome.","Rao, Neal M; Levine, Steven R; Gornbein, Jeffrey A; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,511,1

Cerebrovascular events were identified on screening patients with decreased consciousness or in the presence of focal neurological deficits. These events were common in elderly, critically ill patients and in patients with prior cardio-cerebrovascular comorbidities. The diagnosis of cerebrovascular events was confirmed with computed tomography of the brain in most studies reporting neurological events. Multiple pathological mechanisms have been postulated regarding the process of neurological and vascular injury among which cytokine storm is shown to correlate with mortality. Patients with severe illness are found to have a higher cardio- cerebrovascular comorbidity. With an increasing number of cases and future prospective studies, the exact mechanism by which these cerebrovascular events occur and attribute to the poor outcome will be better understood.","Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Sahu, Kamal Kant; George, Anu Anna; Sargent, Jennifer; Lal, Amos",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,511,25

We apply JuSpace to two datasets covering Parkinson’s disease patients (PD) and risperidone-induced changes in rsfMRI and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Consistently with the predominant neurodegeneration of dopaminergic and serotonergic system in PD, we find significant spatial associations between rsfMRI activity alterations in PD and dopaminergic (D2) and serotonergic systems (5-HT1b). Risperidone induced CBF alterations were correlated with its main targets in serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

Few data are presently available reagarding how the management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed due to this unprecedented situation. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the challenges and issues of the diagnosis and treatment of RCC in the COVID-19 era, and to provide recommendations based on the collected literature and our personal experience. METHODS: Systematic review of the available Literature regarding the management of RCC during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: Our review showed a prevalence of narrative publications, raising the issue of the real relevance of the evidence retrieved. Indeed, the only original data about RCC and COVID-19 found were a small retrospective case series and two surveys, providing either patients' or physicians' viewpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The expected delayed diagnosis of RCC could lead to an increase of advanced/metastatic cases;thus, proper therapeutic choices for patients with small renal masses should be carefully evaluated case by case, in order to avoid negative effects on long-term survival rates. The controversial interaction between immune checkpoint blockade and COVID-19 pathogenesis is more hypothetical than evidence-based, and thus immunotherapy should not be denied, whenever appropriate. To avoid treatments which won't have an impact on patients' survival, a honest and accurate evaluation of the cost/benefit ratio of each treatment option should be always performed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 swab positivity should not prevent the continuation of ongoing active treatments in asymptomatic cases, or or after symptoms' resolution.","Bersanelli, M.; Porta, C.",Kidney Cancer,511,1

A total of 480 breathing sounds (240 shallow and 240 deep) were obtained from a publicly available database named Coswara. These sounds were recorded by 120 COVID-19 and 120 healthy subjects via a smartphone microphone through a website application. A deep learning framework was proposed herein the relies on hand-crafted features extracted from the original recordings and from the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) as well as deep-activated features learned by a combination of convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory units (CNN-BiLSTM). Analysis of the normal distribution of the combined MFCC values showed that COVID-19 subjects tended to have a distribution that is skewed more towards the right side of the zero mean (shallow: 0.59{+/-}1.74, deep: 0.65{+/-}4.35). In addition, the proposed deep learning approach had an overall discrimination accuracy of 94.58% and 92.08% using shallow and deep recordings, respectively. Furthermore, it detected COVID-19 subjects successfully with a maximum sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 94.96%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of 0.90. Among the 120 COVID-19 participants, asymptomatic subjects (18 subjects) were successfully detected with 100.00% accuracy using shallow recordings and 88.89% using deep recordings. This study paves the way towards utilizing smartphone-based breathing sounds for the purpose of COVID-19 detection. The observations found in this study were promising to suggest deep learning and smartphone-based breathing sounds as an effective pre-screening tool for COVID-19 alongside the current reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay.

Observational studies, however, are subject to biases, even when there is no true effect. Cluster randomized trials provide a means to conduct valid hypothesis tests of the effect of interventions on community transmission. While they may only require a short duration, they often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power. However, the sample sizes required for such tests in an outbreak setting are largely undeveloped and the question of whether these designs are practical remains unanswered. We develop approximate sample size formulae and simulation-based sample size methods for cluster randomized trials in infectious disease outbreaks. We highlight key relationships between characteristics of transmission and the enrolled communities and the required sample sizes, describe settings where cluster randomized trials powered to detect a meaningful true effect size may be feasible, and provide recommendations for investigators in planning such trials. The approximate formulae and simulation banks may be used by investigators to quickly assess the feasibility of a trial, and then more detailed methods may be used to more precisely size the trial. For example, we show that community-scale trials requiring 220 clusters with 100 tested individuals per cluster are powered to identify interventions that reduce transmission by 40% in one generation interval, using parameters identified for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For more modest treatment effects, or settings with extreme overdispersion of transmission, however, much larger sample sizes are required.","Sheen, J. K.; Haushofer, J.; Metcalf, C. J.

To display the range of effects that can be achieved in urban mobility through the proper implementation of shared e-scooter systems, a systematic literature review and a case study were performed. It was found that this shared system can help cities with environmental issues, such as reducing air pollution, reducing inequality in access to transport, promoting money-saving, and improving mobility resilience. During the Covid-19 pandemic, shared e-scooters became a great asset in many cities worldwide, because they promote social distancing and help cities not to rely only on private cars to replace public transport rides, especially for short-distance trips.

Studies in this area suggest that different determinants will affect different forms of innovation outputs of KIBS. This paper investigates the direction and the significance of these influences on propensity to innovate. The empirical evidence is based on quantitative and firm-level data gathered through an email questionnaire, which yielded 128 qualified responses from small KIBS in the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on binary logistic regression to identify the effects of determinants on the propensity to innovate. In addition to the consistent results produced by studies in this area, we found reverse relationships between innovation and selected determinants. Negatively evolving knowledge (especially lack of qualified employees) and market determinants (lack of information about the market), positively stimulated small KIBS towards the propensity to introduce organizational innovations (structural and human resources practices), followed by increasing intensity of competition positively related to introducing a new service to the firm (especially t-KIBS) and insufficient availability of business partners increasing the marketing efforts. It’s evident that some negatively evolving determinants perform as incentives or driving forces to specific types of innovations. The results of this study could also be useful for owners and managers in KIBS firms engaging in innovation activities and government support, or incentivize the propensity to innovate.","Bumberová, Veronika",Sustainability,511,8

The consensus computational pipeline in drug development starts from triaging via docking tools of data-driven generated libraries of compounds followed by Molecular Dynamics (MD) techniques on a subset of the best scoring ligands. In this context, absolute binding free energy determination via MD is a crucial and challenging intermediate step, preceding the drug optimization process, using efficient alchemical MD techniques on strictly congeneric series. Here we describe an alchemical MD technique based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics capable of delivering in few hours on a modern HPC platform reliable estimates of the absolute binding free energies in drug–receptor systems. The methodology can be combined with well established alchemical relative binding free energy calculations providing an automatable workflow for drug optimization starting from a set of chemically distant ligands.","Macchiagodena, M.; Karrenbrock, M.; Pagliai, M.; Guarnieri, G.; Iannone, F.; Procacci, P.",Methods Pharmacol.

In Africa, South Africa is leading in terms of the number of infected cases. The lockdown that was introduced in March 2020 meant that all sectors except the essential services grounded to a halt as a containment measure. The education sector at both the basic and tertiary levels was also affected. Even though higher education in South Africa continues to be among the best in Africa and beyond, students enrolled in higher education come from diverse backgrounds. Students represent different classes, cultural diversity, and varying levels of computer literacy. The call to exclusively migrate learning to digital platforms remains a practical solution to salvage a difficult situation in many ways. However, not all students have the capacity to actively participate in digital learning for varying reasons. This paper focuses on rural-based UKZN first-year students. It draws from data collected through telephonic interviews. The contribution of the paper is twofold. Firstly, it addresses the rural-based students’ experiences with the exclusivity of electronic-based platforms adopted for teaching and learning at UKZN. Secondly, it contends that the acclaimed ‘one size fits all’ remote teaching and learning appears to be ‘phony’ and ‘counterproductive’ because it failed to address the pertinent needs of rural-based UKZN first-year students. The major question raised thus is whether online teaching is meant to reinforce the already existing geo-spatial inequalities in the education system of South Africa or is genuinely meant to salvage an already dire situation. © 2021 The Author(s).

The stress has a negative effect on job satisfaction (Singh et al., 2019). The one of the most important criteria for successful activities is a job satisfaction (Burić & Moè, 2020). The highest level of job satisfaction can be achieved by the high adaptive potential of professionals, who have a diverse arsenal of self-regulation resources and apply them adequately to working conditions (Kuznetsova et al., 2019).ObjectivesThe study was held in 45 professionals from different fields, who work remotely during the self-isolation due to COVID-19 pandemic and aimed to estimate the correlation between job satisfaction and self-regulation resources of professionals under work stress.MethodsThe assessment methods included: 1) test “Job Satisfaction” by V.A. Rozanova 2) S. Hobfoll’s “SACS” 3) Ch. Spilberger’s “Trait Anxiety”.ResultsThe results revealed an average level of anxiety with a tendency to growth. Avoidance, asocial and aggressive behaviour are frequently used. The direct correlation between the level of job satisfaction and such a resource of self-regulation as a search for social contact was revealed (r=0.291;p=0.049). The general level of anxiety is directly related to avoidance (r=0. 374;p=0.011), manipulative (r=0.343;p=0.021) and aggressive actions (r=0.343;p=0.021), and negatively correlates with assertive actions (r=-0.703;p=0).ConclusionsThe results of the study can be used to develop programs to improve the psychological well-being and performance of employees working under stress due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Titova, M.",European Psychiatry,511,20

The analysis combines monitored data obtained for a sample of housing units as well as the results from a validated Saudi residential building stock model. In particular, a bottom-up building stock modeling analysis approach is used to estimate the energy impact of the 2020 stay home order imposed due to COVID-19 in most of Saudi Arabia's regions between March 15 and June 15, 2020. Moreover, the potential influences of long-term stay home patterns on the cost-benefits of energy retrofit programs are investigated targeting Saudi existing housing stocks. The analysis results indicate that when normalized to weather, the 2020 lockdown has resulted in a 16 % increase in electricity consumption compared to the 2019 level specific to the entire Saudi housing stock. Most of this increase is associated with the higher energy end-use of lighting, appliances, and air conditioning associated with increased occupancy levels during daytime hours. For a transition to long-term stay home living, the results of the analysis show that the energy consumption of the Saudi housing stock is estimated to increase by 13.5 % compared to the current occupancy pattern. Moreover, the analysis indicates that the cost-benefits for energy efficiency retrofits are enhanced with long-term stay home living.","Aldubyan, Mohammad Krarti Moncef",Energy,511,25

Based on the beneficial effects of the AFO-202 strain of black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans-produced beta 1,3-1,6 glucan in balancing of blood glucose and immune enhancement, and that of the N-163 strain of the same species in lipid metabolism and immune modulation, in this pilot study, we have evaluated their specific benefits in healthy human subjects. Methods: Sixteen healthy Japanese male volunteers (aged 40 to 60 years) took part in this clinical trial. They were divided into four groups (n = 4 each): Group I consumed AFO-202 beta glucan (2 sachets of 1 g each per day), IA for 35 days and IB for 21 days; Group II consumed a combination of AFO-202 beta glucan (2 sachets of 1 g each) and N-163 beta glucan (1 sachet of 15 g gel each per day), IIA for 35 days and IIB for 21 days. Investigations for immune stimulation, anti-glycaemic, and anti-cholesterolemia biomarkers were undertaken in all four groups. Results: In terms of metabolic control of glucose, the decrease in HbA1C and glycated albumin (GA) was significantly better in Group I compared with the other groups. Immune enhancement in terms of a significant increase of eosinophils and monocytes and marginal decrease in D-dimer levels, decrease in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with an increase in the lymphocyte-to-CRP ratio (LCR) and leukocyte-to-CRP ratio (LeCR) was observed in Group I. Regulation of lipids by decrease in total and LDL cholesterol was better in Group II, and immunomodulation of coagulation-associated and anti-inflammatory markers by a decrease of CD11b, serum ferritin, galectin-3, fibrinogen was profound in Group II. Conclusion: A. pullulans, a polythermotolerant black yeast - produced AFO-202 beta glucan has balanced blood glucose with marginal immune enhancement in healthy individuals, which when combined with N-163 beta glucan, balanced the lipid profile and immunomodulation. This outcome warrants larger clinical trials to understand the mechanisms and explore the potentials of these safe food supplements in prevention and prophylaxis of diseases due to dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, such as fatty liver disease, and infections such as COVID-19 in which a balanced immune activation and immunomodulation are of utmost importance, besides their administration as an adjunct to existing therapeutic approaches of both communicable and non-communicable diseases.","Ikewaki, N.; Sonoda, T.; Kurosawa, G.; Iwasaki, M.; Dedeepiya, V.

We studied the inversion in the decreased/increased rate of new SARS-COV-2 infections in the countries of the tournament, investigating the hypothesis of an association. Using a Bayesian piecewise regression with a Poisson generalized linear model, we looked for a changepoint in the timeseries of the new SARS-COV-2 cases of each country, expecting it to appear not later than two to three weeks after the date of their first match. The two slopes, before and after the changepoint, were used to discuss the reversal from a decreasing to an increasing rate of the infections. For 17 out of 22 countries (77%) the changepoint came on average 14.97 days after their first match (95% CI 12.29–17.47). For all those 17 countries, the changepoint coincides with an inversion from a decreasing to an increasing rate of the infections. Before the changepoint, the new cases were decreasing, halving on average every 18.07 days (95% CI 11.81–29.42). After the changepoint, the cases begin to increase, doubling every 29.10 days (95% CI 14.12–9.78). This inversion in the SARS-COV-2 case rate, which happened during the tournament, provides evidence in favor of a relationship.","Casini, Luca Roccetti Marco",Future Internet,511,1

Obtaining research results is based on surveying stakeholders in higher education and obtaining quantitative data regarding key performance indices. Quantitative data and the genetic algorithm method are applied to determine optimal management strategies for quality improvement. Quality in the higher education sector is among the current issues in the academic community. By monitoring and researching the higher education field and analysing the literature and the current situation in the system of higher education in developing countries, it can be concluded that there is no single way to assess the quality of higher education institutions. This knowledge was a good starting point for the research presented in this paper. Accordingly, the findings include developing a system for quality assessment and the ranking of higher education institutions. Additionally, evaluating the relevance of key performance indicators of higher education institutions differs from different stakeholder perspectives. However, it is possible to develop a system for decision support and the selection of the optimal strategy for improving the performance of study programs and higher education institutions with regard to quality. The practical implications include defining a decision support system that enables the adoption of optimal decisions by the management teams of higher education institutions to improve study programs and the performance of the higher education institutions. The presented system may enable the benchmarking, simulation, and verification of different scenarios for improving the quality and performance of higher education institutions. In this paper, the authors analysed the characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of different ranking systems to develop and introduce a novel ranking system that suggests weights for the ranking criteria and different perspectives regarding new digital age requirements. The model was tested, and the results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the developed model. The originality of the research lies in the presented novel model that can be made available to government institutions and serve as a basis for the overall ranking and evaluation of higher education institutions, with the possibility of developing a performance-based funding system.

Methodology: We prospectively analysed patients aged from 1 month to 17 years admitted between March 2018 and April 2020 who were hospitalized for CAP. For all patients included in the study, history, clinical parameters, microbiological data, and lung ultrasound data were collected. Patients were stratified into three main groups (bacterial, viral, atypical) according to the presumed microbial aetiology and lung ultrasound findings evaluated according to the aetiological group. Results: We found that some ultrasound findings as size, number and distribution of consolidations, the position and motion of air bronchograms, pleural effusions and distribution of vertical artifacts significantly differ (p < 0.05) in children with bacterial, viral and atypical CAP. Conversely, clinical parameters and laboratory were not able to significantly distinguish between these groups. Chest x-ray, despite being still widely used, was the less useful tool in this discrimination.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with widespread inflammation with multi-organ involvement where renal failure is the most dreaded and fatal complication. Adoptive therapy with cord blood (CB) derived T regulatory cells has been shown to improve outcomes in disease driven by inflammation including graft versus host disease (GvHD), inflammatory bone marrow disorder, COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that CB Treg therapy can treat lupus nephritis. Methods. The suppressive abilities of CB Tregs expressing CD4+CD25highCD127lowFoxP3+ were assayed by human cytokines assay kits (IL-10, IFN-γ, IP-10, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17A) in the cell culture supernatants. For examining the efficacy of CB Tregs in vivo, SLE xenograft model was created with female Rag2-/-γc-/- mice transplanted with 3x106 human SLE-peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by intravenous injection on day 0. The mice were allowed to develop disease and on day 30 post-transplant, they were divided into 2 groups: i) control and ii) treatment. 1x107 ex vivo-expanded, cryopreserved, allogeneic, non-HLA matchedCB Tregs were injected into SLE xenografts intravenously once per week for 4 weeks through the tail vein. Serial blood draws were performed for the phenotypic analysis, cytokine assay and anti-double stranded (ds)DNA IgG antibody analysis. Serial examination of the urine samples was performed for creatinine and albumin quantification. Histopathologic examination of the harvested organs was performed at the time of planned euthanasia at 13 weeks. Results. Co-culture of CB Tregs with the pathogenic SLE-PBMCs decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines including IFN-γ, IP-10, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17A (Figure A) with a reciprocal increase in the secretion of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine (Figure B). Adoptive therapy with CB Treg cells led to a significant decrease in circulating CD8+ effector T cells and an increase in CD4+ helper T cells (Figure C). CB Treg recipients showed preserved weight gain (Figure D), lower GvHD score (Figure E) and improved overall survival (Figure F). A significant decrease in proteinuria at 9 weeks post-transplant (Figure G) correlated with a decrease in anti-dsDNA IgG Ab levels (Figure H) and soluble CD40 ligand levels (Figure I). Histopathological results from two index cases from each arm (Figure J) demonstrated that CB Treg recipients show reduced T-cells (CD3+) (Figure K) and B-cells (CD20+) (Figure L) in the kidneys, as well as a decrease in the lymphoid infiltration into glomeruli and renal parenchyma as compared to the control arm (Figure M). Conclusion. We are the first to demonstrate the benefit of allogeneic CB Treg cell therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis. We propose to examine such a strategy in the clinical setting.

Its containment represents a unique challenge for India due to a large population (>1.38 billion) across a wide range of population densities. Assessment of the COVID-19 disease burden is required to put the disease impact into context and support future pandemic policy development. Here, we present the national-level burden of COVID-19 in India in 2020 that accounts for differences across urban and rural regions and across age groups. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) due to COVID-19 were estimated in the Indian population in 2020, comprised of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD). Scenario analyses were conducted to account for excess deaths not recorded in the official data and for reported COVID-19 deaths. The direct impact of COVID-19 in 2020 in India was responsible for 14,106,060 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 14,030,129-14,213,231) DALYs, consisting of 99.2% (95% UI 98.47-99.64%) YLLs and 0.80% (95% UI 0.36-1.53) YLDs. DALYs were higher in urban (56%; 95% UI 56-57%) than rural areas (44%; 95% UI 43.4-43.6) and in males (64%) than females (36%).

Although various approaches have mimicked the structures and functions of the human skin, challenges remain with high‐density integration, super sensitivity, and multi‐functionality. A multimodal and comfortable skin‐inspired active‐matrix circuitry is reported here with high pixel density (&gt;100 cm–2) based on all 2D materials, which exhibits excellent performance to detect both mechanical interactions and humidity variations. The ultra‐high sensitivity (&gt;400 and ≈ 104 for strain and humidity sensing, respectively), long‐term stability (&gt;1000 cycles), and rapid response time for every pixel can fulfill simultaneous multi‐stimulus sensing. Accordingly, a respiratory monitor is constructed to realize healthcare monitoring through observing the human breath frequency, intensity, and humidity in real‐time. Moreover, the multimodal e‐skin breaks through shackles of the contact sensor medium for HMI. 3D strain and humidity spatial mapping can reflect object location information even without contact, avoiding cross‐infection of viruses effectively between users during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The reported e‐skin will broaden applications for future healthcare and human–machine interactive devices.

Although current research has argued that institution elements have had an impact on MCB diffusion, limited studies have empirically investigated the distinct effectiveness of various institution elements on driving MCB’s widespread diffusion in construction megaprojects. Based on institution theory, this study proposes a theoretical model comprising institutional elements (i.e., normative and mimetic isomorphism), owner’s support, relationship-based trust, and their effect or impact on MCB’s diffusion. Based on 171 industrial questionnaires collected from managers of contractors and designers in megaprojects. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to validate the established model. The results indicated that both normative and mimetic isomorphism have positive effects on facilitating MCB diffusion, and owner’s support has shown partial mediation in promoting MCB diffusion through normative isomorphism, as well as full mediation in the promoting of MCB diffusion through mimetic isomorphism. Meanwhile, relationship-based trust exerts a positive moderating effect on the relationship between mimetic isomorphism and MCB.

This baseline information is essential to design effective strategies and improve adherence to prevention measures. Objective: Identify the KAP related to COVID-19 in Venezuelan patients screened at the Caracas University Hospital triage tent. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 215 patients between April 25th and May 25th, 2020 with in-person interviews using a KAP survey. Results: Most surveyed patients (53.5%) were asymptomatic. Most of them had adequate knowledge about symptoms and transmission of the disease without distinction between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. Most of them indicated to be practicing quarantine, frequent handwashing, and face mask use in public areas;however, daily replacement of cloth face masks was more frequent in the asymptomatic group, whereas replacement every 3 days of cloth face masks was more frequent in the symptomatic group. Finally, more than half of the participants admitted having been in crowded places, being this practice more common among the symptomatic compared to the asymptomatic patients. Conclusions: This is the first KAP study in Venezuela about COVID-19. The knowledge and practices of Venezuelans could be improved through the strengthening of education and training programs. This information obtained from the early phase of the pandemic in Venezuela could contribute to the design of COVID-19 promotion and prevention strategies.","Chacon, F. R.; Doval, J.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery mobile applications gained numerous new users, with the industry being one of the few domains to have leveraged the pandemic’s outbreak. This study investigates the factors that have influenced the adoption of food delivery mobile application technology during the pandemic in Thailand. The research model was adopted from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, integrating perceived fear of COVID-19. Empirical research was conducted using data from 223 food delivery mobile application users in Thailand, with Structural Equation Modelling used to validate the model and analyse the hypotheses. The results indicate that the intention to use food delivery applications was significantly influenced by social influence, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived fear. Facilitating conditions significantly impacted actual usage behaviour, with moderating results revealing a stronger influence on behaviour intention of perceived fear of COVID-19 among females than males and among younger respondents than older respondents. The variance explained by the modified UTAUT model for intention to adopt food delivery mobile application technology was found to be 59.4%. This research makes a significant contribution to the literature in terms of validating a theory-driven framework that emphasizes the factors which impact the adoption of food delivery mobile application technology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

The problem can be addressed by outsourcing the management of the property to a company possessing quality property management (PMGT) certification. The PMGT certification is normally hailed as an effective means of reassuring occupiers and prospective property buyers of the good level of quality of the property management to be expected. This study investigated whether PMGT certification carries with it a price premium for residential properties.Design/methodology/approachA fixed-effects modelling approach was employed in relation to a large residential properties dataset in Hong Kong, in the period 2009–2018.FindingsThe results indicate, on average, that the PMGT certification commands a price premium of between 3.3 and 3.9%. This premium can be called, the “tragedy of anti-commons premium (TAC premium)”. The results further suggest that significant price premium differences relate to the four different types of certifications studied. The price of a residential unit managed by a property management company (PMC) with Q-mark certification is about 3.4% higher than a unit managed by a non-certified PMC, ceteris paribus. Likewise, corresponding price premiums for units certified related to ISO9001 and HKMAQA certifications are 3.5 and 2.4%, respectively.Originality/valueTo the best of author's knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate if there is any relationship between the property price premium attributed to “tragedy of anti-commons” and PMGT certification.","Jayantha Wadu, Mesthrige",Property Management,511,24

Hyper-engagement risks impulsivity and is fatiguing over time, while hypo-engagement could lead to missed opportunities. Even in sleep, when engagement levels are minimal, sensory responsiveness varies. Thus, maintaining an optimal engagement level with the environment is a fundamental cognitive ability. The claustrum, and in particular its reciprocal connectivity with executive regions in the frontal cortex, has been associated with salience, attention and sleep. These apparently disparate roles can be consolidated within the context of engagement. Here we describe the activity of claustro-frontal circuits in a task imposing a tradeoff between response inhibition and sensory acuity (‘ENGAGE’). Recording calcium fiber photometry during >80,000 trials, we characterize claustrum recruitment during salient behavioral events, and find that a moderate level of activity in claustro-cingulate projections defines optimal engagement. Low activity of this pathway is associated with impulsive actions, while high activity is associated with behavioral lapses. Chemogenetic activation of cingulate-projecting claustrum neurons suppressed impulsive behavior and reduced the engagement of mice in the task. This relationship became even clearer upon addressing individual variability in the strategy mice employed during the ENGAGE task. Furthermore, this association of claustrum activity and engagement extends into sleep. Using simultaneous EEG and photometry recordings in the claustrum, we find that cingulate projecting claustrum neurons are most active during deep unresponsive slow-wave sleep, when mice are less prone to awakening by sensory stimuli.","Atlan, Gal; Matosevich, Noa; Peretz-Rivlin, Noa; Yvgi, Idit; Chen, Eden; Kleinman, Timna; Bleistein, Noa; Sheinbach, Efrat; Groysman, Maya; Nir, Yuval; Citri, Ami",bioRxiv,511,20

In mice homozygous for the paucity of lymph node T cell (plt) mutation, naive T cells fail to home to LNs or the lymphoid regions of spleen. Here we demonstrate that expression of SLC is undetectable in plt mice. In addition to the defect in T cell homing, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) fail to accumulate in spleen and LN T cell zones of plt mice. DC migration to LNs after contact sensitization is also substantially reduced. The physiologic significance of these abnormalities in plt mice is indicated by a markedly increased sensitivity to infection with murine hepatitis virus. The plt mutation maps to the SLC locus; however, the sequence of SLC introns and exons in plt mice is normal. These findings suggest that the abnormalities in plt mice are due to a genetic defect in the expression of SLC and that SLC mediates the entry of naive T cells and antigen-stimulated DCs into the T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs.","Gunn, Michael D.; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Tam, Carmen; Kakiuchi, Terutaka; Matsuzawa, Akio; Williams, Lewis T.; Nakano, Hideki",J Exp Med,511,9

A possible reason might be related to metastases in the central mesocolic lymph nodes. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe the pattern of mesocolic lymph node metastases, particularly in central lymph nodes, and the risk of skip, aberrant, and gastrocolic ligament metastases as the argument for performing extended lymph node dissection. DATA SOURCES EMBASE and PubMed were searched using the terms colon or colorectal with sentinel node, lymph node mapping, or skip node; lymph node resection colon; and complete or total and mesocolic excision. STUDY SELECTION Studies describing the risk of metastases in central, skip, aberrant, and gastrocolic ligament lymph node metastases from colon adenocarcinomas in 10 or more patients were included. No languages were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The risk of metastases in the central mesocolic lymph nodes was measured. RESULTS A total of 2052 articles were screened, of which 277 underwent full-text review. The 47 studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were very heterogeneous, and meta-analyses were not considered appropriate. The risk of central mesocolic lymph node metastases for right-sided cancers varies between 1% and 22%. In sigmoid cancer, the risk is reported in ≤12% of the patients and is associated with advanced T stage. LIMITATIONS The retrospective design and heterogeneity, in terms of definitions of lymph node location, tumor sites, stage, morphology, pathology assessment, and inclusion criteria (selection bias), of the included studies were limitations. Also, anatomic definitions were not uniform. CONCLUSIONS The present literature cannot give a theoretical explanation of a better oncological outcome after extended lymph node dissection. Consensus for a standardization of anatomical definitions and surgical and pathological assessments is warranted for future mapping studies.","Bertelsen, Claus A; Kirkegaard-Klitbo, Anders; Nielsen, Mingyuan; Leotta, Salvatore M G; Daisuke, Fukumori; Gögenur, Ismail",Diseases of the colon and rectum,511,1

One of its functions is to mediate the incorporation of the spikes into the viral envelope. Heterotypic interactions between M and the spike (S) protein can be demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence colocalization, after coexpression of their genes in eukaryotic cells. Using these assays in a mutagenetic approach, we have mapped the domains in the M protein that are involved in complex formation between M and S. It appeared that the 25-residue luminally exposed amino-terminal domain of the M protein is not important for M-S interaction. A 15-residue deletion, the insertion of a His tag, and replacement of the ectodomain by that of another coronavirus M protein did not affect the ability of the M protein to associate with the S protein. However, complex formation was sensitive to changes in the transmembrane domains of this triple-spanning protein. Deletion of either the first two or the last two transmembrane domains, known not to affect the topology of the protein, led to a considerable decrease in complex formation, but association was not completely abrogated. Various effects of changes in the part of the M protein that is located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane were observed. Deletions of the extreme carboxy-terminal tail appeared not to interfere with M-S complex formation. However, deletions in the amphipathic domain severely affected M-S interaction. Interestingly, changes in the amino-terminal and extreme carboxy-terminal domains of M, which did not disrupt the interaction with S, are known to be fatal to the ability of the protein to engage in virus particle formation (C. A. M. de Haan, L. Kuo, P. S. Masters, H. Vennema, and P. J. M. Rottier, J. Virol. 72:6838-6850, 1998).

In this study we have addressed this hypothesis by comparing the expression of messenger RNA of Gtx, a homeodomain transcription factor expressed within oligodendrocytes during myelination, with the expression of messenger RNAs of the major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein during remyelination of experimentally induced demyelination in the adult rat brain. We have found a close temporal and spatial association between the expression patterns of the three messenger RNA species during remyelination. By comparing the expression patterns in rapidly remyelinating lesions in young adult rats with slowly remyelinating lesions in old adult rats, we have shown that Gtx messenger RNA expression follows the reappearance of myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein messenger RNAs regardless of the rate of remyelination. This observation demonstrates a clear association between the expression of Gtx messenger RNA and myelin repair. We have also shown that there is a decrease in constitutive levels of expression of myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein and Gtx messenger RNA in old adults compared with young adults. Taken together, our results indicate that Gtx, which has multiple binding sites in the promoter regions of both myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein genes, may have a similar role in the regulation of myelin protein gene expression during remyelination as has been proposed in myelination.","Sim, F J; Hinks, G L; Franklin, R J",Neuroscience,511,16

We report here the generation of SARS CoV S protein-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector particles. The wild-type S protein pseudotyped MLV vectors, although at a low efficiency. Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of S dramatically increased infectivity of pseudotypes, with titers only two- to threefold lower than those of pseudotypes generated in parallel with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. S-pseudotyped MLV particles were used to analyze viral tropism. MLV(SARS) pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV displayed similar cell types and tissue and host restrictions, indicating that the expression of a functional receptor is the major restraint in permissiveness to SARS CoV infection. Efficient gene transfer could be detected in Vero and CaCo2 cells, whereas the level of gene marking of 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells was only slightly above background levels. A cat cell line and a dog cell line were not susceptible. Interestingly, PK-15, a porcine kidney cell line, and primary porcine kidney cells were also highly permissive for SARS S pseudotypes and wild-type SARS CoV. This finding suggests that swine may be susceptible to SARS infection and may be a source for infection of humans. Taken together, these results indicate that MLV(SARS) pseudotypes are highly valuable for functional studies of viral tropism and entry and, in addition, can be a powerful tool for the development of therapeutic entry inhibitors without posing a biohazard to human beings.","Giroglou, Tsanan; Cinatl, Jindrich; Rabenau, Holger; Drosten, Christian; Schwalbe, Harald; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm; von Laer, Dorothee",Journal of virology,511,31

Comparative sequence analysis of 3'-terminal structural genes of the single-stranded RNA viral genome revealed the presence of two genotypic classes of PRRSV, represented by the prototype North American and European strains, VR-2332 and Lelystad virus (LV), respectively. To better understand the evolution and pathogenicity of PRRSV, we obtained the 12,066-base 5'-terminal nucleotide sequence of VR-2332, encoding the viral replication activities, and compared it to those of LV and other arteriviruses. VR-2332 and LV differ markedly in the 5' leader and sections of the open reading frame (ORF) 1a region. The ORF 1b sequence was nearly colinear but varied in similarity of proteins encoded in identified regions. Furthermore, molecular and biochemical analysis of subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) processing revealed extensive variation in the number of sgmRNAs which may be generated during infection and in the lengths of noncoding sequence between leader-body junctions and the translation-initiating codon AUG. In addition, VR-2332 and LV select different leader-body junction sites from a pool of similar candidate sites to produce sgmRNA 7, encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein. The presence of substantial variations across the entire genome and in sgmRNA processing indicates that PRRSV has evolved independently on separate continents. The near-simultaneous global emergence of a new swine disease caused by divergently evolved viruses suggests that changes in swine husbandry and management may have contributed to the emergence of PRRS.","Nelsen, C J; Murtaugh, M P; Faaberg, K S",Journal of virology,511,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS The hospital ethics committee approved the study, and all patients provided written informed consent. A total of 254 patients with confirmed SARS treated with steroids underwent evaluation with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for osteonecrosis. Clinical profiles, joint symptoms, relevant past medical and drug history, steroid dose, and radiographic and MR imaging evidence of osteonecrosis and other bone abnormalities were evaluated. Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and Pearson exact chi(2) tests were performed, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS One hundred thirty-four (53%) of 254 patients had recent onset of large joint pain, but 211 (80%) of 264 painful joints were not associated with abnormality on MR images. MR images in 12 (5%) of 254 patients showed evidence of subchondral osteonecrosis in the proximal femur (n = 9), distal femur (n = 2), and proximal and distal femora and proximal tibiae (n = 1). Additional nonspecific subchondral and intramedullary bone marrow abnormalities were present in 77 (30%) of 254 patients. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose to be the most important risk factor for osteonecrosis. The risk of osteonecrosis was 0.6% for patients receiving less than 3 g and 13% for patients receiving more than 3 g prednisolone-equivalent dose. No relationship was found between additional nonspecific bone marrow abnormalities and steroid dose. CONCLUSION An appreciable dose-related risk was found for osteonecrosis in patients receiving steroid therapy for SARS. Additional nonspecific bone marrow abnormalities were frequent. Joint pain was common after SARS infection and was not a useful clinical indicator of osteonecrosis.","Griffith, James Francis; Antonio, Gregory Ernest; Kumta, Shekhar Madhukar; Hui, David Shu Cheong; Wong, Jeffrey Ka Tak; Joynt, Gavin Matthew; Wu, Alan Ka Lun; Cheung, Albert Yu Kiu; Chiu, Kwok Hing; Chan, Kai Ming; Leung, Ping Chung; Ahuja, Anil Tejbhan",Radiology,511,1

For this project, we used recombinant baculoviruses expressing different lengths of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein in a capture assay to deduce the minimal DC-SIGN binding region. Our results identified the region location between amino acid (aa) residues 324 to 386 of the S protein. We then generated nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the S protein to map the DC-SIGN-binding domain using capture assays with pseudotyped viruses and observed that MAb SIa5 significantly blocked S protein-DC-SIGN interaction. An enhancement assay using the HKU39849 SARS-CoV strain and human immature dendritic cells confirmed our observation. Data from a pepscan analysis and M13 phage peptide display library system mapped the reactive MAb SIa5 epitope to aa residues 363 to 368 of the S protein. Results from a capture assay testing three pseudotyped viruses with mutated N-linked glycosylation sites of the S protein indicate that only two pseudotyped viruses (N330Q and N357Q, both of which lost glycosylation sites near the SIa5 epitope) had diminished DC-SIGN-binding capacity. We also noted that MAb SIb4 exerted a neutralizing effect against HKU39849; its reactive epitope was mapped to aa residues 435 to 439 of the S protein. We offer the data to facilitate the development of therapeutic agents and preventive vaccines against SARS-CoV infection.","Shih, Yi-Ping; Chen, Chia-Yen; Liu, Shih-Jen; Chen, Kuan-Hsuan; Lee, Yuan-Ming; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur",Journal of virology,511,16

As a part of the research, a quantitative survey found that among 600 sexually active women living with HIV aged 18-69, all reported experiencing emotional abuse; 20%, 17%, and 15% experienced controlling behavior, physical violence, and sexual violence, respectively. Qualitative research using focus group discussions with 19 women from the quantitative survey sought to contextualize these experiences and place them within a larger social structure where institutionalized gender inequality sets the tone for intimate partner violence against women in households. Participants reported that intimate partner violence led to their exposure to the virus and made them leery of disclosing their positive status or seeking support from a male partner for fear of a violent reaction. This fear and the socio-structural conditions in Kenya limit their ability to actively pursue comprehensive care, the stress of which can exacerbate symptoms and make managing the disease more difficult.","Andrews, Courtney; Reuter, Tina Kempin; Marsh, Lauren; Velazquez, Judith M; Jaoko, Walter; Jolly, Pauline",Health and human rights,511,24

Asbestos still is used in the United States (approximately 2,200 metric tons in 2006) in certain products manufactured domestically. In addition, an undocumented amount of asbestos continues to be imported in products manufactured elsewhere, and a substantial amount of asbestos remains in existing buildings and manufactured products. An estimated 1.3 million construction and general industry workers in the United States potentially are exposed to asbestos each year, mainly from manipulation of asbestos during renovation or demolition activities. Also, although asbestos ore is no longer mined in the United States, some U.S. mine workers might remain at risk for exposure to asbestos contained in other ores. To characterize trends in premature mortality attributed to asbestosis in the United States, CDC analyzed annual underlying cause-of-death data for 1968-2005, the most recent years for which data were available. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that annual years of potential life lost before age 65 years (YPLL) attributed to asbestosis increased 64%, from an average of 146.0 YPLL per year during 1968-1972 to 239.6 per year during 2001-2005 (regression trend for the 5-year moving average, p<0.001), for an overall total of 7,267 YPLL (mean per decedent: 6.2) over the entire period.

This review aimed to summarize the current knowledge about the uncut Roux-en-Y anastomosis operation, so that surgeons may be able to make informed decisions about its clinical application. Additionally, we hope that our findings will guide future research on this topic. Areas covered: The original uncut technique was associated with dehiscence or recanalization of the jejunal occlusion, and was therefore not widely applied. However, with recent improvements in the method of jejunal occlusion, the uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction may be an appropriate alternative for digestive tract reconstruction after distal gastrectomy. This review summarizes the basic research on and clinical applications of uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy from the following several aspects: origin of the uncut reconstruction technique, rationale for uncut reconstruction based on data from animal experiments, clinical results of the uncut reconstruction, recanalization and its countermeasures, and so on. Expert commentary: The uncut Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy is a controversial yet promising method of gastrointestinal reconstruction after distal gastrectomy. Prospective randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up outcomes are required to support the modified technique in the future.","Huang, Yuqin; Wang, Sen; Shi, Youquan; Tang, Dong; Wang, Wei; Chong, Yang; Zhou, Huaicheng; Xiong, Qingquan; Wang, Jie; Wang, Daorong",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,511,20

The mechanisms of virus pathogenesis are still obscure. The occurrence of defective proviruses in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of infected individuals is a frequent feature of virus infection. We detected defective proviruses with large internal deletions in PBMC from ATLL and HAM/TSP patients and in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Seventeen PCR-amplified defective proviruses were sequenced, and three types of deletions were found. Besides truncated MA and the 5' end of the genome, truncated CA, truncated SU, and more frequently truncated TM linked to the pX region were detected. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of PBMC from ATLL patients and asymptomatic carriers also revealed RNA transcripts with large internal deletions. Analysis of two RT-PCR cDNA clones confirmed a Gag-TM-pX structure of the transcripts. Most defective proviruses contained numerous internal stop codons, but some were capable of coding for the truncated MA linked to a variable out-of-frame peptide. Cloned defective proviruses with long open reading frames were subjected to in vitro transcription-translation followed by radioimmunoprecipitation, which showed expression of chimeric proteins between 8 and 12 kDa. Possible roles of defective proviruses and chimeric proteins are discussed, although there is no firm association with pathogenesis.","Morozov, V A; Lagaye, S; Taylor, G P; Matutes, E; Weiss, R A",Journal of virology,511,16

Female Wistar rats were assigned into control and diabetic group, each consisting of five animals. The later was induced with STZ (50mg/Kg intraperitoneal injection) and the animals were sacrificed after 14 weeks. The blood glucose, body and organ weight, serum hormone level along with oxidative stress parameters of the ovary and uterus were determined. Histology of the ovary and expression levels of CD79 in the ovary was also assessed. The weight of the diabetic rats after the experiment was significantly lower (p<0.05) than the control. The level of Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing hormone and estrogen was significantly lower in the diabetic group. The antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) were significantly lower in the diabetic ovary and uterus while the Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration significantly increased compared to the control group. Histological observation of the ovary showed signs of chronic inflammation and immunohistochemistry for CD79 showed positive expression in the diabetic ovary.

We conducted a cohort study examining multiple parameters of immune responses to SARS-CoV infection, aiming to identify the immune correlates of protection. We used a matrix of overlapping peptides spanning whole SARS-CoV proteome to determine T cell responses from 128 SARS convalescent samples by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays. Approximately 50% of convalescent SARS patients were positive for T cell responses, and 90% possessed strongly neutralizing Abs. Fifty-five novel T cell epitopes were identified, with spike protein dominating total T cell responses. CD8(+) T cell responses were more frequent and of a greater magnitude than CD4(+) T cell responses (p < 0.001). Polychromatic cytometry analysis indicated that the virus-specific T cells from the severe group tended to be a central memory phenotype (CD27(+)/CD45RO(+)) with a significantly higher frequency of polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2, and CD8(+) T cells producing IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and CD107a (degranulation), as compared with the mild-moderate group. Strong T cell responses correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with higher neutralizing Ab. The serum cytokine profile during acute infection indicated a significant elevation of innate immune responses. Increased Th2 cytokines were observed in patients with fatal infection.

A novel SARS-associated coronavirus was identified as its principal etiologic agent; however, the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. In this study, potential HLA-A*0201-restricted spike (S) and nucleocapsid protein-derived peptides were selected from an online database and screened for potential CTL epitopes by in vitro refolding and T2 cell-stabilization assays. The antigenicity of nine peptides which could refold with HLA-A*0201 molecules was assessed with an IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A2(+) SARS-recovered donors. A novel HLA-A*0201-restricted decameric epitope P15 (S411-420, KLPDDFMGCV) derived from the S protein was identified and found to localize within the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor-binding region of the S1 domain. P15 could significantly enhance the expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules on the T2 cell surface, stimulate IFN-gamma-producing CTLs from the PBMCs of former SARS patients, and induce specific CTLs from P15-immunized HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice in vivo. Furthermore, significant P15-specific CTLs were induced from HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice immunized by a DNA vaccine encoding the S protein; suggesting that P15 was a naturally processed epitope. Thus, P15 may be a novel SARS-associated coronavirus-specific CTL epitope and a potential target for characterization of virus control mechanisms and evaluation of candidate SARS vaccines.","Zhou, Minghai; Xu, Dongping; Li, Xiaojuan; Li, Hongtao; Shan, Ming; Tang, Jiaren; Wang, Min; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhu, Xiaodong; Tao, Hua; He, Wei; Tien, Po; Gao, George F",Journal of immunology,511,28

In the present study, we demonstrate that mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide and to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) when compared with wild-type mice. Interestingly, in the CLP model, mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice efficiently cleared the bacteria despite an impaired recruitment of leukocytes, especially mononuclear cells. The increased lethality rate in these models correlates with an impaired production of interleukin (IL) 10 in vivo. Furthermore, macrophages from mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice activated with lipopolysaccharide also produced lower amounts of IL-10 and similar tumor necrosis factor compared with wild-type mice. We observed a drastic increase in the amounts of macrophage migration inhibitory factor at 6 and 24 h after CLP in mcp-1/ccl2-deficient mice. These results indicate that endogenous MCP-1/CCL2 positively regulates IL-10 but negatively controls macrophage migration inhibitory factor during peritoneal sepsis, thus suggesting an important immunomodulatory role for MCP-1/CCL2 in controlling the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in sepsis.","Gomes, Rachel N; Figueiredo, Rodrigo T; Bozza, Fernando A; Pacheco, Patrícia; Amâncio, Rodrigo T; Laranjeira, Andréa P; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo C; Bozza, Patrícia T; Bozza, Marcelo T",Shock,511,24

This may have physiological and clinical advantages when compared with pressure support ventilation (PSV). Our objective was to compare these two modes in patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation. DESIGN Prospective randomised controlled trial comparing PSV with PAV+. SETTING University-affiliated, tertiary referral intensive care unit (ICU). PARTICIPANTS Mechanically ventilated patients on a controlled mode of ventilation for at least 24 hours, who were anticipated to be spontaneously ventilated for at least 48 hours after randomisation. INTERVENTIONS Nil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was time to successful liberation from the ventilator after the commencement of a spontaneous mode of ventilation. Secondary outcomes were requirement of rescue (mandatory) ventilation, requirement of sedative drugs, requirement for tracheostomy, re-intubation within 48 hours of extubation, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and ICU and hospital mortality. RESULTS 50 patients were randomised to either PSV (n = 25) or PAV+ (n = 25). There was no significant difference between the PAV+ and PSV groups in time to successful weaning (84.3 v 135.9 hours, respectively; P = 0.536). Four patients randomised to PAV+ were crossed over to PSV during weaning. There was no significant difference between groups for rescue ventilation, reintubation within 48 hours, tracheostomy, sedatives and analgesics prescribed, and ICU and hospital LOS.

An alkaline antigen diluent (carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) used in initial experiments produced diffuse, nonspecific color reactions in both viral and control antigen cuvettes which were correlated, paradoxically, with coronavirus antibody levels in test sera. These interfering reactions were minimized by use of lower-pH antigen diluents such as water and phosphate-buffered saline. Background kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity directed against a noncoronaviral component of antigen tissue culture fluids could then detected in numerous sera, particularly in samples with lower titers. Much of this reactivity was shown to be associated with bovine gamma globulins in cell culture fluid. It was not serum lot or species specific, since a variety of bovine serum lots as well as individual lots of serum from other mammalian and avian species reacted. Reactivity was markedly reduced when cells for antigen preparation were grown in gamma globulin-free bovine serum. Generation of corrected slope values from the kinetics-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay made it possible to correct for residual background reactivity in individual test sera and thus eliminate a potentially major source of false-positive reactions. Collectively, these studies indicated that the control of nonspecific reactivity in feline coronavirus serology is absolutely essential to obtain useful estimates of specific antibody responses.","Barlough, J E; Jacobson, R H; Downing, D R; Marcella, K L; Lynch, T J; Scott, F W",Journal of clinical microbiology,511,30

METHODS The work is based upon the authors' experiences in and observations of these policy developments, as well as relevant government policy documents and legislation. RESULTS Both countries are experiencing HIV epidemics driven by injection drug use and have maintained generally severe policies towards injection drug users (IDUs). In recent years, however, they have also officially endorsed harm reduction. We sought to understand how and why this apparently surprising policy evolution took place. Factors associated with growing support for harm reduction were similar but not identical in China and Vietnam. These included the emergence of effective 'champions' for such policies, an ethos of pragmatism and receptivity to evidence, growing collaboration across public health, police and other sectors, the influence of contingent events such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and pressure from donors and international organizations to adopt best practice in HIV prevention. CONCLUSIONS Ongoing challenges and lessons learned include the persistence of tensions between drug control and harm reduction that may have negative effects on programs until a fully harmonized policy environment is established. Excessive reliance on law enforcement and forced detoxification will not solve the problems of substance abuse or of HIV among drug users. Ongoing evaluation of harm reduction programs, as well as increased levels of multi-sectoral training, collaboration and support are also needed.","Hammett, Theodore M; Wu, Zunyou; Duc, Tran Tien; Stephens, David; Sullivan, Sheena; Liu, Wei; Chen, Yi; Ngu, Doan; Des Jarlais, Don C",Addiction,511,24

Basic knowledge of amphotropic MuLV receptor expression is likely to be useful in the development and improvement of gene therapy protocols based on amphotropic-pseudotyped vectors. To investigate the expression of the human receptor for the amphotropic MuLV (GLVR-2, newly termed Pit2), we determined its mRNA levels in several cell lines and found them to vary significantly. Induction of increased levels of mRNA after removal of phosphate from the media was observed in two osteosarcoma cell lines. The increase in GLVR-2 mRNA resulted in a concomitant rise in the levels of a 71-kDa protein specifically recognized by affinity-purified antibodies against GLVR-2. Using these antibodies, we were able to confirm the intracellular topology of the large hydrophilic domain between the proposed sixth and seventh transmembrane domains of the GLVR-2 protein. This assignment is in agreement with the fourth extracellular loop being outside the cell, consistent with the proposal that the fourth extracellular loop of GLVR-2 contains the envelope binding site.","Chien, M L; Foster, J L; Douglas, J L; Garcia, J V",Journal of virology,511,20

In a great effort to standardize the management and treatment guidelines, the different health authorities and scientific associations have tried to issue recommendations on how to act in this new and complex scenario. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the existing evidence and recommendations about urological emergency surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Furthermore, we propose a general action protocol for these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The document is based ont he scarce evidence on SARS / Cov-2 and the experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Cantabria, Madrid and the Basque Country. A web and PubMed search was performed using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID19"", ""COVID Urology"", ""COVID19 surgery"" and ""emergency care"". A narrative review of the literature was carried out until April 30, 2020, including only articles and documents written in Spanish and English. After the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors on May 12, 2020. RESULTS General principles of action are set out, as well as specific recommendations for the most frequent urgent urological procedures. CONCLUSIONS Given the exceptional nature of the situation, there is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal management of the patient with urgent urological pathology. The information is changing, as the epidemiological knowledge of the disease advances. The establishment of multidisciplinary surgical committees that develop and implement action protocols appropriate to the different resources and particular situations of each center is recommended. Likewise, these committees must individually assess each possible urological surgical emergency situation and ensure compliance with protective measures for the patient and other healthcare personnel.","Puche-Sanz, Ignacio; Sabio-Bonilla, Almudena; Sánchez-Conde, Victor; Jiménez-Domínguez, Ana Cristina; Tamayo-Gómez, Alba; Vila-Braña, Pedro; Vázquez-Alonso, Fernando; Gómez Rivas, Juan; Gómez-Gómez, Enrique; Campos-Juanatey, Felix; García-Olaverri Rodríguez, Jorge; Flores-Martín, José; Moreno-Jiménez, Juan; Cózar-Olmo, José Manuel",Archivos espanoles de urologia,511,16

The feasibility of virus propagation in vivo is also limited by the handling of a number of samples at the same time. In this study, the detection of PEDV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is described. The RT-PCR could detect up to 10(4) TCID50/ml of PEDV and did not show any cross reaction with transmissible gastroenteritis virus or porcine rotavirus. Using this method, the detection of PEDV in experimentally inoculated piglets was possible as early as one day after inoculation. These results suggest that the RT-PCR could be applicable for a rapid diagnosis of PEDV infection.","Kweon, C H; Lee, J G; Han, M G; Kang, Y B",The Journal of veterinary medical science,511,24

Stroke as a singular manifestation of COVID-19 in absence of typical symptoms (fever, cough and dyspnea) is under- recognized. Objective Comparative study of clinical and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 stroke patients without typical symptoms at onset with stroke cases without COVID-19 infection. Methods 28consecutive stroke patients, eight with coronavirus infection and twenty without COVID-19 admitted to neurology department of a tertiary care centre of North West India between 20 June,2020 and 19 July,2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Results COVID-19 patients had higher frequency of seizures (4[50%]) vs 2[10%];p= 0.03)and altered mental status(6[75%] vs 6[30%] p= 0.04). Severity of ischemic stroke(NIHSS >20, 3[75 %] vs 2[18%])and mortality(p=0.04)despite comparable vascular risk factors for stroke between the two groups was higher in COVID-19 patients. Three out of four COVID-19 young strokes died. Two females with COVID-19 did not develop any typical symptoms, six males(75%) developed fever with dyspnea after a mean delay of 2.7 days(Standard deviation 1.7) from stroke onset.

In adults, HIV is certainly the most common cause of CD4 lymphocytopenia, but other causes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy, lymphoma and idiopathic forms need to be considered. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the poorly understood syndrome of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia. RECENT FINDINGS Little research has tried to systematically dissect this probably heterogeneic syndrome after its initial description in 1992. Numerous cases presenting with opportunistic infections have been reported. Disturbed differentiation of stem cell precursors may contribute to CD4 lymphocytopenia. Because infections and lymphoma may also cause CD4 lymphocytopenia, the distinction between cause and effect may evolve only during follow-up. SUMMARY The manifestation of opportunistic infections calls for the evaluation of the immune system for CD4 lymphocytopenia. The differential diagnosis of this condition in adults comprises primarily HIV infection and less often other diseases or drugs. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is very rare. The clinical significance of low CD4 cell counts in HIV negative patients still awaits its systematic analysis. Prophylaxis of opportunistic infections is oriented at the recommendations of HIV-infected individuals and causal treatment remains experimental.","Walker, Ulrich A; Warnatz, Klaus",Current opinion in rheumatology,511,16

While large prospective randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking at this point in time, smaller observational studies and case series are reviewed to ascertain the indications and utility of NMBAs. Additionally, large RCTs that address similar clinical scenarios are reviewed and the authors translate these findings to patients with COVID-19. Specifically, NMBAs can be helpful during endotracheal intubation to minimize the risk of patient coughing and possibly infecting healthcare personnel. NMBAs can also be used in patients to promote patient-ventilator synchrony while reducing the driving pressure needed with mechanical ventilation, particularly in patients with the severe clinical presentation (Type H phenotype). Prone positioning has also become a cornerstone in managing refractory hypoxemia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and NMB can be useful in facilitating this maneuver. In the perioperative setting, deep levels of neuromuscular blockade can improve patient outcomes during laparoscopic operations and may theoretically reduce the risk of aerosolization as lower insufflation pressures may be utilized. Regardless of the indication, quantitative neuromuscular monitoring remains the only reliable method to confirm adequate recovery following cessation of neuromuscular blockade. Such monitors may serve a unique purpose in patients with COVID-19 as automation of measurements can reduce healthcare personnel - patient contact that would occur during periodic subjective evaluation with a peripheral nerve stimulator.","Chaves-Cardona, Harold E; Hernandez-Torres, Vivian R; Kiley, Sean; Renew, J Ross",Korean j. anesthesiol.,511,23

This retrospective study assessed a total of 23,481 inpatient PSIRs from 22 medical facilities. We compared data on PSIRs between COVID-19 period (March-July 2020) and a comparable pre-COVID-19 period (March-July 2019). PSIRs were classified according to ""Saudi Patient Safety Taxonomy."" In the COVID-19 period: inpatient admissions have significantly dropped by one-fourth, and the median score of PSIRs significantly increased to 30.6/100 inpatients. Nevertheless, there were no changes in PSIRs harm level. The top five areas of reporting were related to: patient care, medication, infection control, staff, and facility maintenance. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the frequency rate of PSIRs by facility bed capacity. The significant increase in PSIRs at COVID-19 time can be perceived as a positive outcome.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of the registered COVID-19 trials has been performed on platforms including ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (CHiCTR), Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Britain's National Research Register (BNRR), Current Control Trials (CCT), and Glaxo Smith Kline Register. Trials registered at the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak are included, without language restrictions. For each study, the registration information, study design, and administrator information are collected and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 220 registered trials were evaluated as of February 27, 2020. Hospital-initiated trials were the majority and account for 80% of the sample. Among the trials, pilot studies and phase 4 trials are more common and represent 35% and 19.1% of the sample, respectively. The median sample size of the registered trials is 100, with interquartile range 60-240. Further, 45.9% of the trials mentioned information on a data monitoring committee. 54.5% of the trials did not specify the disease severity among patients they intend to recruit. Four types of interventions are most common in the experimental groups across the registered studies: antiviral drugs, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), biological agents, and hormone drugs. Among them, the TCM and biological agents are frequently used in pilot study and correspond to a variety of primary endpoints. In contrast, trials with antiviral drugs have more targeted primary outcomes such as ""COVID-19 nucleic acid test"" and ""28-day mortality."" CONCLUSIONS: We provide an evidence mapping and analysis of registered COVID-19 clinical trials in China. In particular, it is critical for ongoing and future studies to refine their research hypothesis and better identify their intervention therapies and the corresponding primary outcomes. It is also imperative for multiple public health divisions and research institutions to work together for integrative clinical data capture and sharing, with a common objective of improving future studies that evaluate COVID-19 interventions.","Lu, Liming; Li, Fan; Wen, Hao; Ge, Shuqi; Zeng, Jingchun; Luo, Wen; Wang, Lai; Tang, Chunzhi; Xu, Nenggui",BMC Med,511,16

The multiple regression analysis results indicated that environmental changes, work overload, somatic symptoms, insomnia, negative job expectations, and uncertainty constituted significant mental workload predictors. Insomnia, somatic symptoms, and negative job expectations constituted significant predictors for burnout. Differences between job positions and genders in mental workload and burnout were found. In conclusion, the uncertainty at work derived from the CoViD-19 pandemic harms fashion retailing workers' psychological well-being in Spain.","Rodríguez-López, Ana María; Rubio-Valdehita, Susana; Díaz-Ramiro, Eva María",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),511,14

We aimed to describe the changes in liver care before and after COVID-19 restricted access to health care. We obtained data on the number of liver clinic visits, abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging using electronic query or clinic registry at three medical centers in the United States, Japan, and Singapore for the following periods: February 1 to March 14, 2018, 2019, and 2020; and March 15 to May 1, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We performed trend analysis using logistic regression. In total, 14,403 visits were made to the liver clinics at the three centers: 5,900 in 2018, 5,270 in 2019, and 3,233 in 2020. Overall, there were no significant changes in the distribution of males and females between February 1 and May 1 from 2018 to 2020, but there was a lower proportion of seniors ages 65 years and older (P < 0.001). There were significant decreasing trends in the total number of liver clinic visits overall (p-trend = 0.038) and in the subanalysis for chronic hepatitis B, C, and other liver diseases. HCC/cirrhosis visits also dropped from 883 to 538 (39.07% decrease) overall and 665 to 355 (46.62% decrease) for the US site. In addition, there was a significant decreasing trend in the number of abdominal ultrasounds (P-trend = 0.004) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (P-trend = 0.007) performed overall. Conclusion: Liver clinic visits, hepatoma surveillance, and diagnostic abdominal imaging fell dramatically as social distancing measures were instituted.

The current study was undertaken to examine the impact of the pandemic on the employment of young adults with rheumatic disease and on perceptions of work and health. METHODS: Surveys were administered to young adults with rheumatic disease prior to and following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys asked about employment status and collected information on sociodemographic, disease/health, and work-context factors. Items also asked about the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on work and health. A generalized estimating equation model was fitted to examine the effect of the pandemic on employment. RESULTS: In total, 133 young adults completed the pre-COVID-19 pandemic survey (mean age 28.9 years, 82% women). When compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period, employment decreased from 86% to 71% following the pandemic, but no other changes were identified in sociodemographic, disease/health, or work-context factors. The time period following the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a 72% lower odds of employment compared to the pre-pandemic period (odds ratio 0.28 [95% confidence interval 0.11-0.71]). Those with a postsecondary education or who reported more mental job demands were more likely to be employed following the onset of the pandemic. Also, a majority of participants reported that the pandemic affected health care (83%), treatment access (54%), working conditions (92%), and occupational health and safety (74%). CONCLUSION: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic had socioeconomic implications for young people with rheumatic disease. To support economic recovery for individuals with rheumatic disease, strategies to promote employment should be designed that account for the young adult life phase and occupational characteristics.","Jetha, Arif; Tucker, Lori B; Chen, Cynthia; Gignac, Monique A M",Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),511,21

Despite these barriers, students had a suitable OL self-regulation level. Significantly higher self-regulation was observed among pre-clinical year students, students with higher grades, and students who had designated learning space at home. We found that high-immediacy and low-bandwidth applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram, and YouTube as the most accessible and easiest platforms to navigate in OL. Our qualitative findings yielded a conceptual model of OL enablers at learners, educators, and institution levels.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of desflurane and sevoflurane in patients with elevated preoperative liver functions undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: The study was a randomized study and included 162 patients classified randomly into two groups: Desflurane group: The patients received desflurane (end-tidal concentration 4%-6%) as an inhalational agent during the whole procedure. Sevoflurane group: The patients received sevoflurane (end-tidal concentration 2%-4%) as an inhalational agent during the whole procedure. The investigations included serum level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and total bilirubin. The values were serially collected at the following timepoints; T0:at the preoperative period, T1:directly after surgery, T2:1st postoperative day, T3:2nd postoperative day, T4:3rd postoperative day, T5:5th postoperative day, T6:7th postoperative day, and T7:10th postoperative day. The statistics were described in terms of mean ± standard deviation, frequencies, and percentages. Results: The preoperative liver enzymes and total bilirubin were higher than the normal range in patients of the two groups. Postoperatively, there was a decrease in the AST and ALT with desflurane more than sevoflurane from T1 to T6(P < 0.05). The ALP, GGT, and bilirubin decreased in patients of the two groups, but the comparison was insignificant (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The desflurane is a safe inhalational volatile for maintenance of anesthesia in patients with impaired liver function undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Sometimes, the lack of suppliers and the global shortage of these reagents, a consequence of the high demand, make it difficult to detect and diagnose patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting the control of virus spread. Many alternatives have enabled the continuous processing of samples and have presented a decrease in time and cost. These measures thus allow broad testing of the population and should be ideal for controlling the disease. In this sense, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection effectiveness by Real time RT-PCR using two different protocols for RNA extraction. The experiments were conducted in the National Institute of Health (INS) from Peru. We compared Ct values average (experimental triplicate) results from two different targets, a viral and internal control. All samples were extracted in parallel using a commercial kit and our alternative protocol-samples submitted to proteinase K treatment (3 µg/µL, 56°C for 10 minutes) followed by thermal shock (98°C for 5 minutes followed by 4°C for 2 minutes); the agreement between results was 100% in the samples tested. In addition, we compared the COVID-19 positivity between six epidemiological weeks: the initial two in that the Real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted using RNA extracted by commercial kit, followed by two other using RNA obtained by our kit-free method, and the last two using kit once again; they did not differ significantly. We concluded that our in-house method is an easy, fast, and cost-effective alternative method for extracting RNA and conducing molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.","Ñique, Adolfo Marcelo; Coronado-Marquina, Fiorella; Mendez Rico, Jairo Andrés; García Mendoza, María Paquita; Rojas-Serrano, Nancy; Simas, Paulo Vitor Marques; Cabezas Sanchez, Cesar; Drexler, Jan Felix",PLoS One,511,26

Using RT-qPCR, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample (n = 37) collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis. Although we detected evidence of viral RNA on 8 out of 70 breast skin swabs, only one was considered a conclusive positive result. In contrast, 76% of the milk samples collected from women with COVID-19 contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, and 80% had SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG. In addition, 62% of the milk samples were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro, whereas milk samples collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were unable to do so. Taken together, our data do not support mother-to-infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a beneficial source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.IMPORTANCE Results from prior studies assaying human milk for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, have suggested milk may act as a potential vehicle for mother-to-child transmission. Most previous studies are limited because they followed only a few participants, were cross-sectional, and/or failed to report how milk was collected and/or analyzed. As such, considerable uncertainty remains regarding whether human milk is capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child. Here, we report that repeated milk samples collected from 18 women following COVID-19 diagnosis did not contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated.

In this study, we prepared a series of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC)-MCs with nano and micron-scale capsule sizes (average diameters of 209.4 nm, MC-N; 2.41 µm, MC-S; 4.87 µm, MC-M; and 12.41 µm, MC-L). The assessment results showed that the release and sedimentation behavior of LC-MCs in water and toxicity to zebrafish at three life stages were all particle size-dependent. As the diameter distribution of approximately 100 nm extended to the micron scale (~27 µm), the capsules released more slowly and sunk more quickly in water. In addition, micron-sized LC-MC exposure resulted in significantly less fish mortality and malformations of larvae and embryos compared with nanosized LC-MC exposure. The highest accumulation of MC-N in the gill and the severest toxicity to larvae suggested that the smaller size and stronger permeability of nanocapsules would pose unpredictable consequences for nontargeted organisms. The obvious toxicological differences of LC-MCs toward aquatic organisms implies that regulating MC production in an appropriate size range is an important prerequisite for achieving efficient but safe pesticide applications.","Huang, Xueping; Wang, Aiping; Luo, Jian; Gao, Yue; Guan, Lei; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Feng; Mu, Wei; Li, Beixing",J Hazard Mater,511,16
217041,217041,217041,Breast Cancer Care During COVID-19 Pandemic,18.1744,5.904818,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgency of addressing an epidemic of obesity and associated inflammatory illnesses. Previous studies have demonstrated that interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and lifestyle interventions such as food and exercise may vary metabolic outcomes, contributing to obesity. However, there is a paucity of research relating outcomes from digital therapeutics to the inclusion of genetic data in care interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe and model the weight loss of participants enrolled in a precision digital weight loss program informed by the machine learning analysis of their data, including genomic data. It was hypothesized that weight loss models would exhibit a better fit when incorporating genomic data versus demographic and engagement variables alone. METHODS: A cohort of 393 participants enrolled in Digbi Health's personalized digital care program for 120 days was analyzed retrospectively. The care protocol used participant data to inform precision coaching by mobile app and personal coach. Linear regression models were fit of weight loss (pounds lost and percentage lost) as a function of demographic and behavioral engagement variables. Genomic-enhanced models were built by adding 197 SNPs from participant genomic data as predictors and refitted using Lasso regression on SNPs for variable selection. Success or failure logistic regression models were also fit with and without genomic data. RESULTS: Overall, 72.0% (n=283) of the 393 participants in this cohort lost weight, whereas 17.3% (n=68) maintained stable weight. A total of 142 participants lost 5% bodyweight within 120 days. Models described the impact of demographic and clinical factors, behavioral engagement, and genomic risk on weight loss. Incorporating genomic predictors improved the mean squared error of weight loss models (pounds lost and percent) from 70 to 60 and 16 to 13, respectively. The logistic model improved the pseudo R2 value from 0.193 to 0.285. Gender, engagement, and specific SNPs were significantly associated with weight loss. SNPs within genes involved in metabolic pathways processing food and regulating fat storage were associated with weight loss in this cohort: rs17300539_G (insulin resistance and monounsaturated fat metabolism), rs2016520_C (BMI, waist circumference, and cholesterol metabolism), and rs4074995_A (calcium-potassium transport and serum calcium levels). The models described greater average weight loss for participants with more risk alleles. Notably, coaching for dietary modification was personalized to these genetic risks. CONCLUSIONS: Including genomic information when modeling outcomes of a digital precision weight loss program greatly enhanced the model accuracy. Interpretable weight loss models indicated the efficacy of coaching informed by participants' genomic risk, accompanied by active engagement of participants in their own success. Although large-scale validation is needed, our study preliminarily supports precision dietary interventions for weight loss using genetic risk, with digitally delivered recommendations alongside health coaching to improve intervention efficacy.","Sinha, Ranjan; Kachru, Dashyanng; Ricchetti, Roshni Ray; Singh-Rambiritch, Simitha; Muthukumar, Karthik Marimuthu; Singaravel, Vidhya; Irudayanathan, Carmel; Reddy-Sinha, Chandana; Junaid, Imran; Sharma, Garima; Francis-Lyon, Patricia Alice",J Med Internet Res,511,33

A successful cannulation outcome when an AVF or arteriovenous graft (AVG) is used for the first time can be influenced by many factors, including access maturity, staff skill, and patient factors. This study examined AVF/AVG outcomes at initiation of HD across two major metropolitan public hospitals. METHODS: Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect data retrospectively for a cohort of all newly commencing ESRD HD starts during 2018 to identify cannulation outcomes in the first 6 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 117 patients included, AVG use was low (5%). Twenty-four percent of patients required a surgical intervention to salvage a poorly functioning AVF prior to commencing HD. About 32.5% of the cohort had an uneventful start with all successful cannulations. For the remainder of the cohort the number of treatments with unsuccessful cannulation ranged from 1 to 4 or more. About 36% required a surgical intervention for a poorly functioning AVF after commencing HD. Commencing HD with a CVC is associated with a lower likelihood of subsequent successful cannulation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Even in experienced centres, a subset of patients experienced complicated cannulation in the first 6 weeks of HD. Several areas of improvement could be considered for these patients; timely referral for access creation, post-operative surveillance to ensure AVF maturation inclusive of duplex ultrasonography, gentle induction using small gauge needles and low blood flows, and consideration of a single needle HD initiation pathway.","Hill, Kathleen; Xu, Qunyan; Jaensch, Ashleigh; Esterman, Adrian; Le Leu, Richard; Childs, Jessie; Juneja, Rajiv; Jesudason, Shilpanjali",J Vasc Access,511,26

In response, schools have shifted into online learning in developed societies while the developing world struggles to opt for online learning due to limited infrastructure and capacity and religious beliefs, in some communities, that discourage online learning. However, there has been a significant increase in the use of Social Media (SM) observed across developing and developed societies and religious communities amid physical distancing. This study was conducted to explore the possibility of SM use in online learning by exploring teachers' attitudes in relation to the effects of physical distancing and increased SM use, SM knowledge and religious leaders' SM use. In a quantitative investigation method, the researchers used a questionnaire as a primary tool to collect the data from 252 teachers of both public and private schools. Partial Least Square Structural Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as an analysis method to assess and measure the proposed model.

Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area. Moreover, Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis were performed to assess social indicators and environmental conditions which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19. Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city São Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density, and negatively correlated with social isolation rate, hence indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Finally, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be inversely correlated with both temperature and UV radiation. Together with recent literature our study suggests that the UV radiation provided by sunlight might contribute to depletion of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Urban, Rodrigo Custodio",,511,2

Like the SARS and influenza pandemics, there have been a large number of cases coinfected with other viruses, fungi, and bacteria, some of which originate from the oral cavity. Capnocytophaga, Veillonella, and other oral opportunistic pathogens were found in the BALF of the COVID-19 patients by mNGS. Risk factors such as poor oral hygiene, cough, increased inhalation under normal or abnormal conditions, and mechanical ventilation provide a pathway for oral microorganisms to enter the lower respiratory tract and thus cause respiratory disease. Lung hypoxia, typical symptoms of COVID-19, would favor the growth of anaerobes and facultative anaerobes originating from the oral microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 may aggravate lung disease by interacting with the lung or oral microbiota via mechanisms involving changes in cytokines, T cell responses, and the effects of host conditions such as aging and the oral microbiome changes due to systemic diseases. Because the oral microbiome is closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 co-infections in the lungs, effective oral health care measures are necessary to reduce these infections, especially in severe COVID-19 patients. We hope this review will draw attention from both the scientific and clinical communities on the role of the oral microbiome in the current global pandemic.","Bao, Lirong; Zhang, Cheng; Dong, Jiajia; Zhao, Lei; Li, Yan; Sun, Jianxun",Front.

Unintended consequences might be delays in treatment for other diseases and subsequent mortality. We examined national all-cause mortality comparing weeks 1-27 in 2020 and 2015-2019. This registry-based study used Danish national registry data until 5 July 2020. We examined all-cause mortality rates among all deaths recorded from 2015 to 2020 and among chronic conditions (cardiovascular (cardiac & circulatory), chronic pulmonary, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and diabetes), comparing each week in 2020 to weeks in 2015-2019. In 2020, there were 28,363 deaths in weeks 1-27 (30 December 2019-5 July 2020), the mean deaths in 2015-2019 were 28,630 deaths (standard deviation 784). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in weeks 3-10 of 2020 was low, peaking in week 14 (17.6 per 100,000 persons in week 9, 19.9 per 100,000 in week 14). Comorbidity prevalence among deceased individuals was similar in 2020 and 2015-2019: 71.1% of all deceased had a prior cardiovascular diagnosis, 30.0% of all deceased had a prior cardiac diagnosis. There were 493 deaths with COVID-19 in weeks 11-27, (59.8% male), and 75.1% had a prior cardiovascular diagnosis. Weekly mortality rates for pre-existing chronic conditions peaked in week 14, and then declined.

Due to the interrupted competition schedule and potentially decreased motivation, Paralympic athletes may be at risk for a highly disrupted training schedule, impacting their ability to prepare for the 2021 Games. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the training, diet, and fitness of Paralympic cyclists and triathletes. METHODS: Twenty-four paracyclists and one paratriathlete (15 females and 10 males; age 37.6 ± 9.3 years) completed two incremental exercise tests to assess sport-specific fitness and reported their training volume and intensity for a specified week prior to the pandemic (February) and again in March, April, and May (during pandemic). Participants also reported their dietary intake and sedentary screen time prior to and during the pandemic. RESULTS: The amount of time spent engaging in sedentary screen time increased from 4.5 to 6.1 h (p < .001). No effect of the pandemic was found for training volume (14.2 vs 12.5 h; p = .18), intensity (678 vs 650; p = .36), or dietary intake (p > .05). While fitness test duration was nominally increased for the second test (27.3 vs 27.9 min; p = .02), no difference was seen in fitness (average power output: 201 W vs 204 W; p = .5). CONCLUSION: Time spent engaging in sedentary screen time activities increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were no differences in training, fitness, or dietary intake over a short-term (3 months), demonstrating the resilience of these athletes.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Dalton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Disabil Health J,511,22

TRIAL DESIGN: Open-label, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness platform trial with response-adaptive randomization PARTICIPANTS: We will evaluate patients who meet the eligibility criteria stipulated by the COVID-19 mAB EUAs who receive mABs within the UPMC Health System, including infusion centers and emergency departments. EUA eligibility criteria include patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, <10 days of symptoms, and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization (elderly, obese, and/or with specific comorbidities). The EUA criteria exclude patients who require oxygen for the treatment of COVID-19 and patients already hospitalized for the treatment of COVID-19. We will use data collected for routine clinical care, including data entered into the electronic medical record and from follow-up calls. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The interventions are the COVID-19 specific mABs authorized by the EUAs. All aspects of mAB treatment, including eligibility criteria, dosing, and post-infusion monitoring, are as per the EUAs. As a comparative effectiveness trial, all patients receive mAB treatment, and the interventions are compared against each other. When U.S. government mAB policies change (e.g., FDA grants or revokes EUAs), UPMC Health System policies and the evaluated mAB interventions will accordingly change. From November 2020 to February 2021, FDA issued EUAs for three mAB treatments (bamlanivimab; bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab), and at trial launch on March 10, 2021 we evaluated all three. Due to a sustained increase in SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States resistant to bamlanivimab administered alone, on March 24, 2021 the U.S. Government halted distribution of bamlanivimab alone, and UPMC accordingly halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. On April 16, 2021, FDA revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy. At the time of manuscript submission, we are therefore evaluating the two mAB treatments authorized by EUAs (bamlanivimab and etesevimab; and casirivimab and imdevimab). MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is total hospital free days (HFD) at 28 days after mAB administration, calculated as 28 minus the number of days during the index stay (if applicable - e.g., for patients admitted to hospital after mAB administration in the emergency department) minus the number of days readmitted during the 28 days after treatment. This composite endpoint captures the number of days from the day of mAB administration to the 28 days thereafter, during which the patient is alive and free of hospitalization. Death within 28 days is recorded as -1 HFD, as the worst outcome. RANDOMISATION: We will start with equal allocation. Due to uncertainty in sample size, we will use a Bayesian adaptive design and response adaptive randomization to ensure ability to provide statistical inference despite variable sample size. When mABs are ordered by UPMC physicians as a generic referral order, the order is filled by UPMC pharmacy via therapeutic interchange. OPTIMISE-C19 provides the therapeutic interchange via random allocation. Infusion center operations teams and pharmacists use a mAB assignment application embedded in the electronic medical record to determine the random allocation. BLINDING (MASKING): This trial is open-label. However, outcome assessors conducting follow-up calls at day 28 are blinded to mAB assignment, and investigators are blinded to by-mAB aggregate outcome data until a statistical platform trial conclusion is reached. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Sample size will be determined by case volume throughout the course of the pandemic, supply of FDA authorized mABs, and by that needed to reach a platform trial conclusion of inferiority, superiority, or futility of a given mAB. The trial will continue as long as more than one mAB type is available under EUA, and their comparative effectiveness is uncertain. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol Version 1.0, February 24, 2021. Recruitment began March 10, 2021 and is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission. The estimated recruitment end date is February 22, 2022, though the final end date is dependent on how the pandemic evolves, mAB availability, and when final platform trial conclusions are reached. As noted above, due to U.S. Government decisions, UPMC Health System halted bamlanivimab monotherapy on March 31, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04790786 .

It has saved millions of lives and prevented disease worldwide and millions more have been spared the permanent disabilities caused by diseases such as polio and the long-term morbidity caused by other diseases such as measles. Despite the compelling evidence of the public health and economic value of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy has become a growing concern globally. By calling into question the safety and efficacy of vaccines, vaccine hesitancy threatens the progress made in combating morbidity and mortality including efforts to introduce COVID-19 vaccines. This paper a) examines key factors that drive limited demand for vaccines and vaccine hesitancy, (b) highlights the role of demand promotion for immunization and of risk communication and community engagement to address those challenges, (c) discusses vaccine demand and hesitancy in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and (d) makes recommendations for public health policy and programming for the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine and beyond.Recommendations include strengthen social listening and digital engagement to address the concerns of caregivers and healthcare professionals, improve the availability and use of social data for evidence-based programming, reinforce public trust in health institutions and service providers, mainstream demand for immunization, strengthen the communication competencies of health service providers, test and apply solutions based on behavioral insights to reinforce demand, engage regularly with local governments and local actors, and strengthen resilience and response capacities for diseases outbreaks and public health emergencies.","Obregon, Rafael; Mosquera, Mario; Tomsa, Sergiu; Chitnis, Ketan",J Health Commun,511,3

Older adults and people living with these comorbidities are at a greater risk for complications during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the negative impact of physical inactivity on immune function and showcase evidence that regular physical activity may be an effective strategy to counter some of the deleterious effects of social isolation.

Intestinal enteroids, which partially recreate the structure and function of intestinal villi-crypts, have many physiological similarities to the intestinal tissues in vivo. Enteroids exhibit advantages in studying the interactions between intestines and enteric pathogens. To create a novel infection model for PDCoV, we developed an in vitro system to generate porcine intestinal enteroids from crypts of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of pigs. Enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, stem cells, proliferating cells, and goblet cells were found in the differentiated enteroids. Replication of PDCoV was detected in the cultured enteroids by immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling demonstrated that PDCoV was present in Sox9-positive intestinal cells and Villin1-positive enterocytes. There were multiple cellular responses shown as changes of transcription of genes related to mucosal immunity, antiviral genes, and marker genes of stem cells and other cells in the enteroids infected with PDCoV. We conclude that the 2-D enteroids derived from porcine jejunum can be used as an in vitro multicellular model for the investigation of pathogenesis and host immune responses to porcine enteric pathogens, such as PDCoV.","Luo, Hao; Zheng, Jingyou; Chen, Yunlu; Wang, Tingjun; Zhang, Zhenning; Shan, Ying; Xu, Jidong; Yue, Min; Fang, Weihuan; Li, Xiaoliang",Front.

Thus, our aim was to assess, in a cohort of patients regularly followed up in a devoted outpatient clinic of Southern Italy, the association between their gastrointestinal symptoms changes, stress, and anxiety reported during the Italian lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients from the outpatient clinic of the University of Salerno, devoted to functional gastrointestinal disorders, selecting only patients for whom an evaluation was available in the last 6 months before the lockdown. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at each visit through standardized questionnaire and pooled in a database. On 45th days from the beginning of the lockdown, patients were re-assessed by phone with the same questionnaire. Anxiety and stress levels were assessed through a self-administered online questionnaire based on Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 test and Perceived Stress Scale 10 test. KEY RESULTS: The intensity-frequency scores of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms improved (Wilcoxon test <0.05). Higher anxiety levels had a higher risk of worsening chest pain (OR 1.3 [1.1-1.7]), waterbrash (OR 1.3 [1.0-1.7]), epigastric burning (OR 1.3 [1.0-1.6]), and abdominal pain (OR 1.6 [1.0-2.3]). When compared to the interval preceding the outbreak, half of the patients declared their symptoms remained unchanged, 13.6% worsened, and 36.4% improved.

Recent studies suggest that while the demand for public transport has decreased due to passengers’ inability to maintain physical distance inside this mode, the demand for private automobile and active transport modes (walking and cycling) has increased during the pandemic. Policymakers should take this opportunity given by the pandemic and encourage people to use active transport more in the new normal situation to achieve sustainable transportation outcomes. This study explores the expected change in active transport mode usage in the new normal situation in Bangladesh based on the data from a questionnaire survey. The study finds that 56% and 45% of the respondents were expected to increase travel by walking and cycling, respectively, during the new normal situation. On the other hand, 19% of the respondents were expected to do the opposite. The study further identifies the factors influencing the expected change in travel by active transport modes during the new normal situation by developing multinomial logistic regression models.

However, no studies examine how human infant amygdala connectivity relates to direct observations of novelty-evoked distress in human infants. The current study examines the link between amygdala connectivity and infant novelty-evoked distress using direct-observation of temperament. METHOD: At four-months of age infants' (N=90) novelty-evoked distress was assessed using a standardized reactivity assessment and parent-report. Within three weeks, resting state fMRI was collected in a subset of infants (n=34). Using a whole-brain voxel wise approach, we examine amygdala connectivity associated with positive and negative affect during the reactivity assessment. We then examined regions where the association of amygdala connectivity with negative affect was higher than with positive affect. Additionally, we examined associations between amygdala connectivity and parent-report of temperament. RESULTS: Greater amygdala-cingulate and amygdala-superior frontal gyrus connectivity was associated with lower positive affect during the reactivity assessment. Results further indicated that the association between amygdala-cingulate connectivity was greater for negative affect compared to positive affect. There were no significant associations between latency to approach novelty (as measured by parent-report) and amygdala connectivity. Validation analyses conducted using a large independent longitudinal sample (N=323) demonstrate that negative reactivity is associated with increased child-reported anxiety symptoms in adolescence. CONCLUSION: These results provide novel insight into the developmental pathophysiology of novelty-evoked distress. This is consistent with research linking an altered cognitive control mechanism to temperamental risk for anxiety.","Filippi, Courtney A; Ravi, Sanjana; Bracy, Maya; Winkler, Anderson; Sylvester, Chad M; Pine, Daniel S; Fox, Nathan A",J.

DESIGN: A correlational and cross-section research design was used to collect over 82,000 useable data points of historical workload data from the three unique systems on a medical-surgical unit in a midsized hospital in the southeast United States over a 60-day period. Data were collected prior to the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: Combined data were analyzed using JMP Pro version 12. Mean responses from two groups were compared using a t-test and those from more than two groups using analysis of variance. Logistic regression was used to determine the significance of impact each workload variable had on individual nurses' ability to administer medications successfully as measured by occurrence of NMs. FINDINGS: The mean outcome of each of the six workload factors measured differed significantly (p < .0001) among nurses. The mean outcome for all workload factors except the hours worked was found to be significantly higher (p < .0001) for those who committed an NM compared to those who did not. At least one workload variable was observed to be significantly associated (p < .05) with the occurrence or nonoccurrence of NMs in 82.6% of the nurses in the study. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of the nurses in our study, the occurrence of an NM was significantly impacted by at least one workload variable. Because the specific variables that impact performance are different for each individual nurse, decreasing only one variable, such as patient load, will not adequately address the risk for NMs. Other variables not studied here, such as education and experience, might be associated with the occurrence of NMs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the majority of nurses, different workload variables increase their risk for an NM, suggesting that interventions addressing medication errors should be implemented based on the individual's risk profile.","Campbell, Amy A; Harlan, Todd; Campbell, Matt; Mulekar, Madhuri S; Wang, Bin",J Nurs Scholarsh,511,26

The global pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in 2019-2021 has shown that new strains of viruses can widespread very quickly, causing disease and death, with significant socio-economic consequences. Therefore, the search for new methods of combating different pathogenic viruses is an urgent task, and strategies based on nanoparticles are of significant interest. This work demonstrates the antiviral adsorption (virucidal) efficacy of nanoparticles of porous silicon (PSi NPs) against various enveloped and non-enveloped pathogenic human viruses, such as Influenza A virus, Poliovirus, Human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, and Hepatitis virus. PSi NPs sized 60 nm with the average pore diameter of 2 nm and specific surface area of 200 m2/g were obtained by ball-milling of electrochemically-etched microporous silicon films. After interaction with PSi NPs, a strong suppression of the infectious activity of the virus-contaminated fluid was observed, which was manifested in a decrease in the infectious titer of all studied types of viruses by approximately 104 times, and corresponded to an inactivation of 99.99% viruses in vitro. This sorption capacity of PSi NPs is possible due to their microporous structure and huge specific surface area, which ensures efficient capture of virions, as confirmed by ELISA analysis, dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy images. The results obtained indicate the great potential of using PSi NPs as universal viral sorbents and disinfectants for the detection and treatment of viral diseases.","Osminkina, Liubov A; Agafilushkina, Svetlana N; Kropotkina, Ekaterina A; Saushkin, Nikolay Yu; Bozhev, Ivan V; Abramchuk, Sergei S; Samsonova, Jeanne V; Gambaryan, Alexandra S",,511,20

Previously its application to speech in noise has required separate knowledge about the speech and noise signals to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, a novel, blind equalization cancellation model is introduced that can use the mixed signals. This approach does not require any assumptions about particular sound source directions. It uses different strategies for positive and negative SNRs, with the switching between the two steered by a blind decision stage utilizing modulation cues. The output of the model is a single-channel signal with enhanced SNR, which we analyzed using the speech intelligibility index to compare speech intelligibility predictions. In a first experiment, the model was tested on experimental data obtained in a scenario with spatially separated target and masker signals. Predicted speech recognition thresholds were in good agreement with measured speech recognition thresholds with a root mean square error less than 1 dB. A second experiment investigated signals at positive SNRs, which was achieved using time compressed and low-pass filtered speech. The results demonstrated that binaural unmasking of speech occurs at positive SNRs and that the modulation-based switching strategy can predict the experimental results.","Hauth, Christopher F; Berning, Simon C; Kollmeier, Birger; Brand, Thomas",Trends Hear,511,25

Accidental or intentional foreign body insertions pose a diagnostic challenge to surgeons and put them in demanding circumstances for successful extraction. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 60-year-old male with alleged history of accidental foreign body insertion into the rectum. Radiographs showed a linear metallic foreign body with crooked end. Computed Tomography (CT) with rectal contrast revealed contrast extravasation indicating anterior wall perforation of upper rectum. Patient was taken urgently for exploration and foreign body removal. Intra-operatively, bladder was injured inadvertently. Primary repair of enterotomy and loop sigmoid-ostomy was done besides bladder repair. Patient tested positive for COVID-19. Patient was observed in critical care unit for two days. Post-operative period was unremarkable apart from midline abdominal wound gape for which secondary closure was done. Patient was discharged with urinary catheter in-situ. Patient followed-up with a normal cystourethrogram and a well-functioning stoma. Stoma closure after two months was uneventful. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A thorough history and clinical examination is required and one should raise a high index of suspicion of perforation in patients with rectal foreign bodies, which should be managed appropriately and promptly to prevent sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. Inadvertent bladder injuries are common with lower-midline incisions. However, give good results when repaired suitably.

Analysis of the molecular mechanisms associated with the clinical manifestations and severity of COVID-19 has identified several key points of immune dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For diabetic patients, factors including higher binding affinity and virus penetration, decreased virus clearance and decreased T cell function, increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation, and cytokine storm may make these patients susceptible to a more severe course of COVID-19 disease. Metabolic changes induced by diabetes, especially hyperglycemia, can directly affect the immunometabolism of lymphocytes in part by affecting the activity of the mTOR protein kinase signaling pathway. High mTOR activity can enhance the progression of diabetes due to the activation of effector proinflammatory subpopulations of lymphocytes and, conversely, low activity promotes the differentiation of T-regulatory cells. Interestingly, metformin, an extensively used antidiabetic drug, inhibits mTOR by affecting the activity of AMPK. Therefore, activation of AMPK and/or inhibition of the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway may be an important new target for drug therapy in COVID-19 cases mostly by reducing the level of pro-inflammatory signaling and cytokine storm. These suggestions have been partially confirmed by several retrospective analyzes of patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized for severe COVID-19.","Kamyshnyi, Olexandr Matskevych Victoriya Lenchuk Tetyana Strilbytska Olha Storey Kenneth Lushchak Oleh",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,511,30

However, they concentrated in learning without any interference from Facebook and took active role in extra-curricular activities, sports and games. Mental health positively influenced students' engagement while Facebook use enhanced mental health. Therefore, it is recommended that educators should make use of Google Classroom, WhatsApp and Zoom to support students' engagement.

While the need for social care rises, the ability of families and social care staff to provide support is reduced by illness and quarantine, implying reductions in staffing levels. Consequently, COVID-19 could seriously threaten care availability and quality. The government has sought volunteers to work in health and social care to help address the threat posed by staff shortages at a time of rising need, and the call has achieved an excellent response.

However, the evidence about how the pandemic has affected clinical management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, two common diseases worldwide, is lacking. We therefore aimed to examine the trends in the number of outpatients with thyroid disorders and their thyrotropin (TSH) levels before and during the pandemic in Japan. Methods: This cohort study included all patients aged ≥20 years who visited Ito Hospital, one of the largest hospitals that specialize in thyroid disorders in Japan, during 2019/1-2020/6. Our outcomes of interest were 1) trends in the aggregated number of visits at the clinic and 2) trends in average TSH levels from January 2019 to June 2020. The trends in TSH according to the clinic visit in early 2020 were assessed utilizing difference-in-difference models controlling for age, sex, and city of residence, stratified by each medication use (i.e., levothyroxine [LT4], antithyroid drug [ATD], potassium iodine [KI], or no medication). Results: During 2019/1-2020/6, we observed 517,412 visits at Ito Hospital for thyroid disorders, and the average number of visits per month was significantly decreased for both the first visits (1,995 in 2019 vs. 1,268 in 2020;reduction rate, 36%;p&amp;lt;0.001) and the follow-up visits (29,509 in 2019 vs. 21,959 in 2020;reduction rate, 26%;p&amp;lt;0.001). Among 15,455 patients who had been followed in 2019, we found a higher TSH at the follow-up visits during 2020/4-2020/6 among patients with LT4 who did not visit the clinic during 2020/1-2020/3 than those who did (difference-in-difference [95%CI]=+1.77 [1.25-2.29], p&amp;lt;0.001).

However, the characteristics of repositive results are still not well understood, leading to a lack of effective monitoring strategies. METHODS: In the present study, a total of 59 COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and the characteristics of the repositive samples were analyzed. RESULTS: The repositive rate in this cohort was 15.79%. The N gene was the main target gene that was positive in the repositive results as well as in the last positive results of all patients. The median duration from diagnosis to the last positive test was 20 days (IQR, 16-31 days), and the longest duration was 40 days. Repositivity was only observed in IgM single- or both IgM- and IgG-positive patients, instead of IgG single-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant proportion of repositives in the recovered COVID-19 patients, and increasing the required number of negatives for consecutive nucleic acid tests may reduce the incidence of repositives. The recommended monitoring strategy for repositivity is monitoring the N gene in IgM-positive patients. This can ensure high sensitivity while reducing the time and cost of nucleic acid detection.","Zhang, Xuzhao; Li, Min; Zhang, Bin; Chen, Tao; Lv, Dong; Xia, Pengfei; Sun, Zhuanyi; Shentu, Xiaoyan; Chen, Haiyan; Li, Libin; Qian, Wenbin",Clin Chim Acta,511,16

OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between asthma diagnosis and endotype and clinical outcomes among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of outpatients and inpatients presenting to 6 hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System New York metropolitan region between March 7, 2020, and June 7, 2020, with COVID-19 infection, with and without a history of asthma. The primary outcome evaluated was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. The outcomes were compared in patients with or without asthma using a multivariate Cox regression model. The outcomes stratified by blood eosinophilia count were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of 10,523 patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection, 4902 were hospitalized and 468 had a diagnosis of asthma (4.4%). When adjusted for COVID-19 disease severity, comorbidities, and concurrent therapies, patients with asthma had a lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.64 (0.53-0.77); P < .001) and a lower rate of hospitalization and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.43 (0.28-0.64); P < .001 and OR, 0.51 (0.41-0.64); P < .001, respectively). Those with blood eosinophils greater than or equal to 200 cells/µL, both with and without asthma, had lower mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma may be at a reduced risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19 infection.

As a result, novel vaccine approaches are needed to generate long-lasting and universal broadly cross-reactive immunity against distinct influenza virus strains and subtypes. Several new vaccine candidates are currently under development and/or in clinical trials. The successful development of new vaccines requires testing in animal models, other than mice, which capture the complexity of the human immune system. Importantly, following vaccination or challenge, the assessment of adaptive immunity at the antigen-specific level is particularly informative. In this study, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cynomolgus macaques, we describe detection methods and in-depth analyses of influenza virus-specific B cells by recombinant hemagglutinin probes and flow cytometry, as well as the detection of influenza virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells by stimulation with live influenza A virus and intracellular cytokine staining. We highlight the potential of these assays to be used with PBMCs from other macaque species, including rhesus macaques, pigtail macaques and African green monkeys. We also demonstrate the use of a human cytometric bead array kit in detecting inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from cynomolgus macaques to assess cytokine/chemokine milieu. Overall, the detection of influenza virus-specific B and T cells, together with inflammatory responses, as described in our study, provides useful insights for evaluating novel influenza vaccines.

Doubts have been raised regarding lipid therapy in these patients. The objectives are to analyze the efficacy and safety of lipid lowering therapy in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the scientific literature was conducted in PubMed, CDC Reports, NIH, and NCBI SARS-CoV-2 using the keywords: COVID-2, statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, hypercholesterolemia, and hypolipidemic drugs. RESULTS: The statins should continue to use patients with COVID-19 based on their efficacy, safety, immunosuppressive effects, anti-inflammatory availability and accessibility. Depending on the cardiovascular risk levels of these patients, the use of high potency statins and/or ezetimibe and/or iPCSK9 may be necessary in patients with high and very high cardiovascular risk. Patients treated with iPCSK9 should continue treatment for its beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and COVID-19 are especially vulnerable to cardiovascular disease and should continue to receive severe lipid lowering therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, the majority of baseline CVDs are of atherosclerotic origin, with the worst prediction for patients with high risk and very high risk of CVD. In these patients, intensive treatment with statins and/or fixed combination with ezetimibe and/or iPCSK9 plays a fundamental role.","Frías Vargas, M; Díaz Rodríguez, A; Díaz Fernández, B","SEMERGEN, Soc.

This study assessed the level of knowledge on SARS-COV-2 infection prevention, transmission and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as perceptions regarding prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection among allied radiation medicine professionals. Cross-sectional descriptive survey was carried out among 145 radiation medicine professionals in Ghana using facts on COVID-19 as presented on the website of the World Health Organization and data was analyzed based on weighted average indices. Overall, the extent of knowledge among allied radiation medicine professionals on the symptoms of COVID-19, transmission and control of SARS-COV-2 infection in radiation medicine facilities were all adequate, with weighted average indices of 3.8, 4.1 and 4.4 respectively. However, overall perception of the respondents regarding the use of radiation medicine procedures in management of COVID-19 was diverse, with weighted index of 3.5. The facts about COVID-19 that were identified to be most known were shortness of breath being a serious symptom of the disease and fever being a common symptom. The extent of knowledge on the fact that ""SARS-COV-2 infection can be transmitted through small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person"" was almost excellent, with weighted average index of 4.9. Also, the thinking that provision of hand washing and sanitizing facilities is a measure for controlling the infection was almost perfectly shared among the respondents. Computed tomography was perceived by majority of the respondents as the most preferred imaging modality for screening patients for COVID-19.

METHODS: Four sample treatments were evaluated in a 3-step procedure to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva: 1) heating at 95 °C for 5 min for sample inactivation; 2) sample treatment; 3) analysis by reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Saliva samples used were from infected individuals or were spiked with known quantities of viral particles. RESULTS: Three treatments had a limit of detection (LOD) of 500.000 viral particles per ml of saliva and could be used to detect individuals with potential to transmit the disease. The treatment of phosphate buffer, dithiothreitol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and proteinase K, with an additional 95 °C heating step, yielded a lower LOD of 95; its sensitivity ranged from 100% in patients with nasopharyngeal swab reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values <20 to 47.8% for values >30. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance of an adequate sample treatment for saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 and describes a flexible procedure that can be adapted to point-of-care. Although its sensitivity when LAMP is used is lower than reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, this procedure can contribute to COVID-19 control by detecting individuals able to transmit the disease.","Rubio, Camila P; Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Resalt, Cristina Sánchez; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Martinez-Morata, Irene; Bernal, Enrique; Alcaraz, María J; Vicente-Romero, María R; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Cerón, José J",Int J Infect Dis,511,30

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal cohort study; seven fortnightly online surveys of a representative sample of 1296 Australian adults from the beginning of COVID-19-related restrictions in late March 2020 to mid-June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of depression and anxiety, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales; trajectories of symptom change. RESULTS: Younger age, being female, greater COVID-19-related work and social impairment, COVID-19-related financial distress, having a neurological or mental illness diagnosis, and recent adversity were each significantly associated with higher baseline depression and anxiety scores. Growth mixture models identified three latent trajectories for depression symptoms (low throughout the study, 81% of participants; moderate throughout the study, 10%; initially severe then declining, 9%) and four for anxiety symptoms (low throughout the study, 77%; initially moderate then increasing, 10%; initially moderate then declining, 5%; initially mild then increasing before again declining, 8%). Factors statistically associated with not having a low symptom trajectory included mental disorder diagnoses, COVID-19-related financial distress and social and work impairment, and bushfire exposure.

Patients who suffer from it frequently have hyperglycemia and coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death. The comorbidities associated with diabetes are overweight and obesity, systemic arterial hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and in some patients peripheral vascular disease, kidney damage, neuropathy and retinopathy. Chronic lack of control of the disease is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, which generally have few symptoms, but hyperglycemia is generally magnified, which worsens the course of infections. Since December 2019, when the disease caused by one of the coronaviruses (coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-2) was identified and has been called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there have been some reports that associate the presence of diabetes with an increased risk of mortality.

The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify circPITX1, miR-584-5p, and karyopherin b1 (KPNB1) expression in GBM tissues and cells. The proliferation capability of cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony-forming assays. The matrigel angiogenesis assay was used to assess tube formation in GBM cells. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to evaluate the cell cycle distribution of GBM cells. The migration and invasion assays were assessed by transwell assay. The Western blot assay was employed to quantify the protein expression level in GBM tissues and cells. The targets of circPITX1 and miR-584-5p were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. A xenograft experiment in nude mice was used to assess the functional role of circPITX1 in vivo. CircPITX1 was obviously overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells when compared with negative groups. The functional experiment implied that knockdown of circPITX1 suppressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and tumor growth in vivo along with induced cell cycle arrest of GBM cells. Furthermore, miR-584-5p was a target gene of circPITX1, and knockdown of miR-584-5p could abolish circPITX1 silencing-induced effects on GBM cells. KPNB1 was a target gene of miR-584-5p, and functional experiments revealed that overexpression of miR-584-5p repressed proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process in GBM cells by targeting KPNB1. Mechanistically, circPITX1/miR-584-5p/KPNB1 axis regulated GBM process via mediating proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle process of GBM cells.","Cao, Yiqiang; Wang, Fei; Chen, Yu; Wang, Yonggang; Song, Hai; Long, Jiang",J. mol. neurosci,511,10

We performed the first systematic and comprehensive LUS evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, in order to describe LUS findings and their association with clinical course and outcome. METHODS: Between 21/03/2020 and 04/05/2020, 120 consecutive patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center due to COVID-19, underwent complete LUS within 24 h of admission. A second exam was performed in case of clinical deterioration. LUS score of 0 (best)-36 (worst) was assigned to each patient. LUS findings were compared with clinical data. RESULTS: The median baseline total LUS score was 15, IQR [7-20]. Baseline LUS score was 0-18 in 80 (67%) patients, and 19-36 in 40 (33%) patients. The majority had patchy pleural thickening (n = 100; 83%), or patchy subpleural consolidations (n = 93; 78%) in at least one zone. The prevalence of pleural thickening, subpleural consolidations and the total LUS score were all correlated with severity of illness on admission. Clinical deterioration was associated with increased follow-up LUS scores (p = 0.0009), mostly due to loss of aeration in anterior lung segments. The optimal cutoff point for LUS score was 18 (sensitivity = 62%, specificity = 74%). Both mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation were increased with baseline LUS score > 18 compared to baseline LUS score 0-18. Unadjusted hazard ratio of death for LUS score was 1.08 per point [1.02-1.16], p = 0.008; Unadjusted hazard ratio of the composite endpoint (death or need for invasive mechanical ventilation) for LUS score was 1.12 per point [1.05-1.2], p = 0.0008. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19, at all clinical grades, present with pathological LUS findings. Baseline LUS score strongly correlates with the eventual need for invasive mechanical ventilation and is a strong predictor of mortality. Routine use of LUS may guide patients' management strategies, as well as resource allocation in case of surge capacity.","Lichter, Yael; Topilsky, Yan; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Hochstadt, Aviram; Merdler, Ilan; Gal Oz, Amir; Vine, Jacob; Goren, Or; Cohen, Barak; Sapir, Orly; Granot, Yoav; Mann, Tomer; Friedman, Shirley; Angel, Yoel; Adi, Nimrod; Laufer-Perl, Michal; Ingbir, Merav; Arbel, Yaron; Matot, Idit; Szekely, Yishay",Intensive Care Med,511,16

On the announcement of the COVID-19 health emergency, the Marrakesh School of Medicine accelerated the digitization and the establishment of courses available to students through the faculty platform. We aimed to describe the students’ perspectives toward the online educational approach implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the factors that might affect the implementation of online teaching in the future. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study among medical students in Marrakesh during June-July 2020. Data collection was based on a self-administered electronic questionnaire distributed via the student platform. We studied the knowledge and previous practices of virtual technologies and students’ appreciation of distance learning during the lockdown. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS16.0 software. Results. A total of 111 students participated. The female-to-male sex ratio was 2.2 with an average age of 20.6 ± 1.8. The majority of students felt that they had a good knowledge of virtual technologies (on a scale of 1 to 10, 81% ≥ 5/10), and two-thirds reported using them in medical studies. Before the COVID-19 lockdown, 16.2% of the students used the platform and 39.6% did not attend in-person courses (16.0% in 1st cycle versus 49.2% in 2nd cycle, p=0.01). During the pandemic, 79% of the students appreciated the virtual learning (54.0% in 1st cycle versus 89.0% in 2nd cycle, p&lt;0.001) and 80.2% thought that the online courses were understandable. Regarding to student’s preferences, 41.4% preferred blended education and 68.5% of the students would recommend continuing distance learning after the pandemic. Regarding satisfaction, previous use of the educational platform (OR = 66.3, CI 95% [1.9;2.2∗103]), improvement of learning during distance learning (OR = 22.6, IC 95% [4.1, 123.7]), and professor support (OR = 7, IC95% [1.3, 38]) seemed to be the most powerful factors in the multivariate analysis.

However, vaccine supplies are limited, and there are concerns about side-effects, particularly with the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine. OBJECTIVES: To report our first experience of pwMS receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: Service evaluation. pwMS using the MS service at Barts Health NHS Trust were sent questionnaires to report symptoms following vaccination. RESULTS: Thirty-three responses were returned, 29/33 pwMS received a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, the remaining four received a first dose of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. All but two patients (94%) reported any symptoms including a sore arm (70%), flu-like symptoms (64%), fever (21%), fatigue (27%), and headache (21%). In more than 2/3 patients, symptoms lasted up to 48 hours, and with the exception of two pwMS reporting symptom duration of 10 and 12 days, respectively, symptoms in the remainder resolved within seven days. No severe adverse effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: pwMS report transient symptoms following AstraZeneca vaccination, characteristics of which were similar to those reported in the non-MS population. Symptoms may be more pronounced in pwMS due to the temperature-dependent delay in impulse propagation (Uhthoff's phenomenon) due to demyelination.","Allen-Philbey, K; Stennett, A; Begum, T; Johnson, A C; Dobson, R; Giovannoni, G; Gnanapavan, S; Marta, M; Smets, I; Turner, B P; Baker, D; Mathews, J; Schmierer, K",Mult Scler Relat Disord,511,16

First, the theoretical pI values, based on the amino acid (AA) sequences of the proteins, were calculated using the ProtParam tool from the Bioinformatics Resource Portal ExPASy. The proteins were then measured with the Maurice imaged CIEF system (native fluorescence detection), testing various measurement conditions, such as different ampholytes or ampholyte mixtures. Due to isoforms, we get sections with several peaks and not just one peak for each protein. The determined pI range for the RBD/Fc is 8.24-9.32 (theoretical pI: 8.55), for the RBD/His it is 7.36-9.88 (8.91) and for the S1/His it is 7.30-8.37 (7.80). The pI range of the S1/S2/His is 4.41-5.87 (no theoretical pI, AA sequence unknown) and for hACE2/His, the determined global range is 5.19-6.11 (5.60) for all experimental conditions chosen. All theoretically derived values were found within these ranges, usually close to the center. Therefore, we consider theoretical values as useful to make predictions about the isoelectric points of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The experimental conditions had only a minor influence on the pI ranges obtained and mainly influenced the peak shapes.","Krebs, Finja; Scheller, Christin; Grove-Heike, Kristina; Pohl, Lena; Wätzig, Hermann",Electrophoresis,511,16

Here, we report preliminary results on the efficacy and safety of Gam-COVID-Vac from the interim analysis of this phase 3 trial. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 25 hospitals and polyclinics in Moscow, Russia. We included participants aged at least 18 years, with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG and IgM tests, no infectious diseases in the 14 days before enrolment, and no other vaccinations in the 30 days before enrolment. Participants were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive vaccine or placebo, with stratification by age group. Investigators, participants, and all study staff were masked to group assignment. The vaccine was administered (0·5 mL/dose) intramuscularly in a prime-boost regimen: a 21-day interval between the first dose (rAd26) and the second dose (rAd5), both vectors carrying the gene for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein S. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 from day 21 after receiving the first dose. All analyses excluded participants with protocol violations: the primary outcome was assessed in participants who had received two doses of vaccine or placebo, serious adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose at the time of database lock, and rare adverse events were assessed in all participants who had received two doses and for whom all available data were verified in the case report form at the time of database lock. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04530396). FINDINGS: Between Sept 7 and Nov 24, 2020, 21â977 adults were randomly assigned to the vaccine group (n=16â501) or the placebo group (n=5476). 19â866 received two doses of vaccine or placebo and were included in the primary outcome analysis. From 21 days after the first dose of vaccine (the day of dose 2), 16 (0·1%) of 14â964 participants in the vaccine group and 62 (1·3%) of 4902 in the placebo group were confirmed to have COVID-19; vaccine efficacy was 91·6% (95% CI 85·6-95·2). Most reported adverse events were grade 1 (7485 [94·0%] of 7966 total events). 45 (0·3%) of 16â427 participants in the vaccine group and 23 (0·4%) of 5435 participants in the placebo group had serious adverse events; none were considered associated with vaccination, with confirmation from the independent data monitoring committee. Four deaths were reported during the study (three [<0·1%] of 16 427 participants in the vaccine group and one [<0·1%] of 5435 participants in the placebo group), none of which were considered related to the vaccine. INTERPRETATION: This interim analysis of the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91·6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort.

Even celebrities and public figures often share their opinions on a variety of topics through OSM platforms. One such subject that has gained a lot of coverage on Twitter is the Novel Coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, which has become a pandemic and has sparked a crisis in human history. In this study, we examine 29 million tweets over three months to study highly influential users, whom we refer to as leaders. We recognize these leaders through social network techniques and analyse their tweets using text analysis. Using a community detection algorithm, we categorize these leaders into four clusters: research, news, health, and politics, with each cluster containing Twitter handles (accounts) of individual users or organizations. e.g., the health cluster includes the World Health Organization (@WHO), the Director-General of WHO (@DrTedros), and so on. The emotion analysis reveals that (i) all clusters show an equal amount of fear in their tweets, (ii) research and news clusters display more sadness than others, and (iii) health and politics clusters are attempting to win public trust. According to the text analysis, the (i) research cluster is more concerned with recognizing symptoms and the development of vaccination;(ii) news and politics clusters are mostly concerned with travel. We then show that we can use our findings to classify tweets into clusters with a score of 96% AUC ROC.","Goel, Rahul Sharma Rajesh",Social Network Analysis and Mining,511,24

Low- and middle-income country (LMIC) facilities often suffer from restrictions in availability of human resources, laboratory testing, medications, and imaging during routine functioning, and such shortages may worsen during times of surge. Low- and middle-income country healthcare providers will need contextually appropriate tools to identify and triage potential COVID-19 patients. We report on a series of LMIC-appropriate recommendations and suggestions for screening and triage of COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on a pragmatic, experience-based appraisal of existing literature. We recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease. We recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility. We recommend that, following screening and implementation of appropriate universal source control measures, suspected COVID-19 patients be triaged with a triage tool appropriate for the setting. We recommend a standardized severity score based on the WHO COVID-19 disease definitions be assigned to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients before their disposition from the emergency unit. We suggest against using diagnostic imaging to improve triage of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, unless a patient has worsening respiratory status. We suggest against the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound to improve triage of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients who are RT-PCR negative but have moderate to severe symptoms and are suspected of a false-negative RT-PCR with high risk of disease progression.

The European Union (EU) has developed what remains largely contractual and decentralized international procurement cooperation. The corona crisis has broadened and deepened public debate on such cooperation, in particular on the scope of cooperation, solidarity in the allocation of such cooperation, and delegation of cooperative decision-making. Crucial to political debate about these issues are public attitudes that constrain and undergird international cooperation. METHODS: Our survey includes a randomized survey experiment (conjoint analysis) on a representative sample in five European countries in March 2020, informed by legal and policy debate on medical cooperation. Respondents choose and rate policy packages containing randomized mixes of policy attributes with respect to the scope of medicines covered, the solidarity in conferring priority access and the level of delegation. RESULTS: In all country populations surveyed, the experiment reveals considerable popular support for European cooperation. Significant majorities preferred cooperation packages with greater rather than less scope of medicines regulated; with priority given to most in-need countries; and with delegation to EU-level rather than national expertise. CONCLUSION: Joint procurement raises delicate questions with regard to its scope, the inclusion of cross-border solidarity and the delegation of decision-making, that explain reluctance toward joint procurement among political decision-makers. This research shows that there is considerable public support across different countries in favor of centralization, i.e. a large scope and solidarity in the allocation and delegation of decision-making.","Beetsma, Roel; Burgoon, Brian; Nicoli, Francesco; de Ruijter, Anniek; Vandenbroucke, Frank",Eur. j. public health,511,24

This study examined the factors associated with difficulties in accessing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey of 236 Chinese-speaking gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong conducted in 2020. RESULTS: Among those who expressed a need to access HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic, 22.9%, 33.9% and 43.2% indicated moderate-to-high, mild and no difficulties in accessing these services, respectively. Difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively related to concerns about potential COVID-19 infection, experience of actual impact on health because of COVID-19, disruption in work/studies, and reduced connection to the LGBT+ community during the pandemic. It was also found that difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively associated with frequency of having sex with casual partners, but were not significantly associated with frequency of having sex with regular partners. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel empirical evidence for understanding difficulties in accessing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it has developed into a global pandemic in just a few months. Antibody testing is an effective method to supplement the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, multicentre studies are lacking to support the understanding of the seroprevalence and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 epidemic regions. METHOD: A multicentre cross-sectional study of suspected and confirmed patients from 4 epidemic cities in China and a cohort study of consecutive follow-up patients were conducted from 29/01/2020 to 12/03/2020. IgM and IgG antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2 were tested by a chemiluminescence assay. Clinical information, including basic demographic data, clinical classification, and time interval from onset to sampling, was collected from each centre. RESULTS: A total of 571 patients were enrolled in the cross-sectional study, including 235 COVID-19 patients and 336 suspected patients, each with 91.9%:2.1% seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 92.3%:5.4% seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in COVID-19 patients was over 70% less than 7 days after symptom onset. Thirty COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the cohort study and followed up for 20 days. The peak concentrations of IgM and IgG were reached on the 10th and 20th days, respectively, after symptom onset. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 IgG and IgM increased along with the clinical classification and treatment time delay.

In this Editorial the different aspects of changes in our routine are described, based on the experience of this Editor in Germany. I will try to give you a bit of background information first, as the situation is very much dependent on the specific phase of the pandemic and your place of work. The experience for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in New York or Madrid may differ from that of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in Singapore, or South Korea. As Europe is, at least at the moment, the most affected continent, it hopefully is an interesting topic for all of you. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member. Most countries have stopped elective surgeries and by that relegated Orthopaedic surgeons to a minimum of work. Keeping contact to patients with digital tools might be an option to achieve an organised restart after the end of the lock down period and to keep treating patients through that phase. For many Orthopaedic surgeons, the principal task now is being part of an interdisciplinary team that is headed by colleagues from Internal Medicine or Anaesthesiology. Wards from the Orthopaedic department are reorganised as quarantine wards for Covid-19 patients. Worldwide all conferences have been cancelled and nobody knows for how long this will continue. Education now has become fully digital, allowing to present and communicate without real limitations compared to conventional conferences. Some teaching options, such as hands-on workshops, fellowships, etc. are ceased and cannot be replaced by digital options. Due to social distancing families are spending much more time together than before, while some family members, especially the people at risk (elders, ones with a fragile health) cannot be visited for a long time. Get togethers with friends as well as community meetings are completely suspended. For some of them, digital technology is the only option to minimize the problem of social distancing. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as an Orthopaedic Surgeon are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As nobody knows how long these restrictions need to remain in place we have to accept them and work on improving this specific situation by following the rules. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed in the near future, allowing us to return to a “normal” life. Nevertheless, it will never be like it was before.","Graichen, Heiko",J. Orthop.,511,27

However, it is unknown whether lipid levels have improved and there are potential sequlae in recovered patients. OBJECTIVE: In this follow-up study, we evaluated serum lipidemia and various physiopathological laboratory values in recovered patients. METHODS: A 3-6 month follow-up study was performed between June 15 and September 3, 2020, to examine serum levels of laboratory values in 107 discharged COVID-19 patients (mild = 59; severe/critical = 48; diagnoses on admission). Sixty-one patients had a revisit chest CT scan. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze changes in laboratory values at admission and follow-up. RESULTS: LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). LDL-c levels were significantly higher at follow-up than at admission in mild cases (p < 0.05). Coagulation and liver functional values were significantly improved at follow-up than at admission for patients (p < 0.05). Increases in HDL-c significantly correlated with increases in numbers of white blood cells (p < 0.001) during patients' recovery. With exclusion of the subjects taking traditional Chinese medicines or cholesterol-lowering drugs, LDL-c and HDL-c levels were significantly increased at follow-up than at admission in severe/critical cases (p < 0.05). Residue lesions were observed in CT images in 72% (44 of 61) of follow-up patients. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements of LDL-c, HDL-c, liver functions, and incomplete resolution of lung lesions were observed at 3-6 month follow-up for recovered patients, indicating that a long-term recovery process could be required and the development of sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis could be expected in some patients.","Li, Guiling; Du, Li; Cao, Xiaoling; Wei, Xiuqi; Jiang, Yao; Lin, Yuqi; Nguyen, Vi; Tan, Wenbin; Wang, Hui",BMC Infect Dis,511,17

METHODS: This is a multicenter, observational study from a prospectively collected database of consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 36 Spanish and Andorran intensive care units (ICUs) who received HFNO on ICU admission during a 22-week period (March 12-August 13, 2020). Outcomes of interest were factors on the day of ICU admission associated with the need for endotracheal intubation. We used multivariable logistic regression and mixed effects models. A predictive model for endotracheal intubation in patients treated with HFNO was derived and internally validated. RESULTS: From a total of 259 patients initially treated with HFNO, 140 patients (54%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Baseline non-respiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [odds ratio (OR) 1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.35], and the ROX index calculated as the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to inspired oxygen fraction divided by respiratory rate (OR 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37-0.72), and pH (OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24-0.86) were associated with intubation. Hospital site explained 1% of the variability in the likelihood of intubation after initial treatment with HFNO. A predictive model including non-respiratory SOFA score and the ROX index showed excellent performance (AUC 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Among adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 initially treated with HFNO, the SOFA score and the ROX index may help to identify patients with higher likelihood of intubation.","Mellado-Artigas, Ricard; Mujica, Luis Eduardo; Ruiz, Magda Liliana; Ferreyro, Bruno Leonel; Angriman, Federico; Arruti, Egoitz; Torres, Antoni; Barbeta, Enric; Villar, Jesús; Ferrando, Carlos",J Intensive Care,511,18

In austere locations in which testing, resupply, and evacuation have been limited or impossible, unique challenges exist. This case series demonstrates the importance of population isolation in preventing disease from overwhelming medical assets. METHODS: This is a case series describing the outbreak of COVID-19 in an isolated population in Africa. The population consists of a main population with a Role 2 capability, with several supported satellite populations with a Role 1 capability. Outbreaks in five satellite population centers occurred over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic from its start on approximately 1 March 2020 until 28 April 2020, when a more robust medical asset became available at the central evacuation hub within the main population. RESULTS: Population movement controls and the use of telehealth prevented the spread within the main population at risk and enabled the setup of medical assets to prepare for anticipated widespread disease. CONCLUSION: Isolation of disease in the satellite populations and treating in place, rather than immediately moving to the larger population center's medical facilities, prevented widespread exposure. Isolation also protected critical patient transport capabilities for use for high-risk patients. In addition, this strategy provided time and resources to develop infrastructure to handle anticipated larger outbreaks.","Hall, Andrew B; Dixon, Michael; Dennis, Andrew J; Wilson, Ramey L",J Spec Oper Med,511,7

Member States' divergent responses to this crisis reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe. At best, this undermines the effectiveness of health protection within the European Union (EU). At worst, it risks breaking up the Union altogether. Divergent national responses to COVID-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy, and thus cannot be completely avoided. In this article, we argue that these responses should be better coordinated. Without coordination, the price for diversity is high. Firstly, there are damaging spill-overs between Member States, which undermine key pillars of European integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods. Secondly, national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups. Our proposal is that the EU indicates - not mandates - a European exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of COVID-19. In particular, the EU should help Member States procure and validate tests for infection and immunity. The EU should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work, thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods. We see a great advantage in such EU guidance_ it could improve mutual learning between Member States, which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons. Although the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation, the EU can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for Europe to resurrect united from the ashes of COVID-19.","Pacces, Alessio M.; Weimer, Maria",Eur.

This study reports the experience of the four Hubs for Vascular Surgery in Lombardy and provides a comparison of in hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAEs) according to COVID-19 testing. METHODS: Data from all patients who were referred to the Vascular Surgery Department of Hubs from 9 March to 28 April 2020 were collected prospectively and analysed. A positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction swab test, or symptoms (fever > 37.5 °C, upper respiratory tract symptoms, chest pain, and contact/travel history) associated with interstitial pneumonia on chest computed tomography scan were considered diagnostic of COVID-19 disease. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and in hospital outcomes were compared according to COVID-19 testing. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of in hospital death and MAEs. RESULTS: Among 305 included patients, 64 (21%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID group) and 241 (79%) did not (non-COVID group). COVID patients presented more frequently with acute limb ischaemia than non-COVID patients (64% vs. 23%; p < .001) and had a significantly higher in hospital mortality (25% vs. 6%; p < .001). Clinical success, MAEs, re-interventions, and pulmonary and renal complications were significantly worse in COVID patients. Independent risk factors for in hospital death were COVID (OR 4.1), medical treatment (OR 7.2), and emergency setting (OR 13.6). COVID (OR 3.4), obesity class V (OR 13.5), and emergency setting (OR 4.0) were independent risk factors for development of MAEs. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Lombardy, acute limb ischaemia was the most frequent vascular disease requiring surgical treatment.

It is useful to examine the theoretical implications of his work by applying a human development theoretical perspective. Phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST) is a strengths-based theoretical framework that engages the variability of resource access and coping strategies that promote positive identity development for diverse children. While skill acquisition is a key focus of human capital theory's engagement of early childhood needs, this article highlights the on-going status of human vulnerability that undergirds identity development over the life course. The authors note that ""inequality presence denial"" combines with high-risk contexts, framed by geography and psychohistoric moments (e.g., The Great Recession, COVID-19), to alter diverse children's developmental pathways. The acknowledgement of ""morbid risk"" motivates the urgency for research that builds upon Zigler's innovations and privileges human development imperatives. The case study explores these concepts by examining the challenges and assets available to mothers in a low-income community. The article's closing notes developments in the field of economics that ameliorate human capital theory's conceptual limitations, underscoring human development's theoretical strength in motivating research and policies that are maximally responsive to children's positive identity development.","Nichols Lodato, Bronwyn; Hall, Jennifer; Spencer, Margaret Beale",Dev Psychopathol,511,20

This literature review aims to investigate the possibility of fetal vertical transmission in COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers by diagnosing through placental swabs. Materials and methods The search terms 'pregnant COVID-19 positive mothers', 'fetal vertical transmission' and 'placental swabs' were used. 11 papers were selected for this review. Results This literature review comprises 45 COVID-19 positive pregnant women whose placentas and neonates were also analysed by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. 43 neonates were successfully delivered primarily via caesarean section out of 45 expectant mothers (96%). 2 mothers did not deliver due to severe preeclampsia and a miscarriage both occurring in the second trimester. 3 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7%). We report no neonatal mortality after birth and no maternal mortality. 8 female's placentas tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 out of a total of 45 tested (18%). Of these 8, 2 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in the maternal, neonatal and placental tissue. Conclusions After reviewing multiple studies and investigating the nature of placental physiology in SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers we conclude that there is no concrete evidence of vertical transmission occurring between mother and infant. However, there are inconsistencies across the different papers used for this review and further research investigating the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women by using RT-PCR to test the mother, placenta, vaginal fluid, breast milk and infant for SARS-CoV-2 at various stages of transmission is urgently needed.","Sweeney, I.; Niazy, A.

This paper demonstrates how evolutionary AI could be used to facilitate the next step, i.e. determining most effective intervention strategies automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription (ESP), it is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact. While still limited by available data, early experiments suggest that workplace and school restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. It also demonstrates that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and suggests creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g. by alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future pandemics.","Miikkulainen, Risto; Francon, Olivier; Meyerson, Elliot; Qiu, Xin; Canzani, Elisa; Hodjat, Babak",,511,1

The present study aimed to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress in healthcare and administrative staff in 5 oncology institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in 2020 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) questionnaire. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional observational study enrolled 175 healthcare and administrative workers from 5 oncology institutions in BiH during December 2020. Data were collected using a questionnaire that captured general information about the participants and a DASS-21 questionnaire. RESULTS Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the levels of depression, anxiety, and stress (P=0.003, P=0.011, and P=0.022, respectively) among participants with comorbidities connected with increased risk of severe illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared with participants without comorbidities. There was also a statistically significant difference in the levels of stress among participants from different cities (P=0.031). Supplement intake and educational level were significantly related (P=0.012). High levels of stress and anxiety were accompanied by high levels of depression among participants (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS The findings from the present study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on depression, anxiety, and stress levels in oncology staff in BiH.

With overwhelming demands on medical resources, patient stratification based on their risks is essential. In this multi-center study, we built prognosis models to predict severity outcomes, combining patients' electronic health records (EHR), which included vital signs and laboratory data, with deep learning- and CT-based severity prediction. METHOD: We first developed a CT segmentation network using datasets from multiple institutions worldwide. Two biomarkers were extracted from the CT images: total opacity ratio (TOR) and consolidation ratio (CR). After obtaining TOR and CR, further prognosis analysis was conducted on datasets from INSTITUTE-1, INSTITUTE-2 and INSTITUTE-3. For each data cohort, generalized linear model (GLM) was applied for prognosis prediction. RESULTS: For the deep learning model, the correlation coefficient of the network prediction and manual segmentation was 0.755, 0.919, and 0.824 for the three cohorts, respectively. The AUC (95 % CI) of the final prognosis models was 0.85(0.77,0.92), 0.93(0.87,0.98), and 0.86(0.75,0.94) for INSTITUTE-1, INSTITUTE-2 and INSTITUTE-3 cohorts, respectively. Either TOR or CR exist in all three final prognosis models. Age, white blood cell (WBC), and platelet (PLT) were chosen predictors in two cohorts. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) was a chosen predictor in one cohort. CONCLUSION: The developed deep learning method can segment lung infection regions. Prognosis results indicated that age, SpO2, CT biomarkers, PLT, and WBC were the most important prognostic predictors of COVID-19 in our prognosis model.","Gong, Kuang; Wu, Dufan; Arru, Chiara Daniela; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Neumark, Nir; Guan, Jiahui; Buch, Varun; Kim, Kyungsang; Bizzo, Bernardo Canedo; Ren, Hui; Tak, Won Young; Park, Soo Young; Lee, Yu Rim; Kang, Min Kyu; Park, Jung Gil; Carriero, Alessandro; Saba, Luca; Masjedi, Mahsa; Talari, Hamidreza; Babaei, Rosa; Mobin, Hadi Karimi; Ebrahimian, Shadi; Guo, Ning; Digumarthy, Subba R; Dayan, Ittai; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Li, Quanzheng",Eur J Radiol,511,30

Overall, poor vitamin D status seems to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Severely ill COVID-19 patients appear to be deficient or have suboptimal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a measure of vitamin D status. Consequently, vitamin D is now the subject of several prophylactic and therapeutic clinical trials. In this review, the general status of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements amid the pandemic is appraised, with a particular focus on vitamin D. Consumers should be aware of misinformation and unsubstantiated promises for products marketed for COVID-19 protection.

The goal of the research was to explore the association between deprivation of socio-economic status (SES) and spatial patterns of COVID-19 incidence in Chennai megacity for unfolding the disease epidemiology. STUDY DESIGN: This is an ecological (or contextual) study for electoral wards (subcities) of Chennai megacity. METHODS: Using data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from May 15, 2020, to May 21, 2020, for 155 electoral wards obtained from the official website of the Chennai Municipal Corporation, we examined the incidence of COVID-19 using two count regression models, namely, Poisson regression (PR) and negative binomial regression (NBR). As explanatory factors, we considered area deprivation that represented the deprivation of SES. An index of multiple deprivations (IMD) was developed to measure the area deprivation using an advanced local statistic, geographically weighted principal component analysis. Based on the availability of appropriately scaled data, five domains (i.e., poor housing condition, low asset possession, poor availability of WaSH services, lack of household amenities and services, and gender disparity) were selected as components of the IMD in this study. RESULTS: The hot spot analysis revealed that area deprivation was significantly associated with higher incidences of COVID-19 in Chennai megacity. The high variations (adjusted R2: 72.2%) with the lower Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) (124.34) and Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) (112.12) for NBR compared with PR suggests that the NBR model better explains the relationship between area deprivation and COVID-19 incidences in Chennai megacity. NBR with two-sided tests and P <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The outcome of the PR and NBR models suggests that when all other variables were constant, according to NBR, the relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 incidences was 2.19 for the wards with high housing deprivation or, in other words, the wards with high housing deprivation having 119% higher probability (RR = e0.786 = 2.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.98 to 2.40), compared with areas with low deprivation. Similarly, in the wards with poor availability of WaSH services, chances of having COVID-19 incidence was 90% higher than in the wards with good WaSH services (RR = e0.642 = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.79 to 2.00). Spatial risks of COVID-19 were predominantly concentrated in the wards with higher levels of area deprivation, which were mostly located in the northeastern parts of Chennai megacity. CONCLUSIONS: We formulated an area-based IMD, which was substantially related to COVID-19 incidences in Chennai megacity. This study highlights that the risks of COVID-19 tend to be higher in areas with low SES and that the northeastern part of Chennai megacity is predominantly high-risk areas. Our results can guide measures of COVID-19 control and prevention by considering spatial risks and area deprivation.","Das, A; Ghosh, S; Das, K; Basu, T; Das, M; Dutta, I",Public Health,511,16

A feature of the LASSBio Chemical Library worth highlighting is the fact that it is a smart library designed by medicinal chemists with pharmacological activity as the main priority. The great majority of the compounds part of this library have shown in vivo activity in animal models, which is an indication that they possess overall favorable bioavailability properties and, hence, adequate pharmacokinetic profiles. This, in turn, is supported by the fact that approximately 85% of the compounds are compliant with Lipinski's rule of five and ca. 95% are compliant with Veber's rules, two important guidelines for oral bioavailability. In this work it is presented a virtual screening methodology combining a pharmacophore-based model and an empirical Gibbs free energy-based model for the ligand-protein interaction to explore the LASSBio Chemical Library as a source of new hits for the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIß (PI4KIIIß) enzyme, which is related to the development of viral infections (including enteroviruses, SARS coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus), cancers and neurological diseases.

The article explores this conjecture by scrutinising a real-time data source of equity investments. Our findings suggest that the volume of new equity transactions in the United Kingdom has declined markedly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears that seed finance is the main type of entrepreneurial finance most acutely affected by the crisis, which typically goes to the most nascent entrepreneurial start-ups facing the greatest obstacles obtaining finance.

This plays a major role in COVID-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. Higher levels of inflammatory hallmarks including C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimers, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- &#945; (TNF-&#945;) have been reported. Many anti-viral drugs have been tried, but none were proven fully effective. Supportive care and management of the complications that are caused mainly by inflammation might be the key to greater survival rates and shorter hospitalization (e.g., the use of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir (arbidol), oseltamivir, ganciclovir, favipiravir, darunavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, anakinra, canakinumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, Type 1 interferon, interferon ß-1a, interferon &#945;- 2b, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, fedratinib, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone). However, the efficacy of these treatments still needs well-planned clinical trials. In such trials, careful attention must be paid to the duration of the treatment, the onset of beneficial effects, and the severity of the disease, otherwise, the outcomes may still remain inconclusive. Herein, we present a review of the current drugs, which are being used in the management of the disease and their anti-inflammatory properties.

Then we explain how coupling the LR analysis and type SIR epidemiological models (EM) provide further information by including the temporal dynamics of the epidemic spreading. This is a promising approach to investigate important aspects of the recent NPIs applied by government to contain SARS-CoV-2, such as modeling the effect of the social distancing severity and timing over different network topologies. Further, implementing different link removal strategies to halt epidemics spreading provides information to individuate more effective NPIs, representing an important tool to offer a rationale sustaining policies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and similar epidemics.","Bellingeri, M.; Turchetto, M.; Bevacqua, D.; Scotognella, F.; Alfieri, R.; Nguyen, Q.; Cassi, D.",Frontiers in Physics,511,5

In addition, social distancing, travel restrictions, and spread of disease have resulted in unique challenges, creating barriers to healthcare access. Compared to the rate prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant increase in clinical insomnia rates have been reported. With well-known limitations of currently established treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy-insomnia (CBT-I), pharmacotherapy), there is a need to explore other effective and safe treatment modalities to treat insomnia, especially those that can be used remotely. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of app-based intervention to treat insomnia in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic (using the Yoga of Immortals (YOI) app). This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. All participants in this study were asked to complete an online survey including demographic data and validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at baseline (15 May 2020), 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after starting the YOI intervention. Survey data was exported using Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was done using the GraphPad Prism 8. YOI intervention significantly improved the mean ISI scores in all categories of insomnia (severe, moderate, and subthreshold) at each follow-up (p &#8804; 0.0001). The improvement was significant among all age groups and in both genders. In our study, YOI was a novel and effective intervention for improving insomnia symptoms and may be a new addition to the armamentarium of insomnia management.

In this research, we identified consumers’ emotions on the adoption of use-oriented Product-Service-Systems (PSS) and the effect of COVID-19 on such emotions using pre- and amid-COVID-19 samples. The results indicate that positive emotions are generally more associated with the process of adopting use-oriented PSS. However, the negative effect of COVID-19 on emotions influencing the decision to use the PSS is significant. We found that during the pandemic, consumers moved from the positive side of emotions to the more negative one. The emotions with the highest frequencies in pre-COVID-19 data collection (sympathy, joy, and peacefulness) suffered a significant descent effect due to the pandemic. Also, negative emotions such as fear, shame, and guilt, which were already present in the pre-COVID-19 phase, showed an increase in manifestations in the amid-COVID-19 sample. COVID-19 has increased self-interest in people, and emotions that predict altruism and concern for society were affected. We also found that previous use experience as well as gender and education do not significantly moderate the effect of COVID-19 on consumption emotions, although these demographic variables have been confirmed in other studies as important moderators in pro-environmental consumption. Finally, the results demonstrated that younger people (between 18 and 24 years old) tend to be more impacted by pandemic. Theoretically, our study contributes (1) by using an emotions scale specifically developed for consumption situations, allowing to assess a greater amount of emotions, (2) by analysing basic emotions, in addition to the self-conscious ones, that interfere in the adoption of use-oriented PSS, and (3) by confirming that an external traumatic event alters consumption-related emotions. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers","de Medeiros, J.

The effects of drag, diffusion and the gravity on the droplets during its motion in the air have been taken into account. We found that the distance traveled by a droplet released at an average human height by an infected individual strongly depends on the velocity of ejection and mass of the droplet. For example, a droplet of radius 100 $\mu$m and mass 4186 nano-gm released at a height of 1.7 meter will travel 2.35 meter distance horizontally before settling gravitationally. The same droplet with lower ejection velocity of 5 m/s will travel a horizontal distance of 0.55 meter approximately. We found that the gravitational force does not allow larger (and hence massive) droplets to remain suspended in the air for long. Because the gravitational force is superior to the the drag force exerted by the air molecules on larger droplets. However, for smaller droplets the drag force dominates over the gravitational force which allows it to be suspended in the air for longer time. As an instance a droplet of radius 2.5 $\mu$m may remain suspended in the air for more than half an hour. This suggests that a healthy individual should maintain temporal distance from an infected one to avoid virus suspended in the air. Therefore, as preventive strategies a healthy individual should not only maintain geometric distance from an infected one but also temporal distance to deter the floating smaller droplets by covering nose, mouth, etc. This approach will be useful for the prevention of current COVID19 pandemic.","Das, Santosh K.; Alam, Jan-e; Plumari, Salvatore; Greco, Vincenzo",,511,16

However, severe adverse outcomes are not recorded in all patients. In this study, we assessed disease outcomes in patients with and without T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of patients with T2DM hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. Multivariate modeling was used to assess the independent predictors of demographic and clinical characteristics with mortality, length of hospital stay, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 18 426 inpatients (median age [interquartile range, IQR]: 61 [17] years; males: 43.3%) were investigated. Patients with T2DM (n = 9213) were compared with a group without diabetes (n = 9213) that were matched using the propensity scores for age and gender. Compared with the group without T2DM, 30-day mortality following hospitalization was higher in patients with T2DM (13.6% vs 8.7%; hazard ratio 1.75; 95% CI, 1.58-1.93; P < .001). The independent associates of mortality were older age, male gender, obesity, insulin treatment, low lymphocyte count, and pulmonary involvement on admission. Older age, low lymphocyte values, and pulmonary involvement at baseline were independently associated with longer hospital stay and/or ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The current study from the Turkish national health care database showed that patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 are at increased risk of mortality, longer hospital stay, and ICU admission.","Sonmez, Alper; Demirci, Ibrahim; Haymana, Cem; Tasci, Ilker; Dagdelen, Selcuk; Salman, Serpil; Ata, Naim; Sahin, Ibrahim; Emral, Rifat; Cakal, Erman; Atmaca, Aysegul; Sahin, Mustafa; Celik, Osman; Demir, Tevfik; Ertugrul, Derun; Unluturk, Ugur; Caglayan, Murat; Satman, Ilhan",J. diabetes (Online),511,1

Interfering with the interaction of viral antigens with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor is a promising strategy by blocking the infection of the coronaviruses into human cells. We have implemented a novel protein engineering technology to produce a super-potent tetravalent form of ACE2, coupled to the human immunoglobulin Î³1 Fc region, using a self-assembling, tetramerization domain from p53 protein. This high molecular weight Quad protein (ACE2-Fc-TD) retains binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding spike protein and can form a complex with the spike protein plus anti-viral antibodies. The ACE2-Fc-TD acts as a powerful decoy protein that out-performs soluble monomeric and dimeric ACE2 proteins and blocks both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with greatly enhanced efficacy. The ACE2 tetrameric protein complex promise to be important for development as decoy therapeutic proteins against COVID-19. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, ACE2 decoy is unlikely to be affected by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 that are beginning to appear in variant forms. In addition, ACE2 multimeric proteins will be available as therapeutic proteins should new coronaviruses appear in the future because these are likely to interact with ACE2 receptor.","Miller, Ami; Leach, Adam; Thomas, Jemima; McAndrew, Craig; Bentley, Emma; Mattiuzzo, Giada; John, Lijo; Mirazimi, Ali; Harris, Gemma; Gamage, Nadisha; Carr, Stephen; Ali, Hanif; Van Montfort, Rob; Rabbitts, Terence",Sci Rep,511,16

A leave one out machine learning classification scheme was implemented to assess the robustness of the EEG features, with the classification accuracy evaluation of the trained model repeatedly performed against an unseen participant's data. The classification results located consistent differences in the EEG features across participants in the different classroom design conditions, with a predictive power that was significantly higher compared to a baseline classification learning outcome using scrambled data. These findings were most robust during the Visual Memory Test, and were not found during the Stroop Test and the Arithmetic Test. The most discriminative EEG features were observed in bilateral occipital, parietal, and frontal regions in the theta and alpha frequency bands. While the implications of these findings for student learning are yet to be determined, this study provides rigorous evidence that brain activity features during cognitive tasks are affected by the design elements of window placement and room dimensions.","Cruz-Garza, Jesus G.; Darfler, Michael; Rounds, James D.; Gao, Elita; Kalantari, Saleh",,511,16

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare the levels of major milk allergens in uncooked and baked muffins using monoclonal immunoassays and IgE antibody binding before and after baking. METHODS: Uncooked and baked muffins were prepared using recipes from Mount Sinai and Imperial College. Allergen levels were compared by ELISA for Bos d 5 (ß-lactoglobulin) and Bos d 11 (ß-casein). IgE reactivity was assessed using sera from milk-sensitized donors in direct binding and inhibition ELISA. RESULTS: Bos d 5 was reduced from 680 µg/g in uncooked muffin mix to 0.17 µg/g in baked muffins, representing a >99% decrease after baking. Conversely, Bos d 11 levels in baked muffin remained high and only decreased by 30% from a mean of 4249 µg/g in uncooked muffin mix to 2961 µg/g when baked (~181 mg Bos d 11 per muffin). Baked muffins retained ~70% of the IgE binding to uncooked muffin mix. Baked muffin extract inhibited IgE binding to uncooked muffin mix by up to 80%, demonstrating retention of in vitro IgE reactivity. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: High levels of Bos d 11 in baked muffins pose a risk for adverse reactions, especially in patients who have high anti-casein IgE antibodies.","Hindley, James P; Oliver, Maria A; Thorpe, Cathy; Cullinane, Angharad; Wuenschmann, Sabina; Chapman, Martin D",Clin. exp. allergy,511,22

In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the ""entry receptor"" for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the ""time delay"" given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the ""exposure time"" to the ""interaction time"" (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. BACKGROUND: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the ß-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. METHODS: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. RESULTS: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","Sohail, Ayesha; Nutini, Alessandro",Prog Biophys Mol Biol,511,10

Texts of interest include abstracts of clinical trials in English and in multilingual contexts. The main focus is on information characterized via the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) framework, but data extraction is not limited to these fields. Recent neural network architectures based on transformers show capacities for transfer learning and increased performance on downstream natural language processing tasks such as universal reading comprehension, brought forward by this architecture's use of contextualized word embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. This paper contributes to solving problems related to ambiguity in PICO sentence prediction tasks, as well as highlighting how annotations for training named entity recognition systems are used to train a high-performing, but nevertheless flexible architecture for question answering in systematic review automation. Additionally, it demonstrates how the problem of insufficient amounts of training annotations for PICO entity extraction is tackled by augmentation. All models in this paper were created with the aim to support systematic review (semi)automation. They achieve high F1 scores, and demonstrate the feasibility of applying transformer-based classification methods to support data mining in the biomedical literature.","Schmidt, Lena; Weeds, Julie; Higgins, Julian P.

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) department and general infection department of TaiKang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital from February 10 to March 27, 2020, were included. Data on clinical features, complications, laboratory parameters, chest CT, nutrient requirement, and electrolyte imbalance were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 123 (50 critical and 73 non-critical) patients were enrolled. 65% of patients with comorbidities, hypertension (45.5%), diabetes (21.9%), 36.5% of patients had more than one comorbidity. The proportion of lymphocytes in critical patients was significantly lower than that of non-critical patients. The proportion of patients with increased NLR, PLR, IL-6, CRP levels, and chest CT score was significantly higher in the critical than that of non-critical patients. The logistic regression analysis identified low lymphocyte count, high NLR, PLR, IL-6, CRP levels, and CT score as independent factors for discerning critical cases and high NLR, PLR, IL-6, and CT score could predict poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, we identified patients who needed nutrition support (HR 16.99) and with correction of electrolyte imbalance (HR 18.24) via intravenous injection were more likely to have a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of lower lymphocyte count, high levels of NLR, PLR, IL-6, CRP, chest CT score, and the statue of nutrient requirement or electrolyte imbalance could assist clinicians in discerning critical cases and predict the poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Weili; Zhao, Zhongxiu; Liu, Xi; Liu, Gang; Xie, Dongjing; Xu, Zhi; Zhao, Jinghong; Zhang, Jingbo",J Clin Lab Anal,511,26

Together, residents and staff constitute the single most vulnerable population in the pandemic. The health of these workers is completely entangled with the health of those they care for. Vaccination of SNF staff is key to increasing uptake of the vaccine, reducing health disparities, and reopening SNFs to visitors. Yet, as the vaccine rollout begins, some SNF staff are declining to be vaccinated. The purpose of this article is to describe reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reported by staff of skilled nursing facilities and understand factors that could potentially reduce hesitancy. DESIGN: Five virtual focus groups were conducted with staff of SNFs as part of a larger project to improve vaccine uptake. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Focus groups with 58 staff members were conducted virtually using Zoom. MEASURES: Focus groups sought to elicit concerns, perspectives, and experiences related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that some SNF staff are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for this hesitancy include beliefs that the vaccine has been developed too fast and without sufficient testing; personal fears about pre-existing medical conditions, and more general distrust of the government. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SNF staff indicate that seeing people like themselves receive the vaccination is more important than seeing public figures. We discuss the vaccination effort as a social enterprise and the need to develop long-term care provider-academic-community partnerships in response to COVID-19 and in expectation of future pandemics.","Harrison, Jill; Berry, Sarah; Mor, Vince; Gifford, David",J Am Med Dir Assoc,511,9

Previous research has shown that social isolation can contribute to psychological distress. The impact of increased social isolation on mental health functioning during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as potential mechanisms to buffer this impact, have yet to be investigated. The current study explored the moderating role of psychological flexibility and related constructs on the relationships between social isolation and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 278 participants, the majority residing in the United States, were collected during a 3-week period from mid-April to early May, 2020 via online survey. A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated statistically significant relationships between social isolation and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress), well-being, and valued living. Psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotional suppression significantly moderated these relationships in a number of instances. Greater psychological flexibility and acceptance of difficult experiences appeared to act as a buffer against the negative effects of increased social isolation, while amplifying the benefits of social connectedness. Implications for promoting mental health and buffering against the harmful effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed.","Smith, Brooke M; Twohy, Alexander J; Smith, Gregory S",,511,24

The question has been raised on whether DPP4 modulation or inhibition may prevent infection and/or progression of the COVID-19. A docked complex model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and DPP4 has been proposed, showing a large interface between the proteins and proposing close similarity with other coronaviruses using DPP4 as functional receptor. In absence of experimental validation, these data should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, this observation may rise the question on whether DPP4 is directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell adhesion/virulence, and whether DPP4 inhibition might be a therapeutic strategy for preventing infection. Although a direct involvement of DPP4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be clarified, there is also evidence suggesting that DPP4 inhibitors modulate inflammation and exert anti-fibrotic activity. These properties may be of potential use for halting progression to the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe COVID-19. Taken together these findings may suggest a potential role for DPP4 inhibition or modulation in one or more steps of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Strollo, Rocky; Pozzilli, Paolo",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,511,16

Phylogenetic analysis and comparisons of full-length sequences of the S1 gene suggested that the GI-7 lineage should be further classified as Taiwan (TW)-I and TW-II sublineages, which correspond to the previous TW-I and TW-II genotypes. The nine IBV strains were clustered in the TW-II sublineage. Further investigation revealed that viruses in the TW-I and TW-II were not only genetically but also antigenically different. Moreover, the TW-II sublineage contained various clades and recombinants. A recombinant was found to originate from recombination events between field strains (TW-II ck/CH/LJL/090608- and GI-19 ck/ CH/LDL/091022-like viruses) in which the recombination in the S1 subunit coding sequences had led to changes in antigenicity of the viruses. A more in-depth investigation demonstrated that TW-II viruses appear to have undergone a significant evolution following introduction in mainland China, which resulted in the viruses diverging into different clades. The viruses between the different clades in TW-II sublineage exhibited a significant change in genetic and antigenic characteristics. In addition, the five TW-II viruses selected on the basis of the results of S1 nucleotide sequence phylogenetic trees showed different pathogenicity to specific-pathogen-free chickens, although they could induce nephritis in the infected chickens and thus were identified as nephropathogenic strains.","Ren, Mengting; Zhang, Lili; Hou, Yutong; Zhao, Yan; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang",Avian Dis,511,1

METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 2, 2020 to March 8, 2020 in Shandong Province, China, using quota sampling combined with snowball sampling. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to assess the anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 4000 invitations were sent from three centers, 3237 valid questionnaires were received. Based on GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scales, 19.5%-21.7% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms; 2.9%-5.6% had severe symptoms. Besides, 2.4%, 4.8%, and 4.5% of the participants had anxiety-depression, anxiety-insomnia, or depression-insomnia combined symptoms. The scores of anxiety and insomnia symptoms, along with scores of depression and insomnia symptoms were positively correlated in these samples.

Total Thrombus-Formation Analysis System (T-TAS) is a flow-chamber device that analyses platelet-mediated thrombus formation in capillary channels through the following parameters: (1) the area under the flow-pressure curve (AUC), (2) occlusion start time (OST), time needed to reach OST, and (3) occlusion time (OT), time needed to reach the occlusion pressure. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive, subintensive, and low intensive care were prospectively enrolled according to the time of admission: group A (up to 8 days) (n = 18); group B (from 9 to 21 days) (n = 19), and group C ( > 21 days) (n = 24). T-TAS measurements were performed at enrolment and after 7 days. Median OST was similar among groups. AUC was lower in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.033). OT was longer in group A compared to B (p = 0.001) and C (p = 0.028). Platelet count (PC) was higher in group B compared to A (p = 0.024). The linear regression showed that OT and AUC were independent from PC in group A (OT: 0.149 [95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.326 to 0.624], p = 0.513 and AUC: 0.005 [95% CI: -0.008 to 0.017], p = 0,447). In contrast, in group B, PC was associated with OT (-0.019 [-0.028 to 0.008], p = 0.023) and AUC (0.749 [0.358-1.139], p = 0,015), similarly to group C. Conversely, patients with different illness severity had similar T-TAS parameters.

METHODS: A novel survey was sent to all faculty members at an academic pediatric orthopedic practice in New York City regarding their use of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Faculty members performed 227 unique tele-health visits with pediatric orthopedic patients over a 7-week period in early 2020, and this formed the basis for responses to the survey. The results of the faculty survey suggest that telemedicine has substantial clinical benefits for pediatric orthopedic surgeons and our patients that extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers recognize the limits of conducting physical exams over telemedicine and should always use clinical judgment when evaluating patients, par-ticularly trauma patients who may require prompt referral for additional care. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to provide pediatric orthopedic care through telemedicine has allowed us to safely evaluate and treat pediatric patients with musculoskeletal problems in New York City and its environs despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The efficient evaluation of both new and exist-ing pediatric orthopedic patients via telehealth is viable. Physical examination is the most challenging aspect of the physician-patient encounter to replicate virtually. Targeted educational efforts for patients and their families before the visit about what to expect and how to prepare improves efficiency with virtual pediatric orthopedic visits. Efforts to limit disparities in access to telemedicine will be needed to allow all pediatric orthopedic patients to participate in telemedicine equitably.","Carter, Cordelia W.; Herrero, Christina P.; Bloom, David A.; Karamitopoulos, Mara; Castañeda, Pablo G.",Bull Hosp Jt Dis (2013),511,20

The model has four components leading to a system of fractional order differential equations incorporating the refuge concept to study the lockdown effect in controlling COVID-19 spread in India. We investigate the model using the concept of Caputo fractional-order derivative. The goal of this model is to estimate the number of total infected, active cases, deaths, as well as recoveries from COVID-19 to control or minimize the above issues in India. The existence, uniqueness, non-negativity, and boundedness of the solutions are established. In addition, the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points of the fractional-order system and the basic reproduction number are studied for understanding and prediction of the transmission of COVID-19 in India. The next step is to carry out sensitivity analysis to find out which parameter is the most dominant to affect the disease's endemicity.

Background: Neurologic manifestations are often seen in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and prior studies suggest that infection rates, disease severity, and complications may vary across populations. However, no prior published cohorts describe the breadth of neurologic findings in a racially and socioeconomically diverse inpatient COVID-19 population in the U.S. Design/Methods: Patients were identified through an electronic medical record review from April 15, 2020, until July 1, 2020, at a large safety-net hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, caring primarily for underserved, low-income, and elderly patients. All hospitalized adult patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab or respiratory PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 during their hospitalization or in the 30 days prior to admission who received an inpatient neurologic or neurocritical care consultation or admission during the study period were enrolled. Results: Seventy-four patients were identified (42/57% male, median age 64 years). The majority of patients self-identified as Black or African-American (38, 51%). The most common neurologic symptoms at presentation to the hospital included altered mental status (39, 53%), fatigue (18, 24%), and headache (18, 18%). Fifteen patients had ischemic strokes (20%). There were 10 inhospital mortalities, with moderately severe disability among survivors at discharge (14%, median modified Rankin Scale score of 4). Conclusions: Neurologic findings spanned inflammatory, vascular pathologies, sequelae of critical illness and metabolic derangements, possible direct involvement of the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2, and exacerbation of underlying neurologic conditions, highlighting a broad range of possible etiologies of neurologic complications in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are needed to characterize the infectious and post-infectious neurologic complications of COVID-19 in diverse patient populations.","Anand, P.; Zhou, L.; Bhadelia, N.; Hamer, D.; Greer, D.; Cervantes-Arslanian, A.

Therefore, we aimed to address this gap. In this retrospective cohort study, we included inpatients diagnosed with severe/critical COVID-19 at the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University and grouped them depending on the recipience of TCMDs (TCMD and non-TCMD groups). We conducted a propensity score-matched analysis to adjust the imbalanced variables and treatments and used logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Among 282 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged or died, 186 patients (66.0%) received TCMD treatment (TCMD cohort) and 96 (34.0%) did not (non-TCMD cohort). After propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio, 94 TCMD users were matched to 94 non-users, and there were no significant differences in baseline clinical variables between the two groups of patients. The all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the TCMD group than in the non-TCMD group, and this trend remained valid even after matching (21.3% [20/94] vs. 39.4% [37/94]).

We examined overall survival (OS) in patients with RA and solid malignancies receiving bDMARDs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with RA and solid malignancies seen at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2002 and 2014. Cox proportional hazard regression models, stratified by tumor type and stage, were fit evaluating use of bDMARDs as a time fixed and time varying covariate. RESULTS: We identified 431 RA patients with solid malignancies: 111 (26%) received bDMARDs after their cancer diagnosis. Median OS from cancer diagnosis was 16.1 years. Of the patients receiving bDMARDs, most had localized disease, and only 14 (13%) had advanced cancer. In the stratified Cox models no statistically significant differences were observed between patients who received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or patients who received nonTNFi, compared with those who did not receive bDMARDs (hazard ratio (HR), 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31, 1.44; HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.26, 4.60 respectively). In breast cancer patients, those receiving TNFi or nonTNFi had a numerically higher but statistically nonsignificant HR compared with those who did not receive bDMARD: HR, 1.40 (95% CI, 0.42, 4.73), and HR, 1.37 (95% CI, 0.22, 8.42) respectively.

Background: COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs. Methods: The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 Å. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy; therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. Results: The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (-187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively. Conclusion: The findings showed that the four selected FDA approved drugs can be potent inhibitors against COVID-19; among them, Temoporfin may be more potent for the treatment of the disease. Based on the findings, it is recommended that in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations be conducted to determine the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19.","Absalan, Abdorrahim; Doroud, Delaram; Salehi-Vaziri, Mostafa; Kaghazian, Hooman; Ahmadi, Nayebali; Zali, Fatemeh; Pouriavali039,; s, Mohamamd Hassan; Mousavi-Nasab, Seyed Dawood",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,511,16

Given the high risk of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients, appropriate VTE prophylaxis seems to be an important part of managing these patients. Although many protocols regarding venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis or therapeutic (full-dose) anticoagulation have been conducted worldwide, primarily in hospitalised adult patients, details on paediatric patients, if included, are limited or incomplete. The current evidences suggest that anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) appears to be associated with better prognosis in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 induced coagulopathies or elevated D-dimer levels. Our recommendations are intended to offer guidance for anticoagulation prophylaxis and treatment in COVID-19 children and adolescent patients and not intend to supersede the clinician judgement. We are also conscious that several clinical questions deserve further studies and clarifications because this area is rapidly evolving.","Karimi, Mehran; Bozorgi, Haleh; Zarei, Tahereh; Bordbar, Mohammadreza; Amanati, Ali; Safaei, Arash; De Sanctis, Vincenzo",Acta Biomed,511,1

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The present commentary draws on current policies, practices and literature regarding the health, needs and management of older incarcerated adults in Australia to discuss risk, care and early release for this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: Incarcerated persons experience poorer health and accelerated age-related decline compared to those in the general community. The present situation offers the opportunity to fill knowledge and practice gaps, including policies for staff training, identification of dementia and cognitive decline, assessment of mobility issues, addressing barriers to health-seeking, possibilities of medical or compassionate release, risk assessment and release protocols and post-release needs. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: While Australian prisons have acknowledged the vulnerability of older persons, more focused adaptation of COVID-19-related policies to consider adults as young as 45 years are needed. Appropriate ethical identification and management of cases in this population is needed, as is discussion on issues of decarceration and medical release. Re-conceptualisation of incarcerated adults as ""citizens in need of care"", rather than as ""offenders to be secured"", will be beneficial.

COVID-19 infection, mental stress and non-availability of drugs following lockdown may worsen myasthenic symptoms. We report the impact of COVID 19, and lockdown on the physical and mental health, and quality of sleep in a cohort of MG. METHODS: Thirty-eight MG patients were telephonically interviewed 2months after the declaration of lockdown in India. The difficulty in procuring drugs, complications, and worsening in the MG Foundation of America (MGFA) stage were noted. The patients were enquired about MG Quality of Life 15 (MGQOL15), MG Activity of Daily Living (MGADL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) using a prefixed questionnaire. Their pre-COVID parameters were retrieved from our earlier trial data, which was completed 4months back. The scores of the above mentioned parameters before and after COVID were compared. RESULTS: Their median age was 45 years, and the median duration of treatment for MG was 4.5years. Eleven (28.9 %) patients were hypertensive and 3(7.9 %) diabetic. All were on prednisolone and 18(47.4 %) received azathioprine. None developed COVID, but three had other infections. Two patients needed hospitalization because of wrong medication in one and severe anxiety-insomnia in another. Following COVID19 and lockdown, MG patients had worsening in MGQOL15, MGADL, HADS and PSQI scores. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score correlated with MGQOL15 and dose of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and lockdown were associated with anxiety, depression, poor MGQOL and sleep especially in severe MG patients.","Kalita, Jayantee; Tripathi, Abhilasha; Dongre, Nikhil; Misra, Usha K",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,511,16

Here, we review current data on suspected myocarditis in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Hypothetical mechanisms to explain the pathogenesis of troponin release in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 include direct virus-induced myocardial injury (ie, viral myocarditis), systemic hyperinflammatory response (ie, cytokine storm), hypoxemia, downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, systemic virus-induced endothelialitis, and type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction. To date, despite the fact that millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been diagnosed worldwide, there is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel cardiotropic virus causing direct cardiomyocyte damage. Diagnosis of viral myocarditis should be based on the molecular assessment of endomyocardial biopsy or autopsy by polymerase chain reaction or in-situ hybridization. Blood, sputum, or nasal and throat swab virology testing are insufficient and do not correlate with the myocardial involvement of a given pathogen. Data from endomyocardial biopsies and autopsies in clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis are scarce. Overall, current clinical epidemiologic data do not support the hypothesis that viral myocarditis is caused by SARS-CoV-2, or that it is common. More endomyocardial biopsy and autopsy data are also needed for a better understanding of pathogenesis of clinically suspected myocarditis in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may include virus-negative immune-mediated or already established subclinical autoimmune forms, triggered or accelerated by the hyperinflammatory state of severe novel coronavirus disease 2019.","Ozieranski, Krzysztof; Tyminska, Agata; Jonik, Szymon; Marcolongo, Renzo; Baritussio, Anna; Grabowski, Marcin; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Opolski, Grzegorz; Caforio, Alida L P",J. card. fail,511,1

In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of health-protecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online questionnaire survey on the sample of 3,000 respondents aged 15+ randomly selected from the Czech internet panel using socio-demographic quotas was performed shortly after the end of confinement measures in May 2020 (response rate 35.4%). Questions covered current prevalence and patterns of substance use (i.e. in the last 12 months) and other forms of addictive behaviours as well as changes in their behaviour during the confinement measures. Responses were provided on categorical scale;a factor of 0 to 2 was assigned to the categories to quantify the changes where 1 means no change. RESULTS: Respondents reporting the highest frequency of current use, especially the use of alcohol, cannabis and sedatives, further increased their intensity of use during the confinement measures by 5-10% on average, while less frequent users reduced it. The reduction of use during confinement measures increased with decreasing frequency of current use. Although the same correlation exists in tobacco smokers, decrease in intensity of use was observed also in daily smokers. On the population level, our results suggest a slight increase in total alcohol and sedatives consumption and a significant increase in the total consumption of gaming and social media. On the contrary, there was a significant reduction in the consumption of tobacco and online gambling (likely due to the ban on sports matches), and a slight reduction in the consumption of cannabis and other illicit drugs. CONCLUSION: People with intensive patterns of substance use increased their use during confinement measures. The same concerns gaming and social media. Without this insight the overall picture suggests rather overall reduction of consumption. Addiction treatment system should prepare for the increase of treatment demand following COVID-19 epidemic.","Mravcik, V.; Chomynova, P.","Epidemiologie, Mikrobiologie, Imunologie",511,24

Here we propose an abstract agent-based model for the outbreak of COVID-19 in which economic activities are taken into account. The computational simulation of the model recapitulated the trade-off between health and economic damage associated with lockdown measures. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how macroscopic dynamics of infection and economy emerge from the individuals' behaviours.

To investigate the initial introductions and transmissions of the SARS-CoV-2 in the country, we performed the largest genomic epidemiology study of COVID-19 in Pakistan and generated 150 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from samples collected before June 1, 2020. We identified a total of 347 variants, 29 of which were over-represented in Pakistan. Meanwhile, we found over one thousand intra-host single-nucleotide variants. Several of them occurred concurrently, indicating possible interactions among them. Some of the hypermutable positions were not observed in the polymorphism data, suggesting strong purifying selections. The genomic epidemiology revealed five distinctive spreading clusters. The largest cluster consisted of 74 viruses which were derived from different geographic locations and formed a deep hierarchical structure, indicating an extensive and persistent nation-wide transmission of the virus that was probably contributed by a signature mutation of this cluster. Twenty-eight putative international introductions were identified, several of which were consistent with the epidemiological investigations. No progenies of any of these 150 viruses have been found outside of Pakistan, most likely due to the nonphmarcological intervention to control the virus. This study has inferred the introductions and transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which could provide a guidance for an effective strategy for disease control.","Song, Shuhui; Li, Cuiping; Kang, Lu; Tian, Dongmei; Badar, Nazish; Ma, Wentai; Zhao, Shilei; Jiang, Xuan; Wang, Chun; Sun, Yongqiao; Li, Wenjie; Lei, Meng; Li, Shuangli; Qi, Qiuhui; Ikram, Aamer; Salman, Muhammad; Umair, Massab; Shireen, Huma; Batool, Fatima; Zhang, Bing; Chen, Hua; Yang, Yungui; Abbasi, Amir Ali; Li, Mingkun; Xue, Yongbiao; Bao, Yiming",,511,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer registry data were reviewed from 2005-2014. Inclusion criteria included HPC, clinical N1-3 disease (AJCC staging system, 7th edition), and receiving radiotherapy. Patients with M1 diseaseor with synchronous/metachronous cancer were excluded. Staging images were reviewed by two radiologists. rENE was defined as infiltration of adjacent fat/muscles, irregular nodal surface, or irregular capsular enhancement. Clinical stage, rENE status, and clinical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 355 patients were included. Patients with rENE had lower 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates. Univariate analysis showed that clinical T4 or N3 stage, overall stage IV, and rENE correlated with OS and RFS. In multivariate analysis, clinical T4 or N3 stage correlated with poor OS, while clinical T4 or N3 stage and rENE were independent predictors of poor RFS. N1/2 without rENE was designated as Group 1, N1/2 with rENE as Group 2, and N3 with/without rENE as Group 3. The 3-year RFS rates in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 55.8%, 41.0%, and 29.3%, respectively. The 3-year RFS rate in Group 1 was significantly higher than that in the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: rENE is an adverse prognostic factor for survival in patients with HPC treated with primary chemoradiation. It correlated with inferior RFS regardless of N stage. rENE may be used as a criterion for clinical ENE in future staging systems.","Fan, Kang-Hsing; Yeh, Chih-Hua; Hung, Sheng-Ping; Kang, Chung-Jan; Huang, Shiang-Fu; Chang, Kai-Ping; Wang, Hung-Ming; Chia-Hsun Hsieh, Jason; Lin, Chien-Yu; Cheng, Ann-Joy; Ng, Shu-Hang; Tung-Chieh Chang, Joseph",Radiother. oncol,511,33

We found an alkylating signature which was previously undescribed in CRC, and then showed the existence of a similar mutational process in normal colonic crypts. This alkylating signature is associated with high intakes of processed and unprocessed red meat prior to diagnosis. Additionally, this signature was more abundant in the distal colorectum, predicted to target cancer driver mutations KRAS p.G12D, KRAS p.G13D and PIK3CA p.E5454K, and associated with poor survival.

The recent escalation of genome-wide sequencing (GS) applications in population diagnostics will not only enable the assessment of risks of transmitting well-defined monogenic disorders at preconceptional stages (i.e. carrier screening), but also facilitate identification of multifactorial genetic predispositions to sub-lethal pathologies, including those affecting reproductive fitness. Through GS, the acquisition and curation of reproductive-related findings will warrant the expansion of genetic assessment to new areas of genomic prediction of reproductive phenotypes, pharmacogenomics and molecular embryology, further boosting our knowledge and therapeutic tools for treating infertility and improving women's health. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: In this article, we review current knowledge and potential development of preconception genome analysis aimed at detecting reproductive and individual health risks (recessive genetic disease and medically actionable secondary findings) as well as anticipating specific reproductive outcomes, particularly in the context of IVF. The extension of reproductive genetic risk assessment to the general population and IVF couples will lead to the identification of couples who carry recessive mutations, as well as sub-lethal conditions prior to conception. This approach will provide increased reproductive autonomy to couples, particularly in those cases where preimplantation genetic testing is an available option to avoid the transmission of undesirable conditions. In addition, GS on prospective infertility patients will enable genome-wide association studies specific for infertility phenotypes such as predisposition to premature ovarian failure, increased risk of aneuploidies, complete oocyte immaturity or blastocyst development failure, thus empowering the development of true reproductive precision medicine. SEARCH METHODS: Searches of the literature on PubMed Central included combinations of the following MeSH terms: human, genetics, genomics, variants, male, female, fertility, next generation sequencing, genome exome sequencing, expanded carrier screening, secondary findings, pharmacogenomics, controlled ovarian stimulation, preconception, genetics, genome-wide association studies, GWAS. OUTCOMES: Through PubMed Central queries, we identified a total of 1409 articles. The full list of articles was assessed for date of publication, limiting the search to studies published within the last 15 years (2004 onwards due to escalating research output of next-generation sequencing studies from that date). The remaining articles' titles were assessed for pertinence to the topic, leaving a total of 644 articles. The use of preconception GS has the potential to identify inheritable genetic conditions concealed in the genome of around 4% of couples looking to conceive. Genomic information during reproductive age will also be useful to anticipate late-onset medically actionable conditions with strong genetic background in around 2-4% of all individuals. Genetic variants correlated with differential response to pharmaceutical treatment in IVF, and clear genotype-phenotype associations are found for aberrant sperm types, oocyte maturation, fertilization or pre- and post-implantation embryonic development. All currently known capabilities of GS at the preconception stage are reviewed along with persisting and forthcoming barriers for the implementation of precise reproductive medicine. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The expansion of sequencing analysis to additional monogenic and polygenic traits may enable the development of cost-effective preconception tests capable of identifying underlying genetic causes of infertility, which have been defined as 'unexplained' until now, thus leading to the development of a true personalized genomic medicine framework in reproductive health.","Capalbo, Antonio; Poli, Maurizio; Riera-Escamilla, Antoni; Shukla, Vallari; Kudo Høffding, Miya; Krausz, Csilla; Hoffmann, Eva R; Simon, Carlos",Hum. reprod. updat,511,1

The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of healthcare professionals toward COVID-19 affect their compliance to prevention and control initiatives. During the evolving pandemic, we examined the KAP among healthcare professionals against COVID-19 in this research. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among Riyadh region health care professionals from the beginning of December 2020 to the end of February 2021 using a validated self-administered questionnaire. The knowledge questionnaire contained questions about COVID-19 clinical characteristics, prevention, and management. The evaluation of attitudes and practices included questions regarding actions and adjustments in COVID-19 response activities. Knowledge scores were measured and compared using demographic characteristics, as well as attitudes and practices toward COVID-19. Using SPSS-IBM 25, bivariate statistics were done to analyze the data. Results: 146 healthcare professionals completed the survey. Physicians were the most prominent party in the survey, accounting for 74 (51 percent), followed by nurses 44 (30 percent) and pharmacists 28 (19 percent). The participants' average age was 39.69 ± 8.48 years. The participant's mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 11.43 ± 1.34, 3.89 ± 0.93, and 3.85 ± 0.81, respectively. With a positive attitude, the mean knowledge score was 11.52, and with proper practice, it was 11.32. With an improvement in knowledge, the attitude score increased significantly (r = 0.172, P = 0.001). Besides, there was a greater association between attitudes and practices (r = 0.170, P = 0.029). A significant enhancement in the practice score of the professionals was noted with an increase in knowledge score (r = 0.095, P = 0.010), an indicator for a positive correlation between practice and knowledge scores. Interpretation & conclusion: Healthcare practitioners have a good understanding of COVID-19. Improved knowledge and a positive attitude toward COVID-19 infection are linked to appropriate practice. There is a need for more manpower, better COVID-19 management training, and strategies to reduce anxiety among healthcare professionals.","Mohammed Basheeruddin Asdaq, Syed; A S, Alshrari; Imran, Mohd; Sreeharsha, Nagaraja; Sultana, Rokeya",,511,23

METHODS: Clinical procedures were simulated in cadaveric heads whose oral and nasal cavities were coated with fluorescent tracer (vitamin B2) and breathing was manually simulated through retrograde intubation. A cascade impactor placed adjacent to the nares collected generated particles with aerodynamic diameters &#8804;14.1 µm. The 3D printed models and syringes were used to simulate middle and external ear suctioning as well as open suctioning, respectively. Provider's personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedural field contamination were also recorded for all trials using vitamin B2 fluorescent tracer. RESULTS: The positive controls of nebulized vitamin B2 produced aerosol particles &#8804;3.30 µm and endonasal drilling of a 3D model generated particles &#8804;14.1 µm. As compared with positive controls, aerosols and small droplets with aerodynamic diameter &#8804;14.1 µm were not detected during rigid nasal endoscopy, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and rigid nasal suction of cadavers with simulated breathing. There was minimal to no field contamination in all 3 scenarios. Middle and external ear suctioning and open container suctioning did not result in any detectable droplet contamination. The clinic suction unit contained all fluorescent material without surrounding environmental contamination. CONCLUSION: While patients' coughing and sneezing may create a baseline risk for providers, this study demonstrates that nasal endoscopy, flexible laryngoscopy, and suctioning inherently do not pose an additional risk in terms of aerosol and small droplet generation. An overarching generalization cannot be made about endoscopy or suctioning being an aerosol generating procedure.

It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce the misinformation's impact. This study aimed to test the effects of fact-checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen's d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation.

However, the role of VD in M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction remains clear. In this context, we investigate the role of VD and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. First, we infected RAW264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (M. bovis BCG) in vitro. Then, we activated VDR through VD administration. TRAP and FAK staining, bone resorption assays, immunofluorescence staining, qPCR, and western blot were carried out. In vivo, the M. tuberculosis-induced osteolytic model on the murine skull was established and the µCT and histological analyses were performed. We found that VDR and TRAP were upregulated in bone tuberculosis tissue and proved that M. tuberculosis infection promoted osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 and BMMs. VD could inhibit osteoclasts differentiation, fusion, and bone resorption dose-dependently. However, when VDR was knocked down, the inhibitory effect of VD on osteoclasts disappeared. In mechanism, activation of VDR inhibits the phosphorylation of I&#954;B &#945;, thereby inhibiting NF&#954;B signaling pathway and alleviating osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in the skull osteolysis model, VD administration reduced osteolysis, but not in VDR-/- mice. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates that activation of VDR by VD administration inhibits M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction. Our results reveal that VD and VDR are potential therapeutic targets for M. tuberculosis-induced bone destruction, and are of great clinical significance for the development of new therapeutic strategies.","Deng, Jiezhong; Yang, Yusheng; He, Jinyue; Xie, Zhao; Luo, Fei; Xu, Jianzhong; Zhang, Zehua",FASEB J,511,23

This rapid deployment precluded the opportunity for initial planning of implementation strategies. The purpose of the quality improvement project was to understand the needs of nurse practitioners and examine TH procedures and interventions designed to promote high-quality, equitable health care for pediatric patients with gastrointestinal concerns. METHOD: The Plan-Do-Study-Act model was used. Survey data from providers and families were collected and analyzed. They were further illuminated through iterative dialog across the research team to determine the quality and efficiency of TH. RESULTS: A toolkit of strategies for promoting the quality and efficiency of TH was created according to the three domains of health equity: availability, accessibility, and acceptability. DISCUSSION: TH will be used in the postpandemic era.

New powers to reach the nanoscale brought us the unprecedented possibility to directly target at the scale of biomolecular interactions, and the motivation to create smart nanostructures that could circumvent the hurdles hindering the success of traditional pharmacological approaches. Forty years on, the progressive integration of bio- and nanotechnologies is starting to produce a transformation of the way we detect, treat and monitor diseases and unresolved medical problems [ 1]. While much of the work remains in research laboratories, the first nano-based treatments, vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic devices, are now receiving approval for commercialisation and clinical use. In this special issue we review recent advances of nanomedical approaches to combat antibiotic resistance, treatment and detection of cancers, targeting neurodegerative diseases, and applications as diverse as dentistry and the treatment of tuberculosis. We also examine the use of advanced smart nanostructured materials in areas such as regenerative medicine, and the controlled release of drugs and treatments. The latter is currently poised to bring ground-breaking changes in immunotherapy: the advent of 'vaccine implants' that continuously control and improve immune responses over time. With the increasingly likely prospect of ending the COVID 19 pandemic with the aid of a nanomedicine-based vaccine (both Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines are based on lipid nanoparticle formulations), we are witnessing the coming of age of nanomedicine. This makes it more important than ever to concentrate on safety: in parallel to pursuing the benefits of nanomedine, we must strengthen the continuous focus on nanotoxicology and safety regulation of nanomedicines that can deliver the medical revolution that is within our grasp.","Contera, Sonia; Bernardino de la Serna, Jorge; Tetley, Teresa D",,511,1

Nearly one-third of the adult population is hypertensive worldwide, it is urgent to identify the factors that determine the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: 148 COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension with clarified outcomes (discharge or deceased) from a national cohort in China were included in this study, of whom 103 were discharged and 45 died in hospital. Multivariate regression showed higher odds of in-hospital death associated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) > 28 pg/ml (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55-6.91) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 7 pg/ml (HR: 3.63, 95% CI:1.54-8.55) at admission. Patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) (n = 52) which were defined as systolic BP &#8805;140 mm Hg or diastolic BP &#8805;90 mm Hg for more than once (&#8805;2 times) during hospitalization, were more likely to have ICU admission (p = 0.037), invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.028), and renal injury (p = 0.005). A stricter BP control with the threshold of 130/80 mm Hg was associated with lower mortality. Treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) suppressors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and spironolactone, was associated with a lower rate of ICU admission compared to other types of anti-hypertensive medications (8 (22.9%) vs. 25 (43.1%), p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Among COVID-19 patients with pre-existing hypertension, elevated hs-cTn and IL-6 could help clinicians to identify patients with fatal outcomes at an early stage, blood pressure control is associated with better clinical outcomes, and RAAS suppressors do not increase mortality and may decrease the need for ICU admission.","Wang, Tao; Tang, Ruidi; Ruan, Honglian; Chen, Ruchong; Zhang, Zili; Sang, Ling; Su, Xi; Yi, Shuting; Ni, Zhengyi; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chunliang; Peng, Yixiang; Liu, Chunli; Li, Jing; Hong, Cheng; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Shiyue",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),511,26

MGNREGA, the rural employment guarantee programme, has had a mixed track record in terms of providing adequate employment to those who need it the most, the quality of asset creation and adequacy of wages offered. This paper makes a case for reorienting a small portion of MGNREGA spending to create micro-entrepreneurs out of the 'reverse migrating' masons, electricians, plumbers and others in rural areas who can directly contribute to augmenting health and sanitization infrastructure in the likely new normal. This will provide relief to those whose livelihoods have been severely impacted and eventually lower dependence on public finances. We propose approval of a new work type for sanitization works without any hard asset creation under MGNREGA and roping in the private sector for its project management skills to quickly skill up the returning migrants as well as to match work with workers on an ongoing basis.","Vasudevan, Gayathri; Singh, Shanu; Gupta, Gaurav; Jalajakshi, C K",Indian J Labour Econ,511,10

A more comprehensive understanding of sphingolipid metabolism in response to liver toxicity has great potential to gain mechanistic insight into hepatotoxicity and define molecular markers that are responsible for hepatocyte dysfunction. Here, we present an analytical platform that provides multidimensional mass spectrometry-based datasets for comprehensive structure characterization of sphingolipids extracted from human primary hepatocytes (HPH) exposed to toxic levels of acetaminophen (APAP). Sphingolipid metabolism as measured by characterization of individual sphingolipid structure was sensitive to APAP toxicity displaying a concentration-dependent response. A number of sphingolipid structures were differentially expressed across varying APAP exposures highlighting the unique role sphingolipid metabolism has in response to hepatotoxicity and its potential use as a molecular marker in DILI.","Li, Linhao; Wang, Hongbing; Jones, Jace W",Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,511,5

To combat shortages, re-use of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended. Prior decontamination is paramount to the re-use of these typically single-use only items and, without compromising their integrity, must guarantee inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other contaminating pathogens. AIM: We provide information on the effect of time-dependent passive decontamination (infectivity loss over time during room temperature storage in a breathable bag) and evaluate inactivation of a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate and a non-enveloped model virus as well as mask and respirator integrity following active multiple-cycle vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP), ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), and dry heat (DH) decontamination. METHODS: Masks and respirators, inoculated with infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus or murine norovirus, were submitted to passive decontamination or single or multiple active decontamination cycles; viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured via TCID50 assay. In parallel, filtration efficiency tests and breathability tests were performed according to EN standard 14683 and NIOSH regulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Infectious porcine respiratory coronavirus and murine norovirus remained detectable on masks and respirators up to five and seven days of passive decontamination. Single and multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH were shown to not adversely affect bacterial filtration efficiency of masks. Single- and multiple UVGI did not adversely affect respirator filtration efficiency, while VHP and DH induced a decrease in filtration efficiency after one or three decontamination cycles. Multiple cycles of VHP-, UVGI-, and DH slightly decreased airflow resistance of masks but did not adversely affect respirator breathability. VHP and UVGI efficiently inactivated both viruses after five, DH after three, decontamination cycles, permitting demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude.

Compared with pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) after PD, it may be speculated that pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) is a risk factor for DGE, because it needs an anastomosis of the remnant pancreas to the back wall of the stomach. This study aimed to compare PG and PJ with regard to the incidence of DGE after PD. METHODS: We performed a prospective open-label randomized clinical trial (RCT) including patients undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy, who were randomly assigned PG or PJ the day before surgery. The primary endpoint was incidence of DGE. RESULTS: The study included 60 patients (30 PG, 30 PJ), of whom seven were deemed unresectable, one was enucleated, and one was switched from PJ to PG during surgery according to the surgeon's decision. Thus, modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed in 27 PG patients and 26 PJ patients.

In some cases, policy measures such as containment can generate psychological distress. High sensory processing sensitivity is an innate component of temperament that characterises individuals with higher sensory sensitivity than their peers. It can be understood either as an individual's ability to adapt to specific situations, or as a factor of vulnerability to certain negative stimuli, which may impact upon quality of life, or manifest itself in the expression of anxiety-depressive symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effects of confinement from a longitudinal perspective on these aspects, according to the degree of sensitivity of individuals.Data collection was carried out longitudinally during the lockdown of the French population. The sample was composed of 493 adults who were asked to respond twice, anonymously, to a research protocol hosted online. We used a tool composed of the French version of the Highly Sensitive Person Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the French short version of the World Health Organisation Quality Of Life scale.The results did not show a significant change in anxiety and depression disorders and quality of life in general between the beginning and the end of lockdown. Furthermore, notable disparities were observed according to the degrees of sensitivity in relation to the type of lifestyle during lockdown.The data from the literature, based on cross-cutting approaches, was clarified by the results, as they did not show any negative effects of lockdown on anxiety-depressive disorders during the lockdown period.

Therefore, to fully define protective humoral immunity, we dissected the early evolution of the humoral response in 193 hospitalized individuals ranging from moderate to severe. Although robust IgM and IgA responses evolved in both survivors and non-survivors with severe disease, non-survivors showed attenuated IgG responses, accompanied by compromised FcÉ£ receptor binding and Fc effector activity, pointing to deficient humoral development rather than disease-enhancing humoral immunity. In contrast, individuals with moderate disease exhibited delayed responses that ultimately matured.

A high level of IL-33 and its soluble decoy receptor sST2 in the acute phase of systemic vasculitis has been demonstrated. Methods: The serum level of IL-33 and sST2 in 50 TAO patients, 20 age- and smoking habit-matched controls and 19 age-matched non-smoker controls was evaluated. Results: The mean level of IL-33 in TAO, smokers and non-smokers was 370.2±61.7ng/mL,132.14±2.6ng/mL and 11.3±0.38ng/mL, respectively. The IL-33 was significantly higher in the TAO than in either control groups (p < 0.001). The IL-33 in the acute phase of TAO was significantly higher than in the patients in the quiescent phase of the disease (p = 0.019). Also, IL-33 in the patients with gangrene was significantly higher than in the patients with non-healing ulcers (p = 0.021). The sST2 in the TAO patients was 49.3±5.58ng/mL, and in smoker and non-smoker controls, it was 45.3±6.3ng/mL and 4.11±0.17ng/mL, respectively. No significant difference was found between the patients and smoker control groups (p = 0.87). The mean ratio of IL-33/sST2 was 27.89±10.44 in the TAO group and, in smokers and non-smokers, it was 2.85±0.48 and 2.84±0.14, respectively. A significantly high level of IL-33/sST2 ratio was observed in TAO patients in both the active and quiescent phases of the disease in comparison to both control groups (p<0.001). Conclusion: The regulation pattern of IL-33/sST2 was different in TAO in comparison to autoimmune vasculitis.","Sharebiani, Hiva; Mohareri, Mehran; Mirhosseini, Ali; Fazeli, Bahare",J Inflamm Res,511,1

After 1 h on coated glass or stainless steel, the viral titer was reduced by about 99.9% on average compared to the uncoated sample. An advantage of a polyurethane-based coating is that polyurethane is already used to coat a large number of everyday objects. Our coating adheres well to glass and stainless steel as well as everyday items that people may fear to touch during a pandemic, such as a doorknob, a pen, and a credit card keypad button.

It has been suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), which are commonly used in patients with hypertension or diabetes and may raise tissue ACE2 levels, could increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated this hypothesis in a consecutive cohort of 1200 acute inpatients with COVID-19 at two hospitals with a multi-ethnic catchment population in London (UK). The mean age was 68 ± 17 years (57% male) and 74% of patients had at least one comorbidity. Overall, 415 patients (34.6%) reached the primary endpoint of death or transfer to a critical care unit for organ support within 21 days of symptom onset. A total of 399 patients (33.3%) were taking ACEi or ARB. Patients on ACEi/ARB were significantly older and had more comorbidities. The odds ratio for the primary endpoint in patients on ACEi and ARB, after adjustment for age, sex and co-morbidities, was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.47-0.84, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence for increased severity of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients on chronic treatment with ACEi or ARB.

We have been actively observing and managing these patients and have recorded the salient features including risk factors, the presenting complaints and also the trends of mortality. We aimed to have risk factors stratification, prevalent symptoms at the time of presentation to the hospital and to determine factors contributing to mortality due to COVID-19 in population of Nowshera (Pakistan). Methodology: In this cross sectional study, 75 cases with returned PCR results were included from 15th February 2020 to 18th April 2020. Data were entered in a format in SPSS version 25, prepared in accordance with the objectives of the study. Results: Out of a total of 75 patients, 20 (26.67%) were females and 55 (73.33%) were males. The mean age was 36±18 y. Out of these, 29 (38.67%) patients were COVID-19 positive by PCR technique, and 46 (61.33%) were negative. The probability of virus detection was higher in male gender (OR = 1.5, Relative Risk (RR) = 1.2). A significant relation of viral infectivity was noted with history of travel to an epidemic area (p = 0.01 OR = 3.85, RR = 1.5) and history of contacts with COVID-19 infected person/s (p = 0.018, OR = 3. 5, RR = 2.3). A high mortality rate of 3/29 (10.34%) for positive COVID-19 cases was recorded. The probability of worse outcome in term of death in COVID-19 positive patients was (p = 0.5, OR = 2.1). Regarding symptoms selection; contact and travel history without any symptoms has a reliability index (RI) of 12/35 (34%) for infectivity. Cough, fever with shortness of breath (RI; 8/12(67%) for positive cases followed by fever and cough with RI of 6/10 (60%) cases etc. Sore throat (RI; 1/13(8%) and flue only (RI;0/3(0%) proved non-reliable symptoms. When plotted the survival graphs of COVID positive vs. COVID negative cases, a similar pattern was recorded that showed the mortality rate in the positive cases was not solely due to COVID-19, though being opportunistic infection, it would have contributed. We recorded refractory COVID-19 in 4/29 (13.79%) cases. Conclusion: We conclude that male gender with history of travel to an epidemic area and contact with COVID-19 patients are strong predisposing factors. Cough, fever with shortness of breath are reliable symptoms for COVID-19 in our suspects. COVID-19 being an opportunistic infection contributes to a higher mortality in respiratory and cardiac patients.","Khan, Hamzullah; Khan, Khalid; Khan, Shahtaj; Zar, Abu",Anaesth.

This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, and an association between RNAemia and clinical severity suggesting the potential utility of plasma viral testing as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19.","Hogan, Catherine A; Stevens, Bryan A; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Garamani, Natasha; Gombar, Saurabh; Yamamoto, Fumiko; Murugesan, Kanagavel; Kurzer, Jason; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A",Clin. infect. dis,511,29

It has been proven that converting large-scale public venues such as stadiums and exhibition centres into Fangcang shelter hospitals, which serve as hospitals for isolation, treatment and disease monitoring of patients with mild symptoms, is the most effective way to control virus transmission and reduce mortality. This paper presents some experiences learnt from treating COVID-19 in Wuhan, the first city to report the outbreak and which suffered from a shortage of emergency supplies, heavy workload among staff and a shortage of hospital beds during the early stages of the pandemic. The experiences include location, accessibility, spacious outdoor area, spacious indoor space, power supply, architectural layout design and partition isolation, ventilation, sewage, and problems in the construction and management of Fangcang shelter hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional approaches to disaster preparedness have demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as poor economic performance, inefficiency and lack of flexibility. Converting large-scale public venues into Fangcang shelter hospitals is an important means to rapidly improve the function of the city's healthcare system during a pandemic. This valuable experience in Wuhan will help other countries in their battle against the current COVID-19 pandemic and will also contribute to disaster preparedness and mitigation in the future.","Fang, Dongping; Pan, Shengjie; Li, Zaishang; Yuan, Ting; Jiang, Benran; Gan, Di; Sheng, Bai; Han, Jing; Wang, Tao; Liu, Zhongmin",,511,1

Serological assays are the most widely used method to measure antibody responses in patients. However, most of the current methods lack the speed, stability, sensitivity, and specificity to be selected as a test for worldwide serosurveys. Here, we demonstrate a novel NanoBiT-based serological assay for fast and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies in sera of COVID-19 patients. This assay can be done in high-throughput manner at 384 samples per hour and only requires a minimum of 5 µL of serum or 10 ng of antibody. The stability of our NanoBiT reporter in various temperatures (4-42 °C) and pH (4-12) settings suggests the assay will be able to withstand imperfect shipping and handling conditions for worldwide seroepidemiologic surveillance in the post-vaccination period of the pandemic. Our newly developed rapid assay is highly accessible and may facilitate a more cost-effective solution for seroconversion screening as vaccination efforts progress.","Azad, Taha; Rezaei, Reza; Singaravelu, Ragunath; Jamieson, Taylor R; Crupi, Mathieu J F; Surendran, Abera; Poutou, Joanna; Taklifi, Parisa; Cowan, Juthaporn; Cameron, Donald William; Ilkow, Carolina S",,511,15

Routine imaging studies have been discouraged due to elevated transmission risk. Patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 often have a protracted hospital course with progression of disease. Given the need for close follow-up of patients, we recommend the use of ultrasonography, particularly point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), to manage patients with COVID-19 through their entire ICU course. POCUS will allow a clinician to evaluate and monitor cardiac and pulmonary function, as well as evaluate for thromboembolic disease, place an endotracheal tube, confirm central venous catheter placement, and rule out a pneumothorax. If a patient improves sufficiently to perform weaning trials, POCUS can also help evaluate readiness for ventilator liberation.","Schrift, David; Barron, Keith; Arya, Rohan; Choe, Carol",J. ultrasound med,511,20

However, ransomware attacks and their spread on hospital infrastructures, including ICE, are rising. Often the adversaries are targeting multiple hospitals with the same ransomware attacks. These attacks are detected by using machine learning algorithms. But the challenge is devising the anti-ransomware learning mechanisms and services under the following conditions: (1) provide immunity to other hospitals if one of them got the attack, (2) hospitals are usually distributed over geographical locations, and (3) direct data sharing is avoided due to privacy concerns. In this regard, this paper presents a federated distributed integrated clinical environment, aka. FedDICE. FedDICE integrates federated learning (FL), which is privacy-preserving learning, to SDN-oriented security architecture to enable collaborative learning, detection, and mitigation of ransomware attacks. We demonstrate the importance of FedDICE in a collaborative environment with up to four hospitals and four popular ransomware families, namely WannaCry, Petya, BadRabbit, and PowerGhost. Our results find that in both IID and non-IID data setups, FedDICE achieves the centralized baseline performance that needs direct data sharing for detection. However, as a trade-off to data privacy, FedDICE observes overhead in the anti-ransomware model training, e.g., 28x for the logistic regression model. Besides, FedDICE utilizes SDN's dynamic network programmability feature to remove the infected devices in ICE.","Thapa, Chandra; Karmakar, Kallol Krishna; Celdran, Alberto Huertas; Camtepe, Seyit; Varadharajan, Vijay; Nepal, Surya",,511,8

Methods and Results Male C57BL/6J mice (4-6 months of age) were subjected to sham surgeries or transverse aortic constriction to produce cardiac pressure overload. Two weeks after transverse aortic constriction, empagliflozin (10 mg/kg per day) or vehicle was administered daily for 4 weeks. Empagliflozin increased survival rate and significantly attenuated adverse left ventricle remodeling and cardiac fibrosis after transverse aortic constriction. Empagliflozin also attenuated left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, evaluated by echocardiography, and increased exercise endurance by 36% in mice with transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure. Empagliflozin significantly increased glucose and fatty acid oxidation in failing hearts, while reducing glycolysis. These beneficial cardiac effects of empagliflozin occurred despite no significant changes in fasting blood glucose, body weight, or daily urine volume. In vitro experiments in isolated cardiomyocytes indicated that empagliflozin had direct effects to improve cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium transients. Importantly, molecular docking analysis and isolated perfused heart experiments indicated that empagliflozin can bind cardiac glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, restore activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and inhibit activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that empagliflozin may directly bind glucose transporters to reduce glycolysis, rebalance coupling between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and regulate the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway to attenuate adverse cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure induced by pressure-overload in non-diabetic mellitus mice.","Li, Xuan; Lu, Qingguo; Qiu, Yunguang; do Carmo, Jussara M; Wang, Zhen; da Silva, Alexandre A; Mouton, Alan; Omoto, Ana C M; Hall, Michael E; Li, Ji; Hall, John E",J Am Heart Assoc,511,21

It focuses on the period of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) between 2000 and 2015 and the first years of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from 2016 to 2018. The paper aims also to assess the level of subsidies for sanitation services in Algeria and the lack of full cost recovery. We then emphasise the idle capacity for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the risks of wastewater discharge on public health and ecological integrity. Our methodological approach is multidimensional and based on a critical reading of reports by institutions responsible for the implementation of sanitation policy. We used water and sanitation data from the water authorities to evaluate the funding of the sanitation subsector and to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of this sub-sector. This study was also facilitated by semi-structured interviews with executive staff in water institutions responsible for the implementation of sanitation policy in Algeria. In the period studied (2000-2018) we find that the sanitation subsector benefited from a significant investment budget (or budgetary allocations) of nearly US$7.58 billion (in constant 1999 US$), representing 20.53% of the total budget allocated to the water sector. However, the low absorption capacity, estimated at 62.7% between 2000 and 2015, meant that the capital expenditure of achieving MDG target 7.C related to sanitation was US$4.38 billion (in constant 1999 US$) out of US$6.98 billion allocated for the same period. The study shows that the decline in real investment since 2009, with a funding gap that increased from 201.49% in 2015 to 385.56% in 2018, casts uncertainty on the fulfillment of SDG targets 6.2 and 6.3 related to sanitation. It is thus very difficult to meet the level of investment planned for 2030. It seems, therefore, that the SDGs will only be comfortably achieved if reforms towards the sustainable recovery of sanitation service costs are undertaken.","Kherbache, Nabil; Oukaci, Kamal",World Dev Perspect,511,23

At present, there are no specifically approved therapeutic agents or vaccines for its treatment. Previous studies have shown that the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is effective in patients with COVID-19. However, its efficacy in patients with persistently positive nucleic acid test is unknown. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we present the clinical data of 5 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted, between January 16 and February 26, 2020, in intensive care unit of Xiaogan Central Hospital. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTIONS: All these patients had a persistently positive nucleic acid test and received CPT. All 5 patients had severe respiratory failure, and thus, required invasive mechanical ventilation. The median time from the onset of symptoms to initiating the CPT was 37 (Interquartile range, 34-44) days. OUTCOMES: Only 2 patients were cured and subsequently discharged, while 3 patients succumbed due to multiple organ failure. CONCLUSION: The time of initiating the CPT may be an important factor affecting its efficacy, and its therapeutic effect in the treatment of COVID-19, in the late stage, is limited.","Wang, Min; Yang, Xiaohong; Yang, Fang; Zhu, Xinxin; Sun, Zhibing; Bao, Peiling; Yan, Yimin",Medicine (Baltimore),511,1

COVID-19 and its associated stressors have the potential to disrupt numerous facets of our everyday lives. Pregnant and postpartum women are especially vulnerable to changes in the availability of routine health and social care services and of their support networks. The current study sought to explore stress levels and their influencers among an international cohort of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was hosted on the Pregistry platform and made available in 12 languages, with respondents sought through a variety of social media platforms and parenting forums. In addition to levels of stress, we collected data related to demographics, COVID-19 exposure and worries, lifestyle changes, traditional and social media use, precautionary measures related to COVID-19, and mental health. RESULTS: In total, 7185 women were included in our sample. We found statistically significant (p-value <0.05) reductions in stress score among older women (&#8805;35 years of age), those either living with a partner or married, those who had graduated from college, and those with medical coverage. Higher stress scores were found among women who resided in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Middle East, and North America compared with those in Europe. When race and ethnicity were included in the model, black women were found to have higher stress compared to white women. Level of family and community support was inversely associated with level of stress. CONCLUSION: Our study is one of the first to explore stress levels among pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found statistically significant differences in stress levels by age, education, marital status, region of residence, race/ethnicity and level of support. Understanding stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, and exploring ways to address it, will be key to contributing to the mental and physical health of expectant and new mothers, as well as their children, in both the short and long term.","Wyszynski, Diego F; Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia; Gordon-Dseagu, Vanessa; Ramiro, Noemi; Koenen, Karestan C",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,511,16

Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic modulation, can be assessed in conjunction with the ActiGraph using a Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor. There is a paucity of nursing literature to guide nurse researchers' protocol development when using the ActiGraph to assess both physical activity and short-term HRV via its Bluetooth capabilities. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe a standardized research ActiGraph and HRV (ActiGraph HRV) protocol for an ongoing randomized controlled trial to measure physical activity and short-term HRV in patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness. METHODS: We outline the study protocol for the standardization of reliable and rigorous physical activity and HRV data collection using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor, and data analysis using ActiLife and Kubios software programs. RESULTS: Sixty-four participants enrolled in the randomized controlled trial to date, and 45 (70.3%) have completed or are actively participating in the study. Heart rate variability data have been collected on 43 of the 45 participants (96%) to date. During the first data collection time point, 42 of 44 participants (95.5%) wore the ActiGraph for a minimum of 5 valid days, followed by 28 of 31 participants (90.3%) and 25 of 26 participants (96.2%) at subsequent data collection time points. The intraclass correlation for physical activity in this study is 0.95 and 0.98 for HRV. DISCUSSION: Revisions to the protocol were successfully implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for data collection using social distancing. The protocol was additionally amended in response to an unanticipated problem with ActiGraph battery life using Bluetooth technology. Use of the ActiGraph HRV protocol has led to a reliable and rigorous measurement of physical activity and HRV for patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness in this randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: We provide an ActiGraph HRV protocol that can be adapted as a model in the development of ActiGraph HRV protocols for future nursing research in community and home-based settings while maximizing social distancing in the current and future pandemics.","Luong, Anna; Goodyke, Madison; Dunn, Susan L; Baynard, Tracy; Bronas, Ulf",J. cardiovasc. nurs,511,1

Recently, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), zero-dimensional (0D) carbon-based nanomaterials, have emerged as a fresh antiviral agent owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Additionally, doping instils beneficial properties in CQDs, augmenting their antiviral potential. The antiviral properties of CQDs can be reinforced by heteroatom doping. Bestowed with multifaceted features, functionalized CQDs can interact with the spike protein of the human coronaviruses and perturb the virus-host cell recognition. Recently, triazole derivatives have been explored as potent inhibitors of human coronaviruses by blocking the viral enzymes such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and helicase, important for viral replication. Moreover, they offer a better aromatic heterocyclic core for therapeutics owing to their higher thermodynamic stability. To curb the current outbreak, triazole functionalized heteroatom co-doped carbon quantum dots (TFH-CQDs) interacting with viral cells spanning the gamut of complexity can be utilized for deciphering the mystery of its inhibitory mechanism against human coronaviruses. In this quest to unlock the potential of antiviral carbon-based nanomaterials, CQDs and triazole conjugated CQDs template comprising a series of bioisosteres, CQDs-1 to CQDs-9, can extend the arsenal of functional antiviral materials at the forefront of the war against human coronaviruses.","Garg, Piyush; Sangam, Sujata; Kochhar, Dakshi; Pahari, Siddhartha; Kar, Chirantan; Mukherjee, Monalisa",Nano Today,511,21

Currently, if climate change enters the arena of public debate, it primarily does so in direct relation to the pandemic. In two experiments, we investigated (1) whether portraying the response to the COVID-19 threat as a “trial run” for future climate action would increase climate-change concern and mitigation support, and (2) whether portraying climate change as a concern that needs to take a “back seat” while focus lies on economic recovery would decrease climate-change concern and mitigation support. We found no support for the effectiveness of a trial-run frame in either experiment. In Experiment 1, we found that a back-seat frame reduced participants’ support for mitigative action. In Experiment 2, the back-seat framing reduced both climate-change concern and mitigation support; a combined inoculation and refutation was able to offset the drop in climate concern but not the reduction in mitigation support.","Ecker, Ullrich K.H.; Butler, Lucy H.; Cook, John; Hurlstone, Mark J.; Kurz, Tim; Lewandowsky, Stephan",J.

This role is still incompletely understood, with involvement of both host and viral factors. To evaluate differential gene expression and pathway involvement in feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and FIP, we applied next-generation RNA-sequencing of the mesenteric lymph nodes from cats with naturally-acquired FIP, as well as those with systemic FCoV infection without FIP, and those with neither. Viral infection was associated with upregulation of viral defenses regardless of the disease state, but to a greater degree in FIP. FIP was associated with higher pro-inflammatory pathway enrichment, whilst non-FIP FCoV-positive cats showed lower enrichment of humoral immunity pathways, below that of uninfected cats in the case of immunoglobulin production pathways. This host response is presumed to be protective. In FIP, downregulation of T cell-related processes was observed, which did not occur in non-FIP FCoV-positive cats. These results emphasize the importance of the host’s immune balance in determining the outcome of the FCoV infection.","Malbon, Alexandra J.; Russo, Giancarlo; Burgener, Carole; Barker, Emi N.; Meli, Marina L.; Tasker, Séverine; Kipar, Anja",Pathogens,511,24

Some studies show that up to half of the events are diagnosed early after admission. OBJECTIVES: To study symptomatic VTE incidence in acute COVID-19 hospitalized patients and to describe timing of VTE diagnosis. METHODS: Multicenter cohort of 5966 patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19. Multicenter Registry of 844 hospitalized patients with acute COVID-19 and associated acute VTE. RESULTS: By the time of cohort data collection, 68 patients (1.14%) were still hospitalized, 19.8% had died, and 5.4% required ICU. During a median follow-up of 6 days (IQR, 4-12), 183 patients (3.07%; 95% CI, 2.64-3.55) presented a symptomatic VTE event. The cumulative incidences of VTE at 7, 14 and 21 days in wards [2.3% (95% CI, 1.9-2.7), 3.6% (95% CI, 3.0-4.3), and 4.3% (95% CI, 3.5-5.1)] were similar to the ones reported in ICU [2.2% (95% CI, 1.0-4.4), 2.9% (95% CI, 1.5-5.3), and 4.1% (95% CI, 2.2-6.8)], but at 30 and 60 days were higher in ICU [6.9% (95% CI, 4.2-10.5), and 12.8% (95% CI, 8.1-18.5)] than in wards. Eighty-eight VTE events (48%) were diagnosed early, within 48 h of admission. VTE was not associated with death (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.55-1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of symptomatic VTE in our COVID-19 cohort is consistent with that of other real-life studies recently published. Early VTE events are, along with COVID-19, the reason for admission rather than an in-hospital complication.","Arribalzaga, Karmele; Martínez-Alfonzo, Inés; Díaz-Aizpún, Carola; Gutiérrez-Jomarrón, Isabel; Rodríguez, Mario; Castro Quismondo, Nerea; Pérez-Fernández, Elia; Velasco-Rodríguez, Diego; Gómez, Elvira; Fernández, Begoña; Vilches, Alba; Martín-Herrero, Sara; Castilla, Lucía; Blanco, María Jesús; Gutiérrez, María Del Mar; Rivas, Isabel; Pascual, Cristina; Rosado, Belén; Sola, Elena; Vidal-Laso, Rosa; Asenjo, Susana; Mora Casado, María Asunción; Benito-Parra, Laurentino; Carmona, Itziar; Marín, Karen; Acedo, Natalia; García-León, Natalia; Marcheco, Alexis; Guillén, Carolina; Fernández, Cristina; Rodríguez, Ramón; Pardo, Laura; Silva, Pablo; Montero, Laura; Meijón, Mar; Massó, Pilar; Llamas-Sillero, Pilar",Thromb Res,511,1

METHODS: We searched for information on ehealth services related to the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The sources of information were mainstream search engines such as Baidu and the popular interactive social platforms such as Webchat. The keywords were ""Internet+pneumonia"", ""Internet clinic"", ""pneumonia online clinic"" and so on. The time of information was from January 20 to February 3, 2020. The key information was extracted and encoded by two persons back-to-back. The coding information included: name of organization provider, launching time, location of provider, service items, user, health workers engaging in the service, and so on. The coded information was entered and analyzed with SPSS 24.0 and Excel. RESULTS: There were totally 57 projects launched by local governments, hospitals and IT companies. Most of them were launched from January 24th to 27th, the hospital and government projects services regionally, especially in eastern provinces. In this study, 90.48% of the enterprises and 100.00% of the hospitals had online fever clinic and consultation services for COVID-19, 66.67% of the enterprises and 37.04% of the hospitals serviced derivative health problems. Only a few projects provided tele-medical consultation. There were individual projects that provided online health management for home quarantine people. Physicians were the main force of various projects. In some hospital projects, there were also nurses, pharmacists and professional technicians to provide featured consultation. CONCLUSION: Ehealth is useful and helpful for the health care system to rapidly cope with health demand during instantaneous and post epidemic time. Regional distribution of ehealth is unbalanced. There are institutional and technical feasibilities for the emergency application of Internet technology. However, community health centers seldom provide ehealth or connect with tertiary hospitals with Internet. Therefore, all kinds of providers within healthcare system should promote emergence ehealth. Tele-medical diagnosis and referral should be developed by local governments during COVID-19. The application of ""Internet+medical treatment"" in community medical institutions and synergy among various institutions should be promoted.","Feng, W; Zhang, L N; Li, J Y; Wei, T; Peng, T T; Zhang, D X; Guo, Z X; Wang, W S",Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,511,16

It has become a challenge for a nations survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare. Malware is a key component of cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack. This work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification framework and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification (DFS-MC). In the proposed framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by fusing the feature spaces of the best performing customized CNN architectures models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it against the standard customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented in two ways: softmax classifier and deep hybrid learning-based malware classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are extracted from customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning classifier to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the concept of transfer learning in a customized CNN architecture based malware classification framework through fine-tuning. The performance of the proposed malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg malware dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and fine-tuning the customized CNN using transfer learning.

The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak was accompanied by a high rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Within the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV-2 is considered to be the third most highly pathogenic virus that infects humans, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Four major mechanisms are thought to be involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signaling pathway, oxidative stress and cell death, cytokine storm, and endothelial dysfunction. Following virus entry and RAS activation, acute respiratory distress syndrome develops with an oxidative/nitrosative burst. The DNA damage induced by oxidative stress activates poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1), viral macrodomain of non-structural protein 3, poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), and transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) channel in a sequential manner which results in cell apoptosis or necrosis. In this review, blockers of angiotensin II receptor and/or PARP, PARG, and TRPM2, including vitamin D3, trehalose, tannins, flufenamic and mefenamic acid, and losartan, have been investigated for inhibiting RAS activation and quenching oxidative burst. Moreover, the application of organic and inorganic nanoparticles, including liposomes, dendrimers, quantum dots, and iron oxides, as therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2 were fully reviewed.

In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in central Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from June 25, 2020, to July 25, 2020, in Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-reported Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Data were cleaned, coded, and analysed using SPSS Version 23. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify the associated factors for mental health outcomes at a p-value of less than 0.05. Results: A total of 816 HCWs completed the self-report questionnaire.

There have been abundant research data and findings in this field. The interference of drugs on gene expression in cell lines, drug-target, protein-virus receptor networks, and immune cell infiltration of the host may provide useful information for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug research. To simplify the complex bioinformatics analysis and facilitate the evaluation of the latest research data, we developed OmiczViz ( http://medcode.link/omicsviz ), a web tool that has integrated drug-cell line interference data, virus-host protein-protein interactions, and drug-target interactions. To demonstrate the usages of OmiczViz, we analyzed the gene expression data from cell lines treated with chloroquine and ruxolitinib, the drug-target protein networks of 48 anti-coronavirus drugs and drugs bound with ACE2, and the profiles of immune cell infiltration between different COVID-19 patient groups. Our research shows that chloroquine had a regulatory role of the immune response in renal cell line but not in lung cell line. The anti-coronavirus drug-target network analysis suggested that antihistamine of promethaziney and dietary supplement of Zinc might be beneficial when used jointly with antiviral drugs.

We present outcome ('recovered', 'isolated' or 'death') risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over 'early' datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. METHOD: Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used 'country', 'age' and 'gender' as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient's 'disease' history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. RESULTS: The use of a patient's 'disease' history improves the prediction of 'death' by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent's 'disease' history performed poorly in test predictions. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient's 'disease' history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.","Khan, Koffka; Ramsahai, Emilie",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,511,23

SARS-CoV-2 infection was shown to suppress global mRNA splicing, and at least 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind specifically to one or more human RNAs. Here, we investigate 17 published experimental and clinical datasets related to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as datasets from the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS as well as Streptococcus pneumonia, HCV, Zika virus, Dengue virus, influenza H3N2, and RSV. We show that genes showing differential alternative splicing in SARS-CoV-2 have a similar functional profile to those of SARS-CoV and MERS and affect a diverse set of genes and biological functions, including many closely related to virus biology. Additionally, the differentially spliced transcripts of cells infected by coronaviruses were more likely to undergo intron-retention, contain a pseudouridine modification and a smaller number of exons than differentially spliced transcripts in the control groups. Viral load in clinical COVID-19 samples was correlated with isoform distribution of differentially spliced genes. A significantly higher number of ribosomal genes are affected by DAS and DGE in betacoronavirus samples, and the betacoronavirus differentially spliced genes are depleted for binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Our results demonstrate characteristic patterns of differential splicing in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS, potentially modifying a broad range of cellular functions and affecting a diverse set of genes and biological functions.","Karlebach, Guy; Baylin, Stephen J; Butler, Daniel; Foox, Jonathan; Levy, Shawn; Meydan, Cem; Mozsary, Christopher; Saravia-Butler, Amanda M; Wurtele, Eve; Mason, Christopher; Beheshti, Afshin; Robinson, Peter N.",,511,10

Disability Nurse Navigators assume a critical intermediary role between the healthcare system and this population. Aim: To discuss the impact that rapid service change, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can have on people with disability and the work of Disability Nurse Navigators who support them. Methods: This clinical case discussion comprises two parts. First, a discussion on the impact that COVID-19 pandemic management has had on one person with an intellectual disability is framed using intersecting notions of cumulative complexity and Burden of Treatment Theory. Following, through a Latourian lens, the role of the Disability Nurse Navigator is explored. Findings: During COVID-19, telehealth has proved an important tool for healthcare continuity. Yet, for some people with some disabilities who live with additional and cumulative layers of health and social complexity, the healthcare workload that is transferred to them is exacerbated as they try to interact with disabling infrastructure. Discussion: The Disability Nurse Navigator recognises that people with disability are not independent of the technologies and structures that make up the healthcare system but that they are mutually constitutive. The Disability Nurse Navigator thus works to stabilise the relationships between changed service provision and the healthcare workload and capacity of people with disability. Conclusion: The work of the Disability Nurse Navigator ultimately mitigated the disruption and additional treatment burden that is transferred to people with disability because of unintended consequences arising from the rapid introduction of service change. © 2021","Brunelli, V.

Three major structural proteins, the spike, envelope and membrane proteins, are amongst several SARS-CoV-2 components synthesised at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected human cells prior to the assembly of new viral particles. Hence, the inhibition of membrane protein synthesis at the ER is an attractive strategy for reducing the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and other obligate viral pathogens. Using an in vitro system, we demonstrate that the small molecule inhibitor ipomoeassin F (Ipom-F) potently blocks the Sec61-mediated ER membrane translocation/insertion of three therapeutic protein targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the viral spike and ORF8 proteins together with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the host cell plasma membrane receptor.

While the detrimental impact of job insecurity on safety outcomes has been extensively investigated, no study has examined the concurrent role of financial stress let alone their emotion-related predictors. OBJECTIVE: The present cross-country research sought to identify the simultaneous effects of affective job insecurity and financial stress in predicting employee safety injuries and accidents under-reporting, and to examine the extent to which emotional contagion of positive/negative emotions at work contribute to the level of experienced economic stress. METHODS: We performed multi-group measurement and structural invariance analyses. RESULTS: Data from employees in the US (Nâ=â498) and Italy (Nâ=â366) suggest that financial stress is the primary mediator between emotional contagion and poor safety outcomes. Moreover, greater anger-contagion predicted higher levels of financial strain and job insecurity whereas greater joy-contagion predicted reduced economic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the relevance of considering the concurrent role of income-and employment-related stressors as predictors of safety-related outcomes.

Here, we use a simple, cheap, and rapid whole blood stimulation assay - an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) - to study T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent COVID-19 patients and in unexposed healthy contacts from Quito, Ecuador. METHODS: Interferon-gamma (INF-Î³) production was measured in the heparinized blood of convalescent and unexposed subjects after stimulation for 24 h with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) protein or the Nucleocapsid (NP) protein, respectively. The presence of IgG-RBD protein antibodies in both study groups was determined with an ""in-house"" ELISA. RESULTS: As measured with INF-Î³ production, 80% of the convalescent COVID-19 patients, all IgG-RBD seropositive, had a strong T-cell response. However, unexpectedly, 44% of unexposed healthy controls, all IgG-RBD seronegative, had a strong virus-specific T-cell response with the COVID-19 IGRA, probably because of prior exposure to common cold-causing coronaviruses or other viral or microbial antigens. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: The high percentage of unexposed healthy subjects with a pre-existing immunity suggests that a part of the Ecuadorian population is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells. Given that the IGRA technique is simple and can be easily scaled up for investigations where high numbers of patients are needed, this COVID-19 IGRA may serve to determine if the T-cell only response represents protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based study.","Echeverría, Gustavo; Guevara, Ángel; Coloma, Josefina; Ruiz, Alison Mera; Vasquez, María Mercedes; Tejera, Eduardo; de Waard, Jacobus H",Int J Infect Dis,511,16

There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies available for MERS-CoV. In this study, we evaluated parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV envelope spike protein (PIV5/MERS-S) in a human DPP4 knockin C57BL/6 congenic mouse model (hDPP4 KI). Following a single-dose intranasal immunization, PIV5-MERS-S induced neutralizing antibody and robust T cell responses in hDPP4 KI mice. A single intranasal administration of 104 PFU PIV5-MERS-S provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERSMA6.1.2) and improved virus clearance in the lung. In comparison, single-dose intramuscular immunization with 106 PFU UV-inactivated MERSMA6.1.2 mixed with Imject alum provided protection to only 25% of immunized mice. Intriguingly, an influx of eosinophils was observed only in the lungs of mice immunized with inactivated MERS-CoV, suggestive of a hypersensitivity-type response. Overall, our study indicated that PIV5-MERS-S is a promising effective vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infection.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes lethal infection in humans, and there is no vaccine.

As its neighbouring countries, Spain and France, it has been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the entire country by universal serological testing under a lockdown environment. Methods A total of 77,543 inhabitants of Andorra were invited to participate in the study. From 4-28 May, 2020, two cross sectional serological surveys were conducted using a rapid serological test (nCOV IgG/IgM) on a finger prick blood sample in 59 drive-through or walk-through checkpoints, all over Andorra. We calculated seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and analysed the main sociodemographic factors associated with being seropositive. Findings 70,494 inhabitants (90.9% of the population) participated in at least one survey. Overall seroprevalence was 11.0%. The most affected age groups were those over 90 years old (15.2%) and 80-89 (13.8%), followed by adults 50-59 (13.6%) and adolescents 10-19 (13.7%). Most seropositive participants, 6,061 (95.1%), were asymptomatic before the surveys. The multivariable analysis showed that the odds of being seropositive was higher among seasonal workers (OR 2.41;95% CI 1.07-5.45) or in the population living in La Massana region, a popular ski-related area (OR 2.66;95% CI 2.44-2.89). A higher seroprevalence was observed in those familiar nuclei with greater numbers of cohabitants: 18% in families with 6 household members or more;13% in medium size families (3/4/5 people) and 12% in small size (1 to 2 people) nuclei. Interpretation The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of Andorra was high during the first wave of the pandemic. Seasonal workers and inhabitants based in La Massana presented a higher seroprevalence. Mass antibody screening allows to identify infection hotspots and should contribute to the design of tailored interventions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Andorra.

The main objective of the present work is to demonstrate how CoV deposited droplets are projected during biomicroscopy and to discuss what kind of precautions should be taken in ophthalmic practice. METHODS: A coupled fluid-structure system comprising smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the finite element method has been built to assess the projection of droplets spreading from an infected person. Different conditions based on the maximum exit flow velocity from the infector's mouth during the ophthalmic examination were modeled. RESULTS: During exhalation, for which the exit flow is ~ 1000 mm/s, the average horizontal distance of the flow front was ~ 200 mm while individual particles can reach up to ~ 500 mm. In case of coughing or sneezing (corresponding to an exit flow of ~ 12,000 mm/s), the average horizontal distance of the flow front was ~ 1300 mm. CONCLUSION: During the ophthalmic examination, the proximity to the patient's nose and mouth was observed to be less than the horizontal distance of flow front particles. Even though mounted breath shields are used, particles flew beyond the shield and contaminate the ophthalmologist. Compared with the current protective breath shields, the use of a larger shield with a minimum radius of 18 cm is needed to decrease viral transmission.","Bostanci Ceran, Basak; Karakoç, Alp; Taciroglu, Ertugrul",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,511,0

Early data shows a lower SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody immune response among SOTRs leading to patient concerns about vaccine efficacy. Public health messaging has largely left out immunocompromised individuals leading to a higher risk of vaccine misinformation. The American Society of Transplantation recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all SOTRs, however, patient concerns and beliefs about vaccination are largely unknown. Methods We conducted a transplant-center-based, pragmatic pilot trial to encourage COVID-19 vaccination among 103 unvaccinated SOTRs. We assessed vaccine concerns, barriers to vaccination, answered questions about efficacy, side effects, and clinical recommendations. Results A total of 24% (n = 25) of SOTRs reported that they will schedule COVID-19 vaccination after the study call, 46% reported that they will consider vaccination in the future, and 30% said they will not consider vaccination. Older age and White race were associated with lower willingness to schedule the vaccine, whereas Black race and longer time from transplant were associated with higher willingness. Common vaccine concerns included lack of long-term data, inconsistent messaging from providers, scheduling inconvenience, and insufficient resources. Follow-up approximately one month after the initial outreach found 52% (n = 13) of liver transplant recipients (LTRs) and 10% (n = 3) of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) subsequently received COVID-19 vaccines for a vaccination rate of 29% among respondents. Conclusion Transplant center-based vaccine outreach efforts can decrease misinformation and increase vaccination uptake;however, vaccine-related mistrust remains high.

The Swiss Federal Council prescribed a lockdown of nonessential businesses. Students and employees of higher education institutions had to install home offices and participate in online lectures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to evaluate lifestyle habits, such as physical activity (PA), sitting time, nutritional habits (expressed as median modified Mediterranean Diet Score [mMDS]), alcohol consumption habits, and sleeping behavior during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were students and employees of a Swiss university of applied sciences. METHODS: All students and employees from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions (ie, nursing, nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, and physiotherapy divisions) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. Information on the lifestyle dimensions of PA, sitting time, nutritional and alcohol consumption habits, and sleep behavior was gathered using adaptations of validated questionnaires. Frequency analyses and nonparametric statistical methods were used for data analysis. Significance was set at 5% &#945; level of error. RESULTS: Prevalence of non-health-enhancing PA was 37.1%, with participants of the division of physiotherapy showing the lowest prevalence. Prevalence of long sitting time (>8 hours/day) was 36.1%. The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations. CONCLUSIONS: In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.

During the second week of viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome can occur and carries high mortality. Unlike most common respiratory viruses, children seem to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and generally develop mild disease with low mortality. However, clusters of severe shock associated with high levels of cardiac biomarkers and unusual vasoplegia requiring inotropes, vasopressors and volume loading have recently been described. Both the clinical symptoms (i.e. high and persistent fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin rash, conjunctival injection and dry cracked lips) and the biological signs (e.g. elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin and high levels of ferritinaemia) mimicked Kawasaki disease. In most cases, intravenous immunoglobin therapy improved cardiac function and led to full recovery within a few days. Adjunctive steroid therapy and sometimes biotherapy (e.g. anti-interleukin 1Ra and anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibodies) were often necessary. Although almost all children fully recovered within a week, some of them later developed coronary artery dilation or aneurysm.

This new strain of coronavirus is not completely understood and to date, there is no treatment of coronavirus. Traditional ayurvedic medicines mainly essential oils and Chinese herbs have always played a vital role in the prevention and treatment of several epidemics and pandemics. In the meantime, guidelines of the ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homoepathy) include a traditional medicinal treatment for flu and fever and also recommended to boost immunity to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It is not possible to find which essential oil will offer the best level of protection. However, it is likely to assume that some essential oils are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way they do with many other known viruses. METHODS: Literature relevant to various essential oils having antiviral activity has been collected and compiled. Various nanocarriers of essential oils have also been stated. The database was collected using various search engines such as jgate, google scholar, scihub, pubmed, sciencedirect etc. Results: Essential oils contain active constituents such as phenolics compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, phenyl propanoids etc., which are responsible for their biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities and many more. But the use of essential oils has always been limited due to poor solubility, solvent toxicity, volatility and low solubility. Many nanotechnology based carriers especially, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and microemulsion etc. have been evidenced to overcome limitations associated with essential oils. CONCLUSION: Several essential oils possess potent antiviral activity and are characterized by fewer side effects and are safe to human use. The nanocarrier systems of these oils have proved the potential to treat viral and bacterial infections.","Kaur, Malkiet; Devi, Gayatri; Nagpal, Manju; Singh, Manjinder; Dhingra, Gitika Arora; Aggarwal, Geeta",Pharm.

DESIGN: Nationwide, population based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark from 13 March 2019 to 27 January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish residents >1 year of age. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Population based healthcare registries that encompass the entire Danish population were used to compare hospital admission and mortality rates during the covid-19 pandemic (from 11 March 2020 to 27 January 2021) with the prepandemic baseline data (from 13 March 2019 to 10 March 2020). Hospital admissions were categorised as covid-19 when patients were assigned a diagnosis code for covid-19 within five days of admission. All patients were followed until migration, death, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Rate ratios for hospital admissions were computed using Poisson regression and were directly standardised using the Danish population on 1 January 2019 as reference. 30 day mortality rate ratios were examined by Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and covid-19 diagnosis was used as a competing risk. RESULTS: 5 753 179 residents were identified during 567.8 million person weeks of observation, with 1 113 705 hospital admissions among 675 447 people. Compared with the prepandemic baseline period (mean hospital admission rate 204.1 per 100 000/week), the overall hospital admission rate for non-covid-19 conditions decreased to 142.8 per 100 000/week (rate ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.74) after the first national lockdown, followed by a gradual return to baseline levels until the second national lockdown when it decreased to 158.3 per 100 000/week (0.78, 0.73 to 0.82). This pattern was mirrored for most major diagnosis groups except for non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, cancer, heart failure, sepsis, and non-covid-19 respiratory infections, which remained lower throughout the study period. Overall 30 day mortality rates were higher during the first national lockdown (mortality rate ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.32) and the second national lockdown (1.20, 1.16 to 1.24), and these results were similar across most major diagnosis groups. For non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis, the 30 day mortality rate ratios were also higher between lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions for all major non-covid-19 disease groups decreased during national lockdowns compared with the prepandemic baseline period. Additionally, mortality rates were higher overall and for patients admitted to hospital with conditions such as respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis. Increased attention towards management of serious non-covid-19 medical conditions is warranted.","Bodilsen, Jacob; Nielsen, Peter Brønnum; Søgaard, Mette; Dalager-Pedersen, Michael; Speiser, Lasse Ole Zacho; Yndigegn, Troels; Nielsen, Henrik; Larsen, Torben Bjerregaard; Skjøth, Flemming",BMJ,511,16

The COVID-19 outbreak impacted the 2021 IVSR match due to travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing VS, logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists. RESULTS: Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (25-41), 32.9% were female, 91.4% were US medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median 2; range 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included: program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance. CONCLUSIONS: Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs. Despite their high cost, away rotations played an important role in the Match, suggesting that time spent at potential institutions allowed ideal assessment of factors for students. The high average number of away rotations and in-person interviews performed in 2019-2020 was limited for the 2021 Match due to COVID-19 restrictions. Programs will have to continue developing creative alternatives or additions to away rotations and the application processes to assure continued success in future post-pandemic Match cycles.","Fereydooni, Arash; Ramirez, Joel L; Morrow, Katherine L; Chandra, Venita; Coleman, Dawn M; Lee, Jason T",J. vasc. surg,511,26

The ligature/LPS method was used to induce periodontitis in rats. LPS was employed to cause inflammation in Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). The transfections with FGFR1 SiRNA, NLRP3 SiRNA and the selective TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 were used to investigate the mechanism of Fisetin-mediated inflammatory reaction in LPS-induced HGF. As a result, Fisetin reduced the alveolar bone gap, reversed histopathological lesion and inhibited serum inflammatory cytokine concentration in periodontitis rats. Fisetin decreased the inflammatory cytokine contents in the supernatant of LPS-induced HGF. The inhibitory effect of Fisetin might be attributed to FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The suppressions of FGFR1, TLR4 and NLRP3 proved that FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 signaling was involved in the Fisetin-mediated inflammatory response. Fisetin also inhibited NLRP3 priming. The data demonstrated that Fisetin attenuated periodontitis by inhibiting inflammatory reaction via FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.","Huang, Xin; Shen, Hong; Liu, Yiran; Qiu, Sainan; Guo, Yan",Int Immunopharmacol,511,16

Methods: We searched multiple data sources including PubMed/MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid EBM Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science, and medrxiv.org from November 2019 through May 27, 2020. We included studies that enrolled COVID-19 patients treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin and reported on cardiac toxicities. We performed a meta-analysis using the arcsine transformation of the different incidences. Results: A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. The pooled incidence of TdP arrhythmia or VT or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000, 95% CI (0-21), I2=96%, 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5%, 95% CI (1-11), I2=98%. The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of &#8805; 60 ms or QTc &#8805; 500 ms was 9%, 95% CI (3-17), I2=97%.

Conclusions: Treatment of COVID-19 patients with CQ or HCQ is associated with a significant risk of drug-induced QT prolongation and relatively higher incidence of TdP/VT/cardiac arrest.

There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies. Among these 21 patients, 20 (95.2%) were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most elective orthopaedic surgery patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are asymptomatic. In the second wave of coronavirus disease, 2019, universal testing of all patients should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent clusters of in-hospital transmission of the disease.","Nakai, Tsuyoshi; Iwasaki, Haruaki; Nishikawa, Tomoya; Higuchi, Ryo; Sakata, Kosuke; Matsuoka, Hozo; Iwata, Hirokazu; Sogo, Eiji; Nanno, Katsuhiko; Nakamura, Shigeko; Kuroda, Sanae; Hayashi, Junzo; Nakata, Seizoh",J. orthop. sci,511,25

In the words of the novelist scholar Arundhati Roy, the COVID-19 pandemic is not merely an epic calamity. It has opened up a new space, a portal, to rethink everything, for example, in how we live, work, produce scientific knowledge, provide health care, and relate to others, be they humans or nonhuman animals in planetary ecosystems. Meanwhile, as the intensity of the pandemic escalates, digital health tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT), biosensors, and artificial intelligence (AI) are being deployed to address the twin goals of social distancing and health care in a ""no touch"" emergency state. Permanent integration of digital technologies into every aspect of post-pandemic civic life-health care, disease tracking, education, work, and beyond-is considered by governments and technology actors around the world. Although digital transformation of health care and industry are in the works, we ought to ensure that digital transformation does not degenerate into ""digitalism,"" which we define here as an unchecked and misguided belief on extreme digital connectivity without considering the attendant adverse repercussions on science, human rights, and everyday practices of democracy. Indeed, the current shrinking of the critically informed public policy space amid a devastating pandemic raises principled questions on the broader and long-term impacts that digital technologies will have on democratic governance of planetary health and society. To this end, a wide range of uncertainties-technical, biological, temporal, spatial, and political-is on the COVID-19 pandemic horizon. This calls for astute and anticipatory innovation policies to steer the health sciences and services toward democratic ends. In this article, we describe new and critically informed approaches to democratize COVID-19 digital health innovation policy, especially when the facts are uncertain, the stakes are high, and decisions are urgent, as they often are in the course of a pandemic. In addition, we introduce a potential remedy to democratize pandemic innovation policy, the concept of ""epistemic competence,"" so as to check the frames and framings of the pandemic innovation policy juggernaut and the attendant power asymmetries. We suggest that if epistemic competence, and attention to not only scientific knowledge but also its framing are broadly appreciated, they can help reduce the disparity between the enormous technical progress and investments made in digital health versus our currently inadequate understanding of the societal dimensions of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and extreme digital connectivity on the planet.","Bayram, Mustafa; Springer, Simon; Garvey, Colin K; Özdemir, Vural",OMICS,511,24

During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), home isolation and activity reduction can lead to hypercoagulability. Here, we report a case of sudden acute myocardial infarction caused by large CAA during the home isolation. CASE PRESENTATION: During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),a 16-year-old man with no cardiac history was admitted to CCU of Tang du hospital because of severe chest pain for 8 h. The patient reached the hospital its own, his electrocardiogram showed typical features of anterior wall infarction, echocardiography was performed and revealed local anterior wall dysfunction, but left ventricle ejection fraction was normal, initial high-sensitivity troponin level was 7.51 ng/mL (<1.0 ng/mL). The patient received loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate and a total occlusion of the LAD was observed in the emergency coronary angiography (CAG). After repeated aspiration of the thrombus, TIMI blood flow reached level 3. Coronary artery aneurysm was visualized in the last angiography. No stent was implanted. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed and the diagnosis of coronary artery aneurysm was further confirmed. The patient was discharged with a better health condition. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery aneurysm is a potential reason of infarction, CAG and IVUS are valuable tools in diagnosis in such cases, during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), home isolation and activity reduction can lead to hypercoagulability, and activities at home should be increased in the high-risk patients.","Ma, Wenshuai; Li, Chunyu; Zhang, Wei; Ji, Zhaole; Li, Yan",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,511,16

In this preclinical study, we investigated whether the combination of HCQ+AZI would be compatible with the therapeutic induction of anticancer immune responses. For this, we used doses of HCQ and AZI that affect whole-body physiology (as indicated by a partial blockade in cardiac and hepatic autophagic flux for HCQ and a reduction in body weight for AZI), showing that their combined administration did not interfere with tumor growth control induced by the immunogenic cell death inducer oxaliplatin. Moreover, the HCQ+AZI combination did not affect the capacity of a curative regimen (cisplatin + crizotinib + PD-1 blockade) to eradicate established orthotopic lung cancers in mice. In conclusion, it appears that HCQ+AZI does not interfere with the therapeutic induction of therapeutic anticancer immune responses.","Liu, Peng; Zhao, Liwei; Ferrere, Gladys; Alves-Costa-Silva, Carolina; Ly, Pierre; Wu, Qi; Tian, Ai-Ling; Derosa, Lisa; Zitvogel, Laurence; Kepp, Oliver; Kroemer, Guido",OncoImmunology,511,1

Under global scrutiny, China has started reviving the social, cultural, and working lives of its inhabitants. However, localized outbreaks of COVID-19 are occurring, indicating that the country still needs to follow disease prevention and control measures. Previous studies have assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of the general public in China regarding COVID-19 during the pandemic. However, little is known about knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of Chinese residents regarding COVID-19 after periods of lockdown. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the KAP and other factors among the residents of Shaanxi Province during the post-lockdown period. Methods: A cross-sectional, network questionnaire survey was conducted in Shaanxi Province from October 1-30, 2020. A total of 1,175 urban residents were interviewed via Wen Juan Xing, an online questionnaire tool. A self-developed online KAP COVID-19 questionnaire was developed in this study. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: general information, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Descriptive statistics and binomial logistic regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. Results: The majority of the participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. They had optimistic attitudes and behaved appropriately toward COVID-19. Education was an associated factor for the knowledge of residents and the knowledge of COVID-19 was high among people with high academic qualifications. Attitudes were more positive in residents who lived with elderly people, women, and children. The score of practice was higher in residents with positive attitudes and high academic qualifications. There was a positive correlation between age and practice. Conclusion: We found that the KAP of residents in Shaanxi was at a relatively high level during the post-lockdown period. Although the lockdown was lifted, the epidemic is not over. Thus, it is necessary to develop targeted health education programs for residents with different demographic characteristics in Shaanxi.","Xu, Na; Zhang, Yongai; Zhang, Xiaona; Zhang, Guangwei; Guo, Zikai; Zhao, Nan; Li, Fei",Front Public Health,511,1

Therefore, we believe that humoral immunity, created through the MMR vaccination, provides children with advantageous protection against COVID-19 as well, however, an experimental analysis is required.","Sidiq, Karzan R.; Sabir, Dana Khdr; Ali, Shakhawan M.; Kodzius, Rimantas",Front.

We hypothesize that donor characteristic including race/ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, and diagnostic groups influences HSPC mobilization. Diagnostic groups include healthy allogeneic donors, autologous multiple myeloma (MM) and non-MM donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Here, we conducted a single-center retrospective study in 64 autologous patients and 48 allogeneic donors. Autologous donors were patients diagnosed with MM or non-MM. All donors were grouped as African American (AA), White (W), or ""Other""(O). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated diagnostic group differences for CD34+ cell yields between race/ethnicity. Specifically, non-MM patients had the lowest CD34+ cell yields in AA and O, but not in W. For pre-apheresis peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cell numbers, race/ethnicity had a significant effect both in bivariate and multivariate analyses. Non-MM patients had the lowest, and AA patients had the highest PB CD34+ cells. The results support the view that past therapies used in MM are likely more conducive of recovery of HSPC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that race/ethnicity and diagnostic group differences influenced CD34+ cell mobilization response across donor types. Interestingly, autologous MM donors with the aid of plerixafor displayed comparable CD34 yields to allogeneic donors. Even though both MM and non-MM donors received plerixafor, non-MM donors had significantly lower CD34 yields among AA and O donors but not in W donors. Larger studies would be required to validate the role of diagnostic groups and race/ethnicity interactions.","Uzoka, Chukwuemeka; Liu, Li C; Park, Youngmin; Lin, Yuankai; Patel, Pritesh; Campbell-Lee, Sally; Sweiss, Karen; Wang, Xinhe; Tepak, Elena; Peace, David; Saraf, Santosh; Rondelli, Damiano; Mahmud, Nadim",,511,1

To better understand how discussions on different topics/oral diseases vary across the users, we acquire or infer demographic information of users and other characteristics based on retrieved information from user profiles. Women and younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk about oral health problems. We use the LDA topic model to extract the major topics/oral diseases in tweets. Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users talk about wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86% tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped tooth/tooth break, 16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding. By conducting logistic regression, we find that discussions vary across user characteristics. More importantly, we find social disparities in oral health during the pandemic. Specifically, we find that health insurance coverage rate is the most significant predictor in logistic regression for topic prediction. People from counties with higher insurance coverage tend to tweet less about all topics of oral diseases. People from counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth decay/gum bleeding and chipped tooth/tooth break. Older adults (50+), who are vulnerable to COVID-19, are more likely to discuss dental pain. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based study to analyze and understand oral health in America amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope the findings of our study through the lens of social media can provide insights for oral health practitioners and policy makers.","Fan, Yangxin; Lyu, Hanjia; Xiao, Jin; Luo, Jiebo",,511,10

The HH-GLI pathway has mostly been investigated in the context of canonical signal transduction and the inhibition of the membrane components of the pathway. In this work we investigated the role of downstream inhibitors GANT61 and lithium chloride (LiCl) on cell viability, wound closure, and colony forming ability of HNSCC cell lines. Five HNSCC cell lines were treated with HH-GLI pathway inhibitors affecting different levels of signal transduction. GANT61 and LiCl reduce the proliferation and colony formation capabilities of HNSCC cell lines, and LiCl has an additional effect on wound closure. The major effector of the HH-GLI signaling pathway in HNSCC is the GLI3 protein, which is expressed in its full-length form and is functionally regulated by GSK3ß. LiCl treatment increases the inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation of the GSK3ß protein, leading to increased processing of GLI3 from full-length to repressor form, thus inhibiting HH-GLI pathway activity. Therefore, downstream inhibition of HH-GLI signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.","Zubcic, Vedran; Rincic, Nikolina; Kurtovic, Matea; Trnski, Diana; Musani, Vesna; Ozretic, Petar; Levanat, Sonja; Leovic, Dinko; Sabol, Maja",,511,1

The rapid community transmission and relatively high mortality rates with COVID-19 in modern times are relatively unique features of this flu pandemic and have resulted in an unparalleled global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2, being a respiratory virus, mainly affects the lungs, but is capable of infecting other vital organs, such as brain, heart and kidney. Emerging evidence suggests that the virus also targets male and female reproductive organs that express its main receptor ACE2, although it is as yet unclear if this has any implications for human fertility. Furthermore, professional bodies have recommended discontinuing fertility services during the pandemic such that reproductive services have also been affected. Although increased safety measures have helped to mitigate the propagation of COVID-19 in a number of countries, it seems that there is no predictable timeline to containment of the virus, a goal likely to remain elusive until an effective vaccine becomes available and widely distributed across the globe. In parallel, research on reproduction has been postponed for obvious reasons, while diagnostic tests that detect the virus or antibodies against it are of vital importance to support public health policies, such as social distancing and our obligation to wear masks in public spaces. This review aims to provide an overview of critical research and ethics issues that have been continuously emerging in the field of reproductive medicine as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically unfolds.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: Assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CCR9: C-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 9; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; Ct: Cycle threshold; CXCR6: C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 6; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: Embryo transfer; FSH: Follicle Stimulating Hormone; FFPE: formalin fixed paraffin embedded; FYCO1: FYVE And Coiled-Coil Domain Autophagy Adaptor 1; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IUI: Intrauterine insemination; IVF: In vitro fertilization; LH: Luteinizing Hormone; LZTFL1: Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor Like 1; MAR: medically assisted reproduction services; MERS: Middle East Respiratory syndrome; NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; ORF: Open Reading Frame; PPE: personal protective equipment; RE: RNA Element; REDa: RNA Element Discovery algorithm; RT-PCR: Reverse=trascriptase transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-2: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; SLC6A20: Solute Carrier Family 6 Member 20; SMS: Single Molecule Sequencing; T: Testosterone; TMPRSS2: transmembrane serine protease 2; WHO: World Health Organization; XCR1: X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor.","Anifandis, George; Tempest, Helen G; Oliva, Rafael; Swanson, Grace M; Simopoulou, Mara; Easley, Charles A; Primig, Michael; Messini, Christina I; Turek, Paul J; Sutovsky, Peter; Ory, Steve J; Krawetz, Stephen A",Syst Biol Reprod Med,511,26

The genesis, processing, and regulation of information are dictated by a huge network of protein interactions. This is proven by the fact that alterations in the levels of proteins, single amino acid changes, post-translational modifications, protein products arising out of gene fusions alter the interaction landscape leading to diseases such as congenital disorders, deleterious syndromes like cancer, and crippling diseases like the neurodegenerative disorders which are often fatal. Needless to say, there is an immense effort to understand the biophysical basis of such direct interactions between any two proteins, the structure, domains, and sequence motifs involved in tethering them, their spatio-temporal regulation in cells, the structure of the network, and their eventual manipulation for intervention in diseases. In this chapter, we will deliberate on a few techniques that allow us to dissect the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of protein interaction, how innovation has rendered some of the traditional techniques applicable for rapid analysis of multiple samples using small amounts of material. These advances coupled with automation are catching up with the genome-wide or proteome-wide studies aimed at identifying new therapeutic targets. The chapter will also summarize how some of these techniques are suited either in the standalone mode or in combination with other biophysical techniques for the drug discovery process.","Harish, Mahalakshmi; Venkatraman, Prasanna",Emerg Top Life Sci,511,16

Currently, no specific drug combination has consistently demonstrated an association with mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of associations observed between the different in-hospital treatments administered to a series of 238 patients admitted for COVID-19 and their relationship with mortality. METHODS: The electronic medical records of patients that discharged or died from COVID-19 in the Hospital Universitario San Cecilio (Granada, Spain) between March 16 and April 10, 2020 were analysed. From these records, information was obtained on sex, age, comorbidities at admission, clinical information, analytical parameters, imaging tests and empirical treatments used. The outcome variable was the in-hospital mortality. To estimate the associations between the different therapeutic alternatives and the risk of mortality, hazard ratios adjusted for age, sex, previous pathologies and severity at discharge were estimated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: The most frequently used combination of drugs was low molecular weight heparins, hydroxychloroquine, and ritonavir/lopinavir. None of the analysed treatments showed independent association with mortality. The drugs that showed a greater inverse association with mortality were tocilizumab and corticoids. CONCLUSIONS: The observed association patterns are consistent with previous literature. It seems necessary to design randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluate the possible protector effect of tocilizumab and corticoids in the risk of mortality for some subgroups of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Valero-Ubierna, María Del Carmen; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",Med Clin (Barc),511,1

Effects can range from mild changes in nutrient intake to a significant decrease in quality of life. Olfactory dysfunction can follow clinical problems such as trauma to the brain and nose. During recent months, in the setting of the current worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, it has become clear that olfaction can also be damaged by viruses that enter the body through the nose. METHODS: To learn more about this important clinical problem, we reviewed the current literature about smell sensation and the contextual application of altered olfaction in the setting of COVID-19. Knowledge about this topic, along with other clinical aspects of COVID-19, is expanding quickly. CONCLUSION: Nurses perform assessments, assist with implementing treatment interventions, and provide vital education to patients and their families. These interventions help patients with olfactory dysfunction achieve the best possible functional outcome.","Mortimer, Diane Schretzman; Duverneau-Salifu, Moira",J Neurosci Nurs,511,16

In contrast, a possible SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of corpses and subsequently its duration under post mortem circumstances remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the infectivity and its duration of deceased COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) patients. Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). Determination of infectivity was performed by means of virus isolation in cell culture. In two cases, virus isolation was successful for swabs and tissue samples of the respiratory tract (PMI 4 and 17 days). The two infectious cases showed a shorter duration of COVID-19 until death than the two non-infectious cases (2 and 11 days, respectively, compared to > 19 days), which correlates with studies of living patients, in which infectivity could be narrowed to about 6 days before to 12 days after symptom onset.

We isolated Asaia strains from wild mosquitoes and flowers in Senegal and demonstrated the transmission of the bacteria from infected mosquitoes to sterile flowers and then to 26.6% of noninfected mosquitoes through nectar feeding. Thus, nectar-producing plants may naturally acquire Asaia and then colonize Anopheles mosquitoes through food-borne contamination.

Despite the global prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or drugs. Dietary plant derived exosome-like vesicles are known as edible nanoparticles (ENPs). ENPs are filled with microRNAs (miRNAs), in bioavailable form. Recently, cross-kingdom regulation of human transcripts by plant miRNAs have been demonstrated. However, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has not been described. STUDY DESIGN: Mature ENP-derived miRNA sequences were retrieved from small RNA sequencing datasets available in the literature. In silico target prediction was performed to identify miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2. ENPs were isolated from ginger and grapefruit plants and the expression of SARS-CoV-2 targeting miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: From a total of 260 ENP-derived miRNAs, we identified 22 miRNAs that could potentially target SARS-CoV-2 genome. 11 miRNAs showed absolute target specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 but not SARS-CoV. ENPs from soybean, ginger, hamimelon, grapefruit, tomato and pear possess multiple miRNAs targeting different regions within SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, osa/cme miR-530b-5p specifically targeted the ribosomal slippage site between ORF1a and ORF1b. We validated the relative expression of six miRNAs (miR-5077, miR-6300, miR-156a, miR-169, miR-5059 and miR-166 m) in ginger and grapefruit ENPs by RT-PCR which showed differential enrichment of specific miRNAs in ginger and grapefruit ENPs. CONCLUSION: Since administration of ENPs leads to their accumulation into lung tissues in vivo, ENP derived miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome has the potential to be developed as an alternative therapy.","Kalarikkal, Sreeram Peringattu; Sundaram, Gopinath M",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,511,26

Surgical resection is the standard treatment, but there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of these tumours. Methods: Five databases were searched from inception to April 1, 2019 for studies reporting on SFTP management. Results: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria (1542 patients, all non-comparative case series); 98% of these patients underwent resection and all SFTP included were pathologically diagnosed. 394 out of 1299 cases (30.5%, 95% CI 27.8-32.8%) were malignant with recurrence rates of between 0% and 42.9%. A pleural effusion was always associated with a negative outcome, but no other features were consistently reported to have negative associations. Preoperative biopsies incorrectly reported malignant histology in two studies. Over 25% of cases of recurrence occurred when a complete (R0) resection had been achieved. The first recurrence occurred >5â years after the initial resection in at least 23% of cases. Conclusions: There is strong evidence to support long-term surveillance after surgical resection of SFTP, even where a complete (R0) resection has been achieved; however, there is no clear evidence to inform clinicians regarding the selection of patients who should undergo resection. The rates of malignant SFTP and SFTP recurrence are higher than previously reported. Only those that were pathologically diagnosed or resected were included, which may bias the data towards more aggressive tumours. Data collection on radiologically diagnosed SFTP is required to draw conclusions regarding the timing and need for intervention.","Mercer, Rachel M; Wigston, Charlotte; Banka, Radhika; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Benamore, Rachel; Nicholson, Andrew G; Asciak, Rachelle; Hassan, Maged; Hallifax, Robert J; Wing, Louise; Bedawi, Eihab O; Maskell, Nick A; Harriss, Elinor K; Miller, Robert F; Rahman, Najib M",ERJ open res,511,22

However, therapeutic applications of short- to medium-chain fatty acids are limited by physical characteristics such as immiscibility in aqueous solutions. We evaluated a novel proprietary formulation based on an emulsion of short-chain caprylic acid, ViroSAL, for its ability to inhibit a range of viral infections in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, ViroSAL inhibited the enveloped viruses Epstein-Barr, measles, herpes simplex, Zika and orf parapoxvirus, together with Ebola, Lassa, vesicular stomatitis and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) pseudoviruses, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Evaluation of the components of ViroSAL revealed that caprylic acid was the main antiviral component; however, the ViroSAL formulation significantly inhibited viral entry compared with caprylic acid alone. In vivo, ViroSAL significantly inhibited Zika and Semliki Forest virus replication in mice following the inoculation of these viruses into mosquito bite sites. In agreement with studies investigating other free fatty acids, ViroSAL had no effect on norovirus, a non-enveloped virus, indicating that its mechanism of action may be surfactant disruption of the viral envelope. We have identified a novel antiviral formulation that is of great interest for the prevention and/or treatment of a broad range of enveloped viruses, particularly those of the skin and mucosal surfaces.","Fletcher, Nicola F; Meredith, Luke W; Tidswell, Emma L; Bryden, Steven R; Gonçalves-Carneiro, Daniel; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Shannon-Lowe, Claire; Folan, Michael A; Lefteri, Daniella A; Pingen, Marieke; Bailey, Dalan; McKimmie, Clive S; Baird, Alan W",J Gen Virol,511,14

In this study, we analyzed the clinical profiles of patients with COVID 19 and acute pancreatitis. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on Research Patient Data Registry data which was pooled from five Mass General Brigham Healthcare Network hospitals. We extracted data on demographics, symptoms, ICU transfer, mechanical ventilation, laboratories' profiles, imaging findings, and patient outcomes. RESULT: Of 985 screened adult patients, 17 were eligible for the study, 9 (52.9%) were admitted primarily for respiratory failure and developed acute pancreatitis after a median of 22.5 days (13-76 days) from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. On contrary, eight patients presented with typical symptoms and were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, the majority with mild severity (62.5%) on admission. Patients who were admitted primarily with severe COVID-19 illness were younger (median age 57 vs. 63 years), females (55.6 vs. 25%), of Hispanic ethnicity (55.6 vs. 25%), and obese (88.9 vs. 37.5%). The median peak lipase, C reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer were higher among patients who developed acute pancreatitis later during hospitalization. Patients who developed acute pancreatitis later also experienced higher episodes of necrotizing pancreatitis (11.1% vs. 0), thromboembolic complications (55.6 vs. 12.5%), and higher mortality (37.5 vs. 12.5%).

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional document review within two purposively selected clusters (one poorly-resourced and one well-resourced), from each arm of a cluster-randomized trial at two different time points: before and during the trial. The total trial consisted of 16 clusters randomized into 8 intervention and 8 control clusters to assess the impact of an mCDMSS on neonatal mortality in Ghana. We evaluated health workers' adherence (expressed as percentages) to birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice and cord sepsis protocols by reviewing medical records of neonatal in-patients using a checklist. Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type. In addition, we tracked concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the clusters during the 18-month intervention period. RESULTS: In the intervention arm, mean adherence was 35.2% (SD = 5.8%) and 43.6% (SD = 27.5%) for asphyxia; 25.0% (SD = 14.8%) and 39.3% (SD = 27.7%) for jaundice; 52.0% (SD = 11.0%) and 75.0% (SD = 21.2%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. In the control arm, mean adherence was 52.9% (SD = 16.4%) and 74.5% (SD = 14.7%) for asphyxia; 45.1% (SD = 12.8%) and 64.6% (SD = 8.2%) for jaundice; 53.8% (SD = 16.0%) and 60.8% (SD = 11.7%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. We observed nonsignificant improvement in protocol adherence in the intervention clusters but significant improvement in protocol adherence in the control clusters. There were 2 concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the intervention clusters and over 12 in the control clusters during the intervention period. CONCLUSION: Whether mHealth interventions can improve adherence to neonatal health protocols in low-resource settings cannot be ascertained by this study. Neonatal health improvement activities are however likely to improve protocol adherence. Future mHealth evaluations of protocol adherence must account for other concurrent interventions in study contexts.","Amoakoh, Hannah Brown; Klipstein-Grobusch, Kerstin; Agyepong, Irene Akua; Amoakoh-Coleman, Mary; Kayode, Gbenga A; Reitsma, J B; Grobbee, Diederick E; Ansah, Evelyn K",BMC Pediatr,511,16

We aimed to describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (during a relatively low transmission period) and associated societal restrictions on presentations, admissions and outpatient visits. DESIGN: We compared hospital activity in 2020 with the preceding 5 years, 2015-2019, using a retrospective cohort study design. SETTING: Quaternary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Emergency department presentations, hospital admissions and outpatient visits from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2020, n=896 934 episodes of care. INTERVENTION: In Australia, the initial peak COVID-19 phase was March-April. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Separate linear regression models were fitted to estimate the impact of the pandemic on the number, type and severity of emergency presentations, hospital admissions and outpatient visits. RESULTS: During the peak COVID-19 phase (March and April 2020), there were marked reductions in emergency presentations (10 389 observed vs 14 678 expected; 29% reduction; p<0.05) and hospital admissions (5972 observed vs 8368 expected; 28% reduction; p<0.05). Stroke (114 observed vs 177 expected; 35% reduction; p<0.05) and trauma (1336 observed vs 1764 expected; 24% reduction; p<0.05) presentations decreased; acute myocardial infarctions were unchanged. There was an increase in the proportion of hospital admissions requiring intensive care (7.0% observed vs 6.0% expected; p<0.05) or resulting in death (2.2% observed vs 1.5% expected; p<0.05).

In this study, we aimed to visualize time-associated alterations of COVID-19 in the context of continents and countries. METHODS: Using COVID-19 case and death data from February to December 2020 offered by Johns Hopkins University, we generated time-associated balloon charts with multiple epidemiological indicators including crude case fatality rate (CFR), morbidity, mortality and the total number of cases, to compare the progression of the pandemic within a specific period across regions and countries, integrating seven related dimensions together. The area chart is used to supplement the display of the balloon chart in daily new COVID-19 case changes in UN geographic regions over time. Javascript and Vega-Lite were chosen for programming and mapping COVID-19 data in browsers for visualization. RESULTS: From February 1st to December 20th 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread across UN subregions in the chronological order. It was first reported in East Asia, and then became noticeable in Europe (South, West and North), North America, East Europe and West Asia, Central and South America, Southern Africa, Caribbean, South Asia, North Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania, causing several waves of epidemics in different regions. Since October, the balloons of Europe, North America and West Asia have been rising rapidly, reaching a dramatically high morbidity level ranging from 200 to 500/10 000 by December, suggesting an emerging winter wave of COVID-19 which was much bigger than the previous ones. By late December 2020, some European and American countries displayed a leading mortality as high as or over 100/100 000, represented by Belgium, Czechia, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Hungary, Bulgaria, Peru, USA, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. The mortality of Iran was the highest in Asia (over 60/100 000), and that of South Africa topped in Africa (40/100 000). In the last 15 days, the CFRs of most countries were at low levels of less than 5%, while Mexico had exceptional high CFR close to 10%.

Previous works generally extract the global image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail, ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT). Experiments on the CX-CHR dataset and our COVID-19 CT Report dataset demonstrate that our proposed ASGK is able to generate a robust and accurate report, and moreover outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both medical terminology classification and paragraph generation metrics.","Li, Mingjie; Wang, Fuyu; Chang, Xiaojun; Liang, Xiaodan",,511,1

Strict lockdowns have not been enforced, potentially affecting viral dissemination. To understand the levels of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant women (n = 5,100) were sampled at random between 14 March 2020 and 28 February 2021. METHODS: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n = 2,600) and pregnant women (n = 2,500) were sampled for consecutive weeks (at four intervals) throughout the study period. Sera from all participants and a cohort of historical (negative) controls (n = 595) were screened for IgG responses against stabilized trimers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and the smaller receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard analytical approaches, a probabilistic (cut-off independent) Bayesian framework that assigns likelihood of past infection was used to analyse data over time. SETTING: Healthy participant samples were randomly selected from their respective pools through Karolinska University Hospital. The study was carried out in accordance with Swedish Ethical Review Authority: registration number 2020-01807. PARTICIPANTS: No participants were symptomatic at sampling, and blood donors were all over the age of 18. No additional metadata were available from the participants. RESULTS: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to the winter second wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 13 December 2020. By the end of February 2021, 19% of the population tested seropositive. Notably, 96% of seropositive healthy donors screened (n = 56) developed neutralizing antibody responses at titres comparable to or higher than those observed in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection engenders a competent B-cell response. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the first year since the start of community transmission, seropositivity levels in metropolitan in Stockholm had reached approximately one in five persons, providing important baseline seroprevalence information prior to the start of vaccination.","Castro Dopico, X; Muschiol, S; Christian, M; Hanke, L; Sheward, D J; Grinberg, N F; Rorbach, J; Bogdanovic, G; Mcinerney, G M; Allander, T; Wallace, C; Murrell, B; Albert, J; Karlsson Hedestam, G B",J. intern. med,511,16

The psychological impact of the pandemic itself and the lockdown in particular is likely to be huge. Aim: To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on general population in West Bengal. Materials and Methods: It was an online survey which was conducted using Google Forms with link sent using WhatsApp. A 38-item self-designed questionnaire was used for the study. The survey questionnaire would take around 5-7 min to complete. Total 507 responses were received by the stipulated time. Results: Near about five-seventh (71.8%) and one-fifth (24.7%) of the respondents felt more worried and depressed, respectively, in the past 2 weeks. Half of the respondents (52.1%) were preoccupied with the idea of contracting COVID-19 and one-fifth (21.1%) of the respondents were repeatedly thinking of getting themselves tested for the presence of COVID-19 despite having no symptoms. Majority (69.6%) of the respondents were worried about the financial loss they were incurring during the period of lockdown. One-fourth (25.6%) and one-third (30.8%) of the respondents found that COVID-19 pandemic had threatened their existence and they found it difficult to adjust to the new routine during 21-day lockdown period, respectively. Conclusion: The index survey suggested that worry and sleep disturbances were common among the respondents in the past 2 weeks. The pandemic threatened the existence of the respondents to a great extent and affected their mental status negatively.","Chakraborty, Kaustav; Chatterjee, Moumita",Indian J. Psychiatry,511,20

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particular in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential.

In view of that, this phenomenographic design study sought to investigate and document the qualitatively different perspectives of thirteen students with visual impairments (SWVIs) as they transitioned and studied fully in an online space. The experiences of the SWVIs were captured in five themes that emerged from the analysis of the field data. The five themes are pre-COVID-19 academic experiences, [initial] reaction to online shift, preparation towards online shift, coping mechanisms in fully online learning spaces and preferred post-COVID-19 learning space. In the end, the SWVIs expressed more challenges with online learning than benefits and opted for a switch to the face-to-face mode post-COVID-19. Consequently, the study recommends inter alia, training for students and faculty to build sustainable online relationships; deployment of participatory technologies to build learner autonomy; and the need for the University to craft a policy of inclusiveness which embeds 'ubuntu' (common humanity) and human awareness to reverse inequalities among its students.","Amponsah, Samuel",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),511,5

From this viewpoint, individuals or, more generally, social stimuli are thought of as a weighted sum of harmonics with different frequencies: Low frequencies represent general categories such as gender, ethnic group, nationality, etc., whereas high frequencies account for personal characteristics. Individuals are then seen by observers as the output of a filter that emphasizes a certain range of high or low frequencies. The selection of the filter depends on the social distance between the observing individual or group and the person being observed as well as on motivation, cognitive resources and cultural background. Enhancing low- or high-frequency harmonics is not on equal footing, the latter requiring supplementary energy. This mirrors a well-known property of signal processing filters. More generally, in the light of this correspondence, we show that several established results of social cognition admit a natural interpretation and integration in the signal processing language. While the potential of this connection between an area of social psychology and one of information engineering appears considerable (compression, information retrieval, filtering, feedback, feedforward, sampling, aliasing, etc.), in this paper we shall limit ourselves to laying down what we consider the pillars of this bridge on which future research may be founded.","Maass, Anne; Pavon, Michele; Suitner, Caterina",,511,1

Furthermore, hyperphosphorylation of tau prevents it from fulfilling its physiological role as a microtubule-stabilizing protein and leaves it increasingly vulnerable to self-assembly, suggestive of a central underlying role of hyperphosphorylation as a contributing factor in the etiology of these diseases. Via in vitro phosphorylation and regulation of kinase activity within cells and acute brain tissue, we reveal that the inflammation associated kinase, protein kinase R (PKR), directly phosphorylates numerous abnormal and disease-modifying residues within tau including Thr181, Ser199/202, Thr231, Ser262, Ser396, Ser404 and Ser409. Similar to disease processes, these PKR-mediated phosphorylations actively displace tau from microtubules in cells. In addition, PKR overexpression and knockdown, respectively, increase and decrease tau protein and mRNA levels in cells. This regulation occurs independent of noncoding transcriptional elements, suggesting an underlying mechanism involving intra-exonic regulation of the tau-encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. Finally, acute encephalopathy in wild type mice, induced by intracranial Langat virus infection, results in robust inflammation and PKR upregulation accompanied by abnormally phosphorylated full-length- and truncated tau. These findings indicate that PKR, independent of other kinases and upon acute brain inflammation, is capable of triggering pathological modulation of tau, which, in turn, might form the initial pathologic seed in several tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease and Chronic traumatic encephalopathy where inflammation is severe.","Reimer, Lasse; Betzer, Cristine; Kofoed, Rikke Hahn; Volbracht, Christiane; Fog, Karina; Kurhade, Chaitanya; Nilsson, Emma; Överby, Anna K; Jensen, Poul Henning",Brain pathol,511,25

No study published to date has analyzed the characteristics of headache in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of COVID-19 related headaches. METHODS: We conducted a survey of Spaniard healthcare professionals who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and presented headache during the course of the disease. The survey addressed respondents' medical history and headache characteristics, and we analyzed the association between both. RESULTS: We analyzed the responses of a sample of 112 healthcare professionals. History of migraine was reported by 20/112 (17.9%) of respondents, history of tension-type headache by 8/112 (7.1%), and history of cluster headache was reported by a single respondent; 82/112(73.2%) of respondents had no history of headache. Headache presented independently of fever, around the third day after symptom onset. The previous history of migraine was associated with a higher frequency of pulsating headache (20% in patients with previous migraine vs 4.3% in those with no history of migraine, P = .013). CONCLUSION: Headache is often holocranial, hemicranial, or occipital, pressing, and worsens with physical activity or head movements. Because the characteristics of the headache and the associated symptoms are heterogeneous in our survey, we suggest that several patterns with specific pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie the headache associated with COVID-19.","Porta-Etessam, Jesús; Matías-Guiu, Jordi A; González-García, Nuria; Gómez Iglesias, Patricia; Santos-Bueso, Enrique; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; García-Azorín, David; Matías-Guiu, Jorge",Headache,511,16

We analyzed 185 commonly administered TCM recipes comprised of 210 herbs nationwide to reveal mechanistic insight. Eight out of the 10 most commonly used herbs showed anti-coronavirus potential by intersecting with COVID-19 targets. Intriguingly, 17 compounds from the 5 most commonly used herbs were revealed to have direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential by docking with the two core structures [CoV spike (S) glycoprotein (6SVB) and CoV 3CL hydrolase (6LU7)]. Seven reported COVID-19 drugs served as positive controls; among them, retionavir (-7.828 kcal/mol) and remdesivir (-8.738 kcal/mol) performed best with 6VSB and 6LU7, respectively. The top candidate was madreselvin B (6SVB: -8.588 kcal/mol and 6LU7: -9.017 kcal/mol), an appreciable component of Flos Lonicerae. Eighty-six compounds from 22 unlisted herbs were further identified among 2,042 natural compounds, completing our arsenal for TCM formulations. The mechanisms have been implicated as multifactorial, including activation of immunoregulation (Th2, PPAR and IL10), suppression of acute inflammatory responses (IL-6, IL-1&#945;/ß, TNF, COX2/1, etc.), enhancement of antioxidative activity (CAT and SOD1), and modulation of apoptosis (inhibited CASP3).

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is used to treat chimeric antigen receptor T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome and may attenuate the dysregulated immune response in COVID-19. We compared outcomes among tocilizumab-treated and non-tocilizumab-treated critically ill COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at a tertiary referral center investigating all patients admitted to the intensive care unit for COVID-19 who had a disposition from the hospital because of death or hospital discharge between March 1 and May 18, 2020 (n = 96). The percentages of death and secondary infections were compared between patients treated with tocilizumab (n = 55) and those who were not (n = 41). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More tocilizumab-treated patients required mechanical ventilation (44/55, 80%) compared to non-treated patients (15/41, 37%; P < 0.001). Of 55 patients treated with tocilizumab, 32 (58%) were on mechanical ventilation at the time of administration, and 12 (22%) progressed to mechanical ventilation after treatment. Of patients treated with tocilizumab requiring mechanical ventilation, 30/44 (68%) were intubated within 1 day of administration. Fewer deaths were observed among tocilizumab-treated patients, both in the overall population (15% vs 37%; P = 0.02) and among the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (14% vs 60%; P = 0.001). Secondary infections were not different between the 2 groups (tocilizumab: 31%, non-tocilizumab: 17%; P = 0.16) and were predominantly related to invasive devices, such as urinary and central venous catheters. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab treatment was associated with fewer deaths compared to non-treatment despite predominantly being used in patients with more advanced respiratory disease.","Huang, Edmund; Isonaka, Sharon; Yang, Haoshu; Salce, Erin; Rosales, Elisa; Jordan, Stanley C",Int J Infect Dis,511,21

The results have shown that, in neutral state, the enol form is strongly dominating in both gas phase and solution. The carboxamide group is easily protonated in the presence of acid, which leads to shift of the tautomeric equilibrium toward the keto tautomer.

Lower prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children, in addition to higher numbers of mild and asymptomatic cases, continues to provide challenges in determining appropriate prevention and treatment courses. Here, we summarize the current evidence on the transmission, clinical presentation, complications and risk factors in regard to SARS-CoV-2 in children, and highlight crucial gaps in knowledge going forward. Based on current evidence, children are rarely the primary source of secondary transmission in the household or in child care and school settings and are more likely to contract the virus from an adult household member. Higher transmission rates are observed in older children (10-19 years old) compared with younger children ( <10 years old). While increasing incidence of COVID-19 in neonates raises the suspicion of vertical transmission, it is unlikely that breast milk is a vehicle for transmission from mother to infant. The vast majority of clinical cases of COVID-19 in children are mild, but there are rare cases that have developed complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which often presents with severe cardiac symptoms requiring intensive care.

Covid-19 appeared as a very dangerous virus and unfortunately caused a worldwide pandemic disease. Radiology doctors use X-ray or CT images for the diagnosis of Covid-19. It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus was proposed. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN), and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV), 10-fold cross-validation, and holdout validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation. This result clearly has shown that the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as an entry route, associated with the transmembrane serine protease protein (TMPRSS2), which makes the testis and particularly spermatogenesis potentially vulnerable, since this tissue has high expression of ACE2. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review by electronic bibliographic databases in Pubmed, Scopus and ScienceDirect up to August 2020 about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on male sexual function and its transmission, to assess possible repercussions on sex organs and the existence of a sexual transmission path. RESULTS: Although SARS-CoV-2 presence has not been found in testicle samples, it has been demonstrated that it causes histological changes compatible with orchitis, and sex hormone disturbances. TMPRSS2 is up-regulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression, thus these patients may have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. No viral material has been found in blood or semen, however it has been proven to be present in stool and saliva. CONCLUSION: The male reproductive system would be highly vulnerable and susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 given the expression of the ACE2 receptor in somatic and germ cells. The seminal fluid would remain free of viral presence in patients with COVID-19. Regardless, non-genital sex could be an important source of viral transmission. In assisted reproduction techniques all necessary tests must be carried out to ensure the donor is free of the virus at the time of collection and handling of the seminal sample.","Rodriguez Bustos, Héctor; Bravo Maturana, Gonzalo; Cortés-Chau, Felipe; Defaur Torres, Joelle; Cortés-Pino, Felipe; Aguirre, Pablo; Arriaza Onel, Camilo",Arch Ital Urol Androl,511,22

One is that of transforming our links with nature and, particularly, wildlife given the likely COVID-19 origin from illegal wildlife trading. Similar to vector borne diseases (VBD, diseases transmitted by vectors), the COVID-19 pandemic follows related patterns (e.g. no effective or available vaccines, difficult to diagnose, highly localized infection geographical foci, non-human reservoirs) for which we urgently need preventive measures. Towards this aim, governments worldwide must strive to prevent further devastation of natural environments that serve as buffer areas to humans against zoonotic agents (among other health risks), protecting biodiversity and its concomitant causes (e.g. global change), and banning use of wildlife of illegal origin. We herein state that some VBD prevention strategies could also be applied to zoonotic disease prevention, including COVID-19 or any type likely to be related to environmental conditions. The occurrence of future pandemic occurrence will depend on whether governments embrace these aims now.","Córdoba-Aguilar, Alex; Ibarra-Cerdeña, Carlos N; Castro-Arellano, Iván; Suzan, Gerardo",Acta Trop,511,24

This systematic review compares mortality risk factors including clinical, demographic and laboratory features of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The aim is to provide new strategies for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. METHODS: We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using five databases to compare the predictors of death for COVID-19, SARS and MERS. A random-effects model meta-analysis calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: 845 articles up through 11/4/2020 were retrieved, but only 28 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that males had a higher likelihood of death than females (ORâ¯=â¯1.82, 95% CI 1.56-2.13). Age (ORâ¯=â¯7.86, 95% CI 5.46-11.29), diabetes comorbidity (ORâ¯=â¯3.73, 95% CI 2.35-5.90), chronic lung disease (ORâ¯=â¯3.43, 95% CI 1.80-6.52) and hypertension (ORâ¯=â¯3.38, 95% CI 2.45-4.67) were the mortality risk factors. The laboratory indicators lactic dehydrogenase (ORâ¯=â¯37.52, 95% CI 24.68-57.03), C-reactive protein (ORâ¯=â¯12.11, 95% CI 5.24-27.98), and neutrophils (ORâ¯=â¯17.56, 95% CI 10.67-28.90) had stronger correlations with COVID-19 mortality than with SARS or MERS mortality. Consolidation and ground-glass opacity imaging features were similar among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19's mortality factors are similar to those of SARS and MERS.

METHODS: Between March and June 2020, all appointments at the practice of a single Andrology-focused academic urologist were conducted by telephone. Consecutive patients were contacted by telephone following their appointment to complete a telephone questionnaire. Baseline demographic information was obtained, and perceptions regarding telephone appointments were assessed using a Likert scale. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients completed the telephone questionnaire. Median age was 48.5 years (interquartile range 37.3-62.8 years) with 55 of 96 (57.3%) of the appointments Andrology-focused. Mean distance of residence from the hospital was 8.4 km (interquartile range 4.7-25.2 km). Only 9 of 96 (9.3%) of the patients felt that the telephone format did not adequately address their needs. However, 26 of 96 (27.1%) of patients said they would prefer an in-person appointment. On multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, presenting complaint, type of appointment, education level, and employment status, no factors were associated with feeling that the telephone appointment adequately addressed needs or preference for an in-person appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: Patients were generally satisfied with telephone appointments as an alternative to in-person appointments during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Nonetheless, a substantial portion of patients said they would prefer in-person appointments in the future.","Shiff, Benjamin; Frankel, Jed; Oake, Justin; Blachman-Braun, Ruben; Patel, Premal",Urology,511,16

In this work, a novel self-organizing model describing diffusion over a lattice is introduced. Simulation results for the model's active lattice sites demonstrate an evolution curve that is very close to those describing the evolution of infected European populations by COVID-19. The model was further examined against real data regarding the COVID-19 epidemic for seven European countries (with a total population of 290 million) during the periods in which social distancing measures were imposed, namely Italy and Spain, which had an enormous spread of the disease; the successful case of Greece; and four central European countries: France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. The value of the proposed model lies in its simplicity and in the fact that it is based on a universal natural mechanism, which through the presentation of an equivalent dynamical system apparently documents and provides a better understanding of the dynamical process behind viral epidemic spreads in general-even pandemics, such as in the case of COVID-19-further allowing us to come closer to controlling such situations. Finally, this model allowed the study of dynamical characteristics such as the memory effect, through the autocorrelation function, in the studied epidemiological dynamical systems.","Contoyiannis, Yiannis; Stavrinides, Stavros G; P Hanias, Michael; Kampitakis, Myron; Papadopoulos, Pericles; Picos, Rodrigo; M Potirakis, Stelios",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),511,24

Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of anosmia. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of nasal betamethasone drops in the recovery of olfaction in COVID-19-associated anosmia. METHODS: The study was designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. In total, 276 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were presented to the outpatient clinic with anosmia were enrolled in the study. In the betamethasone group, 138 participants received nasal drops of betamethasone 3 times daily until recovery for a maximum of one month. Similar dose of 9% NaCl drops was administered to 138 participants in the placebo group. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR 23-37). Among them, 198 (71.7%) were females. Ageusia was co-presented with anosmia in 234 (84.8%) of participants. In this study, 83% of participants had recovered from anosmia within 30 days, with a median recovery time of 13 days (IQR 8-18). Compared to placebo, nasal application of betamethasone drops has no significant effect on the recovery time of anosmia (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI 0.68-1.14; P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The use of nasal betamethasone to facilitate the recovery time of acute anosmia is not advised. In addition, age, smoking status, the duration of anosmia at presentation, and the co-presentation of ageusia with anosmia are important determinant covariates for the recovery time of anosmia. Further clinical trials, which take these covariates into account, will need to be undertaken.

Prior to the development of specific drug therapies or a vaccine, more immediately available treatments were sought including convalescent plasma. A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product. Normalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay activity (per mg/ml IgG) was maintained throughout the process. Protein content in these final product batches was 100% IgG, consisting of 98% monomer and dimer forms. Potentially hazardous proteins (IgM, IgA, and anti-A, anti-B, and anti-D) were reduced to minimal levels. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple batches of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hIVIG that met regulatory requirements were manufactured from human convalescent plasma. The first clinical study in which the hIVIG will be evaluated will be Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin (ITAC) [NCT04546581].","Vandeberg, Peter; Cruz, Maria; Diez, Jose Maria; Merritt, W Keither; Santos, Benjamin; Trukawinski, Susan; Wellhouse, Andrea; Jose, Marta; Willis, Todd",Transfusion,511,24

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","Bambra, Clare; Albani, Viviana; Franklin, Paula",Scand J Public Health,511,17

Members of communities such as hacker- and makerspaces employed their skills and tools to manufacture, for example, face shields and masks. The article discusses these civic innovation practices and their broader social implications by relating them to critical making theory. Methodologically, it is based on a digital ethnography approach, focusing on hacker and maker communities in the UK. Communities' DIY initiatives display characteristics of critical making and 'craftivism', as they assessed and counteracted politicised healthcare supply shortages. It is argued that their manufacturing activities during the COVID pandemic relate to UK austerity politics' effects on healthcare and government failure to ensure medical crisis supplies. Facilitated by open source design, communities' innovation enabled healthcare emergency equipment. At the same time, their DIY manufacturing raises practical as well as ethical issues concerning, among other things, efficacy and safety of use.","Richterich, Annika",Health Sociol Rev,511,13

There is a dire need for novel effective antivirals to treat COVID-19, as the only approved direct-acting antiviral to date is remdesivir, targeting the viral polymerase complex. A potential alternate target in the viral life cycle is the main SARS-CoV-2 protease 3CLpro (Mpro). The drug candidate PF-00835231 is the active compound of the first anti-3CLpro regimen in clinical trials. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of PF-00835231, the pre-clinical 3CLpro inhibitor GC-376, and the polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, in alveolar basal epithelial cells modified to express ACE2 (A549+ACE2 cells). We find PF-00835231 with at least similar or higher potency than remdesivir or GC-376. A time-of-drug-addition approach delineates the timing of early SARS-CoV-2 life cycle steps in A549+ACE2 cells and validates PF-00835231's early time of action. In a model of the human polarized airway epithelium, both PF-00835231 and remdesivir potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations. Finally, we show that the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, which was previously suggested to diminish PF-00835231's efficacy based on experiments in monkey kidney Vero E6 cells, does not negatively impact PF-00835231 efficacy in either A549+ACE2 cells or human polarized airway epithelial cultures. Thus, our study provides in vitro evidence for the potential of PF-00835231 as an effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and addresses concerns that emerged based on prior studies in non-human in vitro models.Importance:The arsenal of SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral drugs is extremely limited. Only one direct-acting antiviral drug is currently approved, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, and it has limited efficacy. Thus, there is a substantial need to develop additional antiviral compounds with minimal side effects and alternate viral targets. One such alternate target is its main protease, 3CLpro (Mpro), an essential component of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle processing the viral polyprotein into the components of the viral polymerase complex. In this study, we characterize a novel antiviral drug, PF-00835231, which is the active component of the first-in-class 3CLpro-targeting regimen in clinical trials. Using 3D in vitro models of the human airway epithelium, we demonstrate the antiviral potential of PF-00835231 for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","de Vries, Maren; Mohamed, Adil S; Prescott, Rachel A; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Desvignes, Ludovic; O039,; Connor, Rebecca; Steppan, Claire; Devlin, Joseph C; Ivanova, Ellie; Herrera, Alberto; Schinlever, Austin; Loose, Paige; Ruggles, Kelly; Koralov, Sergei B; Anderson, Annaliesa S; Binder, Joseph; Dittmann, Meike",J. virol,511,26

First of all, given the immunosuppressive effect of many therapies that are normally administered to patients with hematological diseases, with a consequent increased risk of contracting a more severe viral infection, it has been necessary to reconsider in each individual patient the urgency and priority of the treatments foreseen by the normal standards of care. In particular, as regards allogeneic (and to a lesser extent autologous) hematopoietic cell transplantation and CAR T-cell therapy, specific recommendations have been issued by the transplant community on the criteria to be used to decide whether or not to postpone these procedures and on the clinical management of recipients and donors exposed to COVID-19. As to cytotoxic chemotherapy and other antineoplastic therapies, criteria have been proposed to decide, in the various clinical situations, which treatments were not deferrable and which instead could be postponed or replaced by less aggressive therapies. In the outpatient clinics, various organizational solutions for telemedicine have been adopted, resorting to telephone interviews and/or Information Technology, with the aim of reducing the influx of patients while maintaining an adequate control of their clinical condition.

As much as 57% of physicians have disclosed that they practice defensive medicine. However, this practice does not necessarily prevent malpractice claims and more importantly, neither does it equate to good medical practice, with some leading to poor outcomes. Unfortunately, there is a high percentage of malpractice claims lodged against clinicians in both primary care and hospital settings. Specialists such as surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists face the highest claims. In particular, during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, with new challenges and limited treatment algorithms, there is an even greater concern for possible bourgeoning claims. Counteracting defensive medicine can be accomplished through decriminalizing malpractice claims, leaving physician oversight up to state medical boards and hospital claims management committees. Additional tort reform measures must also be taken such as caps on noneconomic damages to ensure emphasis on beneficence and nonmaleficence. Once these are in place, it may well serve to increase clinician-patient trust and improve patient independence in the shared decision-making process of their treatment, allowing clinicians to practice their full scope of practice without feeling wary of potential malpractice claims.","Williams, Preston L; Williams, Joanna P; Williams, Bryce R",J Forensic Leg Med,511,1

Yet, up to 80% of patients are managed in an outpatient setting. This population is poorly documented. In France, health authorities recommend outpatient management of patients presenting mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The aim of this study was to describe their clinical characteristics. The study took place in an emergency medical dispatching center located in the Greater Paris region. Patients included in this survey met confirmed COVID-19 infection criteria according to the WHO definition. We investigated clinical features and classified symptoms as general, digestive, ear-nose-throat, thoracic symptoms, and eye disease. Patients were included between March 24 and April 6 2020. 1487 patients included: 700 (47%) males and 752 (51%) females, with a median age of 44 (32-57) years. In addition to dry cough and fever reported in more than 90% of cases, the most common symptoms were general symptoms: body aches/myalgia (N = 845; 57%), headache (N = 824; 55%), and asthenia (N = 886; 60%); shortness of breath (N = 479; 32%) and ear-nose-throat symptoms such as anosmia (N = 415; 28%) and ageusia (N = 422; 28%). Chest pain was reported in 320 (21%) cases and hemoptysis in 41 (3%) cases. The main difference between male and female patients was an increased prevalence of ear-nose-throat symptoms as well as diarrhea, chest pains, and headaches in female patients. General symptoms and ear-nose-throat symptoms were predominant in COVID-19 patients presenting mild-to-moderate symptoms. Shortness of breath and chest pain were remarkably frequent.","Lapostolle, Frédéric; Schneider, Elodie; Vianu, Isabelle; Dollet, Guillaume; Roche, Bastien; Berdah, Julia; Michel, Julie; Goix, Laurent; Chanzy, Erick; Petrovic, Tomislav; Adnet, Frédéric",Intern Emerg Med,511,24

Its efficient transmission and range of disease severity raise questions regarding the contributions of virus-receptor interactions. ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous reports describe ACE2 mRNA abundance and tissue distribution; however, mRNA abundance is not always representative of protein levels. Currently, there is limited data evaluating ACE2 protein and its correlation with other SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically examined the human upper and lower respiratory tract using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry to determine receptor expression and evaluated its association with risk factors for severe COVID-19. FINDINGS: Our results reveal that ACE2 protein is highest within regions of the sinonasal cavity and pulmonary alveoli, sites of presumptive viral transmission and severe disease development, respectively. In the lung parenchyma, ACE2 protein was found on the apical surface of a small subset of alveolar type II cells and colocalized with TMPRSS2, a cofactor for SARS-CoV2 entry. ACE2 protein was not increased by pulmonary risk factors for severe COVID-19. Additionally, ACE2 protein was not reduced in children, a demographic with a lower incidence of severe COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: These results offer new insights into ACE2 protein localization in the human respiratory tract and its relationship with susceptibility factors to COVID-19.","Ortiz, Miguel E; Thurman, Andrew; Pezzulo, Alejandro A; Leidinger, Mariah R; Klesney-Tait, Julia A; Karp, Philip H; Tan, Ping; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; McCray, Paul B; Meyerholz, David K",EBioMedicine,511,29

In the setting of anticipated resource constraints and widespread community infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, measures for balancing both infectious and oncologic risk among patients and providers must be carefully considered. Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. Methods: Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. Results: Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. Conclusion: In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes. The judicious and personalized use of immature study data may be warranted in the setting of a competing mortality risk from this widespread pandemic.","Braunstein, Lior Z; Gillespie, Erin F; Hong, Linda; Xu, Amy; Bakhoum, Samuel F; Cuaron, John; Mueller, Boris; McCormick, Beryl; Cahlon, Oren; Powell, Simon; Khan, Atif J",,511,16

However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-&#960;, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-&#960; > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","Sepay, Nayim; Saha, Pranab Chandra; Shahzadi, Zarrin; Chakraborty, Aratrika; Halder, Umesh Chandra",Phys Chem Chem Phys,511,6

The role of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) became of central importance. At the Robert Koch Institute, a multilayer strategy consisting of population-based and individual preventive measures to control the pandemic was developed, which built upon existing influenza pandemic plans as well as generic plans. This paper explains the recommended NPIs and illustrates the pharmaceutical approaches developed in parallel.Among others, general contact bans, providing material for infection prevention and control, ban of events, closing educational institutions, and restricting travel are counted among population-based measures. Additional individual preventive measures are necessary, e.g., keeping a minimum distance, reducing contacts, and wearing a mouth-nose covering as well as quarantine and isolation. Measures within the health system are based on recommendations of the Commission on Hospital Hygiene and Infection Protection (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention (KRINKO)) and specified and implemented by professional societies. Since November 2020, an antiviral therapy with remdesivir and treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone have been available as pharmaceutical interventions. Monoclonal antibodies are at this time not approved. Therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended.Recommendations are constantly adapted to the increasing knowledge on the pathogen and its means of transmission.

We estimated how individual changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic translated into changes in: (i) mean consumption;(ii) dispersion of consumption distribution;and (iii) prevalence of heavy drinkers. We employed data from two independent web-surveys of Norwegian adults collected between April and July 2020 and limited to those reporting past year alcohol consumption (N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 15,267, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1195). Self-reports of changes in drinking behavior were quantified, assuming change being relative to baseline consumption level. During the pandemic, we found a small increase (Survey 1) or no change (Survey 2) in estimated mean alcohol consumption (which parallels to total consumption). However, in both surveys, the dispersion of the distribution increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001). For most respondents, an average modest decline in consumption was found. However, the small fraction with the highest baseline consumption increased their consumption substantially, and in effect, the proportion of heavy drinkers increased markedly (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, quantifications of reported changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic suggest that the upper 5 to 10% of the drinkers increased their consumption and hence the prevalence of heavy drinkers increased, despite little or no change in total alcohol consumption.","Rossow, I.; Bye, E.

These disparities are in large measure the result of longstanding patterns of structural, interpersonal, and cultural racism in US society, which in aggregate represent an underpinning of systemic racism that permeates the long-term care system's organization, administration, regulations, and human services. Mechanisms underlying the role of systemic racism in producing the observed disparities are numerous. Long-term care is fundamentally tied to geography, thereby reflecting disparities associated with residential segregation. Additional foundational drivers include a fragmented payment system that advantages persons with financial resources, and reimbursement policies that systematically undervalue long-term care workers. Eliminating disparities in health outcomes in these settings will therefore require a comprehensive approach to eliminating the role of systemic racism in promoting racial disparities.","Sloane, Philip D; Yearby, Ruqaiijah; Konetzka, R Tamara; Li, Yue; Espinoza, Robert; Zimmerman, Sheryl",J Am Med Dir Assoc,511,16

The Italian authorities have implemented multiple control strategies, such as basic social-distancing measures, early measures (including closing the mall and school), and even nationwide lockdown. Herein, a novel model, named as S2E2IHRD, is presented to reveal the course of epidemic in Italy, where eight groups of the population are considered: S, susceptible cases (unquarantined);Sq, susceptible cases (quarantined);E, exposed cases (infected, undetected);Eq1, exposed cases (infected, quarantined);I, infected cases (confirmed, undetected);H, hospitalized cases;R, recovered cases;D, dead cases. Our model distinguishes the infections based on whether they are quarantined or hospitalized. The essential distinction between quarantined/hospitalized and unquarantined/non-hospitalized cases is that the former are typically isolated who appear to unlikely spread the infection. The implementation of countermeasures has been explained in the model, the short-Term simulation results have demonstrated the accuracy of our model by comparing with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy.

Understanding healthcare providers' (HCPs') knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 is crucial to identifying effective strategies to improve their ability to respond to the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. A phone-based survey of 900 HCPs in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria (300 per country) was conducted to assess knowledge, perceptions, COVID-19 prevention measures, stigma, and mental health of HCPs. Modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate predictors of knowledge, perceptions, and prevention measures; adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Three-fourths of the HCPs had adequate knowledge, and over half had correct perceptions of risk and high levels of self-reported prevention measures. The majority of the HCPs (73.7%) reported self-perceived social stigma. There was relatively low prevalence of depression (6.6%), anxiety (6.6%), or psychological distress (18%). Compared with doctors, being a nurse was associated with lower levels of knowledge (ARR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77-0.90) and was also negatively associated with having correct perceptions toward COVID-19 (AOR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.92).

METHODS: Using data (n = 495; mean age 62.9 years (SD 18.6), 50.5% female) from a prospective cohort study of patients discharged from medical wards at two university hospitals, the prognostic ability of EQ-5D-3L was examined using C-statistic, Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) Index, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The associations between EQ-5D-3L dimensions, total sum, index and VAS scores at the time of discharge and 30-day post-discharge ED visits, readmission, and readmission/death were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: At the time of discharge, 58.6% of participants reported problems in mobility, 28.3% in self-care, 62.1% in usual activities, 62.7% in pain/discomfort, and 42.4% in anxiety/depression. Mean (SD) total sum score was 7.9 (2.0), index score was 0.69 (0.21), and VAS score was 63.7 (18.4). In adjusted analyses, mobility, self-care, usual activities, and the total sum score were significantly associated with 30-day readmission and readmission/death. Differences in C-statistic for LACE readmission prediction models with and without EQ-5D-3L were small. AIC analysis suggests that readmission prediction models containing EQ-5D-3L dimensions or scores were more often preferred to those with the LACE index only. IDI analysis indicates that the discrimination slope of readmission prediction models is significantly improved with the addition of mobility, self-care, or the total sum score of the EQ-5D-3L. CONCLUSION: The EQ-5D-3L, especially the mobility and self-care dimensions as well as the total sum score, improves 30-day readmission prediction of the LACE index and is associated with 30-day readmissions or readmissions/death.","Al Sayah, Fatima; McAlister, Finlay A; Ohinmaa, Arto; Majumdar, Sumit R; Johnson, Jeffrey A",Qual. life res,511,26

However, these instruments are not specifically designed for facial signs. OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a specific questionnaire to assess the burden on patients with facial signs of systemic sclerosis and which we have named ""Burden of Face Affected"" (BoFA). METHODS: BoFA was developed using standard methodology in 3 phases: exploration, development and validation. In all, 197 patients completed questionnaires. We analysed the degree of internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945;) and external validity between BoFA and the 12-Item Short Form Healthy Survey (SF-12), the Mouth Handicap In Systemic Sclerosis Scale (MHISS), Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). To assess reproducibility, a test-retest analysis was conducted. The original French version was translated into English and underwent cultural validation. RESULTS: The questionnaire comprises 20 items grouped into 4 dimensions. BoFA showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945;: 0.93). External validity was demonstrated in terms of good correlation between BoFA and other questionnaires, in particular MHISS (r=0.54). The test-retest analysis demonstrated good reproducibility (0.92). The BoFA score varied significantly according to the severity of facial scleroderma as assessed by the patients themselves. DISCUSSION: Facial involvement in systemic sclerosis may be considered by physicians to be a minor consequence of the disease and is often overlooked. Nevertheless, it is crucial for patients' quality of life. A number of studies have assessed the impact of facial signs on health-related quality of life using instruments such as DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), SWAP (Satisfaction With Appearance Scale), Brief SWAP and SSPRO (Scleroderma Skin Patient-Reported Outcome). However, these are not specific for facial signs and focus on other sites. BoFA has good reliability and construct validity, and it assesses disability specifically involving the face in patients with systemic sclerosis. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, BoFA is the first specific tool for assessing burden in patients with facial scleroderma. It is an easy-to-use tool for evaluating the burden of facial signs and may also be used to assess the degree of burden before and after treatment.","Doutre, M-S; Godard, D; Benani, M; Taieb, C",Ann. dermatol. venereol,511,26

Standard algorithms for this problem assume independent (factorized) evolution of the characters of the sequences, which is generally wrong (e.g. proteins and genome sequences). In this work, we have studied this problem for sequences described by global co-evolutionary models, which reproduce the global pattern of cooperative interactions between the elements that compose it. For this, we first modeled the temporal evolution of correlated real valued characters by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a finite tree. This represents sequences as Gaussian vectors evolving in a quadratic potential, who describe selection forces acting on the evolving entities. Under a Bayesian framework, we developed a reconstruction algorithm for these sequences and obtained an analytical expression to quantify the quality of our estimation. We extend this formalism to discrete valued sequences by applying our method to a Potts model. We showed that for both continuous and discrete configurations, there is a wide range of parameters where, to properly reconstruct the ancestral sequences, intra-species correlations must be taken into account. We also demonstrated that, for sequences with discrete elements, our reconstruction algorithm outperforms traditional schemes based on independent site approximations.","Horta, Edwin Rodr'iguez; Lage-Castellanos, Alejandro; Mulet, Roberto",,511,33

As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students' willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.89, p = 0.002)-when compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10-2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students' willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for own's health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","Lazarus, Gilbert; Findyartini, Ardi; Putera, Azis Muhammad; Gamalliel, Nico; Nugraha, David; Adli, Imam; Phowira, Jason; Azzahra, Lyanna; Ariffandi, Bagas; Widyahening, Indah Suci",BMC Med Educ,511,33

Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; has been demonstrated.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether wearable activity trackers could provide information regarding users' adherence to home confinement policies because of their capacity for seamless and continuous monitoring of individuals' natural activity patterns regardless of their location. METHODS: We analyzed big data from individuals using activity trackers (Withings) that count the wearer's average daily number of steps in a number of representative nations that adopted different modalities of restriction of citizens' activities. RESULTS: Data on the number of steps per day from over 740,000 individuals around the world were analyzed. We demonstrate the physical activity patterns in several representative countries with total, partial, or no home confinement. The decrease in steps per day in regions with strict total home confinement ranged from 25% to 54%. Partial lockdown (characterized by social distancing measures such as school closures, bar and restaurant closures, and cancellation of public meetings but without strict home confinement) does not appear to have a significant impact on people's activity compared to the pre-pandemic period. The absolute level of physical activity under total home confinement in European countries is around twofold that in China. In some countries, such as France and Spain, physical activity started to gradually decrease even before official commitment to lockdown as a result of initial less stringent restriction orders or self-quarantine. However, physical activity began to increase again in the last 2 weeks, suggesting a decrease in compliance with confinement orders. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate analysis of activity tracker data with the potential for daily updates can provide information regarding adherence to home confinement policies.","Pépin, Jean Louis; Bruno, Rosa Maria; Yang, Rui-Yi; Vercamer, Vincent; Jouhaud, Paul; Escourrou, Pierre; Boutouyrie, Pierre",J Med Internet Res,511,20

With the increase of global migration, quantifying the health needs and key correlates of these outcomes is a global health priority. This study assessed migration characteristics, COVID-19 attitudes and the postmigration social environment as key correlates of depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse among international migrants in China. DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 17 February and 1 March 2020. SETTING: Links to the online survey were disseminated by migrant-focused community-based organisations through WeChat. PARTICIPANTS: English speaking international migrants who met the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were being born in a country outside of China, aged 18 years or over, cumulatively living in China for 1 month or more and staying in China between December 2019 and February 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, quality of life and alcohol misuse. RESULTS: Regression models indicated that planning or considering leaving China due to COVID-19, lacking the confidence to protect themselves and not being confident that the epidemic would end soon was associated with greater depression, lower quality of life and greater levels of alcohol misuse. Worry about contracting COVID-19 and feeling helpless to prevent infection were associated with greater depression and lower quality of life. General perceived social support, and trust in Chinese people, institutions and systems were protective factors for depression and associated with higher reported quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies key correlates that, if adequately addressed through public health outreach, may safeguard migrant well-being during a public health emergency. Trust in people and systems within the postmigration environment is an important consideration for future public health planning efforts.","Hall, Brian J; Zhao, Peizhen; Xiong, Ming Zhou; Latkin, Carl; Yang, Bin; Wang, Cheng",BMJ Open,511,21

In a given month between March through November of 2020, the odds of Black Americans reporting such symptoms was on average about half that of Non-Black Americans. We also found that in September 2020, the gap in reporting symptoms for depression began to widen gradually. Specifically, since that time, prevalence of depression remained stable among non-Black Americans while it declined gradually among Black Americans. Our main results were robust to adjusting for demographics, risk perceptions, and baseline pre-pandemic mental health status. CONCLUSIONS: Black Americans maintained significantly better mental health than Non-Black Americans despite their struggle against economic, health, and racial inequalities during the pandemic. We discuss the significance and implications of our results and identify opportunities for future research.","Owens, Victoria; Saw, Htay-Wah",PLoS One,511,31

However, mimicking platelets for in vivo artificial coagulation is still a great challenge due to the complexity of the process. Here, we design platelet-like nanoparticles (pNPs) based on self-assembled peptides that initiate coagulation and form clots in blood vessels. The pNPs first bind specifically to a membrane glycoprotein (i.e., CD105) overexpressed on angiogenetic endothelial cells in the tumor site and simultaneously transform into activated platelet-like nanofibers (apNFs) through ligand-receptor interactions. Next, the apNFs expose more binding sites and recruit and activate additional pNPs, forming artificial clots in both phantom and animal models. The pNPs are proven to be safe in mice without systemic coagulation. The self-assembling peptides mimic platelets and achieve artificial coagulation in vivo, thus providing a promising therapeutic strategy for tumors.","Yang, Pei-Pei; Zhang, Kuo; He, Ping-Ping; Fan, Yu; Gao, Xuejiao J; Gao, Xingfa; Chen, Zi-Ming; Hou, Da-Yong; Li, Yuan; Yi, Yu; Cheng, Dong-Bing; Zhang, Jing-Ping; Shi, Linqi; Zhang, Xian-Zheng; Wang, Lei; Wang, Hao",Sci.

Triage criteria should be objective, ethical, transparent, applied equitably and publically disclosed. The aim of this review is to describe the triage tools and process for critical care resources in a pandemic health emergency. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted of the literature on five electronic databases, namely PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase, searching for studies published from 2006 to June 2020. RESULTS: The results describe different triage tools. A gold standard of triage does not exist for the adult or paediatric population. Using probability of short-term survival as the sole allocation principle is problematic. In general, each triage protocol should be applied with a specific ethical justification, including transparency, duty to care, duty to steward resources, duty to plan, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical triage decisions based on clinical judgment alone are prone to inconsistent application by triage officers in a pandemic. An ethical framework can inform decision-making and improve accountability. It remains difficult to connect clinical criteria and ethical criteria, because of the models on offer for health services.","Iacorossi, Laura; Fauci, Alice J; Napoletano, Antonello; D039,; Angelo, Daniela; Salomone, Katia; Latina, Roberto; Coclite, Daniela; Iannone, Primiano",Acta Biomed,511,1

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine center for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Thanh Lam, Vo; Thanh Dung, Nguyen; Yen, Lam Minh; Minh, Ngo Ngoc Quang; Hung, Le Manh; Ngoc, Nghiem My; Dung, Nguyen Tri; Man, Dinh Nguyen Huy; Nguyet, Lam Anh; Nhat, Le Thanh Hoang; Nhu, Le Nguyen Truc; Ny, Nguyen Thi Han; Hong, Nguyen Thi Thu; Kestelyn, Evelyne; Dung, Nguyen Thi Phuong; Xuan, Tran Chanh; Hien, Tran Tinh; Thanh Phong, Nguyen; Tu, Tran Nguyen Hoang; Geskus, Ronald B; Thanh, Tran Tan; Thanh Truong, Nguyen; Binh, Nguyen Tan; Thuong, Tang Chi; Thwaites, Guy; Tan, Le Van",Clin. infect. dis,511,29

Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. A total of 764 patients admitted to 14 different hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic from 03/09/2020 to 05/20/2020 who had reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction proven coronavirus infection were included. We used LightGBM, a machine learning algorithm, to predict in-hospital mortality at different time points (after 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days of hospitalization) and in-hospital LOS. Results: Among 764 patients, 116 (15%) either died (n = 87) or were transitioned to hospice care (n = 29) during their hospitalization. The median LOS was 5 days (range 1 - 44 days) for patients admitted to the regular nursing floor and 10 days (range 1-38 days) for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients who died during hospitalization were older, initially admitted to the ICU, more likely to be white and to have worse organ dysfunction compared to patients who survived their hospitalization. Using the 10 most important variables only, the final model's area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve was 0.86 for 7-day, 0.88 for 14-day, and 0.85 for 30-day mortality in the validation cohort. Conclusions: We developed a decision tool that can provide explainable and patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality and LOS for COVID-19 positive patients.

Vaccine trials are already underway, but there remains an urgent need to find other therapeutic approaches to either target SARS-CoV-2 or the complications arising from viral infection, particularly the dysregulated immune response and systemic complications which have been associated with progression to severe COVID-19. At the time of writing, in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described using macaques, cats, ferrets, hamsters, and transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). These infection models have already been useful for studies of transmission and immunity, but to date only partly model the mechanisms involved in human severe COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need for development of animal models for improved evaluation of efficacy of drugs identified as having potential in the treatment of severe COVID-19. These models need to reproduce the key mechanisms of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and the immunopathology and systemic sequelae associated with this disease. Here, we review the current models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related disease mechanisms and suggest ways in which animal models can be adapted to increase their usefulness in research into COVID-19 pathogenesis and for assessing potential treatments.

Whether excess mortality has occurred during the Delta wave is less well understood. MethodsWe performed an observational study using data from the Massachusetts Department of Health. Five years of US Census population data and CDC mortality statistics were applied to a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) model to project the number of expected deaths for each week of the pandemic period, including the Delta period (starting in June 2021, extending through August 28th 2021, for which mortality data are >99% complete). Weekly Covid-19 cases, Covid-19-attributed deaths, and all-cause deaths are reported. County-level excess mortality during the vaccine campaign are also reported, with weekly rates of vaccination in each county that reported 100 or more all-cause deaths during any week included in the study period. ResultsAll-cause mortality was not observed after March 2021, by which time over 75% of persons over 65 years of age in Massachusetts had received a vaccination. Fewer deaths than expected (which we term deficit mortality) occurred both during the summer of 2020, the spring of 2021 and during the Delta wave (beginning June 13, 2021 when Delta isolates represented >10% of sequenced cases). After the initial wave in the spring of 2020, more Covid-19-attributed deaths were recorded that all-cause excess deaths, implying that Covid-19 was misattributed as the underlying cause, rather than a contributing cause of death in some cases. ConclusionIn a state with high vaccination rates, excess mortality has not been recorded during the Delta period. Deficit mortality has been recorded during this period.","Faust, Jeremy S; Du, Chengan; Mayes, Katherine Dickerson; Renton, Benjamin; Li, Shu-Xia; Lin, Zhenqiu; Krumholz, Harlan",,511,22

In this study, we describe and compare two methods for predicting near-term SARS-CoV-2 incidence in West Virginia counties. The first method, Rt Only, is solely based on producing forecasts for each county using the daily instantaneous reproductive numbers, Rt. The second method, ML+ Rt, is a machine learning approach that uses a Long Short-Term Memory network to predict the near-term number of cases for each county using epidemiological statistics such as Rt, county population information, and time series trends including information on major holidays, as well as leveraging statewide COVID-19 trends across counties and county population size. Both approaches used daily county-level SARS-CoV-2 incidence data provided by the West Virginia Department Health and Human Resources beginning April 2020. The methods are compared on the accuracy of near-term SARS-CoV-2 increases predictions by county over 17 weeks from January 1, 2021-April 30, 2021.

Over the 17-week assessment period, the ML+Rt method outperforms the Rt Only method in identifying larger spikes. We also find that both methods perform adequately in both rural and non-rural predictions. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion on practical issues regarding implementing forecasting models for public health action based on Rt, and the potential for further development of machine learning methods that are enhanced by Rt.","Price, Bradley S; Khodaverdi, Maryam; Halasz, Adam; Hendricks, Brian; Kimble, Wesley; Smith, Gordon S; Hodder, Sally L",,511,16

Therefore, we aimed to compare the clinical, para-clinical and laboratory evidences of deceased patients with survival group. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 233 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Buali Hospital in Iran; clinical/para-clinical and inflammatory indexes data were collected and analyzed. The data of laboratory examinations and chest CT findings were compared between deceased and survived patients. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 49.8 years and 64% of our patients were male. The acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 64 patients, 52 who were admitted to the ICU, which all of them underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 28 who died. Lymphopenia (79%), neutrophilia (79%), and thrombocytopenia (21%) were the most frequently observed laboratory findings of the deceased group on admission. Most patients (68%) had a high systematic immune-inflammation (SII) index of > 500 and increased C-reactive protein level (88%). Levels of inflammatory indexes such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and SII were documented to be significantly elevated in the deceased group when compared with the patients who survived (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, P < 0.0001, respectively). The most commonly presented symptoms were fever (70%) and cough (63%) on admission. Headache was uncommon (11%). Ground-glass opacity with consolidation (mixed) was the most common radiologic finding on chest CT (51%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 15 of 204 patients (7%). CONCLUSION: Small fraction of patients with COVID-19 may present without fever and abnormal radiologic findings.

Since then researchers worldwide have been struggling to detect the possible pathogenesis of this disease. COVID-19 showed a wide range of clinical behavior from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome. However, the etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury is not yet fully understood. Angiotensin-converting enzyme1 (ACE1) convert angiotensin I into Angiotensin II that was further metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2). The binding ACE2 receptor to SARS-CoV-2 facilitate its enter into the host cell. The interaction and imbalance between ACE1 and ACE2 play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association of ACE1 I/D polymorphism with severity of Covid-19. The study included RT-PCR confirmed 269 cases of Covid-19. All cases were genotyped for ACE1 I/D polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction and followed by statistical analysis (SPSS, version 15.0). We found that ACE1 DD genotype, frequency of D allele, older age (&#8805;46 years), unmarried status, and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in severe COVID-19 patient.

The aim of the present study was to delineate the prevalence of thromboembolic events and the current status of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy in patients with COVID-19 in Japan. METHODS: Between February 1 and August 31, 2020, we performed a dual-center, retrospective cohort study based on data obtained from the medical charts of COVID-19 patients admitted to healthcare facilities in Japan. The primary outcome was any thromboembolic event including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and other systemic thromboemboli. RESULTS: During the study period, we extracted 628 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19. Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy was administered in 63 (10%) patients of whom 20 (31.7%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Thromboembolic events occurred in 18 (2.9%) patients (14.3% of patients in ICU and 2.2% of patients in the general wards). DVT were detected in 13 (2.1%) patients, PE in 11 (1.8%), and both DVT and PE in 6 (0.96%) patients. An increasing prevalence in thromboembolic events was noted with progressive clinical severity. Overall in-hospital mortality was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was administered in only 10% of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of any thromboembolic events was 2.9% in COVID-19 patients with most events occurring in severe and critical patients. Therefore, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may be warranted in severe and critical patients but in asymptomatic to moderate patients the practice remains controversial.","Fujiwara, Sho; Nakajima, Mikio; Kaszynski, Richard H; Fukushima, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Masaru; Yajima, Keishiro; Kobayashi, Taiichiro; Sekiya, Noritaka; Yamamoto, Yasuhiro; Miwa, Maki; Ishihata, Ayaka; Yamauchi, Yuko; Yamamoto, Kazuo; Goto, Hideaki; Imamura, Akifumi",J Infect Chemother,511,24

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale data sharing across the US and around the world has played an important role in public health responses to the pandemic and has been crucial to understanding and predicting its likely course. In California, hospitals have been required to report a large volume of daily data related to COVID-19. In order to meet this need, electronic health records (EHRs) have played an important role, but the challenges of reporting high-quality data in real-time from EHR data sources have not been explored. We describe some of the challenges of utilizing EHR data for this purpose from the perspective of a large, integrated, mixed-payer health system in northern California, US. We emphasize some of the inadequacies inherent to EHR data using several specific examples, and explore the clinical-analytic gap that forms the basis for some of these inadequacies. We highlight the need for data and analytics to be incorporated into the early stages of clinical crisis planning in order to utilize EHR data to full advantage. We further propose that lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic can result in the formation of collaborative teams joining clinical operations, informatics, data analytics, and research, ultimately resulting in improved data quality to support effective crisis response.","Sudat, Sylvia E K; Robinson, Sarah C; Mudiganti, Satish; Mani, Aravind; Pressman, Alice R",J Biomed Inform,511,16

Most epidemics with a rapid early rise die out before affecting a significant fraction of the population, whereas the early pace of some pandemics is rather modest. Recent models suggest that this could be due to the heterogeneity of the target population's susceptibility. We study a computer malware ecosystem exhibiting spread mechanisms resembling those of biological systems while offering details unavailable for human epidemics. Rather than comparing models, we directly estimate reach from a new and vastly more complete data from a parallel domain, that offers superior details and insight as concerns biological outbreaks. We find a highly heterogeneous distribution of computer susceptibilities, with nearly all outbreaks initially over-affecting the tail of the distribution, then collapsing quickly once this tail is depleted. This mechanism restricts the correlation between an epidemic's initial growth rate and its total reach, thus preventing the majority of epidemics, including initially fast-growing outbreaks, from reaching a macroscopic fraction of the population. The few pervasive malwares distinguish themselves early on via the following key trait: they avoid infecting the tail, while preferentially targeting computers unaffected by typical malware.","Muchnik, Lev; Yom-Tov, Elad; Levy, Nir; Rubin, Amir; Louzoun, Yoram",,511,24

However, acknowledging that public discourse around COVID-19 is multi-faceted and evolves over time poses both analytical and ontological challenges. Studies that use text-mining approaches to analyse responses to major events commonly treat public discourse on social media as an undifferentiated whole, without systematically examining the extent to which that discourse consists of distinct sub-discourses or which phases characterize its development. They also confound structured behavioural data (i.e., tagging) with unstructured user-generated data (i.e., content of tweets) in their sampling methods. The present study aims to demonstrate how one might go about addressing both of these sets of challenges by combining corpus linguistic methods with a data-driven text-mining approach to gain a better understanding of how the public discourse around COVID-19 developed over time and what topics combine to form this discourse in the Australian Twittersphere over a period of nearly four months. By combining text mining and corpus linguistics, this study exemplifies how both approaches can complement each other productively. © The Author(s) 2021.","Schweinberger, M.; Haugh, M.; Hames, S.",Big Data and Society,511,33

RESULTS: Due to public health policy and dental emergency management, the number of dental visitors to our clinic dropped sharply, and no COVID-19 suspected cases or high-risk patients received treatment. There have been no reports of infection of dental staff or patients during dental treatment in China to date. CONCLUSION: These public health policies and dental emergency management measures were effective in controlling cross-infection of COVID-19 in the dental clinic. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: We share control measures for COVID-19, and hope that they will be helpful for dental professionals worldwide to continue to provide dental care in a safe and orderly manner.","Wang, Chao; Miao, Li; Wang, Zhigang; Xiong, Yanjie; Jiao, Yang; Liu, Hongchen",Int. dent. j,511,1

In order to meet the growing demand in laboratories for RT-PCR testing for viral genome detection, rapid tests detecting a SARS-CoV-2 protein (antigenic rapid test) have been developed. In this review, we present for different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid tests authorized in France: legislation, technological principle, and analytical and clinical performances. Data bellow are those provided by the manufacturer/distributor. From the list of tests authorized by the French Ministry of Health, we have selected 25 for which the distributors/manufacturers have provided the technical data essential to their comparative analysis. The kits use immunochromatography technology, with detection of the nucleocapsid protein (n = 24) or the spike protein (n = 1). The matrix used is a nasopharyngeal (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 9) or nasal (n = 3) swab. According to the test, the reading of the result is done from 15 to 30 minutes after it is performed. The clinical sensitivity, for the more performant tests is conversely linked to the Ct of RT-PCR, ranging from 80.2% to 98.4%, according to the quantity of virus present in the sample. This percentage is inversely proportional to the Ct obtained using RT-PCR. The limit of detection ranges from 31.55 to 7200 TCID50/mL. The clinical specificity, compared to a negative result of RT-PCR, is between 99.2% and 100%. Analytical specificity evaluated on other microorganisms is 100%, except for 3 kits that show cross-reactivities with SARS-CoV-1 (n = 3) and MERS-CoV (n = 1). Positive and negative predictive values range from 96.3% to 100% and 95% to 99.4%, respectively.","Lim, Isabelle; Gautheret-Dejean, Agnès",Ann Biol Clin (Paris),511,14

AIMS: to review, analyse and discuss all works about the wearing and development of facemasks as potential protection against SARS-COV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar and DOAJ were browsed. KEYWORDS: ""mask and (SARS or Cov)"" (1 August 2019 to 12 April 2020). INCLUSION CRITERIA: original research. PRISMA criteria were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-one works were selected. Identified topics: effectiveness of protective equipment/devices (PE) (n = 3), universal wearing of facemasks plus other protective measures in the community (n = 3), impact of infection control measures on hospitals and epidemiological tracing (n = 3), development of new PE (n = 2), sanitisation of facemasks (n = 4), clinical guidance (n = 4) and questionnaires (n = 2). DISCUSSION: It seems that the effectiveness of PE, namely facemasks, is not fully known. Universal wearing of facemasks may be simultaneously recommended with other protective measures. Nosocomial and community infections seem to be preventable. New PE, methods of facemask sanitisation and clinical guidance are emerging, but caution is recommended regarding their adoption, revision and monitoring by international boards and institutions. Questionnaires are useful tools for collecting citizens' opinions on implementing public health measures, and thus contribute to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Universal wearing of facemasks in the community is likely to be recommended during the COVID-19pandemic. Since SARS-COV-2 is highly contagious, a set of measures should be considered. Facemask sanitisation is possible, but standardised procedures are lacking. New PE is emerging and requires detailed regulatory approval.

We look at the variation in the 7-day averages of the cumulative numbers of reported cases and deaths in each city at the end of every week as a function of its total population, its ‘urbanized area,’ and its average population density (the ratio of its population and its urbanized area). We find that during the last 10 weeks, the numbers have tended to converge: (1) a city with double the population of a smaller one can be expected to have 17 percent more cases per capita and 28 percent more deaths per capita than the smaller city;(2) a city with double the urbanized area of a smaller one can be expected to have 19 percent more cases per capita and 38 percent more deaths per capita than the smaller city;and, finally, (3) a city with double the population density of a smaller one can be expected to have 4.1 percent fewer cases per capita and 7.4 percent fewer deaths per capita than the smaller city. Larger cities have more than their share of cases and deaths in part because the larger the city, the larger the number of possible interactions among its inhabitants. And it is this larger number, rather than the overall average proximity of people to each other — expressed by the average density in the city — that accounts for that larger share.

Objective: To assess whether a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, mood disorder, or anxiety disorder is associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study assessed 7348 consecutive adult patients for 45 days following laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and May 31, 2020, in a large academic medical system in New York. The final date of follow-up was July 15, 2020. Patients without available medical records before testing were excluded. Exposures: Patients were categorized based on the following International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses before their testing date: (1) schizophrenia spectrum disorders, (2) mood disorders, and (3) anxiety disorders. Patients with these diagnoses were compared with a reference group without psychiatric disorders. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality, defined as death or discharge to hospice within 45 days following a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result. Results: Of the 26â¯540 patients tested, 7348 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 54 [18.6] years; 3891 [53.0%] women). Of eligible patients with positive test results, 75 patients (1.0%) had a history of a schizophrenia spectrum illness, 564 (7.7%) had a history of a mood disorder, and 360 (4.9%) had a history of an anxiety disorder. After adjusting for demographic and medical risk factors, a premorbid diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder was significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% CI, 1.48-4.80). Diagnoses of mood disorders (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.49) and anxiety disorders (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65-1.41) were not associated with mortality after adjustment. In comparison with other risk factors, a diagnosis of schizophrenia ranked behind only age in strength of an association with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of adults with SARS-CoV-2-positive test results in a large New York medical system, adults with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis were associated with an increased risk for mortality, but those with mood and anxiety disorders were not associated with a risk of mortality. These results suggest that schizophrenia spectrum disorders may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Nemani, Katlyn; Li, Chenxiang; Olfson, Mark; Blessing, Esther M; Razavian, Narges; Chen, Ji; Petkova, Eva; Goff, Donald C","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

On 11 March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The first instance of the virus in Nigeria was documented on 27 February 2020. This study provides a preliminary epidemiological analysis of the first 45 days of COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria. We estimated the early transmissibility via time-varying reproduction number based on the Bayesian method that incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of serial interval (time interval between symptoms onset in an infected individual and the infector), and adjusted for disease importation. By 11 April 2020, 318 confirmed cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19 have occurred in Nigeria. At day 45, the exponential growth rate was 0.07 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05-0.10) with a doubling time of 9.84 days (95% CI: 7.28-15.18). Separately for imported cases (travel-related) and local cases, the doubling time was 12.88 days and 2.86 days, respectively. Furthermore, we estimated the reproduction number for each day of the outbreak using a three-weekly window while adjusting for imported cases. The estimated reproduction number was 4.98 (95% CrI: 2.65-8.41) at day 22 (19 March 2020), peaking at 5.61 (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.83-7.88) at day 25 (22 March 2020). The median reproduction number over the study period was 2.71 and the latest value on 11 April 2020, was 1.42 (95% CrI: 1.26-1.58). These 45-day estimates suggested that cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria have been remarkably lower than expected and the preparedness to detect needs to be shifted to stop local transmission.","Adegboye, Oyelola A; Adekunle, Adeshina I; Gayawan, Ezra",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),511,23

Institutional punishment of wrong-doers is well-known to curtail their impetus as free-riders. However, institutions often have limited scope in imposing sanctions, more so when these are strict and potentially viewed as disproportionate. Inspired by the design principles proposed by the late Nobel Prize Elinor Ostrom, here we study the evolution and impact of a new form of institutional sanctioning, where punishment is graduated, growing with the incidence of free-riding. We develop an analytical model capable of identifying the conditions under which this design principle is conducive to the self-organization of stable institutions and cooperation. We employ evolutionary game theory in finite populations and non-linear public goods dilemmas in the presence of risk of global losses whose solution requires the self-organization of decision makers into an overall cooperative state. We show that graduated punishment is more effective in promoting widespread cooperation than conventional forms of punishment studied to date, being also less severe and thus, presumably, easier to implement. This effect is enhanced whenever the costs of its implementation are positively correlated with the severity of punishment. We frame our model within the context of the global reduction of carbon emissions, but the results are shown to be general enough to be applicable to other collective action problems, shedding further light into the origins of Human institutions.","Couto, Marta C; Pacheco, Jorge M; Santos, Francisco C",J Theor Biol,511,26

Material and Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was carried out on the young doctors and nursing staff at KAUH. An online questionnaire addressing all the required fields, i.e., background essential demography, perceptions, acceptance, and knowledge regarding telemedicine's utility, was sent to the targeted population of health care workers. Completed responses were analyzed statistically as per study objectives. Results: The response rate in our study was 85%. A total of 335 participants responded to our questionnaire. One hundred seventy-one (51.1%) were doctors, whereas one hundred sixty-four (48.9%) were the nursing staff. Among doctors, 50 (29.4%) were recent graduates, whereas, in the nursing side, 77 (46.7%) were the senior nursing students. The knowledge and attitude of the young nursing staff were relatively better than the senior staff taking part in the study and the trends were found statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study participants, being young, were enthusiastic, had good knowledge regarding the advantages and limitations of telemedicine in managing the selected groups of patients. Their perception and attitude were quite positive. This is an encouraging trend in the promotion of telemedicine as an established way of managing patients with special requirements in an effective way.

However, digestive symptoms also occur in patients with COVID-19 and are often described in outpatients with less severe disease. In this study, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with digestive symptoms and mild disease severity. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients with mild disease and one or more digestive symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), with or without respiratory symptoms, and compared them with a group presenting solely with respiratory symptoms. We followed up patients clinically until they tested negative for COVID-19 on at least 2 sequential respiratory tract specimens collected &#8805;24 hours apart. We then compared the clinical features between those with digestive symptoms and those with respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: There were 206 patients with low severity COVID-19, including 48 presenting with a digestive symptom alone, 69 with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone. Between the 2 groups with digestive symptoms, 67 presented with diarrhea, of whom 19.4% experienced diarrhea as the first symptom in their illness course. The diarrhea lasted from 1 to 14 days, with an average duration of 5.4 ± 3.1 days and a frequency of 4.3 ± 2.2 bowel movements per day. Concurrent fever was found in 62.4% of patients with a digestive symptom. Patients with digestive symptoms presented for care later than those with respiratory symptoms (16.0 ± 7.7 vs 11.6 ± 5.1 days, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, patients with digestive symptoms had a longer duration between symptom onset and viral clearance (P < 0.001) and were more likely to be fecal virus positive (73.3% vs 14.3%, P = 0.033) than those with respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: We describe a unique subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild disease severity marked by the presence of digestive symptoms. These patients are more likely to test positive for viral RNA in stool, to have a longer delay before viral clearance, and to experience delayed diagnosis compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms.","Han, Chaoqun; Duan, Caihan; Zhang, Shengyan; Spiegel, Brennan; Shi, Huiying; Wang, Weijun; Zhang, Lei; Lin, Rong; Liu, Jun; Ding, Zhen; Hou, Xiaohua",Am J Gastroenterol,511,16

In this manuscript, we use comprehensive national-level data to compare morbidity burden between ethnic groups in New Zealand. Methods: We investigated the prevalence of morbidity among all New Zealanders aged 18+ (n = 3,296,837), stratified by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, Asian, Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, European/Other), using national-level hospitalisation and pharmaceutical data and two measures of morbidity (the M3 and P3 indices). Results and Conclusions: We observed substantial disparities for Maori and Pacific peoples compared to other ethnic groups for the vast majority of commonly-diagnosed morbidities. These disparities appeared strongest for the most-common conditions - meaning that Maori and Pacific peoples disproportionately shoulder an increased burden of these key conditions. We also observed that prevalence of these conditions emerged at earlier ages, meaning that Maori and Pacific peoples also experience a disproportionate impact of individual conditions on the quality and quantity of life. Finally, we observed strong disparities in the prevalence of conditions that may exacerbate the impact of COVID-19, such as chronic pulmonary, liver or renal disease. The substantial inequities we have presented here have been created and perpetuated by the social determinants of health, including institutionalised racism: thus solutions will require addressing these systemic issues as well as addressing inequities in individual-level care.","Gurney, Jason; Stanley, James; Sarfati, Diana",J Comorb,511,24

XFEL experiments are a challenge to computing in two ways: i) due to the high cost of running XFELs, a fast turnaround time from data acquisition to data analysis is essential to make informed decisions on experimental protocols; ii) data collection rates are growing exponentially, requiring new scalable algorithms. Here we report our experiences analyzing data from two experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) during September 2020. Raw data were analyzed on NERSC's Cori XC40 system, using the Superfacility paradigm: our workflow automatically moves raw data between LCLS and NERSC, where it is analyzed using the software package CCTBX. We achieved real time data analysis with a turnaround time from data acquisition to full molecular reconstruction in as little as 10 min -- sufficient time for the experiment's operators to make informed decisions.

This study analyzed the COVID-19 vaccination willingness rate (VWR) and its determinants under China's free vaccination policy compared to a paid vaccine. (2) Methods: Data on 2377 respondents were collected through a nationwide questionnaire survey. Multivariate ordered logistic regression models were specified to explore the correlation between the VWR and its determinants. (3) Results: China's free vaccination policy for COVID-19 increased the VWR from 73.62% to 82.25% of the respondents. Concerns about the safety and side-effects were the primary reason for participants' unwillingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Age, medical insurance and vaccine safety were significant determinants of the COVID-19 VWR for both the paid and free vaccine. Income, occupation and vaccine effectiveness were significant determinants of the COVID-19 VWR for the free vaccine. (4) Conclusions: Free vaccinations increased the COVID-19 VWR significantly. People over the age of 58 and without medical insurance should be treated as the target intervention population for improving the COVID-19 VWR. Contrary to previous research, high-income groups and professional workers should be intervention targets to improve the COVID-19 VWR.

439364,439364,439364,Impact of COVID-19 on a tertiary eye hospital,18.407637,6.1696134,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hospital workers have been the most frequently and severely affected professional group during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have a big impact on transmission. In this context, innovative tools are required to measure the symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the spread of infection, and testing capabilities within hospitals in real time. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and test an effective and user-friendly tool to identify and track symptoms compatible with COVID-19 in hospital workers. METHODS: We developed and pilot tested Hospital Epidemics Tracker (HEpiTracker), a newly designed app to track the spread of COVID-19 among hospital workers. Hospital staff in 9 hospital centers across 5 Spanish regions (Andalusia, Balearics, Catalonia, Galicia, and Madrid) were invited to download the app on their phones and to register their daily body temperature, COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and general health score, as well as any polymerase chain reaction and serological test results. RESULTS: A total of 477 hospital staff participated in the study between April 8 and June 2, 2020. Of note, both health-related (n=329) and non-health-related (n=148) professionals participated in the study; over two-thirds of participants (68.8%) were health workers (43.4% physicians and 25.4% nurses), while the proportion of non-health-related workers by center ranged from 40% to 85%. Most participants were female (n=323, 67.5%), with a mean age of 45.4 years (SD 10.6). Regarding smoking habits, 13.0% and 34.2% of participants were current or former smokers, respectively. The daily reporting of symptoms was highly variable across participating hospitals; although we observed a decline in adherence after an initial participation peak in some hospitals, other sites were characterized by low participation rates throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: HEpiTracker is an already available tool to monitor COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in hospital workers. This tool has already been tested in real conditions. HEpiTracker is available in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. It has the potential to become a customized asset to be used in future COVID-19 pandemic waves and other environments.

In the present study, we aimed to discover the potential of ß-adrenoceptor agonists and adenosine deaminase inhibitors which are used in asthma and cancer/inflammatory disorders, respectively, as repurposing drugs against protease inhibitor by ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening using COVID-19 protease-N3 complex. The AARRR pharmacophore model was used to screen a set of 22,621 molecules to obtain hits, which were subjected to high-throughput virtual screening. Extra precision docking identified four top-scored molecules such as +/--fenoterol, FR236913 and FR230513 with lower binding energy from both categories. Docking identified three major hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Glu166 and Gln189 residues. 100 ns MD simulation was performed for four top-scored molecules to analyze the stability, molecular mechanism and energy requirements. MM/PBSA energy calculation suggested that van der Waals and electrostatic energy components are the main reasons for the stability of complexes. Water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand and flexibility of the ligand are found to be responsible for providing extra stability to the complexes.

The available literature data derived from controlled studies or usage in a medical setting seem reassuring; however the literature contains very rare cases of fatal self-inflicted injuries associated with LSD exposure. The behavioral disorder that created the conditions conducive to death is a maladaptive or irrational response to the psychiatric manifestations induced by the substance. PATIENT CONCERN: Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old man found dead with large neck wounds in a locked house. No medical history other than recreational use of alcohol and narcotics was reported as well as any history of psychotic disease. The entirety of the other investigations carried out did not demonstrate the presence of a third party at the place of death and a dropper bottle containing LSD was found near the body. DIAGNOSIS: We report the first case of fatal self-inflicted neck wounds with a cutting instrument in the context of acute exposure to LSD in a patient with no psychiatric history and without suicidal symptoms at the time of the self-aggressive act. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOMES: In the present work, we used a validated method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for simultaneous quantification of LSD and its metabolites (O-H-LSD and Nor-LSD) in whole blood and urine samples. LSD and O-H-LSD were respectively found at 1460 and 182âpg/mL in blood. In the urine, the concentrations of LSD, nor-LSD, O-H-LSD were, respectively, 3670, 201, and 4890âng/L. LESSONS: This observation is particularly relevant in view of the resurgence of interest in the therapeutic use of LSD, notwithstanding the fact that the literature has not demonstrated a link between suicidal risk and acute or chronic exposure to LSD.","Le Daré, Brendan; Gicquel, Thomas; Baert, Alain; Morel, Isabelle; Bouvet, Renaud",Medicine (Baltimore),511,5

To date, pathologic analyses have been limited to patient reports and autopsy series. METHODS: We evaluated biopsy samples of native and allograft kidneys from patients with COVID-19 at a single center in New York City between March and June of 2020. We also used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy to examine this tissue for presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The study group included 17 patients with COVID-19 (12 men, 12 black; median age of 54 years). Sixteen patients had comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, malignancy, or a kidney or heart allograft. Nine patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Fifteen patients (88%) presented with AKI; nine had nephrotic-range proteinuria. Among 14 patients with a native kidney biopsy, 5 were diagnosed with collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with minimal change disease, 2 were diagnosed with membranous glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with crescentic transformation of lupus nephritis, 1 was diagnosed with anti-GBM nephritis, and 4 were diagnosed with isolated acute tubular injury. The three allograft specimens showed grade 2A acute T cell-mediated rejection, cortical infarction, or acute tubular injury. Genotyping of three patients with collapsing glomerulopathy and the patient with minimal change disease revealed that all four patients had APOL1 high-risk gene variants. We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. Biopsy diagnosis informed treatment and prognosis in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 develop a wide spectrum of glomerular and tubular diseases. Our findings provide evidence against direct viral infection of the kidneys as the major pathomechanism for COVID-19-related kidney injury and implicate cytokine-mediated effects and heightened adaptive immune responses.","Kudose, Satoru; Batal, Ibrahim; Santoriello, Dominick; Xu, Katherine; Barasch, Jonathan; Peleg, Yonatan; Canetta, Pietro; Ratner, Lloyd E; Marasa, Maddalena; Gharavi, Ali G; Stokes, M Barry; Markowitz, Glen S; D039,; Agati, Vivette D",J.

METHODS: This proof-of-concept parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 99 patients. Following a 1-week washout, patients were randomized into three groups: OA group (fluoride toothpaste containing 0.1% OA and placebo mouthwash); negative control (fluoride toothpaste and placebo mouthwash); and CHX group (fluoride toothpaste and 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash). Patients were clinically assessed at inclusion, pre-washout visit, baseline, and after 4-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks of twice daily use of the products. Patients received a diary for documentation of bleeding on brushing and provided unstimulated saliva samples. RESULTS: After two weeks, all groups showed significant reductions in all clinical parameters. The CHX group exhibited significantly greater reductions in gingival index and interproximal gingival index scores at week-2, as compared to patients in the negative control (p=0.04). In contrast, reductions in gingival index scores did not differ between CHX and OA groups and between OA and negative control groups at week-2. The CHX group had significantly greater reductions in plaque index scores at day-4, 1-week, and 2-week evaluations, as compared to the negative control and OA groups. The frequency of adverse events was similar among the groups. None of the groups reduced salivary transferrin levels. Finally, the OA group had the lowest percentage of self-reported bleeding events.

We describe our utilization and implementation of telehealth (TH) for pediatric colorectal surgery MDC visits and collate patient satisfaction using TH compared to in-person (IP) visits. METHODS: Implementation of a single-institution MDC TH platform to perform patient visits on February 1, 2020 was studied. Following 6 months of implementation, TH visits' characteristics were compared with IP visits in the 3 months before implementation by patient volume, length of clinic visits, and patient satisfaction survey results. RESULTS: Before implementation, 152 (100%) of clinic visits were IP. During the implementation, 87 (37.7%) were TH visits. Seventy-four (49%) were MDC visits, 17 (23%) of these using the TH platform. Each TH visit's median length was 25 minutes (IQR 15-30), while the median length of IP visits was 45 minutes (IQR 30-45). Pre-implementation satisfaction scores were 88.6% positive, while satisfaction scores after implementation were 96.8% positive. None of the patients who utilized the TH platform had an unplanned hospital admission within 24 hours of being seen. CONCLUSION: Our experience demonstrates that the TH platform can provide an efficient avenue for established patients and families to receive highly complex multidisciplinary follow-up care. High levels of patient satisfaction indicated that TH should become part of the routine care plan for patients who require long-term or consistent follow-up.","Lopez, Joseph J; Svetanoff, Wendy Jo; Rosen, John M; Carrasco, Alonso; Rentea, Rebecca M",Am Surg,511,16

Associations of DPP9 or DPP8 with human liver cancer have not been examined. Genome-wide association studies have found that intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DPP9 are associated with severe COVID-19 and lung fibrosis3. However, exonic SNPs in DPP9 and DPP9 loss of function (LoF) variants have not been explored. Methods Large-scale human genetic databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were interrogated. Results We found that DPP8 and DPP9 are intolerant to LoF variants, which strongly suggests that these enzymes, but not DPP4 and FAP, are essential for life in humans. Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) was the most commonly diagnosed cancer in patients with DPP9 LoF variants, and low DPP9 expression was associated with poor survival in UCEC. The two DPP9 intronic SNPs that have been associated with lung fibrosis and COVID-19 were not associated with liver fibrosis or cancer. All four enzymes were overexpressed in liver tumours. Increased DPP9 expression was associated with obesity in HCC patients, but there was no association between DPP9 expression intensity and HCC survival. However, high expression of all four DPP4-like genes was significantly associated with poor survival in HCC. Moreover, high expression of genes that positively correlated with overexpression of DPP4, DPP8, and DPP9 was associated with very poor survival in HCC (Fig. 1). Enriched pathways analysis of these in-common correlated genes featured Toll-like receptor (TLR) and SUMOylation pathways. Conclusion This comprehensive data mining suggests that DPP9 is essential for human survival and the DPP4 protease family is important in cancer pathogenesis. References 1. Zhang, H.

CONCLUSION: The use of locking plate technology for fixation of distal femur periprosthetic fractures is a common treatment modality. Although much has been reported regarding healing and complication rates of distal femoral periprosthetic fractures, little has been reported about peri-implant fractures subsequent to treatment using locking plates. We propose the importance of developing a method of fixation to protect the entire femur in osteoporotic patients sustaining distal femur periprosthetic fractures at the index surgery to avoid this complication.","Meshay, Ian M; Martin, John R; Auran, Richard L; Jones, Clifford B",JBJS Case Connect,511,20

While several countries have implemented the use of diagnostic testing in a massive scale as a cornerstone for infection control and surveillance, other countries affected by the pandemic are hampered by its limited testing capacity. Pooled testing was first introduced in the 1940s and is now used for screening in blood banks. Testing is done by pooling multiple individual samples together. Only in the case of a positive pool test would individual samples of the pool be tested, thus substantially reducing the number of tests needed. Several studies regarding their use for SARS CoV-2 have been done in the United States, Israel, and Germany. Studies have shown that an individual positive sample can still be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, and possibly even 64 samples, provided that additional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification cycles are conducted with a sensitivity of 96%. Simulation studies to determine optimal pool size and pooling techniques have also been conducted. Based on these studies, pooled testing is shown to be able to detect positive samples with sufficient accuracy and can easily be used with existing equipment and personnel for population-wide screening.","Sunjaya, Angela Felicia; Sunjaya, Anthony Paulo",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,511,33

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","Tu, Yung-Fang; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Yarmishyn, Aliaksandr A; Lin, Yi-Ying; Luo, Yung-Hung; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Lai, Wei-Yi; Yang, De-Ming; Chou, Shih-Jie; Yang, Yi-Ping; Wang, Mong-Lien; Chiou, Shih-Hwa",,511,1

Risk factors concerning COVID-19-induced morbidity and mortality include advanced age, an impaired immune system, cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer treated with chemotherapy. Here, we discuss the risk and impact of COVID-19 in patients with mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndromes. Because no published data are yet available, expert opinions are, by necessity, based on case experience and reports from patients. Although the overall risk to acquire the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may not be elevated in mast cell disease, certain conditions may increase the risk of infected patients to develop severe COVID-19. These factors include certain comorbidities, mast cell activation-related events affecting the cardiovascular or bronchopulmonary system, and chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs. Therefore, such treatments should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis during a COVID-19 infection. In contrast, other therapies, such as anti-mediator-type drugs, venom immunotherapy, or vitamin D, should be continued.

With establishment of new home quarantine facility, isolation/quarantine centres the chances of general waste getting contaminated with biomedical waste has increased exponentially. Through this systematic review the authors searched for all possible queries raised by different researchers on COVID19 waste management on Pubmed. A summary of all the different issues unique to COVID19 waste was prepared. Guidelines, rules and recommendation given by national and international agencies published till date were taken into account while trying to answer all the above questions raised by different studies. The key step in COVID19 waste management is segregation of biomedical waste from solid waste. Waste generated from COVID19 patients is like any other infectious waste, therefore creating public awareness about the COVID19 waste hazards and segregation at source is highlighted in all guidelines as a recommendation. These guidelines for management of waste generated during diagnostics and treatment of COVID-19 suspected or confirmed patients, are required to be followed in addition to existing practices under regulation.

The lockdown impacted several aspects of life including the economy. Food security became a growing concern for many households. AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the diet diversity of urban households in India during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Information regarding socioeconomic status (SES), family size and information regarding availability and access to food were gathered from 450 households. Diet diversity was assessed using a 69-item food frequency questionnaire. Food variety scores (FVS) were computed for individual food groups and overall. RESULTS: The majority of the households (86.4%) belonged to the upper-middle or upper SES. Households did not experience any constraints in accessibility and availability of food except the meat group. Overall, 84% of the households had low FVS for most of the food groups except for sugar and milk and milk products. The household SES score was positively associated with the milk FVS (B = 0.039, p = 0.020) and negatively with the fat FVS (B = -0.062, p < 0.001). The number of adults (B = 6.773, p < 0.001) in the household positively predicted the FVS of cereal, vegetable, fruit, fat and total FVS. CONCLUSIONS: The higher SES households in urban India did not experience food insecurity. Despite this, their poor diet diversity is a serious cause for concern, especially in the wake of the evolving pandemic. This highlights the need to promote consumption of a diverse variety of foods.","Aneesh, Mitravinda; Patil, Rita S",Nutr Health,511,24

The current study assessed the relationships between personality variables (preference for solitude and Big Five personality), mental health (anxiety, stress, loneliness), and creativity, and tried to determine whether the identified personality profiles affect individuals' mental health and creativity. French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the first lockdown in Spring 2020. The results showed that the preference for solitude and personality variables of the Big Five predicted individuals' mental health and creativity. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed three profiles of individuals: ""Affiliation"", ""Emotionally Stable Lonely"" and ""Emotionally Unstable Lonely"". Results showed that individuals with ""Affiliation"" and ""Emotionally Unstable Lonely"" profiles expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an ""Emotionally Stable Lonely"" profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task.

BASIC PROCEDURES: We performed a quantitative research study using a web-based survey, in 140 women referred to Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center. MAIN FINDINGS: We observed changes in body weight during lockdown in 80 % of women, and a significant increase in BMI in comparison to that observed before (p=.001). We observed a high percentage of non-adherence to the Mediterranean pattern during lockdown due to higher frequency of consumption of sweet/pastries, cheese and meat, rather than fruit, vegetables and legumes. Before lockdown 36.4 % women were snack consumers while during lockdown 55 % (p=.002). By considering individuals' attitude to snack consumption, we observed an increase related to boredom (p=<.0001) and anxiety (p=.05) during lockdown. Increased levels of anxiety and sadness were observed in about 30 %, and of boredom in 25 %. The percentage of women worried about their planning infertility treatment was more than 50 %.

This review summarizes food security during epidemics and pandemics before moving on to panic buying, food shortages, and price spikes observed during the current crisis. The importance of food resilience, together with the need for addressing issues related to food loss and food waste, is underlined in the review towards food security and sustainable development. As a result, the pandemic has shown that our food systems are fragile. Since the global population and urbanization will grow in the coming decades, pandemics will likely occur more often, and climate change will intensify. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that our food systems become more sustainable and resilient.

Our ""TSA-MS ratio"" approach successfully identified known nuclear speckle proteins. For example, 96% and 67% of proteins in the top 30 and 100 sorted proteins, respectively, are known nuclear speckle proteins, including proteins that we validated here as enriched in nuclear speckles. We show that MFAP1, among the top 20 in our list, forms droplets under certain circumstances and that MFAP1 expression levels modulate the size, stability, and dynamics of nuclear speckles. Localization of MFAP1 and its binding partner, PRPF38A, in droplet-like nuclear bodies precedes formation of nuclear speckles during telophase. Our results update older proteomic studies of nuclear speckles and should provide a useful reference dataset to guide future experimental dissection of nuclear speckle structure and function.","Dopie, Joseph; Sweredoski, Michael J; Moradian, Annie; Belmont, Andrew S",J. cell. biol,511,16

This has resulted in serious delays in resuscitation response.ILCOR has recently modified its guidelines to separate defibrillation from other interventions, recognizing that shock success is extremely time-dependent and that defibrillation poses relatively little risk of Covid-19 transmission. The new recommendation calls for sending one caregiver into the isolation room in order to initiate bedside monitoring and defibrillate if indicated, while the code team is donning their personal protective equipment. Implementing this change requires focused training in that specific role. This can be accomplished by intensively training a subset of clinical staff to assume the responsibility and act without hesitation when a code occurs.Focused defibrillation training promises to avoid compromising the care of patients experiencing tachyarrhythmic arrests in the setting of Covid-19.

Several legal changes in subsequent years were unable to prevent that, contrary to the original intention, almost 90% of the newly founded facilities were established in urban cores and medium-sized centers; that concentration processes and monopolization were encouraged; and that the freedom of choice for patients was restricted. In order to counter the risk of undermining the free exercise of the medical profession and the dictates of economics over patient-oriented medicine in the outpatient sector, corporations, scientific societies, and professional associations are demanding more transparency and narrower limits for non-physician capital investors. There are currently more than 3000 medical care centers in Germany employing around 20,000 physicians, many of whom are internal medicine specialists. Regionally networked medical care center structures combine the advantages of optimized patient care with the growing desire of the younger generation of physicians for flexible working conditions within employment.

The internet has decreased barriers of accessing quality educational resources for students of all backgrounds. In medical education, the costs of obtaining and maintaining cadavers for the understanding of the human body can be a major expense. Furthermore, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in minimizing in-person learning, the demand for quality anatomy resources is at an all-time high. Objectives This project aimed to create a quality and informative dissection of the anterior abdominal wall for learners, and to investigate the impact of virtual learning as a supplementary resource. Methods A complete and skilled dissection of the anterior abdominal wall was recorded. In addition, specific anatomical features were explained during the recording. The footage was then edited via Camtasia, a video editing software, where visual features, audio features, a comprehensive quiz, and the video's introductory and outgoing effects were prepared. The final production was uploaded to YouTube and prepared for medical students at the University of British Columbia, as well as the online community. A survey was linked at the end of the video, which was open for anyone who watched the production. Results People from across the world watched and provided feedback on this dissection. While a majority of feedback received came from respondents in North America, some comments were received from viewers in Brazil, India and China. 94.7% of respondents were actively completing or had completed an MD Degree and 5.3% of participants were actively completing or had completed an MBBS program. 84.2% of participants used this resource to prepare for their anatomy labs and dissections, 63.2% used this video to prepare for their anatomy lectures, and 68.4% of people used this to prepare for their examinations. Overall, 21.1% of respondents agreed and 78.9% of respondents strongly agreed that this online resource assisted them in fulfilling their purposes of watching this video. Conclusion Responses from the online survey indicate that using gross anatomy dissection videos helped improve the learning experience of anatomy and more resources should be created to fill this demand.

METHODS: We used administrative claims data to identify residents in a single Japanese prefecture who were enrolled in National Health Insurance and Elderly Health Insurance from April 2012 to March 2017 and experienced Achilles tendon rupture after receiving an antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics were categorized into 3 groups: first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones, third-generation fluoroquinolones, and nonfluoroquinolones. We used a conditional Poisson regression model to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of Achilles tendon rupture during the antibiotic exposure period relative to the nonexposure period for each patient. An exposure period was defined as 30 days from start of the prescription. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 504 patients with Achilles tendon rupture who had received antibiotic prescriptions. Risk of rupture was not significantly elevated during exposure to third-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.33-3.37) and nonfluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.80-1.47). In contrast, risk was significantly elevated during exposure to first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.90-4.54). Findings were similar across subgroups stratified by sex and by recent corticosteroid use. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that third-generation fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture.

In response to COVID-19, traditional elements of oversight that relate to resident care have been curtailed in favor of implementing limited infection control surveys and targeted complaint investigations. We seek to describe the state of nursing home oversight during the pandemic to facilitate a discussion of whether and how these activities should be altered going forward. DESIGN AND SETTING: In a retrospective study, we describe national oversight activities in January-June 2020 and compare these activities to the same time period from 2019. We also examine state-level oversight activities during the peak months of the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: United States nursing homes. DATA: Publicly available Quality, Certification, and Oversight Reports (QCOR) data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). MEASUREMENTS: Number of standard, complaint, and onsite infection surveys, number of deficiencies from standard and complaint surveys, number of citations by deficiency tag, and number and amount of civil monetary penalties. RESULTS: The number of standard and complaint surveys declined considerably in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the same time frame in 2019. Deficiency citations generally decreased to near zero by April 2020 with the exception of infection prevention and control deficiencies and citations for failure to report COVID-19 data to the national health safety network. Related enforcement actions were down considerably in 2020, relative to 2019. CONCLUSION: In the months since COVID-19 first impacted nursing homes, regulatory oversight efforts have fallen off considerably. While CMS implemented universal infection control surveys and targeted complaint investigations, other routine aspects of oversight dropped in light of justifiable limits on nursing home entry. Going forward, we must develop policies that allow regulators to balance the demands of the pandemic while fulfilling their responsibilities effectively.","Stevenson, David G; Cheng, Audrey K",J Am Geriatr Soc,511,31

This investigation of Rt estimations was conducted to guide the national COVID-19 response in Qatar, from the onset of the epidemic until August 18, 2021. Methods: Real-time empirical RtEmpirical was estimated using five methods, including the Robert Koch Institute, Cislaghi, Systrom-Bettencourt and Ribeiro, Wallinga and Teunis, and Cori et al. methods. Rt was also estimated using a transmission dynamics model (RtModel-based). Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Agreements between different Rt estimates were assessed by calculating correlation coefficients. Results: RtEmpirical captured the evolution of the epidemic through three waves, public health response landmarks, effects of major social events, transient fluctuations coinciding with significant clusters of infection, and introduction and expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant. The various estimation methods produced consistent and overall comparable RtEmpirical estimates with generally large correlation coefficients. The Wallinga and Teunis method was the fastest at detecting changes in epidemic dynamics. RtEmpirical estimates were consistent whether using time series of symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases, all PCR-confirmed cases, acute-care hospital admissions, or ICU-care hospital admissions, to proxy trends in true infection incidence. RtModel-based correlated strongly with RtEmpirical and provided an average RtEmpirical. Conclusions: Rt estimations were robust and generated consistent results regardless of the data source or the method of estimation. Findings affirmed an influential role for Rt estimations in guiding national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in resource-limited settings.","Bsat, Raghid; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Coyle, Peter; Tang, Patrick; Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Kanaani, Zaina Al; Kuwari, Einas Al; Butt, Adeel A; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Shaik, Riyazuddin Mohammad; Nasrallah, Gheyath A; Benslimane, Fatiha; Khatib, Hebah A.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 pandemic, uses angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry. ACE2 is a member of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) and plays an important role in counteracting the harmful effects mediated by the angiotensin-type-1-receptor. Therefore, we conducted Ovid MEDLINE and Embase database searches of basic science studies investigating the impact of the biological variable of sex on ACE2 expression and regulation from 2000, the year ACE2 was discovered, through December 31, 2020. Out of 2131 publications, we identified 853 original research articles on ACE2 conducted in primary cells, tissues and/or whole mammals excluding humans. The majority (68.7%) of these studies that cited the sex of the animal were conducted in males, while 11.2% were conducted solely in females; 9.26% compared ACE2 between the sexes, while 10.8% did not report the sex of the animals used. General findings are that sex-differences are tissue-specific and when present, are dependent-upon gonadal state. Renal, cardiac and adipose ACE2 is increased in both sexes under experimental conditions that model co-morbidities associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes including hypertension, obesity, and renal and cardiovascular diseases; however, ACE2 protein was generally higher in the males. Studies in Ace2- knockout-mice indicate ACE2 plays a greater role protecting the female from developing hypertension than the male. Studying the biological variable of sex in ACE2 research provides an opportunity for discovery in conditions involving RAS-dysfunction and will shed light on sex-differences in COVID-19-severity.","Stanic, Branka; Maddox, Sydney; Arlindo de Souza, Aline Maria; Wu, Xie; Mehranfard, Danial; Ji, Hong; Speth, Robert C; Sandberg, Kathryn","Am. j. physiol, regul. integr. comp. physiol",511,22

Following first case description in December, 2019 this virus has infected over 10 million individuals and resulted in at least 500,000 deaths world-wide. The virus is undergoing rapid mutation, with two major clades of sequence variants emerging. This study sought to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants are associated with differing outcomes among COVID-19 patients in a single medical system. Whole genome SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was obtained from isolates collected from patients registered in the University of Washington Medicine health system between March 1 and April 15, 2020. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of patients and their outcome data including their hospitalization and death were collected. Statistical and machine learning models were applied to determine if viral genetic variants were associated with specific outcomes of hospitalization or death. Full length SARS-CoV-2 sequence was obtained 190 subjects with clinical outcome data. 35 (18.4%) were hospitalized and 14 (7.4%) died from complications of infection. A total of 289 single nucleotide variants were identified. Clustering methods demonstrated two major viral clades, which could be readily distinguished by 12 polymorphisms in 5 genes. A trend toward higher rates of hospitalization of patients with Clade 2 infections was observed (p = 0.06, Fisher's exact). Machine learning models utilizing patient demographics and co-morbidities achieved area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.93 for predicting hospitalization. Addition of viral clade or sequence information did not significantly improve models for outcome prediction. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 shows substantial sequence diversity in a community-based sample. Two dominant clades of virus are in circulation. Among patients sufficiently ill to warrant testing for virus, no significant difference in outcomes of hospitalization or death could be discerned between clades in this sample. Major risk factors for hospitalization and death for either major clade of virus include patient age and comorbid conditions.","Nakamichi, Kenji; Shen, Jolie Z; Lee, Cecilia S; Lee, Aaron; Roberts, Emma A; Simonson, Paul D; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Andriesen, Jessica; Randhawa, April K; Mathias, Patrick C; Greninger, Alex L; Jerome, Keith R; Van Gelder, Russell N",Sci Rep,511,16

Correcting for possible confounders, we estimated the effects of the most prominent determining factors on reported case numbers. To this end, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as a graphical representation of the hypothesized causal effects of the determinants on new reported cases of COVID-19. Based on this, we computed valid adjustment sets of the possible confounding factors. We collected data for Germany from publicly available sources (e.g. Robert Koch Institute, Germany's National Meteorological Service, Google) for 401 German districts over the period of 15 February to 8 July 2020, and estimated total causal effects based on our DAG analysis by negative binomial regression. Our analysis revealed favorable effects of increasing temperature, increased public mobility for essential shopping (grocery and pharmacy) or within residential areas, and awareness measured by COVID-19 burden, all of them reducing the outcome of newly reported COVID-19 cases. Conversely, we saw adverse effects leading to an increase in new COVID-19 cases for public mobility in retail and recreational areas or workplaces, awareness measured by searches for ""corona"" in Google, higher rainfall, and some socio-demographic factors. Non-pharmaceutical interventions were found to be effective in reducing case numbers. This comprehensive causal graph analysis of a variety of determinants affecting COVID-19 progression gives strong evidence for the driving forces of mobility, public awareness, and temperature, whose implications need to be taken into account for future decisions regarding pandemic management.","Steiger, Edgar; Mussgnug, Tobias; Kroll, Lars Eric",PLoS One,511,16

Expression profiles represent snapshots of combined genetic, socio-environmental (including socioeconomic and environmental factors), and physiological effects on the molecular phenotype. As such, they have potential to improve biological understanding of differences among populations, and provide therapeutic biomarkers and environmental mitigation strategies. Here, we undertook a large-scale assessment of patterns of gene expression between African Americans and European Americans, mining RNA-Seq data from 25 non-diseased and diseased (tumor) tissue-types. We observed the widespread enrichment of pathways implicated in COVID-19 and integral to inflammation and reactive oxygen stress. Chemokine CCL3L3 expression is up-regulated in African Americans. GSTM1, encoding a glutathione S-transferase that metabolizes reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, is upregulated. The little-studied F8A2 gene is up to 40-fold more highly expressed in African Americans; F8A2 encodes HAP40 protein, which mediates endosome movement, potentially altering the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. African American expression signatures, superimposed on single cell-RNA reference data, reveal increased number or activity of esophageal glandular cells and lung ACE2-positive basal keratinocytes. Our findings establish basal prognostic signatures that can be used to refine approaches to minimize risk of severe infection and improve precision treatment of COVID-19 for African Americans. To enable dissection of causes of divergent molecular phenotypes, we advocate routine inclusion of metadata on genomic and socio-environmental factors for human RNA-sequencing studies.","Singh, Urminder; Hernandez, Kyle M; Aronow, Bruce J; Wurtele, Eve Syrkin",Sci Rep,511,29

Although the virus is a ubiquitous problem, world leaders have varied appreciably in their responses resulting in substantially different outcomes in terms of virus mitigation, population health, and economic stability. One explanation for this inconsistency is that leaders have taken differential approaches to making sense of the crisis that, in turn, have driven their approaches to decision making and communication. The present article elaborates on the role of leaders as sensemakers and explains how a leader's sensemaking approach is a critical element in successful crisis management efforts. Through the charismatic, ideological, pragmatic (CIP) leadership model, a sensemaking-focused theory of leadership, it is explained how specific, relatively stable sensemaking approaches manifest and what actions leaders engaged in those styles are likely to take in times of crisis. These connections are then reinforced through case examples of 3 world leaders, framed through CIP, and demonstrate how their sensemaking approach has influenced their response to COVID-19. The article concludes with a discussion of the impacts that these differential approaches to COVID-19 may have on the global community, and recommendations for more explicit incorporation of sensemaking into our understanding of leadership.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 65 consecutively admitted patients with COVID-19 who were between 18 and 40 years old in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. Among them, 53 were moderate cases, and 12 were severe or critical cases. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment data were collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to explore risk factors. RESULTS: The patients with severe/critical cases had obviously higher BMI (average 29.23 vs. 22.79 kg/m2 ) and lower liver computed tomography value (average 50.00 vs. 65.00 mU) than the group of moderate cases. The patients with severe/critical cases had higher fasting glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine compared with patients with moderate cases (all P < 0.01). More severe/critical cases (58.33% vs. 1.92%) had positive urine protein levels. The severe/critical cases also experienced a significant process of serum albumin decline. Logistic regression analysis showed that male sex, high BMI (especially obesity), elevated fasting blood glucose, and urinary protein positivity were all risk factors for young patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is an important predictor of COVID-19 severity in young patients. The main mechanism is related to damage of the liver and kidney.","Deng, Ming; Qi, Yongjian; Deng, Liping; Wang, Huawei; Xu, Yancheng; Li, Zhen; Meng, Zhe; Tang, Jun; Dai, Zhe",Obesity (Silver Spring),511,1

It also paves a way to approach the current crisis caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from all scientific directions. Convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of neural network, is extensively applied in the medical field, and is particularly useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we present the application of CNNs for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 using X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients. The CNN models discussed in this review were mainly developed for the detection, classification, and segmentation of COVID-19 images. The base models used for detection and classification were AlexNet, Visual Geometry Group Network with 16 layers, residual network, DensNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, Inception, and extreme Inception. U-Net and voxel-based broad learning network were used for segmentation. Even with limited datasets, these methods proved to be beneficial for efficiently identifying the occurrence of COVID-19. To further validate these observations, we conducted an experimental study using a simple CNN framework for the binary classification of COVID-19 CT images. We achieved an accuracy of 93% with an F1-score of 0.93. Thus, with the availability of improved medical image datasets, it is evident that CNNs are very useful for the efficient diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19.","Kugunavar, Sneha; Prabhakar, C J",Vis Comput Ind Biomed Art,511,24

The state of alert, however, was declared in December 2010, to reestablish the essential public service of air transportation -which had been cut by the strike of the air traffic controllers working for AENA- and in March and October 2020, to control the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both situations have evinced the limitations and inadequacies of the legal regulation of this regime, both regarding the critical situations that allow to declare it and the measures that can be adopted. This work delves into the two-faced nature of the state of alert and the interpretation difficulties arising from its activation to tackle social conflicts and other emergencies that go beyond its legal framework. There is also an analysis of the problem of differentiating between limiting and suspending rights that lies behind the catalog of measures of this regime, the criticisms to its declaration in 2010 and the intense doctrinal debate resulting from the restrictions to the freedom of movement, the lockdown and the violation of other connected rights such as the right to reunion, to protest and to vote during the critical COVID-19 crisis.Alternate abstract:El estado de alarma fue considerado un instrumento de dudosa utilidad. Frente a las crisis naturales, sanitarias o tecnológicas, la legislación sectorial ordinaria preveía diversas medidas extraordinarias que, a juicio de la doctrina, hacían innecesario recurrir a dicho estado. Y las prevenciones introducidas en su regulación legal, dificultaban su uso ante situaciones de conflictividad social. El estado de alarma se declaró, sin embargo, en diciembre de 2010, para restablecer el servicio público esencial del trasporte aéreo paralizado por los controladores al servicio de AENA, y en marzo y octubre de 2020, para superar la crisis sanitaria ocasionada por la pandemia de la COVID-19. Ello ha evidenciado la versatilidad de la institución y la funcionalidad que antes se le negaba, pero también han puesto de manifiesto las limitaciones e insuficiencias de su regulación legal, tanto por lo que respecta a las situaciones críticas que permiten declararlo cuanto a las medidas susceptibles de adoptar. En este trabajo se analiza la naturaleza bifronte del estado de alarma, junto a las dificultades interpretativas que suscita su activación frente a conflictos sociales y otras emergencias que desbordan su marco jurídico. Asimismo, se abordan el problema de la distinción entre limitación y suspensión de derechos que subyace bajo el elenco de medidas de este estado, las críticas que desencadenó su declaración en 2010 y el intenso debate doctrinal que han generado las restricciones a la libertad de circulación, la reclusión domiciliaria y la afección de otros derechos conexos, como los de reunión, manifestación y sufragio, durante la gravísima crisis de la COVID-19.","López, Carlos Garrido",Teoría y Realidad Constitucional,511,1

Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing expectations in software teams. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether the expectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in software teams. Method: We surveyed 181 professional software developers to understand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1) organizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and educational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting semi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey questions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results: We observed 18 multi-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to a stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers expect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of standard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers, and new hires. Conclusion: Out of the 18 categories, three categories are related to career growth. This observation supports previous research that happiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among the most number of responses, we find expectations from educational institutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job stability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these organizations to help software developers. This observation can be especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hasan, Khalid; Chakraborty, Partho; Shahriyar, Rifat; Iqbal, Anindya; Uddin, Gias",,511,29

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is primarily due to person-to-person transmission. To understand the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we conducted phylogenetic analysis on genome sequences from >54K SARS-CoV-2 cases obtained from two public databases. Hierarchical clustering analysis on geographic patterns in the resulting phylogenetic trees revealed a co-expansion tendency of the virus among neighboring countries with diverse sources and transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. Pairwise sequence similarity analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted locally and evolves during transmission. However, no significant differences were seen among SARS-CoV-2 genomes grouped by host age or sex. Here, our identified epidemiological traits provide information to better prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against the virus.","Pan, Bohu; Ji, Zuowei; Sakkiah, Sugunadevi; Guo, Wenjing; Liu, Jie; Patterson, Tucker A; Hong, Huixiao",Viruses,511,12

BACKGROUND DATA: Earlier studies on cytokines in GCF in RA patients have not given clear results. METHODS: In a population-based cross-sectional study of patients &#8805;61 years of age, 233 RA patients were identified. 132 (57%) dentate RA patients participated. All participants received rheumatological and dental examinations, and had a panoramic radiograph taken. GCF was sampled on each patient. Interleukins 1-ß (IL-1ß), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), and chemokines RANTES/CCL5, eotaxin and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) were analyzed in GCF. These cytokines were stratified for periodontitis, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) status. Binary logistic regression analyses with periodontitis as outcome were performed adjusting for the above mentioned confounding factors including anti-rheumatic medication, disease duration and the cytokine in question. RESULTS: Periodontitis was diagnosed in 80/132 (61%) of study participants. The 110 RA patients not participating were older, had a higher mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), had a higher mean DAS28ESR (Disease Activity Score 28 using ESR) and were less often on biologic treatment. Only RANTES was associated with periodontitis (p = .049, OR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.002) in the binary logistic regression analyses. CONCLUSION: In this population-based elderly RA cohort, neither pro-inflammatory nor anti-inflammatory cytokines in GCF were clearly associated with a diagnosis of periodontitis.","Söderlin, Maria K; Persson, Gösta Rutger; Renvert, Stefan; Sanmartin Berglund, Johan",J. periodontal. res,511,21

AIMS: The purpose of this study is to assess the level of stress-induced cognition among radiologic technologists (RTs) in COVID-19 quarantine centers in Palestine after the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: Stress-induced cognition was assessed using stress-induced cognition scale (SCS) questionnaire. The validity and stability of the measuring tool was verified. The sample consisted of 61 RTs who are working currently at various quarantine centers in Palestine. RESULTS: Cognition-induced stress was higher than average. There was a statistically significant difference between RTs working directly with COVID-19 patient compared to RTs working indirectly. Additionally, results show increased level of stress for RTs having children compared to single or non-parent RTs. Also, RTs who dealt with COVID-19 patients for prolonged periods over a month had higher level of stress-induced cognition. Other variables did not show significant differences among RTs. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to provide psychological support for RTs who dealt and are currently involved in COVID-19 quarantine centers to alleviate stress-induced cognition.","Rimawi, Omar; ALMasri, Hussein",,511,16

It is nearly 200-fold more selective toward the mutant EGFR as compared to the WT EGFR. A tertiary cystein 797 to serine 797 (C797S) mutation in the EGFR kinase domain has hampered Osimertinib treatment in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This C797S mutation is presumed to induce a tertiary-acquired resistance to all current reversible and irreversible EGFR TKIs. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of resistance to Osimertinib as well as different strategies for overcoming the EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent mechanisms of resistance, new challenges, and a future direction.","Shaikh, Matin; Shinde, Yashodeep; Pawara, Rahul; Noolvi, Malleshappa; Surana, Sanjay; Ahmad, Iqrar; Patel, Harun",J. med. chem,511,16

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19.

TAM signaling, which has largely studied in the immune system and in cancer, has been involved in coagulation-related pathologies. Because of these established biological functions, the GAS6-PROS1/TAM system is postulated to play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and progression complications. The participation of the TAM system in vascular function and pathology has been previously reported. However, in the context of COVID-19, the role of TAMs could provide new clues in virus-host interplay with important consequences in the way that we understand this pathology. From the viral mimicry used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells, to the immunothrombosis that is associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, TAM signaling seems to be involved at different stages of the disease. TAM targeting is becoming an interesting biomedical strategy, which is useful for COVID-19 treatment now, but also for other viral and inflammatory diseases in the future.","Tutusaus, Anna; Marí, Montserrat; Ortiz-Pérez, José T; Nicolaes, Gerry A F; Morales, Albert; García de Frutos, Pablo",,511,16

In the past, other studies have already pointed out that health care systems, and more specifically hospitals, can be a so-called ""soft target"" for terrorist attacks. This report has now examined whether this is also the case in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.During the lockdown, hospitals turned out to be the only remaining soft targets for attacks, given that the other classic targets were closed during the lockdown. On the other hand, other important factors have limited the risk of such attacks in hospitals. The main delaying and relative risk-reducing factors were the access control on temperature and wearing a mask, no visits allowed, limited consultations, and investigations.But even then, health care systems and hospitals were prone to (cyber)terrorism, as shown by other COVID-19-related institutions, such as pharmaceuticals involved in developing vaccines and health care facilities involved in swab testing and contact tracing. Counter-terrorism medicine (CTM) and social behavioral science can reduce the likelihood and impact of terrorism, but cannot prevent (state-driven) cyberterrorism and actions of lone wolves and extremist factions.","De Cauwer, Harald G; Somville, Francis",Prehosp Disaster Med,511,12

Today, this virus is almost distributed all over the world. Since binding process plays a crucial role between host and receptor, therefore, we studied the molecules intended toward inhibition process through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation process. From the molecular docking study, it is noteworthy that remdesivir shows better binding affinity toward the main protease of SARS-CoV2 compared to other studied drugs. Within studied phytochemicals, carnosic acid shows better binding poses toward main protease of SARS-CoV2 among studied phytochemicals. The amino acid residues GLN110 and PHE294 were almost found in all the studied interactions of drugs and phytochemicals with main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the results show a larger contribution of the Van der Waals energies as compared to others like electrostatic energies suggesting that ligands at the binding pocket are predominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The conformational change during ligand binding was predicted from Gibbs free energy landscape analysis through molecular dynamics simulation. We observed that, there were two main free energy basins for both docked carnosic acid complex and for docked remdesivir complex, only one main free energy basin was found in the global free energy minimum region.

Although global and national AMR action plans are in place, infection prevention and control is primarily discussed in the context of health care facilities with home and everyday life settings barely addressed. As seen with the recent global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, everyday hygiene measures can play an important role in containing the threat from infectious microorganisms. This position paper has been developed following a meeting of global experts in London, 2019. It presents evidence that home and community settings are important for infection transmission and also the acquisition and spread of AMR. It also demonstrates that the targeted hygiene approach offers a framework for maximizing protection against colonization and infections, thereby reducing antibiotic prescribing and minimizing selection pressure for the development of antibiotic resistance. If combined with the provision of clean water and sanitation, targeted hygiene can reduce the circulation of resistant bacteria in homes and communities, regardless of a country's Human Development Index (overall social and economic development). Achieving a reduction of AMR strains in health care settings requires a mirrored reduction in the community. The authors call upon national and international policy makers, health agencies, and health care professionals to further recognize the importance of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings for preventing and controlling infection, in a unified quest to tackle AMR.","Maillard, Jean-Yves; Bloomfield, Sally F; Courvalin, Patrice; Essack, Sabiha Y; Gandra, Sumanth; Gerba, Charles P; Rubino, Joseph R; Scott, Elizabeth A",Am J Infect Control,511,1

To achieve this, we used a time to event analysis to arrive at factors that could alter the length of hospital stay, aiding in planning additional beds for any future rise in cases. METHODS: Information about COVID-19 patients was collected between June and August 2020. The response variable was the time from admission to discharge of patients. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the factors that were associated with the length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 730 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 675 (92.5%) recovered and 55 (7.5%) were considered to be right-censored, that is, the patient died or was discharged against medical advice. The median length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized was found to be 7 days by the Kaplan Meier curve. The covariates that prolonged the length of hospital stay were found to be abnormalities in oxygen saturation (HR = 0.446, P < .001), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 0.742, P = .003), levels of D-dimer (HR = 0.60, P = .002), lactate dehydrogenase (HR = 0.717, P = .002), and ferritin (HR = 0.763, P = .037). Also, patients who had more than 2 chronic diseases had a significantly longer length of stay (HR = 0.586, P = .008) compared to those with no comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Factors that are associated with prolonged length of hospital stay of patients need to be considered in planning bed strength on a contingency basis.","Thiruvengadam, Gayathri; Lakshmi, Marappa; Ramanujam, Ravanan",J Prim Care Community Health,511,31

To contain the crisis, it is essential to build full cooperation between the government and the public. However, it is unclear which governmental and individual factors are the determinants and how they interact on protective behaviors against COVID-19. To resolve this issue, this study built a multiple mediation model and found government emergency public information as detailed pandemic information and positive risk communication had more important impacts on protective behaviors than rumor refutation and supplies. Moreover, governmental factors could indirectly affect protective behaviors through individual factors such as perceived efficacy, positive emotions, and risk perception. These findings suggest that systematic intervention programs for governmental factors need to be integrated with individual factors to finally achieve effective prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic among the public.

Based on the multi-dimensional perspective, entropy method and exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) are used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of urban resilience of 281 cities of China from 2011 to 2018, and MGWR model is used to discuss the driving factors affecting the development of urban resilience. It is found that: (1) The urban resilience and sub-resilience show a continuous decline in time, with no obvious sign of convergence, while the spatial agglomeration effect shows an increasing trend year by year. (2) The spatial heterogeneity of urban resilience is significant, with obvious distribution characteristics of ""high in east and low in west"". Urban resilience in the east, the central and the west are quite different in terms of development structure and spatial correlation. The eastern region is dominated by the ""three-core driving mode"", and the urban resilience shows a significant positive spatial correlation; the central area is a ""rectangular structure"", which is also spatially positively correlated; The western region is a ""pyramid structure"" with significant negative spatial correlation. (3) The spatial heterogeneity of the driving factors is significant, and they have different impact scales on the urban resilience development. The market capacity is the largest impact intensity, while the infrastructure investment is the least impact intensity. On this basis, this paper explores the ways to improve urban resilience in China from different aspects, such as market, technology, finance and government.","Chen, Yu; Zhu, Mengke; Zhou, Qian; Qiao, Yurong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),511,1

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel anti-infective materials with broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic activity. In the present study, a fluorinated polycationic coating was synthesized on a hydrophilic and negatively charged polyester textile via one-step initiated chemical vapor deposition of poly(dimethyl amino methyl styrene-co-1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (P(DMAMS-co-PFDA), PDP). The surface characterization results of SEM, FTIR, and EDX demonstrated the successful synthesis of PDP coating. Contact angle analysis revealed that PDP coating endowed the polyester textile with the hydrophobicity against the attachment of different aqueous foulants such as blood, coffee, and milk, as well as the oleophobicity against paraffin oil. Zeta potential analysis demonstrated that the PDP coating enabled a transformation of negative charge to positive charge on the surface of polyester textile. The PDP coating exhibited excellent contact-killing activity against both gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the killing efficiency of approximate 99.9%. In addition, the antiviral capacity of PDP was determined by a green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression-based method using lentivirus-EGFP as a virus model. The PDP coating inactivated the negatively charged lentivirus-EGFP effectively. Moreover, the coating showed good biocompatibility toward mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells. All the above properties demonstrated that PDP would be a promising anti-pathogenic polymeric coating with wide applications in medicine, hygiene, hospital, etc., to control the bacterial and viral transmission and infection.","Song, Qing; Zhao, Ruixiang; Liu, Tong; Gao, Lingling; Su, Cuicui; Ye, Yumin; Chan, Siew Yin; Liu, Xinyue; Wang, Ke; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei",Chem Eng J,511,10

Methods: Data were collected via a telephone survey using a standardized script. Between March 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020, 28,903 people were tested at 4 Connecticut drive-through testing centers. Individuals who tested positive between March 16 and April 21, 2020 were randomly contacted. Of those individuals, 100 people agreed to complete the survey. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results: HCWs comprised 46% of the 100 survey respondents during the study period.

HCWs reported a longer duration of symptoms (17.39 vs 13.44 days) and were more likely to report work as their route of exposure (80.4% vs 27.8%) than non-HCWs. Conclusions: HCWs may face a disproportionate risk of contracting COVID-19 and self-report a longer duration of symptoms than the general public. The data suggest a need for an increased recovery time away from work than is currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as an increase in infection precautions for HCWs.","Smith, Aaron A; Akerson, Joie; Danahey, James; Dinh, Tam N M; Porter, Paul S",,511,24

Also, covid-19 confronted us with a question which engages directly with this issue of tradeoffs and balance: what are we willing to give up in order to get to health? How we respond depends on how we define health. Health could be better defined as an activity capable of balancing risk mitigation with the reasonable risk inherent in the pursuit of a full life, with health seen as a means to live a fulfilling life.

RESULTS: The older group had more patients with dyspnea and fewer patients with fever and muscle pain. Older patients had more underlying diseases, secondary infection, myocardial injury, renal dysfunction, coagulation dysfunction, and immune dysfunction on admission. More older patients received immunoglobulin therapy and mechanical ventilation. The proportions of patients with multiple organ injuries, critically ill patients and death increased significantly with age. The older groups had higher cumulative death risk than the younger group. Hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, comorbidities, acute cardiac injury, shock and complications are independent predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of the elderly patients were more atypical, with more comorbidities, secondary infection, organ injuries, immune dysfunction and a higher risk of critical illness. Older age was an important risk factor for mortality. METHODS: 1000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 from January 1, 2020 to February 14, 2020 were enrolled.

However, the implication of policy changes at the individual-level remains unclear: do citizens support those nationalist government responses? More importantly, do people tend to be more nationalistic following the outbreak? Building on terror management theory (TMT), this article examines whether and how ideological beliefs affect individuals' support for nationalist policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to TMT, to cope with death anxiety, people are predisposed to ideological defense, resulting in cohesion with individuals who validate their beliefs and hostility toward those who threaten them. Thus, we argue that when states' nationalist policies are aligned with their ideology, people tend to support them; yet, when states' nationalist policies contradict their ideology, people tend to withdraw their support. Specifically, this study found that as non-conservatives (compared to conservatives) are more concerned with the virus, they are more likely to show an inclination of ideological validation. Given that their ideology advocates more tolerance, non-conservatives are less likely to support nationalistic policies. To test the hypotheses, we applied structural equation modeling to a March 2020 CNN Poll (nationally representative US data about COVID-19). The statistical analysis demonstrated strong support for our arguments.","Su, Ruolin; Shen, Wensong",J Chin Polit Sci,511,20

The current study aimed to examine the relationship between well-being and coping strategies in response to the pandemic. Further, we aimed to investigate the mediational role of benefit finding. A total of 521 participants aged 18-65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation-specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice, and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well-being were assessed one month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well-being, while social distancing negatively predicted well-being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice, and benefit finding with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this scenario, the role of trace metals in the insurgence and progression of atherosclerosis has not been clarified yet. In this paper, the specific role of selected trace elements (magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron, copper, phosphorus, and calcium) is described by focusing on the atherosclerotic prevention and pathogenesis plaque. For each element, the following data are reported: daily intake, serum levels, intra/extracellular distribution, major roles in physiology, main effects of high and low levels, specific roles in atherosclerosis, possible interactions with other trace elements, and possible influences on plaque development. For each trace element, the correlations between its levels and clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 are discussed. Moreover, the role of matrix metalloproteinases, a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, as a new medical therapeutical approach to atherosclerosis is discussed. Data suggest that trace element status may influence both atherosclerosis insurgence and plaque evolution toward a stable or an unstable status. However, significant variability in the action of these traces is evident: some - including magnesium, zinc, and selenium - may have a protective role, whereas others, including iron and copper, probably have a multi-faceted and more complex role in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaque. Finally, calcium and phosphorus are implicated in the calcification of atherosclerotic plaques and in the progression of the plaque toward rupture and severe clinical complications. In particular, the role of calcium is debated. Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemia, optimized magnesium and zinc levels are indicated as important protective tools against a severe clinical course of the disease, often related to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause a systemic inflammatory response, able to transform a stable plaque into an unstable one, with severe clinical complications.","Fanni, D; Gerosa, C; Nurchi, V M; Suri, J S; Nardi, V; Congiu, T; Coni, P; Ravarino, A; Cerrone, G; Piras, M; Cau, F; Kounis, N G; Balestrieri, A; Gibo, Y; Van Eyken, P; Coghe, F; Venanzi Rullo, E; Taibi, R; Orrù, G; Faa, G; Saba, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,511,1

The varying severity of the pandemic is explained by differences in prevention efforts in the form of public health policy, adherence to those guidelines, as well as socio-cultural, climate, and population characteristics. The second wave of the COVID-19 is currently breaching the borders of Europe. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders, however, existing surveillance explains past transmissions obscuring shifts in the pandemic, increases in infection rates, and the persistence in the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for shifts in the pandemic, week over week, speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those who are managing the pandemic successfully. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed and provides novel metrics to measure the transmission of disease. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Europe as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: New European cases slightly decreased from 158,741 to 152,064 from the week of 01/04-01/10 (week 1) to the week of 01/11-01/17 (week 2), and cumulative cases only increased from 22,507,271 to 23,890,761 with a weekly increase of 1,383,490 between January 10 to January 17. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK have the largest 7-day moving averages for new infections at 18,269, 20,787, 17,292, 17,442 and 59,809 respectively during the week of 01/4-01/10, but do not necessarily have positive speed, acceleration, jerk and persistance during the same time period. During week two, Jan 11-17, 7-day moving averages increased to 18,318 and 28,829 for France and Spain respectively. The infection rate per 100,000 people during the week of Jan 4-10 was highest in Ireland and the UK at 139.5 and 81.06, respectively. The Czech Republic, Portugal and Lituania have the next highest rates at 78.90, 73.59, and 54.81 all per 100,000 population. The top five countries by infection rate in week two were Portugal at 101.85, Ireland at 59.66, Andorra at 58.24, France at 57.31 and UK at 56.94. From the week of 01/04-1/10 to the week of 01/11-01/17, Europe's speed decreased (37.72 to 33.02 per 100,000), acceleration decreased (0.39 to -0.16 per 100,000), and jerk increased (-1.30 to 1.37 per 100,000). Speed was largest and decreasing in Ireland (132.29 to 72.66), Czech Republic (120.97 to 77.36), and Slovenia (97.54 to 67.64) during both weeks. Acceleration was highest in Portugal and Ireland in the week of 01/04-01/10 at 5.77 and 5.57 in addition to Slovakia at 4.59. CONCLUSIONS: These dynamic data suggest that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has breached European borders, but that virus transmission is decreasing in some countries. However, the UK, Spain, and Portugal, in particular, are at risk for a rapid expansion in the transmission of COVID-19. An examination of the European region suggests that there was a decrease in caseload of COVID-19 between January 4 and January 17. Unfortunately, the rates of jerk, which were negative for Europe at the beginning of the month, reversed course and became positive, despite descreases in speed and acceleration. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate during the second week was larger than the first week. These measures indicate that the second wave of the pandemic may be subsiding, but some countries remain at risk for new outbreaks and increased transmission in the absence of rapid policy responses.","Post, Lori; Culler, Kasen; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert L; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",,511,16

This is a retrospective record review of individuals who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a high-throughput national-level government facility located in the north of India. Samples collected from 6 April to 31 December 2020 are included in this work and represent four highly populous regions. Additionally, there was a prospective follow-up of 1729 cases through telephone interviews from 25 May 2020 to 20 June 2020. Descriptive analysis has been performed for profiling clinic-epidemiological aspects of suspect cases. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and symptom status. A total of 125 600 participants' details have been included in this report. The mean (s.d.) age of the participants was 33.1 (±15.3) years and 66% were male. Among these tested, 9515 (7.6%) were positive for COVID-19. A large proportion of positive cases were asymptomatic. In symptomatic positive cases, the commonest symptoms were cough and fever. Increasing age (groups 20-59 and &#8805;60 years compared to age group less than 5 years), male sex, history of international travel, symptoms for SARS-CoV-2, and participants from Delhi and Madhya Pradesh were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Having co-morbidity, risk behaviours and intra-familial positivity were associated with a positive odds ratio for exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Intensified testing and isolation of cases, identification of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals and additional care of those with co-morbidities and risk behaviours will all be collectively important for disease containment in India. Reasons for differentials in testing between men and women remain an important area for in-depth study. The increased deployment of vaccines is likely to impact the trajectory of COVID-19 in the coming time, and therefore our data will serve as a comparative resource as India experiences the second wave of infection in light of newer variants that are likely to accelerate disease spread.","Malhotra, Sumit; Rahi, Manju; Das, Payal; Chaturvedi, Rini; Chhibber-Goel, Jyoti; Anvikar, Anup; Shankar, Hari; Yadav, C P; Meena, Jaipal; Tewari, Shalini; Gopinath, Sudha V; Chhabra, Reba; Sharma, Amit",Open Biol,511,1

This study appraised the frequency of asymptomatic individuals and estimated occurrence by age group and gender by reviewing the existing published data on asymptomatic people with COVID-19. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WoS), were used to search the literature following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The study population for this review included asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in original articles published up to 30 April 2020. A random effects model was applied to analyze pooled data on the prevalence of asymptomatic cases among all COVID-19 patients and also by age and gender. From the meta-analysis of 16 studies, comprising 2,788 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, the pooled prevalence according to the random effect size of asymptomatic cases was 48.2% (95% CI, 30-67%). Of the asymptomatic cases, 55.5% (95% CI, 43.6-66.8%) were female and 49.6% (95% CI, 20.5-79.1%) were children. Children and females were more likely to present as asymptomatic COVID-19 cases and could act as unknown carriers of SARS-CoV-2. Symptom-based screening might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections escalating the threat of global spread and impeding containment. Therefore, a mass surveillance system to track asymptomatic cases is critical, with special attention to females and children.","Syangtan, Gopiram; Bista, Shrijana; Dawadi, Prabin; Rayamajhee, Binod; Shrestha, Lok Bahadur; Tuladhar, Reshma; Joshi, Dev Raj",Front Public Health,511,20

During this isolation period or quarantine, habits have been modified. This might have had negative effects on physiological variables but also influenced numerous emotional aspects, especially in elite athletes, which can have a negative impact on training and sleep quality, affecting their performance. METHODS: 175 Spanish professional and non-professional association football players answered an online survey about demographic and training habits, as well as two validated questionnaires to assess psychological variables (POMS and WLEIS-S). RESULTS: The results showed that the confinement period reduced the load of training (p < 0.01), and modified the sleeping behaviour (both, sleep time (p < 0.05) and quality (p < 0.001)) across soccer players. Higher emotional intelligence (EI) values were positively related to training variables and strongly correlated with the mood. Interestingly, athletes' mood was affected differently depending on gender. CONCLUSION: We found that confinement period affects both, training load and recovery process and that mood states and EI could predict the training variables and performance of top-level football players.","Mon-López, Daniel; García-Aliaga, Abraham; Ginés Bartolomé, Alberto; Muriarte Solana, Diego",Physiol Behav,511,1

The impact of changes in practice on prognosis over time has not been evaluated. METHODS: Single center, retrospective study in adults hospitalized in a medicine ward for COVID-19 from March 5th to April 25th 2020. Patient characteristics were compared between two periods (before/after March 19th) considering French guidelines. The aim of the study was to evaluate how medical care impacted unfavorable outcome, namely admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were admitted: mean age 59.0±16.3 years; mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level 84.0±71.1 mg/L; 46% had a lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. Prescribed anti-infective agents were lopinavir-ritonavir (n=12), azithromycin (AZI) (n=28) and AZI combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=52). There was a significant decrease in ICU admission, from 43% to 12%, between the two periods (P<0.0001). Delays until transfer to ICU were similar between periods (P=0.86). Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT)-scans were performed significantly more often with time (from 50% to 90%, P<0.0001), and oxygen-dependency (53% vs 80%, P=0.001) and prescription of AZI±HCQ (from 25% to 76%, P<0.0001) were also greater over time. Multivariate analyses showed a reduction of unfavorable outcome in patients receiving AZI±HCQ (hazard ratio [HR]=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.21-0.97], P=0.04), particularly among an identified category of individuals (lymphocyte &#8805;1000/mm3 or CRP &#8805;100 mg/L). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a significant decrease in admission to ICU over time, which was probably related to multiple factors, including a better indication of pulmonary CT-scan, oxygen therapy, and a suitable prescription of anti-infective agents.","Davido, Benjamin; Boussaid, Ghilas; Vaugier, Isabelle; Lansaman, Thibaud; Bouchand, Frédérique; Lawrence, Christine; Alvarez, Jean-Claude; Moine, Pierre; Perronne, Véronique; Barbot, Frédéric; Saleh-Mghir, Azzam; Perronne, Christian; Annane, Djillali; De Truchis, Pierre",Int J Antimicrob Agents,511,31

AIM: We aimed to establish the duration and risk factors for persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic infected individuals. METHODS: Data of repeat rRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test done for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals at our institute at Jodhpur, India were analysed from 19 March to 21 May 2020. Duration of virus persistence was estimated with parametric regression models based on weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, gamma and generalized gamma distributions. Factors associated with prolonged viral persistence were analysed with the best-fitting model. RESULTS: Fifty-one SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with repeat rRT-PCR test were identified with 44 asymptomatics. The asymptomatic individuals had median virus persistence duration of 8.87 days (95% CI: 7.65-10.27) and 95 percentile duration of 20.70 days (95% CI: 16.08-28.20). The overall median virus persistence including both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was found to be 9.18 days (95% CI: 8.04-10.48). Around one-fourth asymptomatics (10/44) demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 persistence beyond 2 weeks. Age <60 years and local transmission were found to be significantly associated with longer virus persistence among asymptomatic individuals on univariate regression but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Recommended home isolation duration for SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in India should be extended from 17 days to at least 3 weeks. Prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals merits attention with regard to ensuring universal infection prevention precautions irrespective of symptomatic status.","Saurabh, S; Kumar, R; Gupta, M K; Bhardwaj, P; Nag, V L; Garg, M K; Misra, S",QJM,511,10

This factor yields the formation of new clusters of infections, without having to specify a priori and explicitly their date and place of appearance.We establish an {exact deterministic description} for such stochastic processes on 1D lattices (finite lines, semi-infinite lines, infinite lines, circles) by showing that the probability of infection at a given point in space and time can be obtained as the solution of a deterministic ODE system on the lattice. Our results allow stochastic initial conditions and arbitrary spatio-temporal heterogeneities on the parameters.We then apply our results to some concrete situations and obtain useful qualitative results and explicit formulae on the macroscopic dynamics and also the local temporal behavior of each individual. In particular, we provide a fine analysis of some aspects of cluster formation through the study of {patient-zero problems} and the effects of {time-varying point sources}.Finally, we show that the space-discrete model gives rise to new space-continuous models, which are either ODEs or PDEs, depending on the rescaling regime assumed on the parameters.","Fibich, Gadi; Nordmann, Samuel",,511,24

Clinical record systems contain codes to denote when such an offer has been declined by a patient (although these can in some cases be entered for a variety of other reasons including vaccination delay, or other administrative issues). We set out to describe the patterns of usage of codes for COVID-19 vaccines being declined. MethodsWith the approval of NHS England and using the full pseudonymised primary care records for 57.9 million NHS patients, we identified all patients in key vaccine priority groups: aged over 50, or over 16 and at increased risk from COVID-19 (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable [CEV] or otherwise ""at risk""). We describe the proportion of patients recorded as declining a COVID-19 vaccination for each priority group, and by other clinical and demographic factors; whether patients recorded as ""declined"" subsequently went on to receive a vaccination; and the distribution of code usage across GP practices. ResultsOf 24.5 million patients in priority groups as of May 25th 2021, 89.2% had received a vaccine, 8.8% had neither a vaccination nor a decline recorded, and 663,033 (2.7%) had a decline code recorded. Of patients with a recorded decline, 125,587 (18.9%) were subsequently vaccinated. Subsequent vaccination was slightly more common in the South Asian population than other ethnicities (e.g. 32.3% vs 22.8%, over 65s). The proportion of declining-unvaccinated patients varied strongly with ethnicity (Black 15.3%, South Asian 5.6%, White 1.5% in over 80s); and was higher in patients from more deprived areas. COVID-19 vaccine decline codes were present in almost all practices (98.8%), but with wide variation between practices in rates of usage. Among all priority groups, declining-unvaccinated status was most common in CEV (3.3%). ConclusionsClinical codes indicative of COVID-19 vaccinations being declined are widely used in English general practice. They are substantially more common among Black and South Asian patients, and patients from more deprived areas. There is a need for more detailed survey and/or qualitative research with patients and clinicians to determine the most common reasons for these recorded declines.","Curtis, Helen J; Inglesby, Peter; MacKenna, Brian; Croker, Richard; Hulme, William J; Rentsch, Christopher T; Bhaskaran, Krishnan; Walker, Alex J; Morton, Caroline E; Evans, David; Mehrkar, Amir; Bacon, Sebastian CJ; Bates, Christopher; Hickman, George; Ward, Tom; Morley, Jessica; Cockburn, Jonathan; Davy, Simon; Schultze, Anna; Williamson, Elizabeth J; McDonald, Helen I; Tomlinson, Laurie; Mathur, Rohini; Eggo, Rosalind M; Wing, Kevin; Wong, Angel YS; Forbes, Harriet; Tazare, John; Parry, John; Hester, Frank; Harper, Sam; O039, Shaun; Hanlon,; Eavis, Alex; Jarvis, Richard; Avramov, Dima; Griffiths, Paul; Fowles, Aaron; Parkes, Nasreen; Evans, Stephen JW; Douglas, Ian J; Smeeth, Liam; Goldacre, Ben",,511,1

In this paper, we considered a Bayesian inference and failure mode and effects analysis of the modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with an exponentially distributed infectious period. We estimated the effective reproduction number based on laboratory-confirmed cases and death data using Bayesian inference and analyse the impact of the community spread of COVID-19 across the United Kingdom. We used the failure mode and effects analysis tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the action measures taken to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. We focused on COVID-19 infections and therefore the failure mode is taken as positive cases. The model is applied to COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of interventions adopted to control the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of COVID-19. Results have shown that the combination of Bayesian inference, compartmental modelling and failure mode and effects analysis is effective in modelling and studying the risks of COVID-19 transmissions, leading to the quantitative evaluation of the action measures and the identification of the lessons learned from the governmental measures and actions taken in response to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.

Among a clinical laboratory that has been conducting routine workforce screening since the beginning of the pandemic, we aimed to assess the relative risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 naive, previously infected, or vaccinated. MethodsUsing an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX). ResultsWe identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0, and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 1 had an incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3). Group 2 had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). Group 3 had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). The IRR of reinfection among those with previous infection compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.19). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to SARS-CoV-2 naive was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.16). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to prior SARS-CoV-2 was 0 (95% CI: 0-4.98). ConclusionPrevious SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with decreased risk for infection or re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a routinely screened workforce. The was no difference in the infection incidence between vaccinated individuals and individuals with previous infection. Further research is needed to determine whether our results are consistent with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Kojima, Noah; Roshani, Arash; Brobeck, Matthew; Baca, Arthur; Klausner, Jeffrey D",,511,24

Although several studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in the general population, data in CLD patients and liver transplant recipients are lacking. Two COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority and rolled out to several million recipients in Saudi Arabia. These vaccines are mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and adenovirus-based AZD1222 from Oxford/AstraZeneca from three manufacturing sites (EU Nodes, Serum Institute of India, and South Korea Bio). The Saudi Association for the Study of Liver diseases and Transplantation (SASLT) has reviewed the available evidence and issued interim recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in CLD and liver transplant recipients. Since there is no evidence contradicting the safety and immunogenicity of the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in patients with CLD and hepatobiliary cancer and liver transplant recipients, the SASLT recommends vaccination in those patient populations. CLD and hepatobiliary cancer patients and liver transplant recipients should be prioritized depending on the risk factors for severe COVID-19. In transplant recipients, the optimal timing of vaccination remains unknown; however, immunization is recommended after the initial immunosuppression phase. Patients with CLD and liver transplant candidates or recipients should be closely monitored after COVID-19 vaccination. These patient populations should be included in future clinical trials to provide further evidence on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","Alqahtani, Saleh A; Barry, Mazin; Memish, Ziad; Hashim, Almoutaz; Alfares, Mona A; Alghamdi, Saad A; Al-Hamoudi, Waleed K; Al-Judaibi, Bandar; Alhazzani, Waleed; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Abaalkhail, Faisal",Saudi j. gastroenterol.

Approach: To organize the emergency responses, the government of Taizhou established on 23 January 2020 novel headquarters for prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak, by coordinating different governmental agencies. People at high risk of acquiring COVID-19, as well as probable and confirmed cases, were identified and quarantined. The government closed public venues and limited gatherings. The Taizhou Health Commission shared information about identified COVID-19 patients and probable cases with affected agencies. To timely track and manage close contacts of confirmed cases, Taizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention did epidemiological investigations. Medical institutions or local centers for disease control and prevention reported confirmed cases to the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Local setting: Taizhou, a city in Zhejiang province with about 6 million residents, reported 18 confirmed COVID-2019 cases by 23 January 2020, which ranked it third globally in number of cases after Wuhan and Xiaogan cities in the Hubei province. Relevant changes: In total, 146 confirmed cases (85 cases imported and 61 cases through community transmission) and no deaths due to COVID-19 had been reported in Taizhou by 1 June 2020. Between 16 February and 1 June 2020, no confirmed case had been reported. Lesson learnt: Identifying and managing imported cases and people at risk for infection, timely information sharing, limiting gatherings and ensuring collaborations between different agencies were important in controlling COVID-19.","Lin, Haijiang; Guo, Congcong; Hu, Yafei; Liang, Hongbiao; Shen, Weiwei; Mao, Wenhui; He, Na",Bull World Health Organ,511,0

Apart from respiratory manifestations, neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, especially the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases (CVD), has been intensively investigated. In this review, the effects of COVID-19 infection on CVD were summarized as follows: (I) angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the attack on vascular endothelial cells by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading to endothelial damage and increased subintimal inflammation, which are followed by hemorrhage or thrombosis; (II) SARS-CoV-2 could alter the expression/activity of ACE2, consequently resulting in the disruption of renin-angiotensin system which is associated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis; (III) upregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps has been detected in COVID-19 patients, which is closely associated with immunothrombosis; (IV) the inflammatory cascade induced by SARS-CoV-2 often leads to hypercoagulability and promotes the formation and progress of atherosclerosis; (V) antiphospholipid antibodies are also detected in plasma of some severe cases, which aggravate the thrombosis through the formation of immune complexes; (VI) hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients may trigger CVD by increasing oxidative stress and blood viscosity; (VII) the COVID-19 outbreak is a global emergency and causes psychological stress, which could be a potential risk factor of CVD as coagulation, and fibrinolysis may be affected. In this review, we aimed to further our understanding of CVD-associated COVID-19 infection, which could improve the therapeutic outcomes of patients.

However, limited data are available from countries with less COVID-19 burden focusing on concurrent stroke and ACS hospitalisation rates from the same population. METHODS: The study was conducted in three geographically and demographically representative COVID-19 referral university hospitals in Greece. We recorded the rate of stroke and ACS hospital admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 and compared them with the rates of the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: We found a greater relative reduction of stroke admissions (51% [35 vs 71]; incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.49, p=0.001) compared with ACS admissions (27% [123 vs 168]; IRR: 0.73, p=0.009) during the COVID-19 outbreak (p=0.097). Fewer older (>65 years) patients (Stroke: 34.3 vs 45.1%, OR: 0.64, p=0.291; ACS: 39.8 vs 54.2%, OR: 0.56, p=0.016) were admitted during the COVID-19 compared with the control period. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalisation rates both for stroke and ACS were reduced during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social distancing measures, low COVID-19 incidence and low population mortality. Lack of triggers for stroke and ACS during social distancing/quarantining may explain these observations. However, medical care avoidance attitudes among cerbro/cardiovascular patients should be dissipated amidst the rising second COVID-19 wave.","Katsouras, Christos; Karapanayiotides, Theodoros; Papafaklis, Michail; Giannopoulos, Sotirios; Ziakas, Antonios; Sianos, George; Papagiannopoulou, Georgia; Koutroulou, Ioanna; Varytimiadi, Eythimia; Kosmidou, Maria; Naka, Katerina; Michalis, Lampros K; Tsivgoulis, Georgios",Eur. j. neurol,511,16

Transmission of the etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, from mother to infant has been suspected but has been difficult to confirm. This communication summarizes the spectrum of pathology findings from pregnant women with COVID-19 based upon the infection status of their infants and addresses the potential interpretation of these results in terms of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta and the pathophysiology of maternal-fetal infection. Placentas from pregnant women with COVID-19 and uninfected neonates show significant variability in the spectrum of pathology findings. In contrast, placentas from infected maternal-neonatal dyads are characterized by the finding of mononuclear cell inflammation of the intervillous space, termed chronic histiocytic intervillositis, together with syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. These placentas show prominent positivity of syncytiotrophoblast by SARS-CoV-2, fulfilling the published criteria for transplacental viral transmission as confirmed in fetal cells through identification of viral antigens by immunohistochemistry or viral nucleic acid using RNA in situ hybridization. The co-occurrence of chronic histiocytic intervillositis and trophoblast necrosis appears to be a risk factor for placental infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as for maternal-fetal viral transmission, and suggests a potential mechanism by which the coronavirus can breach the maternal-fetal interface.","Schwartz, David A; Morotti, Denise",Viruses,511,32

The key to an efficient air quality management plan is strict compliance of the TPPs with emission norms. Yet, in-situ measurements are lacking, and the bottom-up emission inventory is not periodically updated in India. Here we adopt a top-down approach to estimate NO2 emission from nine TPPs within 300 km of the megacity Delhi using TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) data. We first estimate the NO2 lifetime for each TPP using an e-folding decay length along the wind direction and combine it with the NO2 columnar molecular density to estimate the NO2 emission. Our estimates show a correlation coefficient of 0.88, and a root mean square error of 4.15 kt/year with the ECLIPSE V5 bottom-up inventory. NO2 emission in these TPPs varied in the range of 8.0–30.6 kt/year with considerable seasonal variability. Using this data, we report a decrease in NO2 emission in the range 41%–290% during the COVID-19 lockdown period relative to the same period in the previous year. As India launched the National Clean Air Program to control air pollution, our method would be highly useful in tracking the emission compliance of the TPPs across the country. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Saw, G.

This study evaluated anxiety symptom severity and associations with appetitive traits in students at a large public University in the U.S. during the pandemic. METHODS: Current undergraduate and graduate/professional students completed a cross-sectional survey in fall 2020. Demographic information, anxiety symptoms in the past 2 weeks assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and appetitive traits assessed by the Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire (AEBQ) were evaluated. Mean scores for eight AEBQ scales (four food approach and four food avoidance traits) were calculated. Differences in mean scores were examined between participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score &#8805; 10) and those with mild to no anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score < 10) via independent samples t-tests and effect sizes. Associations between GAD-7 score and individual appetitive traits were also examined, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: Of the 1243 students who completed the survey (57% undergraduates; mean age = 26.5 years), 51.9% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Groups experiencing the highest degree of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms included transgender, gender fluid, and other-gendered participants (73.6%); the youngest age group [18-20 years (62%)]; undergraduate students (60.7%); and Hispanic/Latinx participants (57.7%). Participants with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms had higher scores for most food approach and avoidance traits but lower scores for enjoyment of food than those with mild to no anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were largest for hunger and emotional over-eating (Cohen's d = 0.31 and 0.30, respectively). Adjusting for age and gender, GAD-7 score was significantly and positively associated with hunger, emotional over-eating, food and satiety responsiveness, and food fussiness and negatively associated with enjoyment of food. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of students at a U.S. University reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms during COVID-19. More severe anxiety symptoms were associated with increased hunger, emotional over-eating, and food and satiety responsiveness and decreased enjoyment of food. Universities must consider strategies to address anxiety, particularly in younger students; transgender, gender fluid, and students of other genders; and across race/ethnicities keeping in mind associations with appetitive traits.","Coakley, Kathryn E; Le, Huyen; Silva, Spirit Rae; Wilks, Aspen",Nutr J,511,21

Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV. RESULTS: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66% male. In-hospital mortality was 6% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8% (6/47), and 18% (5/28) for those requiring IMV.

METHODS: Observational cohort study of hospital workers who received their first SARS-CoV2 mRNA vaccination between December 14, 2020 and January 8, 2021, including cases reporting onset of an injection site reaction > 48 hours after administration of their first or second dose to an employee hotline. RESULTS: Thirteen female employees, who received mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV2 vaccine (Moderna) during the first three weeks of SARS-CoV2 vaccine rollout at San Francisco General Hospital, reported a pruritic rash at the injection site appearing 3-9 days after receiving their initial dose. Five had milder or similar reactions with earlier onset after the second dose. One additional female employee reported this delayed reaction only after the second dose. None of these 14 employees reported serious adverse events, such as anaphylaxis, or had symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention. These cases represented 1.1% of the 1,275 female employees who received their first mRNA-1273 dose, and 2.0% of the 557 who were 31-45 years old, during this initial vaccine rollout. None of 675 males initiating mRNA-1273 or 3,612 employees of either sex initiating BNT162b (Pfizer) vaccination during this period reported this delayed onset reaction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that delayed-onset, injection-site pruritic rashes after mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV2 vaccine administration, lasting up to a week, occur commonly in females, do not lead to serious sequela, and should not deter receipt of the second vaccine dose.","Jacobson, Mark A; Zakaria, Adam; Maung, Zaw; Hart, Colin; McCalmont, Tim; Fassett, Marlys; Amerson, Erin",Clin. infect. dis,511,4

Objective: To study skeletal muscle and myocardial inflammation in patients with COVID-19 who had died. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control autopsy series was conducted in a university hospital as a multidisciplinary postmortem investigation. Patients with COVID-19 or other critical illnesses who had died between March 2020 and February 2021 and on whom an autopsy was performed were included. Individuals for whom informed consent to autopsy was available and the postmortem interval was less than 6 days were randomly selected. Individuals who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 per polymerase chain reaction test results and had clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 were compared with individuals with negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test results and an absence of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inflammation of skeletal muscle tissue was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates, expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigens on the sarcolemma, and a blinded evaluation on a visual analog scale ranging from absence of pathology to the most pronounced pathology. Inflammation of cardiac muscles was assessed by quantification of immune cell infiltrates. Results: Forty-three patients with COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 72 [16] years; 31 men [72%]) and 11 patients with diseases other than COVID-19 (median [interquartile range] age, 71 [5] years; 7 men [64%]) were included. Skeletal muscle samples from the patients who died with COVID-19 showed a higher overall pathology score (mean [SD], 3.4 [1.8] vs 1.5 [1.0]; 95% CI, 0-3; P < .001) and a higher inflammation score (mean [SD], 3.5 [2.1] vs 1.0 [0.6]; 95% CI, 0-4; P < .001). Relevant expression of MHC class I antigens on the sarcolemma was present in 23 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (55%) and upregulation of MHC class II antigens in 7 of 42 specimens from patients with COVID-19 (17%), but neither were found in any of the controls. Increased numbers of natural killer cells (median [interquartile range], 8 [8] vs 3 [4] cells per 10 high-power fields; 95% CI, 1-10 cells per 10 high-power fields; P < .001) were found. Skeletal muscles showed more inflammatory features than cardiac muscles, and inflammation was most pronounced in patients with COVID-19 with chronic courses. In some muscle specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but no evidence for a direct viral infection of myofibers was found by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study of patients who had died with and without COVID-19, most individuals with severe COVID-19 showed signs of myositis ranging from mild to severe. Inflammation of skeletal muscles was associated with the duration of illness and was more pronounced than cardiac inflammation. Detection of viral load was low or negative in most skeletal and cardiac muscles and probably attributable to circulating viral RNA rather than genuine infection of myocytes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a postinfectious, immune-mediated myopathy.","Aschman, Tom; Schneider, Julia; Greuel, Selina; Meinhardt, Jenny; Streit, Simon; Goebel, Hans-Hilmar; Büttnerova, Ivana; Elezkurtaj, Sefer; Scheibe, Franziska; Radke, Josefine; Meisel, Christian; Drosten, Christian; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L; Corman, Victor Max; Stenzel, Werner",JAMA neurol.

It is based on interviews of a convenience sample of 52 home care social workers from 11 different home health agencies in New York City between April 1 and September 30, 2020. Seven major themes emerged, 6 of which were identical to the themes identified by the nurses. The only new theme was limits on the ability to provide psychosocial interventions had more severe consequences. The 7 themes were: need for social service supports increased;loneliness and depression increased among patients;physical and mental health conditions became exacerbated;substance use and abuse increased;evidence of domestic violence against patients increased;there was limited staff and equipment to care for patients;and limits on the ability to provide psychosocial interventions had more severe consequences.

Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the pandemic in Québec by measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence in a convenience sample of healthy blood donors and to study the association between seropositivity and the occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: The study design was a cross-sectional serological survey with a nested case-control study. Residual blood samples from donations collected between May 25 and July 9, 2020 (well before vaccination rollout) in the province of Québec were tested for anti-Spike RBD antibodies by ELISA. Seropositive donors and a control group of seronegative donors were questioned about prior COVID-19 symptoms. All qualified blood donors were eligible for participation. RESULTS: A total of 7691 blood donors were included in the study. After adjustments, the seroprevalence rate was 2.2% (95% CI 1.9-2.6). Seropositive donors reported one or more symptoms in a proportion of 52.2% (95% CI 44.2-60.1); this proportion was 19.1% (95% CI 13.4-26.1) among seronegative donors, suggesting that approximately 50-66% of all infections were asymptomatic. Univariate analysis of associations between symptoms and seropositivity revealed that except for rhinorrhea, all symptoms were significantly associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSION: Assuming that blood donors are fairly representative of the general adult population, this study shows that less than 3% of 18-69-year-olds have been infected during the first wave of the pandemic in the province of Québec. Our data also confirm that many infections escaped detection, including a substantial proportion that were asymptomatic.","Lewin, Antoine; Therrien, Roseline; De Serres, Gaston; Grégoire, Yves; Perreault, Josée; Drouin, Mathieu; Fournier, Marie-Josée; Tremblay, Tony; Beaudoin, Julie; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Prévost, Jérémie; Gendron-Lepage, Gabrielle; Finzi, Andrés; Bernier, France; Bazin, Renée; Germain, Marc; Delage, Gilles",Can. j. public health,511,1

In the pandemic scenario the research on the rapid development of new drug molecules is highly risky and tedious process. The current COVID-19 emergency demands an urgent development of possible strategies to protect people at high risk of infection and hence the drug repurposing became an emerging approach to fight COVID-19. This review summarizes an update on various therapeutic strategies with special attention on repurposing of drugs to fight against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. The investigation of existing drugs for new therapeutic purposes is one line of scientific research followed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments. Broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) that have been believed to be safe through testing on early phase clinical trials have been hyped as good drug repurposing candidates. Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs such as Ribavirin, Umifenovir were advised for COVID-19 treatment. Some antibiotics may be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments such as teicoplanin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, monensin and azithromycin. Ivermectin an antiparasitic is recently repurposed. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, having immunomodulating effect on humans, have been shown to have antiviral activity at starting and post-entry stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a need for global health emergency to call for a courageous, global response at the political and governmental levels. Therefore, the regulatory agencies must act swiftly to lessen any financial obstacles involving private companies and update guidelines for drug licenses by repurposing if necessary.","Katakam, Prakash; Adiki, Shanta K.; Assaleh, Fathi H.; Ahmed, Mohammed M.",Indo Global J.

The precise impact of COVID-19 scare and lockdown on emergency access for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still subject to debate. METHODS: Data on all patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography at 9 hospitals in the greater area of Rome, Italy, between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, 9, 2020, were retrospectively collected. Incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), as well as corresponding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), was compared distinguishing two different 20-day time periods (before vs on or after March 10, 2020). RESULTS: During the study period, 1,068 patients underwent coronary angiography, 142 (13%) with STEMI and 169 (16%) with NSTEMI. The average daily number of STEMI decreased from 4.3 before the lockdown to 2.9 after the lockdown (p=0.021). Similarly, the average daily number of NSTEMI changed from 5.0 to 3.5 (p=0.028). The average daily number of primary PCI changed from 4.2 to 2.9 (p=0.030), while the average daily number of PCI for NSTEMI changed from 3.5 to 2.5 (p=0.087). For STEMI patients, the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (onset-to-door time less than three hours) showed a significant increase after the lockdown (p=0.018), whereas door-to-balloon time did not change significantly from before to after the lockdown (p=0.609). CONCLUSIONS: The present study, originally reporting on the trends in STEMI and NSTEMI in the Rome area, highlights that significant decreases in the incidence of both acute coronary syndromes occurred between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, together with increases in time from symptom onset to hospital arrival, luckily without changes in door-to-balloon time.","Gaspardone, Achille; Versaci, Francesco; Tomai, Fabrizio; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Sgueglia, Gregory A; Gioffré, Gaetano; Romagnoli, Enrico; Mancone, Massimo; Calcagno, Simone; Proietti, Igino; Sciahbasi, Alessandro; DI Pietro, Riccardo; Tanzilli, Gaetano; Mariano, Enrica; Romeo, Francesco",,511,1

We recognized at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that students, staff and faculty may require mental health support, particularly with the challenges of isolation and loneliness. In response, our team transitioned from an in-person to a novel online format at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed online content for participants to (1) connect with therapy dogs and experience feelings of love, comfort and support as occurred in in-person programming, and (2) learn about pandemic-specific, evidence-informed mental health knowledge. Our unique approach highlighted what dogs can teach humans about health through their own care and daily activities. From April to June 2020, we developed a website, created 28 Facebook livestreams and 60 pre-recorded videos which featured therapy dogs and handlers, and cross-promoted on various social media platforms. Over three months, first a combined process-outcome evaluation helped us determine whether our activities contributed to the program's goals. A subsequent needs assessment allowed us to elicit participant preferences for the program moving forward. This commentary reflects on these findings and our teams' collective experiences to share our key lessons learned related to program personnel needs, therapy dog handler training and support requirements, and online programming prerequisites. This combined understanding is informing our current activities with the virtual program and should be of interest to other therapy dog programs transitioning online.","Dell, Colleen; Williamson, Linzi; McKenzie, Holly; Carey, Ben; Cruz, Maria; Gibson, Maryellen; Pavelich, Alexandria",,511,20

Therefore, it is worth considering the use of currently available drugs to protect COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We review the current experience of conventional cardiovascular drugs [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anticoagulants, acetosalicylic acid, antiarrhythmic drugs, statins] as well as some other drug classes (antidiabetic drugs, vitamin D and NSAIDs) frequently used by older patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data were sought from clinical databases for COVID-19 and appropriate key words. Conclusions and recommendations are based on a consensus among all authors. RESULTS: Several cardiovascular drugs have a potential to protect patients with COVID-19, although evidence is largely based on retrospective, observational studies. Despite propensity score adjustments used in many analyses observational studies are not equivalent to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Ongoing RCTs include treatment with antithrombotics, pulmonary vasodilators, RAAS-related drugs, and colchicine. RCTs in the acute phase of COVID-19 may not, however, recognise the benefits of long term anti-atherogenic therapies, such as statins. CONCLUSIONS: Most current cardiovascular drugs can be safely continued during COVID-19. Some drug classes may even be protective. Age-specific data are scarce, though, and conditions which are common in older patients (frailty, comorbidities, polypharmacy) must be individually considered for each drug group.","Alves, Mariana; Fernandes, Marília Andreia; Bahat, Gülistan; Benetos, Athanase; Clemente, Hugo; Grodzicki, Tomasz; Martínez-Sellés, Manuel; Mattace-Raso, Francesco; Rajkumar, Chakravarthi; Ungar, Andrea; Werner, Nikos; Strandberg, Timo E",,511,14

Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19. Objective: To estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020. Design, Setting, and Population: This observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Increases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results: There were approximately 781â¯000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122â¯300 (95% prediction interval, 116â¯800-127â¯000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95â¯235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19-reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths. Conclusions and Relevance: Excess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus. The mortality burden and the completeness of the tallies vary markedly between states.","Weinberger, Daniel M; Chen, Jenny; Cohen, Ted; Crawford, Forrest W; Mostashari, Farzad; Olson, Don; Pitzer, Virginia E; Reich, Nicholas G; Russi, Marcus; Simonsen, Lone; Watkins, Anne; Viboud, Cecile",JAMA Intern Med,511,16

Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.","Hureau, Maxence; Versyck, Maaike; Fontainre, Sylvie; Lambiotte, Fabien; El Beki, Nabil; Saint Leger, Piehr",Anaesthesiol.

This article was committed to studying the influence of gynecological tumor treatment history compared to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was of great significance for the treatment of gynecological cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the diagnosis and treatment of six gynecological cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 30 to March 25, 2020. To better explain the treatment of gynecological cancer patients during the epidemic of COVID-19, we summarized the case characteristics, auxiliary examination, treatment plan, and outcome of these six patients. Results: We observed a high rate of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection among these six gynecological cancer patients, who were in a low immune state. Also, due to the influence of cancer treatment history, COVID-19-related atypical symptoms became the first symptom of COVID-19 in some cases, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis. Furthermore, in terms of treatment for these cases, immune boosters and reagents that raised white blood cells were applied, except for in symptomatic antiviral treatment. At present, all patients in this study were discharged from the hospital with a good prognosis. Conclusion: After cancer-related treatment, the gynecological cancer patients became more susceptible to COVID-19. Besides, the history of cancer treatment made the diagnosis of COVID-19 difficult, which also affected the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, we put forward the corresponding therapy suggestions for gynecological cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19.","Liu, Chen; Huang, Yuhan; Qin, Tianyu; Guo, Ensong; Wu, Peng; Sun, Chaoyang; Chen, Gang",Front.

We assessed the diagnostic performance of CXR in consecutive patients presenting at the emergency room at the Policlinico San Donato, Milan, Italy from February 24 to April 8, 2020 for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results of CXR were classified as positive or negative according to the original prospective radiologic reports. To overcome the limitations of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab, especially oscillating sensitivity, we added the information obtained from phone calls to discharged patients with negative initial RT-PCR. Thus, we included 535 patients with concomitant CXR and RT-PCR on admission (aged 65±17 y; 340 males, 195 females), resulting in 408 RT-PCR positive and 127 negative patients at the composite reference standard. Original CXR reports showed an 89.0% sensitivity (95% confidence intervals [CI], 85.5%-91.8%), 60.6% specificity (95% CI, 51.6%-69.2%), 87.9% positive predictive value (95% CI, 84.4%-90.9%), and 63.1% negative predictive value (95% CI, 53.9%-71.7%). The adoption of CXR alongside RT-PCR to triage patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection could foster a safe and efficient workflow, counteracting possible false negative RT-PCR results.","Schiaffino, Simone; Tritella, Stefania; Cozzi, Andrea; Carriero, Serena; Blandi, Lorenzo; Ferraris, Laurenzia; Sardanelli, Francesco",J Thorac Imaging,511,21

Here we report on a beneficial impact of a passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma to treat a prolonged, active COVID-19 infection in a patient with a history of nasopharyngeal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with the therapy inducing substantial impairment of particularly humoral arm of immune system. The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune exhaustion of monocytes.

DESIGN: Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE distributed to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use and disposed of via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of environmental mitigation strategies: (1) eliminating international travel during supply; (2) eliminating glove use; (3) reusing gowns and face shields; and (4) maximal recycling. SETTING: Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The carbon footprint of PPE distributed during the study period totalled 106,478 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 239 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.47 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion was costed at US $12.7m (GBP £9.3m). Scenario modelling indicated UK manufacture would have reduced the carbon footprint by 12%, eliminating gloves by 45%, reusing gowns and gloves by 10% and maximal recycling by 35%. RESULTS: A combination of strategies may have reduced the carbon footprint by 75% compared with the base scenario, and saved an estimated 183 DALYS, 0.34 species.year and US $7.4m (GBP £5.4m) due to resource depletion. CONCLUSION: The environmental impact of PPE is large and could be reduced through domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible and optimising waste management.","Rizan, Chantelle; Reed, Malcolm; Bhutta, Mahmood F",J R Soc Med,511,1

Radical excision of these retroperitoneal liposarcomas is often challenging due to their large size and proximity to visceral organs and major vessels. Here we present the 30-year experience of our multidisciplinary sarcoma team in the treatment of these tumors and analysis of factors influencing survival. METHODS: Patients with retroperitoneal liposarcomas treated in Helsinki University Hospital from 1987 to 2017 were reviewed. Local recurrence-free survival, metastases-free survival, and disease-specific survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and factors influencing survival were evaluated with Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were identified. The median follow-up time was 5.4 years (interquartile range: 2.2-8.8 years). Local recurrence developed in 72% and metastases in 15% during follow-up. The 5-year disease-free survival was 31% and disease-specific survival was 66%. The multifactorial analysis revealed histological type and grade as predictors of disease-specific survival (P < .01) while multifocality carried a poor prognosis for local recurrence (P = .02) and higher histological grade for metastases (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Retroperitoneal liposarcomas rarely metastasize but tend to recur locally. For tumors that have been resected with macroscopically clear margins, histological, type, and grade are significant predictors of survival.","Homsy, Pauliina; Heiskanen, Ilkka; Sampo, Mika; Rönty, Mikko; Tukiainen, Erkki; Blomqvist, Carl",J. surg. oncol,511,16

Methods: We did a review of government documents and literature on air quality standards. We extracted and summarized the PM2.5 concentration limits effective before July 2020, noting whether standards were enforced, voluntary or target. We compared averaging methods and permitted periods of time that standards may be exceeded. We made a descriptive analysis of PM2.5 standards by population, total area and population density of jurisdictions. We also compared data on actual PM2.5 air quality against the standards. Findings: We obtained data on standards from 62 jurisdictions worldwide, including 58 countries. Of the world's 136.06 million km2 land under national jurisdictions, 71.70 million km2 (52.7%) lack an official PM2.5 air quality standard, and 3.17 billion people live in areas without a standard. The existing standards ranged from 8 to 75 µg/m3, mostly higher than the World Health Organization guideline annual limit of < 10 µg/m3. The weakest PM2.5 standards were often exceeded, while the more stringent standards were often met. Several jurisdictions with the highest population density demonstrated compliance with relatively stringent standards. Conclusion: The metrics used in PM2.5 ambient air quality standards should be harmonized worldwide to facilitate accurate assessment of risks associated with PM2.5 exposure. Population density alone does not preclude stringent PM2.5 standards.

One aspect was the cancellation of in-person scientific conferences and the rapid replacement of some into virtual conferences. The aim of this study is to highlight the opportunities that virtual conferences can bring to animal behaviour and welfare research, with a focus on regional diversity and early career researchers (ECRs). The ISAE 2020 virtual meeting was used as a case study. Firstly, conference attendance was compared to the ISAE 2019 in-person international congress. Secondly, a post-conference survey was conducted (n = 142 responses). Data were analysed quantitatively (multinomial models) and qualitatively (word classifications). The organisation by geographical region attracted many non-local attendees and positive feedback was received on the global perspective. The participation from the ISAE developing regions AFRICA (Africa/Central Asia/Middle East), ASIA (South/East/Southeast Asia) and LATAM (Latin America) was higher as compared to the in-person conference (p &lt; 0.001). The most valued advantage for the virtual conference was the reduced cost, followed by the increased ability to participate and the reduced environmental footprint. The most valued advantages did not differ between regions or attendees of different career stages, but an interaction showed that the ability to participate was more appreciated by ECRs in developing regions (p &lt; 0.05). Over 75 % of the respondents ranked the absence of social interaction as the most important disadvantage. Respondents from developed regions were more likely to attend a future virtual conference with a registration fee as compared to those from developing regions (p &lt; 0.05). Respondents most enjoyed the organisation, flexibility, quality of presentations and regional diversity from their virtual experience. This study showed that within applied animal behaviour and welfare science, the virtual format of an international conference can promote participation from diverse regions, especially from less financially privileged groups, but attention should be paid to enhance the social element of a virtual conference.","Chou, Jen-Yun Camerlink Irene",Applied Animal Behaviour Science,511,21
523750,523750,523750,ANMCO POSITION PAPER: The cardiological clinical activities in the transition phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,18.053488,5.986346,2020,"A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions, RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false negatives are reported. Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 h with most of the time involved in RNA extraction from swab samples. We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1 and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid-phase hybridization of fluorescently-labeled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 min. We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR. Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity we were able to identify a false-negative sample. CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows the reduction of both the amount of false-negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 h.","Damin, Francesco; Galbiati, Silvia; Gagliardi, Stella; Cereda, Cristina; Dragoni, Francesca; Fenizia, Claudio; Savasi, Valeria; Sola, Laura; Chiari, Marcella",Sensors (Basel),511,5

METHODS: This single-centre, observational, cross-sectional study included 211 patients with COVID-19 admitted to non-ICU departments who underwent a single transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with poor acoustic window (n=11) were excluded. Clinical, imaging, laboratory and TTE findings were compared in patients with versus without PH (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg) and with versus without RVD (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm or S wave <9.5 cm/s). The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis (median age 62 (IQR 52-74) years, 65.5% men). The prevalence of PH and RVD was 12.0% (24/200) and 14.5% (29/200), respectively. Patients with PH were older and had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and signs of more severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (radiological lung involvement, laboratory findings and oxygenation status) compared with those without PH. Conversely, patients with RVD had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities but no evidence of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without RVD. The presence of PH was associated with a higher rate of in-hospital death or ICU admission (41.7 vs 8.5%, p<0.001), while the presence of RVD was not (17.2 vs 11.7%, p=0.404). CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised non-ICU patients with COVID-19, PH (and not RVD) was associated with signs of more severe COVID-19 and with worse in-hospital clinical outcome.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional design. SETTING: Nurse from one referral and four general hospitals. These were reception centres and cared for patients with COVID-19 in central Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: 395 nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Burnout scores. RESULTS: Of the total 395 participants, 65.1% (n=257) were female; 40% (n=158) had a diploma; 47.1% (n=186) were single; and 39.2% (n=155) had worked for 11–15 years. The results show that 40% (n=158), 41.77% (n=165) and 18.23% (n=77) reported high, average and low levels of burnout, respectively. The results show that the predictors of nurses’ burnout were personal protective equipment (PPE) (OR: 7.1, 95% CI 4.08 to 12.31) and increased workload (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.43 to 7.93). CONCLUSION: This study of nurses working in hospitals dealing with patients with COVID-19 in central Uganda reported high rates of burnout, and it was associated with PPE and workload. Interventions like contracting new nurses to reduce workload, the WHO guidelines on PPE, adjusting working hours and ensuring hours of effective rest should be adapted.","Kabunga, Amir; Okalo, Ponsiano",BMJ Open,511,20

It has to date affected 24,240,000 individuals and killed 2,735,805 people worldwide. The highly infectious virus attacks mainly the lung, causing fever, cough, and fatigue in symptomatic patients, but also pneumonia in severe cases. However, growing evidence highlights SARS-CoV-2-mediated extrarespiratory manifestations, namely, gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic complications. The detection of 1) the virus in the GI system (duodenum, colon, rectum, anal region, and feces); 2) the high expression of additional candidate coreceptors/auxiliary proteins to facilitate the virus entry; 3) the abundant viral angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor; 4) the substantial expression of host transmembrane serine protease 2, necessary to induce virus-cell fusion; 5) the viral replication in the intestinal epithelial cells; and 6) the primarily GI disorders in the absence of respiratory symptoms lead to increased awareness of the risk of disease transmission via the fecal-oral route. The objectives of this review are to provide a brief update of COVID-19 pathogenesis and prevalence, present a critical overview of its GI and liver complications that affect clinical COVID-19 outcomes, clarify associated mechanisms (notably microbiota-related), define whether gut/liver disorders occur more frequently among critically ill patients with COVID-19, determine the impact of COVID-19 on preexisting gut/liver complications and vice versa, and discuss the available strategies for prevention and treatment to improve prognosis of the patients. The novel SARS-CoV-2 can cause gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary manifestations. Metagenomics studies of virobiota in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to highlight the contribution of bacterial microflora to COVID-19 phenotype, which is crucial for developing biomarkers and therapeutics.","Levy, Emile; Stintzi, Alain; Cohen, Albert; Desjardins, Yves; Marette, André; Spahis, Schohraya",Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,511,26

Age-independent, sex-biased differences in susceptibility to severe COVID-19 may be ascribable to deficits in a sexually dimorphic protective attribute that we termed immunologic resilience (IR). Objective To examine whether deficits in IR that antedate or are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection independently predict COVID-19 mortality. Methods IR levels were quantified with two novel metrics: immune health grades (IHG-I [best] to IHG-IV) to gauge CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell count equilibrium, and blood gene expression signatures. IR metrics were examined in a prospective COVID-19 cohort (n=522); primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Associations of IR metrics with outcomes in non-COVID-19 cohorts (n=13,461) provided the framework for linking pre-COVID-19 IR status to IR during COVID-19, as well as to clinical outcomes. Results IHG-I, tracking high-grade equilibrium between CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell counts, was the most common grade (73%) among healthy adults, particularly in females. SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with underrepresentation of IHG-I (21%) vs. overrepresentation (77%) of IHG-II or IHG-IV, especially in males vs. females (P<0.01). Presentation with IHG-I associated with 88% lower mortality, after controlling for age and sex; reduced risk of hospitalization and respiratory failure; lower plasma IL-6 levels; rapid clearance of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 burden; and gene expression signatures correlating with survival that signify immunocompetence and controlled inflammation. In non-COVID-19 cohorts, IR-preserving metrics associated with resistance to progressive influenza or HIV infection, as well as lower 9-year mortality in the Framingham Heart Study, especially in females. Conclusion Preservation of immunocompetence with controlled inflammation during antigenic challenges is a hallmark of IR and associates with longevity and AIDS resistance. Independent of age, a male-biased proclivity to degrade IR before and/or during SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to severe COVID-19. Clinical implications Biomarkers tracking immunologic resilience may have broad prognostic utility, as they associated with longevity, as well as resistance to a progressive disease course during SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or HIV infection.","Lee, Grace C.; Restrepo, Marcos I.; Harper, Nathan; Manoharan, Muthu Saravanan; Smith, Alisha M.; Meunier, Justin A.; Sanchez-Reilly, Sandra; Ehsan, Aamir; Branum, Anne P.; Winter, Caitlyn; Winter, Lauryn; Jimenez, Fabio; Pandranki, Lavanya; Carrillo, Andrew; Perez, Graciela L.; Anzueto, Antonio; Trinh, Hanh; Lee, Monica; Hecht, Joan M.; Martinez, Celida; Sehgal, Raj T.; Cadena, Jose; Walter, Elizabeth A.; Oakman, Kimberly; Benavides, Raymond; Pugh, Jacqueline A.; Letendre, Scott; Steri, Maristella; Orrù, Valeria; Fiorillo, Edoardo; Cucca, Francesco; Moreira, Alvaro G.; Zhang, Nu; Leadbetter, Elizabeth; Agan, Brian K.; Richman, Douglas D.; He, Weijing; Clark, Robert A.; Okulicz, Jason F.; Ahuja, Sunil K.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,511,16

METHODS: A narrative review based on a literature search regarding social media use, of studies and findings pertaining to surgical disciplines, and the authors’ own experience. RESULTS: Several social networking platforms for surgeons are presented to the reader. The more frequently used, i.e., Twitter, is presented with details of opportunities, specific fora for communication, presenting tips for effective use, and also some caveats to use. Details of how the surgical community evolved through the use of the hashtag #SoMe4Surgery are presented. The impact on gender diversity in surgery through important hashtags (from #ILookLikeASurgeon to #MedBikini) is discussed. Practical tips on generating tweets and use of visual abstracts are presented, with influence on post-production distribution of journal articles through “tweetorials” and “tweetchats.” Findings from seminal studies on SoMe and the impact on traditional metrics (regular citations) and alternative metrics (Altmetrics, including tweets, retweets, news outlet mentions) are presented. Some concerns on misuse and SoMe caveats are discussed. CONCLUSION: Over the last two decades, social media has had a huge impact on science dissemination, journal article discussions, and presentation of conference news. Immediate and real-time presentation of studies, articles, or presentations has flattened hierarchy for participation, debate, and engagement. Surgeons should learn how to use novel communication technology to advance the field and further professional and public interaction.","Grossman, Rebecca; Sgarbura, Olivia; Hallet, Julie; Søreide, Kjetil",Langenbecks Arch Surg,511,29

Recently, the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was released as the primary means to combat COVID-19. The currently reported incidence of local and systemic side effects was 27% in the general public. The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has not been studied in patients with an active cancer diagnosis who are either ongoing or plan to undergo oncologic therapy. Methods: This retrospective single center study reviewed the charts of 210 patients with active cancer diagnoses that received both doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The development of side effects from the vaccine, hospitalizations or exacerbations from various oncologic treatment were documented. Type of oncologic treatment (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal, biologic, radiation or mixed) was documented to identify if side effects were related to treatment type. The time at which the vaccine was administered in relation to treatment onset (on long term therapy, within one month of therapy or prior to therapy) was also documented to identify any relationships. Results: 65 (31%) participants experienced side effects from the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, however most were mild to moderate. Treatment protocol was not linked to the development of vaccine related side effects (p =.202), nor was immunotherapy, specifically, (p =.942). The timing of vaccine administered in relation to treatment onset was also not related to vaccine related side effects (p =.653). 6 (2.9%) participants were hospitalized and 4 (2%) died. Conclusions: The incidence of side effects in cancer patients is similar to what has been reported for the general public (31% vs 27%). Therefore, we believe that the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is safe in oncologic patients undergoing numerous cancer treatments. Legal entity responsible for the study: A. Yakobson.

The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein–protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I–converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)–solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to determine the transmission, severity, complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pregnancy. This review showed the influence of COVID-19 disease on the neonatal neurogenesis. Owing to no specific vaccines or medicines that were reported for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, this review suggested some control strategies like treatments (medicinal plants, antiviral therapy, cellular therapy, and immunotherapy), nutrition uptake, prevention, and recommendations. DISCUSSION: This overview showed in severely states that SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early stage of pregnancy might increase the risk of stress, panic, and anxiety. This disorder can disturb the maternal immune system, and thus causing a neurodevelopmental disturbance. This hypothesis may be depending on the severity and intensity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dams to their fetuses is absent until now. CONCLUSION: During this global pandemic disease, maintaining safety during pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and breastfeeding may play a vital role in a healthy life for the offspring.

Patients in the with-COVID-19 group were further divided into three 4-month-long subgroups (first-phase: March to June 2020; second-phase: July to October 2020; third-phase: November 2020 to February 2021), and the time delay of reperfusion therapy were compared between these subgroups. RESULTS Of 1,260 patients with AIS hospitalized in the study period, 265 patients were examined. Compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (133 patients; median age, 79 years), the with-COVID-19 group (132 patients; median age, 79 years) had a longer median door-to-imaging time (25 min vs. 27 min, P=0.04), and a longer door-to-groin puncture time (65 min vs. 72 min, P=0.02). In the three 4-month-long subgroups, the median door-to-needle time (49 min, 43 min, and 38 min, respectively; P=0.04) and door-to-groin puncture time (83 min, 70 min, and 61 min, P＜0.01, respectively) decreased significantly during the with-COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS The delay in reperfusion therapy increased during the with-COVID-19 period compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. However, the door-to-needle time and door-to-groin puncture time decreased as time elapsed during the with-COVID-19 period.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02251665.","Yoshimoto, Takeshi; Shiozawa, Masayuki; Koge, Junpei; Inoue, Manabu; Koga, Masatoshi; Ihara, Masafumi; Toyoda, Kazunori",Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis,511,15

Here, we introduce risk-based quarantine, a system for contact tracing where each cluster (a group of individuals with a common source of exposure) is observed for symptoms when tracing begins, and clusters that do not display them are released from quarantine. We show that, under our assumptions, risk-based quarantine reduces the amount of quarantine time served by more than 30%, while achieving a reduction in transmission similar to standard contact tracing policies where all contacts are quarantined for two weeks. We compare our proposed risk-based quarantine approach against test-driven release policies, which fail to achieve a comparable level of transmission reduction due to the inability of tests to detect exposed people who are not yet infectious but will eventually become so. Additionally, test-based release policies are expensive, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource environments, whereas the costs imposed by risk-based quarantine are primarily in terms of labor and organization.","Perrault, A.; Charpignon, M.-L.; Gruber, J.; Tambe, M.; Majumder, M.

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two other coronaviruses that caused disease epidemic breakouts in humans in the last 2 decades, namely, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19. Targeted therapies, including the use of antibodies to prevent virus entry, nucleotide analogues to prevent viral replication, and inhibitors of proteases to prevent virion formation, among others, are being tested for their clinical efficacy. Likewise, complete sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 and identification of its structural and non-structural proteins have enabled development of RNA-, DNA-, and peptide -based vaccines as well attenuated viral vaccines to instigate the host immune responses. The clinical impacts of the basic science discoveries are amply evident on the rapid pace of progress in developing specific anti-viral therapies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The progress emphasizes the merit of discovering the fundamental scientific elements, regardless of whether or not they have apparent or immediate clinical applications.","Marian, AJ",Cardiovasc Pathol,511,23

The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works related to the new pathogen have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is challenging. In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for investigating: (1) which tools and frameworks are mostly used for early scholarly communication; (2) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e. quasi-zero-day) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. Additionally, correlation coefficients are not inflated by indicators associated with zero values, which are quite common at very early stages after an article has been published. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Then, we define a method, i.e. the Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS), that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator. CIS shows promising results as a tool for selecting relevant papers even in a tight time-window. Our results foster the development of automated frameworks aimed at helping the scientific community in identifying relevant work even in case of limited literature and observation time.","Boetto, Erik; Fantini, Maria Pia; Gangemi, Aldo; Golinelli, Davide; Greco, Manfredi; Nuzzolese, Andrea Giovanni; Presutti, Valentina; Rallo, Flavia",Scientometrics,511,23

Previous work additionally indicated that higher intelligence might serve as a prerequisite for such beneficial effects of tests. Nevertheless, despite their long-term learning effects, tests were also found to be evaluated as more negative and to lead to more stress and anxiety compared to easier control tasks. Stress and anxiety, in turn, often yield detrimental effects on learning outcomes. Hence, we hypothesized that tests increase later learning outcomes but simultaneously also lead to more stress perceptions. Such increased stress was, in turn, hypothesized to reduce later learning outcomes (thus, stress might serve as a mediator of the beneficial effects of tests on learning). All these assumed effects should further be moderated by intelligence, insofar as that higher intelligence should increase beneficial effects of tests on learning, should decrease stress perceptions caused by tests, and should reduce detrimental effects of stress on learning outcomes. Higher intelligence was also assumed to be generally associated with higher learning. We conducted a laboratory study (N=89) to test these hypotheses: Participants underwent an intelligence screening, then worked on either a test or a re-reading control task, and reported their immediate stress perceptions. Later learning outcomes were assessed after 1week. The results supported all assumed main effects but none of the assumed interactions. Thus, participants using tests had higher long-term learning outcomes compared to participants using re-reading tasks. However, participants using tests also perceived more immediate stress compared to participants that only re-read the materials. These stress perceptions in turn diminished the beneficial effects of tests. Stress was also generally related to lower learning, whereas higher intelligence was linked to higher learning and also to lower stress. Hence, our findings again support the often assumed benefits of tests—even when simultaneously considering learners’ intelligence and and when considering the by tests caused stress perceptions. Notably, controlling for stress further increases these long-term learning benefits. We then discuss some limitations and boundaries of our work as well as ideas for future studies.","Wenzel, Kristin; Reinhard, Marc-André",Front Psychol,511,20

METHODS: This is an international multicenter observational study in 20 US and European hospitals. Patients suspected of COVID-19 were tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test and had an LUS examination. We identified three clinical phenotypes based on pre-existing chronic diseases (mixed phenotype), and on the presence (severe phenotype) or absence (mild phenotype) of signs and/or symptoms of respiratory failure at presentation. We defined the LUS likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia according to four different patterns: high (HighLUS), intermediate (IntLUS), alternative (AltLUS), and low (LowLUS) probability. The combination of patterns and phenotypes with RT-PCR results was described and analyzed. RESULTS: We studied 1462 patients, classified in mild (n = 400), severe (n = 727), and mixed (n = 335) phenotypes. HighLUS and IntLUS showed an overall sensitivity of 90.2% (95% CI 88.23–91.97%) in identifying patients with positive RT-PCR, with higher values in the mixed (94.7%) and severe phenotype (97.1%), and even higher in those patients with objective respiratory failure (99.3%). The HighLUS showed a specificity of 88.8% (CI 85.55–91.65%) that was higher in the mild phenotype (94.4%; CI 90.0–97.0%). At multivariate analysis, the HighLUS was a strong independent predictor of RT-PCR positivity (odds ratio 4.2, confidence interval 2.6–6.7, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combining LUS patterns of probability with clinical phenotypes at presentation can rapidly identify those patients with or without COVID-19 pneumonia at bedside. This approach could support and expedite patients’ management during a pandemic surge.

The impact of such changes in the workflow of AECs on throughput and other performance indicators is largely unknown, although a significant reduction in revenue stream is expected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation–based model was developed in the setting of a small to medium community-based single-specialty AEC to quantify the impact of COVID-19–related workflow changes on performance indicators and cost per case compared with the pre–COVID-19 baseline. RESULTS: In the simulation model, post–COVID-19 recommended workflow changes significantly impacted the operational and productivity metrics and, in turn, adversely affected financial metrics. Overall, there was a significant decrease in staff utilization and consequent increase in total facility time, waiting time for patients, and cost per case because of a bottleneck at the time of preprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing while practicing social distancing. Strategies to minimize this adverse impact on productivity were assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Pretesting and screening for COVID-19 as recommended by current guidelines will significantly impact the productivity and revenue stream of AECs. Urgent measures by payors are needed to adjust the facility reimbursement of endoscopy centers to ensure successful reopening and ramping up outpatient endoscopy services in these facilities already hit hard by the pandemic.","Das, Ananya",Gastrointest Endosc,511,21

Although the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on physical health are well-documented, the psychological impact is frequently overlooked. AIMS: The aim of this study was to gauge the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ENT specialists in Ireland. METHODS: A national, cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to ENT specialists during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (21(st) May 2020–21(st) June 2020). The questionnaire collected sociodemographic and COVID-19 related data. The GAD-7 was utilized to measure symptoms of clinically significant anxiety disorder. RESULTS: Thirty-eight ENT specialists (M/F:24/12, median age, 38.7 years (23–60 years)) completed the survey. About 34% (n = 13) of participants screened positive for an anxiety disorder, of which 2 (5%) had moderate symptoms. The majority of participants (n = 32, 84%) felt ENT specialists had increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other medical specialties. Additionally, 32% (n = 12) felt incapable of protecting themselves from infection. An encouraging proportion of ENT specialists (n = 22, 58%) were aware of psychological support available from national and institutional organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term psychological sequelae of COVID-19 will be felt as the physical burden eases. As we adjust to new normalities, ENT surgeons must be conscientious of the mental health issues that arise from the working environment. Sources of anxiety emanated from a lack of control over infection risk, increased vulnerability to COVID-19 relative to other specialties and the implications this has for ENT specialists and their families. Future interventions must focus on increasing awareness of the available psychological support services for our healthcare workers.","Crotty, Thomas J.; Corbett, Mel; Gary, Stephen; Davey, Matthew G.; Hughes, Joseph P.; Keogh, Ivan J.; Patil, Nash P.; Doherty, Eva",Ir J Med Sci,511,17

Design: Agent-based modeling on a simulated population of 100,000 based on a real-world US county. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. To test the robustness of these findings, simulations were performed under different estimates for single-dose efficacy and vaccine administration rates, and under the possibility that a vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread. Setting: population level simulation. Participants: 100,000 agents are included in the simulation, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts are established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions Interventions: we simulate standard Covid-19 vaccination, versus delayed-second-dose vaccination prioritizing first dose. Sensitivity analyses include first-dose vaccine efficacy of 70%, 80% and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread; and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed-second-dose only for those under 65 years of age. Main outcome measures: cumulative Covid-19 mortality over 180 days, cumulative infections and hospitalizations. Results: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100,000 for standard versus delayed second dose was 226 vs 179; 233 vs 207; and 235 vs 236; for 90%, 80% and 70% first-dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed-second-dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80%, and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% population per day, both under sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100,000. The delayed-second-dose for those under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. Conclusions: A delayed-second-dose vaccination strategy, at least for those under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.","Romero-Brufau, S.; Chopra, A.; Ryu, A.

The study was approved by an ethics committee. RESULTS: A total of 290 healthcare professionals responded to the survey. The mean overall quality of life score was 3.37 ± 0.97, general health = 3.66 ± 0.88, domains, i.e., physical = 11.67 ± 2.16, psychological = 13.08 ± 2.14, social = 13.22 ± 3.31 and environment = 12.38 ± 2.59. Respondents aged > 40 years, male gender, married status, being a physician and, having a work experience > 15 years and no extra working hours, had higher mean scores for several domains of Quality of life (QoL), overall QoL and general health (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The QWL among healthcare staff during COVID-19 pandemic was low. Demographic factors were mainly the determinants for a higher QWL while extra working hours was determinant of lower QWL. Despite the pandemic, no COVID-19 related variable affected the work life of healthcare staff.","Bilal Maqsood, Muhammad; Ashraful Islam, Md.; Zeb-un-Nisa; Abbas Naqvi, Atta; Al Qarni, Ali; Fuad Al-karasneh, Aseel; Iffat, Wajiha; Azizullah Ghori, Syed; Ather Ishaqui, Azfar; Hasan Aljaffan, Akram; Alghamdi, Saleh; Aref Albanghali, Mohammad; Jamal Mahrous, Ahmad; Shahid Iqbal, Muhammad; Hayat Khan, Amer; Haseeb, Abdul",Saudi Pharm J,511,21

DESIGN: A retrospective chart review. SETTING: A tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Ten patients with AIP who presented with idiopathic ARDS and showed diffuse alveolar damage on surgical lung biopsy specimens from July 1995 to March 2004. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The median age of patients was 65.5 years (age range, 38 to 73 years). Patients presented with a median duration of severe dyspnea of 9.5 days (range, 2 to 34 days) at the hospital visit. All patients required mechanical ventilation beginning at median time of hospital day 1 (range, hospital day 0 to 5), which continued for a median duration of 9.5 days (range, 4 to 98 days). Patients received ventilation in the pressure assist-control mode with a median tidal volume of 6.97 mL/kg (range, 6.05 to 8.86 mL/kg) and median positive end-expiratory pressure of 11 cm H(2)O (range, 8 to 16 cm H(2)O). An aggressive diagnostic workup for respiratory infection, including BAL at a median time of hospital day 2 (range, hospital day 1 to 5) was performed. High-dose steroid pulse therapy was initiated on median hospital day 3.5 (range, hospital day 1 to 8), while surgical lung biopsy was performed on median hospital day 4 (range, hospital day 2 to 7). Eight patients (80%) survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: Earlier intervention, such as an aggressive diagnostic approach, mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy, and the early institution of immunosuppressive may improve clinical outcome in patients with AIP.","Suh, Gee Young; Kang, Eun Hae; Chung, Man Pyo; Lee, Kyung Soo; Han, Joungho; Kitaichi, Masanori; Kwon, O Jung",Chest,511,1

The objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between physical activity, a sense of coherence, resilience and coping among people diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis during the health emergency situation. To achieve this goal, this transversal descriptive study included 84 patients that belonged to multiple sclerosis associations during the period of confinement. Participants filled out the Physical Activity (IPAQ-SF), Sense of Coherence (SOC-13), Resilience Scale (ER-14) and coping (COPE-28) questionnaires. The results showed that the average age was 46.9 and that 67.9% had Relapsing Remittent Multiple Sclerosis diagnosed on average 13.9 years ago. They had a high degree (33.3%) and moderate degree (34.5%) of physical activity, high levels of resilience, while the level of a sense of coherence was average and the most commonly used strategies for coping were active confrontation and religion. Physical activity was not related to the rest of the studied variables, but there were correlations between the other variables. The people with multiple sclerosis who belong to patient associations have remained physically active during the obligatory confinement period and have elevated degrees of resilience and an average sense of coherence, as well as using suitable coping strategies, which is why the social-health resource of belonging to a patient association could be boosting these variables that are beneficial to their health.","Reguera-García, María Mercedes; Liébana-Presa, Cristina; Álvarez-Barrio, Lorena; Alves Gomes, Lisa; Fernández-Martínez, Elena",Int J Environ Res Public Health,511,24

It is typically described as objective hypoxia in the absence of proportional respiratory distress. The physiological basis for this phenomenon is controversial, and its prognostic value is unclear. We present a case below, of a 66-year-old female presenting with severe hypoxia that was managed without mechanical ventilation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 66 year old female with multiple comorbidities initially presented with a cough, fever and an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air in the absence of respiratory distress or altered mentation. She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit; received oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and continuous positive pressure mask. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 40 days under close observation and exhibited multiple episodes of silent hypoxia on weaning oxygen. She was discharged on room air with an oxygen saturation >90% after 56 days. The patient was not intubated during her stay. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Clinicians face a clinical dilemma on whether to intubate a “silently hypoxemic” patient, who displays hypoxia out of proportion to clinical examination. The decision is confounded by a lack of clear evidence on whether the benefits of precautionary intubation outweighs the risks, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. A recent paradigm shift that recommends delaying intubation further displays the need for clearer analysis of the situation. Our case demonstrates a favorable outcome of the latter approach, yet emphasizes a case-by-case approach until clearer recommendations are available.","Lari, Ali; Alherz, Mohammad; Nouri, Abdullah; Botras, Lotfi; Taqi, Salah",Ann Med Surg (Lond),511,16

Studies examining the factors associated with mask reuse during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic are limited. This nationwide survey aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with mask reuse among Taiwanese citizens during the pandemic. From 18 May through 31 May 2020, a computer-assisted telephone interview system was used to randomly select Taiwanese citizens for interview regarding COVID-19-preventive behaviors and knowledge on mask usage. For a total of 1075 participants, the overall mean age was 57.4 years, and 82.2% of participants reported mask reuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for other covariates, participants who had a greater knowledge of mask usage or had a high supply of masks were less likely to reuse masks during the pandemic. Moreover, generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis showed that, compared with the participants’ mask-wearing behaviors before the COVID-19 pandemic, they were more likely to reuse masks during the pandemic. Thus, it is imperative to educate people on the correct usage of masks. Furthermore, the government should provide sufficient masks to the general population to reduce mask reuse.","Cheng, Feng-Shiang; Yen, Yung-Feng; Lin, Shu-Yi; Weng, Shih-Han; Chou, Yi-Chang; Chu, Dachen; Chen, Chu-Chieh; Hu, Hsiao-Yun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,511,16

This novel polysaccharide is noncytotoxic and nonproliferating to normal lymphocytes as well as tumor cell lines at 0–1000 μg/ml. It activated different subsets of the lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells (331%), T cells (102%), and B cells (39%) at 100 μg/ml concentration. The significant activation of NK cells is associated with the dose-dependent killing of tumor cells by activated normal lymphocytes in a functional assay. Immune activation by RR1 in normal lymphocytes elicited the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1β (1080 pg/ml), IL-6 (21,833 pg/ml), IL-12 p70 (50.19 pg/ml), IL-12 p40 (918.23 pg/ml), IL-18 (27.47 pg/ml), IFN- γ (90.16 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (2225 pg/ml) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (2307 pg/ml) at 100 μg/ml concentration, while it did not induce the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-α and TNF-β. The cytokine profile clearly demonstrates the Th1 pathway of T helper cell differentiation essential for cell mediated immunity, with a self-regulatory mechanism for the control of its overproduction. RR1 also activated the complements in the alternate pathway, demonstrated by a stepwise increase in C3a des Arg components. Incidentally, RR1 stimulation did not produce any oxidative stress or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lymphocytes or any significant increase in nitric oxide production. The water solubility, high molecular mass, activation of lymphocytes especially NK cells, complement activation, Th1 pathway-associated cytokine profile, together with a low level of nitric oxide synthesis and absence of oxidative stress confer important immunoprotective potential to this novel α-d-glucan.","Raveendran Nair, P.K.; Rodriguez, Sonia; Ramachandran, Reshma; Alamo, Arturo; Melnick, Steven J.; Escalon, Enrique; Garcia, Pedro I.; Wnuk, Stanislaw F.; Ramachandran, Cheppail",Int Immunopharmacol,511,24

The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3′ end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells. In the absence of either E or M, MIDI-HD RNA could not be passaged to fresh L cells. We have thus developed a system in which we can produce coronavirus-like particles and an assay to test their infectivity.","BOS, EVELYNE C.W.; LUYTJES, WILLEM; MEULEN, HANS VAN DER; KOERTEN, HENK K.; SPAAN, WILLY J.M.",Virology,511,15

Drawing from the self-expansion model and relationship goals literature, we predicted that people higher (vs. lower) in approach relationship goals would be more likely to plan dates that are more exciting and, in turn, experience more self-expansion from the date and increased closeness with the partner. In Study 1, people in intimate relationships planned a date to initiate with their partners and forecasted the expected level of self-expansion and closeness from engaging in the date. In Study 2, a similar design was employed, but we also followed up with participants 1 week later to ask about the experience of engaging in their planned dates (e.g., self-expansion, closeness from the date). Taken together, the results suggest that people with higher (vs. lower) approach relationship goals derive more closeness from their dates, in part, because of their greater aptitude for planning dates that are more exciting and promote self-expansion.","Harasymchuk, Cheryl; Walker, Deanna L.; Muise, Amy; Impett, Emily A.",J Soc Pers Relat,511,1

DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study performed between March and May 2020 over all workers of a secondary hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: We employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR, for symptomatic individuals) and serology (for both PCR-negative symptomatic workers and asymptomatic workers) as diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We analyzed the prevalence of the virus in healthcare workers (HCWs) and nonhealthcare workers (nHCWs). We also collected information about the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and possible contacts prior to infection. RESULTS: In total, 2,963 workers were included: 1,092 were symptomatic, and of these, 539 were positive by PCR (49.4% of symptomatic workers). From the remaining symptomatic workers, 197 (35.6%) were positive by serology. Regarding asymptomatic workers, 345 were positive by serology (31.9% of infected workers). In total, 1,081 (36.5%) presented a positive diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2. Infection rates were different between HCWs (37.4%) and nHCWs (29.8%) (P = .006).

Stepwise addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain requires the coordinated movement of mRNA and tRNAs through the ribosome, a process known as translocation. Here, we review current understanding of the kinetics and mechanics of translocation, with particular emphasis on the structure of a functional mammalian ribosome stalled during translocation by an mRNA pseudoknot. In the context of a pseudoknot-stalled complex, the translocase EF-2 is seen to compress a hybrid-state tRNA into a strained conformation. We propose that this strain energy helps overcome the kinetic barrier to translocation and drives tRNA into the P-site, with EF-2 biasing this relaxation in one direction. The tRNA can thus be considered a molecular spring and EF-2 a Brownian ratchet in a “spring-and-ratchet” system within the translocation process.","Moran, Stephen J.; Flanagan, John F.; Namy, Olivier; Stuart, David I.; Brierley, Ian; Gilbert, Robert J.C.",Structure,511,20

Yet, little is known about how they are mentally coping with the pandemic-time changes to their lives. This study explores children and youths’ self-reported subjective well-being (SWB) during the pandemic, and provides novel insights into the correlates of potential decrease, using data from a pan-Canadian online survey of 932 children/youth and their parents. SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time. At the same time, many self-reported that they felt calmer (31.9%) and more rested (30%). A latent class analysis revealed that nearly half (49.4%) of surveyed children and youth reported patterns in changes in their emotional state that may contribute to lower SWB. Results from binomial logistic regression suggest that socio-demographic characteristics and size of the municipality were not associated with low pandemic-time SWB. Instead, other potentially modifiable factors such as having access to friends, indoor and outdoor spaces/places to play and exercise, and healthy movement behaviours during the pandemic, were correlated with a lower likelihood of reporting low SWB. The findings can inform pandemic-time public health policy relating to physical distancing, and in the longer term, mental and physical health promotion. The results will also help improve urban planning and design practices in creating healthier, more resilient and equitable communities.","Mitra, Raktim; Waygood, E.

In light of this, there is much interest in rationally designed subunit vaccines that direct the antibody response to protective epitopes. Here, we produced a panel of anti-idiotype antibodies able to specifically recognize the inferred germline version of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) broadly neutralizing antibody b12 (iglb12). We determined the crystal structure of two anti-idiotypes in complex with iglb12 and used these anti-idiotypes to identify rare naive human B cells expressing B cell receptors with similarity to iglb12. Immunization with a multimerized version of this anti-idiotype induced the proliferation of transgenic murine B cells expressing the iglb12 heavy chain in vivo, despite the presence of deletion and anergy within this population.

Most COVID-19-affected patients are suggested to self-quarantine at home or in institutionalized quarantine centers. In such cases, it is essential to provide remote healthcare services. For remote healthcare monitoring, two approaches are being considered in this study, which include mHealth and Telehealth. A mixed-methods approach is adopted, where survey questionnaires are used for collecting information from 108 patients and semi-structured interviews are used with seven physicians regarding mHealth and Telehealth approaches. Survey results indicated that mHealth is rated to be slightly more effective than Telehealth, and interview results indicated that Telehealth is identified to be slightly more effective than mHealth in relation to parameters including usefulness, ease of use and learnability, interface and interaction quality, reliability, and satisfaction. However, both physicians and patients opined that both mHealth and Telehealth have a promising future with increasing adoption. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that both mHealth and Telehealth are considered to be effective in delivering remote care for COPD patients infected with COVID-19 at home.

Exogenous siRNAs (perfectly paired dsRNAs of ∼21–25 nt in length) play an important role in host defense against RNA viruses and in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants and other eukaryotes. Using RNAi technology by transfecting synthetic siRNAs into eukaryotic cells to silence genes has become an indispensable tool to investigate gene functions, and siRNA-based therapy is being developed to knockdown genes implicated in diseases. Other examples of RNAi technology include method of producing highly potent and purified siRNAs directly from Escherichiacoli cells, based on an unexpected discovery that ectopic expression of p19, a plant viral siRNA-binding protein, stabilizes a cryptic siRNA-like RNA species in bacteria. Those siRNAs, named as pro-siRNA for “prokaryotic siRNA”, are bacterial RNase III products that have chemical and functional properties that like eukaryotic siRNAs.","Xu, Wei; Jiang, Xuezhen; Huang, Linfeng",Comprehensive Biotechnology,511,26

The development of new drugs to manage COVID-19 effectively is a challenging and time-consuming process, thus encouraging extensive investigation of drug repurposing and repositioning candidates. Several medications, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, ritonavir, interferons, azithromycin, capivasertib and bevacizumab, are currently under clinical trials for COVID-19. In addition, several medicinal plants with considerable antiviral activities are potential therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. Statistical data show that the pandemic is yet to slow down, and authorities are placing their hopes on vaccines. Within a short period, four types of vaccines, namely, whole virus, viral vector, protein subunit, and nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), which can confer protection against COVID-19 in different ways, were already in a clinical trial. SARS-CoV-2 variants spread is associated with antibody escape from the virus Spike epitopes, which has grave concerns for viral re-infection and even compromises the effectiveness of the vaccines.

The purpose of this study was to review the acute and late phase pulmonary findings in influenza A(H1N1) associated pneumonia using high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and to determine the importance of performing end expiration series. METHODS: Between July and August 2009, 140 patients presented with influenza A (H1N1) confirmed by real-timepolymerase chain reaction. Out of these, 27 patients underwent HRCT in the acute and late phases of pneumonia, allowing for a comparative study. Late phase exams were performed due to clinical worsening and up to 120 days later in patients with persistent complaints of dyspnea. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities, consolidations, and the combination of both were associated with the acute phase, whereas persistence or worsening of the lesions, lesion improvement, and air trapping in the end expiration series (as seen using HRCT, n=6) were observed in the late phase. CONCLUSIONS: In the HRCT end expiration series, air trapping was found in the late phase of H1N1 associated pneumonia. Generally, these exams are not evaluated in research articles, and air trapping has not previously been studied using the end expiration series. Our study brings more scientific knowledge about aspects of pulmonary involvement by influenza A (H1N1), through evaluation with end expiration series, which makes the CT exam dynamic, translating the respiratory movement, and showing bronchial alteration.","Fontes, Cristina Asvolinsque Pantaleão; dos Santos, Alair Augusto Sarmet Moreira Damas; de Oliveira, Solange Artimos; Aidê, Miquel Abdon",Multidiscip Respir Med,511,24

The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.","Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Simpson, Robert W.",Virus Research,511,9

METHODS: We analyzed the Tufts Medical Center’s CEA and Global Health CEA registries, containing 6907 cost-per-quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and 698 cost-per-disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) studies published through 2018. We examined how often published CEAs included non-health consequences and their impact on ICERs. We also reviewed 45 country-specific guidelines to examine recommended analytic perspectives. RESULTS: Study authors often mis-specified or did not clearly state the perspective used. After re-classification by registry reviewers, a healthcare sector or payer perspective was most prevalent (74%). CEAs rarely included unrelated medical costs and impacts on non-healthcare sectors. The most common non-health consequence included was productivity loss in the cost-per-QALY studies (12%) and patient transportation in the cost-per-DALY studies (21%). Of 19,946 cost-per-QALY ratios, the median ICER was $US26,000/QALY (interquartile range [IQR] 2900–110,000), and 18% were cost saving and QALY increasing. Of 5572 cost-per-DALY ratios, the median ICER was $US430/DALY (IQR 67–3400), and 8% were cost saving and DALY averting. Based on 16 cost-per-QALY studies (2017–2018) reporting 68 ICERs from both the healthcare sector and societal perspectives, the median ICER from a societal perspective ($US22,710/QALY [IQR 11,991–49,603]) was more favorable than from a healthcare sector perspective ($US30,402/QALY [IQR 10,486–77,179]). Most governmental guidelines (67%) recommended either a healthcare sector or a payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Researchers should justify and be transparent about their choice of perspective and costing approaches.

Preferably, priority setting combines evidence evaluation with an appraisal procedure, to elicit and weigh these considerations. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a structured approach for eliciting and evaluating a broad range of assessment criteria, including key stakeholders’ values, aiming to support decision makers in priority setting. METHODS: For a set of cost‐effective substitute interventions for depression care, the appraisal criteria were adopted from the Australian Assessing Cost‐Effectiveness initiative. All substitute interventions were assessed in an appraisal, using focus group discussions and semi‐structured interviews conducted among key stakeholders. RESULTS: Appraisal of the substitute cost‐effective interventions yielded an overview of considerations and an overall recommendation for decision makers. Two out of the thirteen pairs were deemed acceptable and realistic, that is investment in therapist‐guided and Internet‐based cognitive behavioural therapy instead of cognitive behavioural therapy in mild depression, and investment in combination therapy rather than individual psychotherapy in severe depression. In the remaining substitution pairs, substantive issues affected acceptability. The key issues identified were as follows: workforce capacity, lack of stakeholder support and the need for change in clinicians’ attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic identification of stakeholders’ considerations allows decision makers to prioritize among cost‐effective policy options. Moreover, this approach entails an explicit and transparent priority‐setting procedure and provides insights into the intended and unintended consequences of using a certain health technology. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patients were involved in the conduct of the study for instance, by sharing their values regarding considerations relevant for priority setting.","Kan, Kaying; Jörg, Frederike; Lokkerbol, Joran; Mihalopoulos, Cathrine; Buskens, Erik; Schoevers, Robert A.; Feenstra, Talitha L.",Health Expect,511,16

METHODOLOGY De-identified data from the Australia and New Zealand Society for Vascular Surgery Australasian Vascular Audit from January 2015 to September 2020 was obtained. Vascular surgery procedure numbers from January to September of 2020 (study period) was compared to the corresponding months between 2015 and 2019 (pre-study period). The volume of procedures, both elective and emergency, were compared. Subgroup analyses included procedures categorized by operation type and location. RESULTS There was a 11% decrease in total vascular procedures, 22% decrease in elective procedures, and a 14% increase in emergency procedures, comparing the study and pre-study periods. There was a large increase in all revascularization procedures for critical limb ischemia and no change in acute limb ischemia interventions, without a concomitant rise in major or minor all-cause amputation. There was a decrease in interventions for abdominal aortic aneurysm and carotid artery disease, driven by a fall in elective procedures, while volume for dialysis access remained the same. Change in procedural volume varied by state with the largest decrease noted in NSW and Victoria.

Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33 % and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive andanxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms was the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlights the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potentially negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed.

EBV replicates in the stratified epithelium but the nasopharynx is also composed of pseudostratified epithelium with distinct cell types. Latent infection is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Here, we show with nasopharyngeal conditionally reprogrammed cells cultured at the air-liquid interface that pseudostratified epithelial cells are susceptible to EBV infection. Donors varied in susceptibility to de novo EBV infection, but susceptible cultures also displayed differences with respect to pathogenesis. The cultures from one donor yielded lytic infection but cells from two other donors were positive for EBV-encoded EBERs and negative for other lytic infection markers. All cultures stained positive for the pseudostratified markers CK7, MUC5AC, α-tubulin in cilia, and the EBV epithelial cell receptor Ephrin receptor A2. To define EBV transcriptional programs by cell type and to elucidate latent/lytic infection-differential changes, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on one EBV-infected culture that resulted in alignment with many EBV transcripts. EBV transcripts represented a small portion of the total transcriptome (~0.17%). All cell types in the pseudostratified epithelium had detectable EBV transcripts with suprabasal cells showing the highest number of reads aligning to many EBV genes. Several restriction factors (IRF1, MX1, STAT1, C18orf25) known to limit lytic infection were expressed at lower levels in the lytic subcluster. A third of the differentially-expressed genes in NPC tumors compared to an uninfected pseudostratified ALI culture overlapped with the differentially-expressed genes in the latent subcluster. A third of these commonly perturbed genes were specific to EBV infection and changed in the same direction. Collectively, these findings suggest that the pseudostratified epithelium could harbor EBV infection and that the pseudostratified infection model mirrors many of the transcriptional changes imposed by EBV infection in NPC.","Ziegler, Phillip; Tian, Yarong; Bai, Yulong; Abrahamsson, Sanna; Bäckerholm, Alan; Reznik, Alex S.; Green, Anthony; Moore, John A.; Lee, Stella E.; Myerburg, Michael M.; Park, Hyun Jung; Tang, Ka-Wei; Shair, Kathy Ho Yen",PLoS Pathog,511,6

Among groups at increased risk are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. To date, there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK HCWs or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation, and adjusted for confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A baseline questionnaire will be administered to a national cohort of UK HCWs and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators, with follow-up questionnaires administered at 4 and 8 months. With consent, questionnaire data will be linked to health records with 25-year follow-up. Univariate associations between ethnicity and clinical COVID-19 outcomes, physical and mental health, and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested. Multivariable analyses will test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables. We will model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress about questions on sensitive topics by clearly participant information that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and there is no obligation to answer these or any other questions, and by providing support organisation links. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers submitted to pre-print servers and peer reviewed journals.

We hypothesize that continuation of RAAS inhibition will be superior to temporary discontinuation with regards to the primary endpoint of a global rank sum score. The global rank sum score has been successfully used in previous cardiovascular clinical trials. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open label parallel two arm (1,1 ratio) randomized control superiority trial of approximately 40 COVID-19 patients who are on chronic RAAS inhibitor therapy. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who are admitted to hospital within the McGill University Health Centre systems (MUHC) including Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and who are within 96 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed via PCR on any biological sample) will be considered for the trial. Of note, the initial protocol to screen and enrol within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis was extended through an amendment, to 96 hours to increase feasibility. Participants have to be 18 years or older and would have to be on RAAS inhibitors for at least a month to be considered eligible for the study. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors should not have been held for more than 48 hours before randomization. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the full protocol document. In order to prevent heart failure exacerbation, patients with reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial. Once a patient is admitted on the ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19, we will confirm with the treating physician if the participant is suitable for the RAAS-COVID trial and meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is eligible and informed consent has been obtained we will collect data on sex, age, ethnicity, past medical history and list of medications (e.g. other anti-hypertensives or anticoagulants), for further analysis. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: All the study participants will be randomized to a strategy of temporarily holding the RAAS inhibitor [intervention] versus continuing the RAAS inhibitor [continued standard of care]. Among participants who are randomized to the intervention arm, alternative guide-line directed anti-hypertensive medication will be provided to the treating physician team (detail in study protocol). In the intervention arm RAAS inhibitor will be withheld for a total of 7 days with the possibility of the withdrawn medication being initiated at any point after day 7 or on the day of discharge. The recommendation for re-initiating the withdrawn medication will be made to the treating physician. The re-initiation of these therapies are according to standard convention and follow-up as per Canadian guidelines. Additionally, the date of restarting the withdrawn medication or whether the medication was re-prescribed on discharge or not, will be collected. This will be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, biomarkers such as troponin, c-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count will be assessed during the same time period. Samples will be collected on randomization, day 4 and day 7. MAIN OUTCOMES: PRIMARY ENDPOINT: In this study the primary end point is a global rank score calculated for all participants, regardless of treatment assignment ( score from 0 to 7). Please refer to table 4 in the full protocol. In the context of the current trial, it is estimated that death is the most meaningful endpoint, and therefore has the highest score ( score of 7). This is followed by admission to ICU, the need for mechanical ventilation etc. The lowest scores ( score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). This strategy has been used successfully in cardiovascular disease trials and therefore is applicable to the current trial. The primary endpoint for the present trial is assessed from baseline to day 7 (or discharge). Participants are ranked across the clinical and biomarker domains. Lower values indicate better health (or stability). Participants who died during the 7th day of the study will be ranked based on all events occurring before their death and also including the fatal event in the score. Next, participants who did not die but were transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation will be ranked based on all the events occurring before the ICU entry and also including the ICU admission in the score. Those participants who did not die were not transferred to ICU for invasive ventilation, will be ranked based on the subsequent outcomes. The mean rank score will then be compared between groups. In this scheme, a lower mean rank score indicates greater overall stability for participants. Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE ( any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay > 4 days, development of acute kidney injury ( > 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to > 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop> 30%. We will also look at the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale for clinical improvement (in COVID-19) in our data. In this scale death will be assigned the highest score of 8. Patients with no limitation of activity will be assigned a score of 1 which indicates overall more stability (3). Additionally, we will evaluate the potential effects of discontinuing RAAS inhibition on alternative schedules (longer/shorter than 7 days, intermittent discontinuation) using a mechanistic mathematical model of COVID-19 immunopathology calibrated to data collected from our patient cohort. In particular, we will assess the impact of alternative schedules on primary and secondary endpoints including increases to baseline CRP and lymphocyte counts. RANDOMIZATION: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within an electronic database system at the time of enrolment using a random number generator, an approach that has been successfully used in other clinical trials. Neither participant, study team, or treating team will be blinded to the intervention arm. BLINDING: This is an open label study with no blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The approximate number of participants required for this trial is 40 patients (randomized 1:1 to continuation versus discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors). This number was calculated based on previous rates of outcomes for COVID-19 in the literature (e.g. death, ICU transfer) and statistical power calculations.

We define green growth by low-carbon output, while we link gray growth to comparative advantages of pollution havens. Green and gray growth models include such predictors as domestic income and foreign direct investment (FDI) together with composite indices for globalization, environmental policy stringency (EPS), industrialization, and control of corruption. Considering non-stationarity, cross-section dependency, endogeneity, and heterogeneity concerns, we employ bootstrap and residual-based cointegration analyses followed by long-run estimations using the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) estimators and causality examination through Dumitrescu-Hurlin and Emirmahmutoglu-Kose tests. The key findings of the study are as follows: (i) income is positively associated with green growth for both IEEs and IDCs, whereas the income-gray growth nexus is negative for IEEs. (ii) Although inward FDI stocks are positively related to green and gray growth of IEEs and outward FDI stocks are negatively associated with green and gray growth of IDCs, these relationships are mediated by EPS. (iii) Globalization encourages both green and gray growth for IDCs. (iv) Even though EPS inhibits green growth and encourage gray growth in IEEs, these direct effects widely depend on the indirect effects of control of corruption. (v) IEEs’ higher gray growth performance is substantially explained by their increased industrial competitiveness, whereas the link is negative for IDCs. (vi) Control of corruption fosters both green and gray growth in IEEs. Overall, “growing gray” does not necessarily mean “not growing green” and vice versa. Globally, the low-carbon benefits of greening countries may be counterbalanced by the environmental costs of graying economies. From a policy perspective, IEEs need to reinforce environmental policies by green efficiency, green industrialization, and anti-corruption plans to decouple economic growth from carbon dioxide emissions.

Meanwhile, some empirical studies suggested that built environment attributes may be associated with the transmission mechanism and infection risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, no review has been conducted to explore the effect of built environment characteristics on the infection risk. This research gap prevents government officials and urban planners from creating effective urban design guidelines to contain SARS-CoV-2 infections and face future pandemic challenges. This review summarizes evidence from 25 empirical studies and provides an overview of the effect of built environment on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. Virus infection risk was positively associated with the density of commercial facilities, roads, and schools and with public transit accessibility, whereas it was negatively associated with the availability of green spaces. This review recommends several directions for future studies, namely using longitudinal research design and individual-level data, considering multilevel factors and extending to diversified geographic areas.","Wang, Jingjing; Wu, Xueying; Wang, Ruoyu; He, Dongsheng; Li, Dongying; Yang, Linchuan; Yang, Yiyang; Lu, Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,511,17

County-level data have been used to identify geospatial patterns of COVID-19 spread and, in conjunction with sociodemographic variables, have helped identify population health disparities concerning COVID-19 in the US. Municipality-level data are essential for advancing more targeted and nuanced understanding of geographic-based risk and resilience associated with COVID-19. We created a dataset that tracks COVID-19 cases and deaths by municipalities in the state of New Jersey (NJ), US, from April 22, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Data were drawn primarily from official county and municipality websites. The dataset is a spreadsheet containing cumulative case counts and case rates in each municipaly on three target dates, representing the peak of the first wave, the summer trough after the first wave, and the outbreak of the second wave in NJ. This dataset is valuable for four main reasons. First, the dataset is unique, because New Jersey's Health Department does not release COVID-19 data for the 77% (433/565) of municipalities with populations smaller than 20,000 individuals. Second, especially when combined with other data sources, such as publicly available sociodemographic data, this dataset can be used to advance epidemiological research on geographic differences in COVID-19, as well as to inform decision-making concerning the allocation of resources in response to the pandemic (e.g., strategies for targeted vaccine outreach campaigns). Third, county-level data mask important variations across municipalities, so municipality-level data permit a more nuanced exploration of health disparities related to local demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and access to resources and services. New Jersey is a good state to explore these patterns, because it is the most densely-populated and racially/ethnically diverse state in the US. Fourth, New Jersey was one of the few locations in the US with a high prevalence of COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in the US. Thus, this dataset permits exploration of whether sociodemographic variables predicted COVID-19 differently as time progressed. To summarize, this unique municipality-level dataset in a diverse state with high COVID-19 cases is valuable for scholars and policy analysts to explore social and environmental factors related to the prevalence and transmission of COVID-19 in the US.","Wang, Yuqi; Allred, Sarah R.; Greenfield, Emily A.; Yadav, Aayush; Pletcher, Ryan; Arthur, George; Saxena, Sachin; Harig, Trista; Rankin, Emily; Rudolph, Benjamin; Sameha, Ummulkhayer; Sharma, Shwetal; Yan, Shibin",Data Brief,511,1

It is a deadly human viral disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a high rate of infection, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop new therapies to control, treat and prevent this disease. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) of the viral host are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication, and building an antiviral cellular defense. Here, we have analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, we have analyzed the potency of anti-miR-155 therapy in a COVID-19 mouse model (mice transgenic for human angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2)). We report for the first time that miR-155 expression is elevated in COVID-19 patients. Further, our data indicate that the viral load as well as miR-155 levels are higher in male relative to female patients. Moreover, we find that the delivery of anti-miR-155 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 effectively suppresses miR-155 expression, and leads to improved survival and clinical scores. Importantly, anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 not only exhibit reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also have increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses in the lungs. Thus, our study suggests anti-miR-155 as a novel therapy for mitigating the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Soni, Dharmendra Kumar; Cabrera-Luque, Juan; Kar, Swagata; Sen, Chaitali; Devaney, Joseph; Biswas, Roopa",bioRxiv,511,28

The famous RT-PCR test is costly and not available for many suspected cases. This article proposes a neurotrophic model to diagnose COVID-19 patients based on their chest X-ray images. The proposed model has five main phases. First, the speeded up robust features (SURF) method is applied to each X-ray image to extract robust invariant features. Second, three sampling algorithms are applied to treat imbalanced dataset. Third, the neutrosophic rule-based classification system is proposed to generate a set of rules based on the three neutrosophic values < T; I; F>, the degrees of truth, indeterminacy falsity. Fourth, a genetic algorithm is applied to select the optimal neutrosophic rules to improve the classification performance. Fifth, in this phase, the classification-based neutrosophic logic is proposed. The testing rule matrix is constructed with no class label, and the goal of this phase is to determine the class label for each testing rule using intersection percentage between testing and training rules. The proposed model is referred to as GNRCS. It is compared with six state-of-the-art classifiers such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest classifiers (RFC) with quality measures of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. The results show that the proposed model is powerful for COVID-19 recognition with high specificity and high sensitivity and less computational complexity. Therefore, the proposed GNRCS model could be used for real-time automatic early recognition of COVID-19.","Basha, Sameh H.; Anter, Ahmed M.; Hassanien, Aboul Ella; Abdalla, Areeg",Soft comput,511,20

In addition, alanine substitution of the cleavage substrates indicated that Gln-(P1) in the substrates mainly determined the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, this study not only established the quantifiable and reliable assay for the in vitro and cell-based measurement of the 3CL(pro) activity, but also characterized the molecular interaction of the SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) with the substrates. The results will be useful for the rational development of the anti-SARS drugs.","Lin, Cheng-Wen; Tsai, Chang-Hai; Tsai, Fuu-Jen; Chen, Pei-Jer; Lai, Chien-Chen; Wan, Lei; Chiu, Hua-Hao; Lin, Kuan-Hsun",FEBS Lett,511,30

There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies to combat potentially fatal complications. Distinctive clinical features of severe COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome, neutrophilia, and cytokine storm, along with severe inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis. Here, we propose the putative role of enhanced neutrophil infiltration and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, complement activation and vascular thrombosis during necroinflammation in COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss how neutrophilic inflammation contributes to the higher mortality of COVID-19 in patients with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This perspective highlights neutrophils as a putative target for the immunopathologic complications of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Development of the novel therapeutic strategies targeting neutrophils may help reduce the overall disease fatality rate of COVID-19.","Tomar, Bhawna; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Desai, Jyaysi; Mulay, Shrikant R.",Cells,511,16

Enabling and supporting family caregivers to provide care at home prevents early institutionalisation of the person with dementia and alleviates the economic burden of dementia in the long term. General practitioners (GPs), as the first point of contact, have a key role in identifying and managing burden and care needs of family caregivers. However, in routine care, this opportunity is often limited by time constraints and even if caregiver needs are recognised, detailed information about regionally available support and advice on healthcare services is often lacking. METHODS: This is a cluster randomised, controlled trial investigating the clinical use and cost-effectiveness of a digitally supported care management programme for caregivers of people with dementia (PwD). Five hundred family caregivers will be randomised at GP offices, specialist practices and memory clinics, with about n=250 participants per arm. Participants are eligible if they are the primary family caregiver of a PwD, are at least 18 years of age and provide informed consent. Participants in the intervention group will receive an individualised care management plan, which will be carried out by qualified study nurses in collaboration with the treating GP. All participants will receive a baseline assessment and a 6-months follow-up assessment. Participants in the wait-list control group will receive usual care. Starting at the 6 months’ follow-up, the former controls will also receive an individualised management plan. Primary outcomes are the number of unmet needs (incl. the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly, CANE) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview, ZBI), social support (Lubben Social Network Scale, LSNS), the use of medical and non-medical services (Questionnaire for the Use of Medical and Non-Medical Services, FIMA) and resource utilisation (Resource Utilisation in Dementia, RUD). The primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. Between- and within-group analyses and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to estimate the effect of the tablet PC-based care management programme. This trial is funded by the German Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) Innovation Fund. DISCUSSION: The findings of this trial will be useful in informing and improving current healthcare system structures and processes to support family dementia caregivers within routine care practices.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time acute cardiovascular admission in two periods: 1) January 2-October 16, 2019 and 2) January 2-October 15, 2020. Weekly incidence rates of a first-time cardiovascular admission, overall and according to subtypes, in the two periods were calculated. The incidence rate of first-time cardiovascular admissions overall was significantly lower during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020 compared with a similar period in 2019 but increased after the gradual reopening of the Danish society. A similar trend was observed for all subgroups of cardiovascular diseases. The mortality rate among patients admitted after March 12 was not significantly different in 2020 compared with 2019 (mortality rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.06]). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, we observed a substantial decrease in the rate of acute cardiovascular admissions, overall and according to subtypes, during the first weeks of lockdown. However, after the gradual reopening of the Danish society, the admission rates for acute cardiovascular diseases increased and returned to rates similar to those observed in 2019. The mortality rate in patients admitted with cardiovascular diseases during lockdown was similar to that of patients during the same period in 2019.","Butt, Jawad H; Østergaard, Lauge; Gerds, Thomas A; Lauridsen, Marie D; Kragholm, Kristian; Schou, Morten; Phelps, Matthew; Gislason, Gunnar H; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Fosbøl, Emil L",Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,511,3

Total Systems Effectiveness (TSE) was developed as an approach to evaluate vaccines with different product attributes from a systems perspective, in order to analyse and compare the value of innovative vaccine products in different settings. The TSE approach has been advanced over the years by various stakeholders including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Gavi, PATH, UNICEF and WHO. WHO further developed the TSE approach to incorporate the country perspective into immunisation decision-making, in order for countries to evaluate innovative products for introduction and product switch decisions, and for vaccine development stakeholders to conduct their assessments of product value in line with country preferences. This paper describes the original TSE approach, development of the tool and processes for NIPs to apply the WHO TSE approach, and results from piloting in 12 countries across Africa, Asia and the Americas. The WHO TSE framework emerged from this piloting effort. The WHO TSE approach has been welcomed by NIP and vaccine development stakeholders as a useful tool to evaluate trade-offs between different products. It was emphasised that the concept of “total systems effectiveness” is likely to be context-specific and that TSE is valuable in facilitating a deliberative process to articulate NIP priorities, for decisions around product choice, and for prioritising the development of future vaccine innovations.","Botwright, Siobhan; Kahn, Anna-Lea; Hutubessy, Raymond; Lydon, Patrick; Biey, Joseph; Karim Sidibe, Abdoul; Diarra, Ibrahima; Nadjib, Mardiati; Suwantika, Auliya A.; Setiawan, Ery; Archer, Rachel; Kristensen, Debra; Menozzi-Arnaud, Marion; Mpia Bwaka, Ado; Mwenda, Jason M.; Giersing, Birgitte K.",Vaccine X,511,17

Consequently, subversion of the host cell replication cycle is a common strategy employed by many viruses to create a cellular environment favorable for viral replication. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes disease in poultry and is also an effective oncolytic agent. However, the effects of NDV infection on cell cycle progression are unknown. In this study, we showed that NDV replication in asynchronized cells resulted in the accumulation of infected cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle, which benefitted the proliferation of NDV. Examination of various cell cycle-regulatory proteins showed that expression of cyclin D1, was significantly reduced following NDV infection. Importantly, the decreased expression of cyclin D1 was reversed by inhibition of CHOP expression, indicating that induction of the PERK-eIF-2a-ATF4-CHOP signaling pathway was involved in the G(0)/G(1) phase cell cycle arrest observed following NDV infection.","Wang, Yan; Wang, Rui; Li, Yanrong; Sun, Yingjie; Song, Cuiping; Zhan, Yuan; Tan, Lei; Liao, Ying; Meng, ChunChun; Qiu, Xusheng; Ding, Chan",Virology,511,16

The use of medications by older adults is acknowledged to be the most common form of medical intervention for many acute and chronic conditions and prescribing in this population continues to increase. In this narrative review, we summarise the age-related factors that should be considered when prescribing for older adults, address some of the perennial challenges related to medicine use in older people, and highlight important emerging research in this area. RECENT FINDINGS: A range of age-related factors should be considered when prescribing for older adults. However, the evidence base still lacks data pertaining to older adults due to their continued under-representation in clinical trials. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and inappropriate prescribing continue to remain prevalent among older adults, although recent research has been focused on the development and evaluation of complex interventions to address these challenges. SUMMARY: Further high-quality studies of interventions to improve and support medication use in older adults are needed, ensuring that older adults are well represented in such trials and consideration is given to the measurement of patient- and provider-focused outcomes.","Barry, Heather E.; Hughes, Carmel M.",Curr Epidemiol Rep,511,32

However, using an improvement and safety checklist during rounds was variable in our neonatology intensive care unit (NICU), and completion was not tracked sustainably. This quality improvement (QI) initiative’s primary aim was to increase compliance with checklist completion from 31% to >75% within 1 year. METHODS: A multidisciplinary QI team identified barriers to checklist completion and implemented a human factors-focused low-technology intervention (redesign of a hard-copy checklist) and later a high-technology clinical decision support tool within the electronic health record. The primary outcome measure was percent compliance with the use of the checklist. Process metrics included the duration of checklist completion. Balancing measures included staff perceptions of work burden and question relevance. RESULTS: Major barriers to checklist utilization were inability to remember, rounding interruptions, and perceived lack of question relevance to patients. Average biweekly checklist compliance improved from 31% before interventions to 80% after interventions. Average checklist completion time decreased from 46 to 11 seconds. Follow-up surveys demonstrated more respondents found questions “completely relevant” (34% pre versus 43% post) but perceived increased work burden (26% pre versus 31% post). CONCLUSIONS: Using QI methodology, human factors-based interventions, and a novel clinical decision support tool, we significantly improved efficiency and checklist compliance and created an automated, sustainable method for monitoring completion and responses. This foundational project provides an infrastructure broadly applicable to QI work in other healthcare settings.","Carr, Leah H.; Padula, Michael; Chuo, John; Cunningham, Megan; Flibotte, John; O’Connor, Theresa; Thomas, Beth; Nawab, Ursula",Pediatr Qual Saf,511,16

Teaching minimally invasive interventions in paediatric dentistry may facilitate the provision of treatment for untreated dental caries in children. We evaluated the teaching of such interventions in both undergraduate dental curriculum and Paediatric Dentistry Specialty Training Programme (PDSTP) in Iran. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey. Participants in this study were the directors of 40 undergraduate programmes and 15 PDSTPs in all Iranian dental schools (response rate = 100%). Descriptive statistics were reported. RESULTS: The most commonly taught methods were preventive fissure sealant and preventive resin restoration (PRR), which were taught ‘both didactically and clinically’ in all undergraduate dental programmes. The least commonly taught methods were silver diamine fluoride (SDF), the Hall technique and resin infiltration, which were taught ‘both didactically and clinically’ in less than 5% of dental schools. The same three methods were the least commonly approaches taught in PDSTP, further, they were less often perceived to be ‘essential’. CONCLUSIONS: There was a notable variation in the teaching of the management of dental caries in Iran’s dental education. Some minimally invasive approaches including SDF, the Hall technique and resin infiltration are not being commonly taught in Iranian dental schools despite the evidence base for these techniques.","Moradi, S.; Sabbagh, S.; Timms, L.; Ravaghi, V.",BMC Oral Health,511,1

Methods 2054 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were studied. To identify sources of AST release, correlations between AST peak values and other biomarkers of tissue damage, i.e., alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for hepatocellular damage, creatine kinase (CK) for muscle damage, lactate dehydrogenase for multiorgan involvement, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyltransferase for cholestatic injury, and C-reactive protein (CRP) for systemic inflammation, were performed and coefficients of determination estimated. The role of AST to predict death and intensive care unit admission during hospitalization was also evaluated. All measurements were performed using standardized assays. Results AST was increased in 69% of patients. Increases could be fully explained by summing the effects of hepatocellular injury [AST dependence from ALT, 66.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 64.5-69.1)] and muscle damage [AST dependence from CK, 42.6% (CI: 39.3-45.8)]. We were unable to demonstrate an independent association of AST increases with worse outcomes. Conclusion The mechanisms for abnormal AST in COVID-19 are likely multifactorial and a status related to tissue suffering could play a significant role. The clinical significance of AST elevations remains unclear.","Aloisio, Elena; Colombo, Giulia; Arrigo, Claudia; Dolci, Alberto; Panteghini, Mauro",Clin Chim Acta,511,33

To determine the added value of uEV measurements for detecting allograft dysfunction after kidney transplantation, we systematically included all related literature containing directly relevant information, with the addition of indirect evidence regarding urine or kidney injury without transplantation. According to their varying characteristics, uEV markers after transplantation could be categorized into kidney-specific, donor-specific, and immune response-related (IR-) markers. A few convincing studies have shown that kidney-specific markers (PODXL, ion cotransporters, SYT17, NGAL, and CD133) and IR-markers (CD3, multi-mRNA signatures, and viral miRNA) could diagnose rejection, BK virus-associated nephropathy, and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity after kidney transplantation. In addition, some indirect proof regarding donor-specific markers (donor-derived cell-free DNA) in urine has been demonstrated. Together, this literature review provides directions for exploring novel uEV markers’ profiling complications after kidney transplantation.","Wu, Liang; Boer, Karin; Woud, Wouter W.; Udomkarnjananun, Suwasin; Hesselink, Dennis A.; Baan, Carla C.",Int J Mol Sci,511,15

This study aims to compare the epidemiology and the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. METHODS: A total of 511 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, including 100 asymptomatic (by the time of the pathogenic tests) and 411 symptomatic individuals were consecutively enrolled from January 25 to February 20, 2020 from hospitals in 21 cities and 47 counties or districts in Sichuan Province. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared. RESULTS: Compared to the symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic cases were younger (P < 0.001), had similar co-morbidity percentages (P = 0.609), and came from higher altitude areas with lower population mobility (P < 0.001) with better defined epidemiological history (P < 0.001). 27.4% of well-documented asymptomatic cases developed delayed symptoms after the pathogenic diagnosis. 60% of asymptomatic cases demonstrated findings of pneumonia on the initial chest CT, including well-recognized features of coronavirus disease-19. None of the asymptomatic individuals died. Two elderly individuals with initially asymptomatic infection developed severe symptoms during hospitalization. One case of possible virus transmission by a patient during the incubation period was highly suspected. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and clinical findings highlight the significance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Murine bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) cultured in the presence of ALVAC secreted high levels of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 and up-regulated expression of the maturation markers CD40, CD80 and CD86.

This aim of this study is to describe the characteristics of NEN patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a worldwide study collecting cases of NEN patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 between June 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021. Centers treating NEN patients were directly contacted by the principal investigator. Patients with NEN of any primary site, grade, and stage were included, excluding small-cell lung carcinoma and mixed adeno-neuroendocrine carcinoma. RESULTS: Among 81 centers directly contacted 88.8% responded and 48.6% of them declined due to lack of cases or interest. On March 31(st), 2021, eight recruiting centers enrolled 89 patients. Median age was 64 years at the COVID-19 diagnosis. Most patients had metastatic, non-functioning, low/intermediate grade gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NEN, on treatment with somatostatin analogs (SSA) and radioligand therapy (RLT). Most of them had comorbidities. Only 8% of patients had high grade NEN and 12% were receiving chemotherapy. Most patients had symptoms or signs of COVID-19, mainly fever and cough.

We quantified rates of organ-specific impairment following recovery from COVID-19 hospitalisation compared with those in a matched control group, and how the rate ratio (RR) varies by age, sex, and ethnicity. Design: Observational, retrospective, matched cohort study. Setting: NHS hospitals in England. Participants: 47,780 individuals (mean age 65 years, 55% male) in hospital with COVID-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, matched to controls on demographic and clinical characteristics. Outcome measures: Rates of hospital readmission, all-cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney and liver diseases until 30 September 2020. Results: Mean follow-up time was 140 days for COVID-19 cases and 153 days for controls. 766 (95% confidence interval: 753 to 779) readmissions and 320 (312 to 328) deaths per 1,000 person-years were observed in COVID-19 cases, 3.5 (3.4 to 3.6) and 7.7 (7.2 to 8.3) times greater, respectively, than in controls. Rates of respiratory, diabetes and cardiovascular events were also significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases, at 770 (758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132) and 126 (121 to 131) events per 1,000 person-years, respectively. RRs were greater for individuals aged <70 than [≥]70 years, and in ethnic minority groups than the White population, with the biggest differences observed for respiratory disease: 10.5 [9.7 to 11.4] for <70 years versus 4.6 [4.3 to 4.8] for [≥]70 years, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for Non-White versus 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for White. Conclusions: Individuals discharged from hospital following COVID-19 face elevated rates of multi-organ dysfunction compared with background levels, and the increase in risk is neither confined to the elderly nor uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PCS require integrated rather than organ- or disease-specific approaches. Urgent research is required to establish risk factors for PCS.","Ayoubkhani, D.; Khunti, K.; Nafilyan, V.; Maddox, T.; Humberstone, B.; Diamond, I.; Banerjee, A.",,511,27

METHODS: Data on Covid-19 deaths across 3,108 contiguous U.S. counties from the Johns Hopkins University and social determinants of health (SDoH) data from the County Health Ranking and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were fitted to Bayesian semi-parametric spatiotemporal Negative Binomial models, and 95% credible intervals (CrI) of incidence rate ratios (IRR) were used to assess the associations. Exceedance probabilities were used for detecting clusters. RESULTS: As of October 31, 2020, the median mortality rate was 40.05 per 100, 000. The monthly urban mortality rates increased with unemployment (IRR(adjusted):1.41, 95% CrI: 1.24, 1.60), percent Black population (IRR(adjusted):1.05, 95% CrI: 1.04, 1.07), and residential segregation (IRR(adjusted):1.03, 95% CrI: 1.02, 1.04). The rural monthly mortality rates increased with percent female population (IRR(adjusted): 1.17, 95% CrI: 1.11, 1.24) and percent Black population (IRR(adjusted):1.07 95% CrI:1.06, 1.08). Higher college education rates were associated with decreased mortality rates in rural and urban counties. The dynamics of exceedance probabilities detected the shifts of high-risk clusters from the Northeast to Southern and Midwestern counties.

To limit the exposure of providers and patients to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages providers to use telehealth platforms whenever possible. Given the maternal mortality crisis in the United States and the compounding 2019 coronavirus disease public health emergency, continued access to quality preconception, prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are essential to the health and well-being of mother and baby. OBJECTIVE: This commentary explores unique opportunities to optimize virtual obstetric care for low-risk and high-risk mothers at each stage of pregnancy. METHODS: In this review paper, we present evidence-based literature and tools from first-hand experience implementing telemedicine in obstetric care clinics during the pandemic. RESULTS: Using the best evidence-based practices with telemedicine, health care providers can deliver care in the safest, most respectful, and appropriate way possible while providing the critical support necessary in pregnancy. In reviewing the literature, several studies endorse the implementation of specific tools outlined in this article, to facilitate the implementation of telemedicine. From a quality improvement standpoint, evidence-based telemedicine provides a solution for overburdened healthcare systems, greater confidentiality for obstetric services, and a personalized avenue for health care providers to meet maternal health needs in the pandemic. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, continued access to quality prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum care are essential to the health and well-being of mother and baby.","Markwei, Metabel; Goje, Oluwatosin",Womens Health (Lond),511,1

Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344 N rats and B6C3F1 mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg DNA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents.","Medinsky, M.

Testing capacity must be sufficient during the winter respiratory season when levels of cough and fever are high due to non-COVID-19 causes. This study aims to make predictions about the contribution of baseline cough or fever to future testing demand in the UK. Methods: In this analysis of the Bug Watch community cohort study, we estimated the incidence of cough or fever in England in 2018-2019. We then estimated the COVID-19 diagnostic testing rates required in the UK for baseline cough or fever cases for the period July 2020-June 2021. This was explored for different rates of the population requesting tests, four COVID-19 second wave scenarios and high and low baseline cough or fever incidence scenarios. Results: Under the high baseline cough or fever scenario, incidence in the UK is expected to rise rapidly from 250,708 (95%CI 181,095 - 347,080) cases per day in September to a peak of 444,660 (95%CI 353,084 - 559,988) in December. If 80% of these cases request tests, testing demand would exceed 1.4 million tests per week for five consecutive months. Demand was significantly lower in the low cough or fever incidence scenario, with 129,115 (95%CI 111,596 - 151,679) tests per day in January 2021, compared to 340,921 (95%CI 276,039 - 424,491) tests per day in the higher incidence scenario. Conclusions: Our results show that national COVID-19 testing demand is highly dependent on background cough or fever incidence. This study highlights that the UK’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic must ensure that a high proportion of people with symptoms request tests, and that testing capacity is sufficient to meet the high predicted demand.","Eyre, Max T.; Burns, Rachel; Kirkby, Victoria; Smith, Catherine; Denaxas, Spiros; Nguyen, Vincent; Hayward, Andrew; Shallcross, Laura; Fragaszy, Ellen; Aldridge, Robert W.",Wellcome Open Res,511,20

The five themes are pre-COVID-19 academic experiences, [initial] reaction to online shift, preparation towards online shift, coping mechanisms in fully online learning spaces and preferred post-COVID-19 learning space. In the end, the SWVIs expressed more challenges with online learning than benefits and opted for a switch to the face-to-face mode post-COVID-19.

National and local authorities have endorsed COVID–19 testing both for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who fulfill certain criteria and for public health or infection control purposes. Therefore understanding kinetics and dynamics of COVID–19 is crucial for diagnosis and potential treatments. Current diagnostic modalities include: (1) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) assay (currently the preferred initial diagnostic test for COVID–19); (2) antigen testing—tests that detect SARS–CoV–2 antigen can be performed rapidly and at the point of care; and (3) serologic detection of antibodies against SARS–CoV–2. As for the treatment, there are a few FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of COVID–19. However, definitive clinical trial data are needed to identify safety of COVID–19 treatments. In the meantime, current practice of SARS–CoV–2 treatment is based greatly on symptomatic care with critical care support applied when hemodynamic, respiratory, or renal insufficiency is needed. Antiviral therapies aim for the inhibition of viral entry (via the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2), viral membrane fusion, and endocytosis or the activity of the SARS–CoV–2 3CLprotease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, agents that modulate immune response, such as human blood-derived products and immunomodulatory therapies, are being explored as adjunctive treatments for the management of moderate to critical infection. In addition to the antiviral medications and the immune-based therapies administration of antithrombotic therapy, use of vitamins C and D and zinc is suggested.","Nikolouzakis, Taxiarchis Konstantinos; Tsatsakis, Aristidis M.",Toxicological Risk Assessment and Multi-System Health Impacts from Exposure,511,16

METHODS: A comprehensive search was carried out in electronic databases for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and experimental studies which investigated the efficacy and safety of CQ, HCQ with or without Azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Findings from the reviews were synthesised using tables and forest plots and the quality effect model was used for the updated meta-analysis. The main outcomes were mortality, the need for intensive care services, disease exacerbation, viral clearance and occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: Thirteen reviews with 40 primary studies were included. Two meta-analyses reported a high risk of mortality, with ORs of 2.2 and 3.0, and the two others found no association between HCQ and mortality. Findings from two meta-analyses showed that HCQ with Azithromycin increased the risk of mortality, with similar ORs of 2.5.

Its fruit and mycelium possess various potent antiproliferative properties. Two studies from our group have reported that T sinensis or A camphorata has the ability to cause apoptosis in various cancer cells. Conversely, underlying molecular mechanisms and any beneficial effects remain unknown. This study shows anticancer efficacy for both T sinensis and A camphorata co-treatments that target HL-60 cells. The combination index values indicate that 40 µg/mL of T sinensis and 25 µg/mL of A camphorata as a combined treatment shows a synergetic effect, which reduces HL-60 cell proliferation. Alternately, this treatment exhibited no cytotoxic effects for human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Western blot data showed that T sinensis and A camphorata as a combined treatment result in augmented expression of apoptosis, cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 inhibition, expression of Bax, Fas, and FasL, as well as the cleavage of Bid in HL-60 cells. Moreover, this combined treatment overshadowed monotherapy in its ability to inhibit uPAR, MMP-9, MMP-2, COX-2 expression, and PGE(2) secretions.

Our aim was to evaluate incidence of UGIB and use of upper GI endoscopy in COVID-19 inpatients. Methods the medical and endoscopic management of UGIB in non-ICU COVID-19 patients has been retrospectively evaluated. Glasgow Blatchford score was calculated at onset of signs of GI bleeding. Timing between onset of signs of GI bleeding and execution, if performed, of upper GI endoscopy was evaluated. Endoscopic characteristics and outcome of patients were evaluated overall or according to the execution or not of an upper GI endoscopy before and after 24 hr. Results Out of 4871 COVID-19 positive patients, 23 presented signs of UGIB and were included in the study (incidence 0.47%). The majority (78%) were on anticoagulant therapy or thromboprophylaxis. In 11 patients (48%) upper GI endoscopy was performed within 24hr, whereas it was not performed in 5. Peptic ulcer was the most common finding (8/18). Mortality rate was 21.7% for worsening of COVID-19 infection. Mortality and rebleeding were not different between patients having upper GI endoscopy before or after 24 hr/not performed. Glasgow Blatchford score was similar between the two groups (13;12-16 vs 12;9-15). Conclusion Upper GI bleeding complicated hospital stay in almost 0.5% of COVID-19 patients and peptic ulcer disease is the most common finding. Conservative management could be an option in patients that are at high risk of respiratory complications.","Aurelio, Mauro; Federico, De Grazia; Vincenzo, Lenti Marco; Roberto, Penagini; Roberto, Frego; Sandro, Ardizzone; Edoardo, Savarino; Franco, Radaelli; Matteo, Bosani; Stefania, Orlando; Arnaldo, Amato; Marco, Dinelli; Francesca, Ferretti; Elisabetta, Filippi; Maurizio, Vecchi; Davide, Stradella; Marco, Bardone; Lodovica, Pozzi; Laura, Rovedatti; Elena, Strada; Antonio, Di Sabatino",Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology,511,12

Rapid detection of high-risk patients is crucial to reduce mortality in this population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognositc accuracy of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) for in-hospital mortality in older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Wuhan Hankou Hospital in China from 1 January 2020 to 29 February 2020. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of MEWS, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA), quick Sequential Organ Function Assessment (qSOFA), Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), Combination of Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure, and Age ≥65 (CURB-65), and the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Criteria (SIRS) for in-hospital mortality. Logistic regression models were performed to detect the high-risk older adults with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 235 patients included in this study, 37 (15.74%) died and 131 (55.74%) were male, with an average age of 70.61 years (SD 8.02). ROC analysis suggested that the capacity of MEWS in predicting in-hospital mortality was as good as the APACHE II, SOFA, PSI and qSOFA (Difference in AUROC: MEWS vs. APACHE II, −0.025 (95% CI [−0.075 to 0.026]); MEWS vs. SOFA, −0.013 (95% CI [−0.049 to 0.024]); MEWS vs. PSI, −0.015 (95% CI [−0.065 to 0.035]); MEWS vs. qSOFA, 0.024 (95% CI [−0.029 to 0.076]), all P > 0.05), but was significantly higher than SIRS and CURB-65 (Difference in AUROC: MEWS vs. SIRS, 0.218 (95% CI [0.156–0.279]); MEWS vs. CURB-65, 0.064 (95% CI [0.002–0.125]), all P < 0.05). Logistic regression models implied that the male patients (≥75 years) had higher risk of death than the other older adults (estimated coefficients: 1.16, P = 0.044). Our analysis further suggests that the cut-off points of the MEWS score for the male patients (≥75 years) subpopulation and the other elderly patients should be 2.5 and 3.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MEWS is an efficient tool for rapid assessment of elderly COVID-19 patients. MEWS has promising performance in predicting in-hospital mortality and identifying the high-risk group in elderly patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Lichun; Lv, Qingquan; Zhang, Xiaofei; Jiang, Binyan; Liu, Enhe; Xiao, Chaoxing; Yu, Xinyang; Yang, Chunhua; Chen, Lei",PeerJ,511,16

We aimed to characterize the medium and long-term clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes after hospitalization for COVID-19, and to identify predictors of long-COVID. Methods: Prospective, longitudinal study conducted in COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR. Serial blood and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) were obtained for measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA and S-IgG/N-IgG antibodies during hospital stay, and at 1, 2 and 6 months post-discharge. Genome sequencing was performed where appropriate. Patients filled out a COVID19-symptom-questionnaire (CSQ) at 2-month and 6-month visits, and those with highest scores were characterized. Results: Of 146 patients (60% male, median age 64 years) followed-up, 20.6% required hospital readmission and 5.5% died. At 2-months and 6-months, 9.6% and 7.8% patients, respectively, reported moderate/severe persistent symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive in NPS in 11.8% (median Ct=38) and 3% (median Ct=36) patients at 2-months and 6-months, respectively, but no reinfections were demonstrated. Antibody titers gradually waned, with seroreversion occurring at 6 months in 27 (27.6%) patients for N-IgG and in 6 (6%) for S-IgG. Adjusted 2-month predictors of the highest CSQ scores (OR [95%CI]) were lower peak S-IgG (0.80 [0.66-0.94]) and higher WHO-severity-score (2.57 [1.20-5.86]); 6-month predictors were lower peak S-IgG (0.89 [0.79-0.99]) and female sex (2.41 [1.20-4.82]); no association was found with prolonged viral shedding. Conclusions: Late clinical events and persistent symptoms in the medium and long term occurred in a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Gender, severity of illness and weaker antibody responses, but not viral shedding, were associated with long-COVID.","Garcia-Abellan, J.; Padilla, S.; Fernandez-Gonzalez, M.; Garcia, J.

Although its primary functions were originally thought to be only of a housekeeping enzyme that degraded intracellular and endocytosed proteins in lysosome, numerous recent studies suggest that it plays many critical and specific roles in diverse cellular settings. Not surprisingly, the dysregulated function of cathepsin L has manifested itself in several human diseases, making it an attractive target for drug development. Unfortunately, several redundant and isoform-specific functions have recently emerged, adding complexities to the drug discovery process. To address this, a series of chemical biology tools have been developed that helped define cathepsin L biology with exquisite precision in specific cellular contexts. This review elaborates on the recently developed small molecule inhibitors and probes of human cathepsin L, outlining their mechanisms of action, and describing their potential utilities in dissecting unknown function.","Dana, Dibyendu; Pathak, Sanjai K.",Molecules,511,4

Neither COVID-19 vaccination nor COVID-19 testing was required before either event. As of August 13, a total of 180 confirmed and probable cases had been identified among attendees at the two events and their close contacts. Among the 122 cases associated with the camp or the conference (primary cases), 18 were in persons who were fully vaccinated, with 38 close contacts. Eight of these 38 close contacts subsequently became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (secondary cases); among the eight close contacts with secondary cases, one half (four) were fully vaccinated. Among the 180 total persons with outbreak-associated cases, five (2.8%) were hospitalized; no deaths occurred. None of the vaccinated persons with cases were hospitalized. Approximately 1,000 persons across at least four states were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through attendance at these events or through close contact with a person who had a primary case. This investigation underscores the impact of secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission during large events, such as camps and conferences, when COVID-19 prevention strategies are not implemented. In Los Angeles County, California, during July 2021, when the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was predominant, unvaccinated residents were five times more likely to be infected and 29 times more likely to be hospitalized from infection than were vaccinated residents (1).

Human mobility is an important factor influencing the spread of diseases possibly leading to a high burden of disease at the country level. Drastic control measures, such as complete lockdown are effective epidemic controls, yet in practice, one hopes that a partial shutdown would suffice. It is an open problem to determine how much mobility can be allowed while controlling an outbreak. In this paper, we use statistical models to relate human mobility to the excess death in Ecuador while controlling for demographic factors. The mobility index provided by GRANDATA, based on mobile phone users, represents the change of number of out-of-home events with respect to a benchmark date (March 2nd, the first date the data is available). The study confirms the global trend that more men are dying than expected compared to women, and that people under 30 show less deaths than expected. Specifically, individuals in the age groups younger than 20, we found have their death rate reduced during the pandemic between 22% and 27% of the expected deaths in the absence of COVID-19. The weekly median mobility time series shows a sharp decrease in human mobility immediately after a national lockdown was declared on March 17, 2020 and a progressive increase towards the pre-lockdown level within two months. Relating median mobility to excess death shows a lag in its effect: first, a decrease in mobility in the previous two to three weeks decreases the excess death and more novel, we found that an increase of mobility variability four weeks prior, increases the number of excess deaths.","Cuellar, L.; Torres, I.; Romero-Severson, E.

A previous diagnosis of chronic liver disease is associated with poorer outcomes. Nevertheless, the impact of silent liver injury has not been investigated. We aimed to explore the association of pre-admission liver fibrosis indices with the prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The work presented was an observational study in 214 patients with COVID-19 consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Pre-admission liver fibrosis indices were calculated. In-hospital mortality and predictive factors were explored with Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 59.58 (13.79) years; 16 patients (7.48%) had previously recognised chronic liver disease. Up to 78.84% of patients according to Forns, and 45.76% according to FIB-4, had more than minimal fibrosis. Fibrosis indices were higher in non-survivors [Forns: 6.04 (1.42) versus 4.99 (1.58), p < 0.001; FIB-4: 1.77 (1.17) versus 1.41 (0.91), p = 0.020)], but no differences were found in liver biochemistry parameters. Patients with any degree of fibrosis either by Forns or FIB-4 had a higher mortality, which increased according to the severity of fibrosis (p < 0.05 for both indexes). Both Forns [HR 1.41 (1.11–1.81); p = 0.006] and FIB-4 [HR 1.31 (0.99–1.72); p = 0.051] were independently related to survival after adjusting for the Charlson comorbidity index, APACHE II, and ferritin. CONCLUSION: Unrecognised liver fibrosis, assessed by serological tests prior to admission, is independently associated with a higher risk of death in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU.","Romero-Cristóbal, Mario; Clemente-Sánchez, Ana; Piñeiro, Patricia; Cedeño, Jamil; Rayón, Laura; del Río, Julia; Ramos, Clara; Hernández, Diego-Andrés; Cova, Miguel; Caballero, Aranzazu; Garutti, Ignacio; García-Olivares, Pablo; Hortal, Javier; Guerrero, Jose-Eugenio; García, Rita; Bañares, Rafael; Rincón, Diego",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,511,29

High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 testing and legal restrictions are not effective in order to get the current outbreak under control. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with a higher transmissibility require efficient strategies for early detection and surveillance. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in aerosols collected by non-powered cold traps. SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics and indoor hotspots could be identified in isolation units and at public places within a high-endemic area. These included an outpatient endoscopy facility, a concert hall, and a shopping mall. Results: Indoor COVID-19 hotspots were found in non-ventilated areas and in zones that are predisposed to a buoyancy (chimney) effect. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those aerosols reached concentrations of 10^5 copies/mL. Extensive outdoor air ventilation reliably eliminated SARS-CoV-2 aerosol contamination. Conclusions: The method presented herein could predict SARS-CoV-2 indoor hotspots and may help to characterize SARS-CoV-2 spreading kinetics. Moreover, it can be used for the surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Due to low costs and easy handling, the procedure might enable efficient algorithms for COVID-19 prevention and screening.","Gehrke, S. G.; Foerderer, C.; Stremmel, W.",,511,28

Variations in climatic and economic conditions significantly impact the economic feasibility and productivity of such fuel systems, requiring harmonized technoeconomic assessments to identify important conditions required for commercial scale up. METHODS: Here, our previously validated Techno-economic and Lifecycle Analysis (TELCA) platform was extended to provide a direct performance comparison of microalgae diesel production at 12 international locations with variable climatic and economic settings. For each location, historical weather data, and jurisdiction-specific policy and economic inputs were used to simulate algal productivity, evaporation rates, harvest regime, CapEx and OpEx, interest and tax under location-specific operational parameters optimized for Minimum Diesel Selling Price (MDSP, US$ L(−1)). The economic feasibility, production capacity and CO(2-eq) emissions of a defined 500 ha algae-based diesel production facility is reported for each. RESULTS: Under a for-profit business model, 10 of the 12 locations achieved a minimum diesel selling price (MDSP) under US$ 1.85 L(−1) / US$ 6.99 gal(−1). At a fixed theoretical MDSP of US$ 2 L(−1) (US$ 7.57 gal(−1)) these locations could achieve a profitable Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 9.5–22.1%. Under a public utility model (0% profit, 0% tax) eight locations delivered cost-competitive renewable diesel at an MDSP of < US$ 1.24 L(−1) (US$ 4.69 gal(−1)). The CO(2-eq) emissions of microalgae diesel were about one-third of fossil-based diesel. CONCLUSIONS: The public utility approach could reduce the fuel price toward cost-competitiveness, providing a key step on the path to a profitable fully commercial renewable fuel industry by attracting the investment needed to advance technology and commercial biorefinery co-production options. Governments’ adoption of such an approach could accelerate decarbonization, improve fuel security, and help support a local COVID-19 economic recovery. This study highlights the benefits and limitations of different factors at each location (e.g., climate, labour costs, policy, C-credits) in terms of the development of the technology—providing insights on how governments, investors and industry can drive the technology forward.

Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is a promising therapeutic candidate that neutralizes SARS CoV-2 infection by acting as a decoy. Using computational mutagenesis, we designed a number of sACE2 derivatives carrying three to four mutations. The top-predicted sACE2 decoy based on the in silico mutagenesis scan was subjected to molecular dynamics and free-energy calculations for further validation. After illuminating the mechanism of increased binding for our designed sACE2 derivative, the design was verified experimentally by flow cytometry and BLI-binding experiments. The computationally designed sACE2 decoy (ACE2-FFWF) bound the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 tightly with low nanomolar affinity and ninefold affinity enhancement over the wild type. Furthermore, cell surface expression was slightly greater than wild-type ACE2, suggesting that the design is well-folded and stable. Having an arsenal of high-affinity sACE2 derivatives will help to buffer against the emergence of SARS CoV-2 variants. Here, we show that computational methods have become sufficiently accurate for the design of therapeutics for current and future viral pandemics.","Havranek, Brandon; Chan, Kui K.; Wu, Austin; Procko, Erik; Islam, Shahidul M.",J Chem Inf Model,511,27

Age, gender, comorbidities, and housing context have been reported to be among the risk factors for mortality. Exposure to antipsychotics have been discussed to potentially impact the immune response and may pose additional risks. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric presentations are common among older patients and it is unclear how geriatric patients with preexisting psychiatric and neuropsychiatric problems recover from COVID-19. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we describe demographic characteristics of patients at a large geriatric psychiatric outpatient clinic in the New York metropolitan area, who had COVID-19. Our aim is to identify factors that may be associated with increased mortality and to evaluate whether those who survived returned to pre-COVID baseline function. We combined information provided by the treating psychiatrists with data that could be extracted from the electronic health records. Results Between February and September 2020, we identified 56 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (mean age 76 years old). Thirteen patients (23.2%) died and we found that antipsychotics use at the time of COVID-19 infection is associated with increased risk of death (Fisher's exact test P= 0.009, odds ratio = 11.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.4 – 96.0). The result remains significant after adjusting for age, gender, housing context and presence of neurocognitive disorder (Logistic regression P=0.037, Beta=2.4). Furthermore, we found that most patients who survived COVID-19 recovered to baseline (88.4%) as indicated by the ratio of pre- and post-COVID Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale (mean ratio= 0.98, median=1.0, One-sample t-test P=0.48) in 33 patients. Conclusions In conclusion, antipsychotics appear to be associated with higher mortality in our geriatric psychiatry outpatient cohort. However, it is encouraging to find that the majority of elderly patients who survived COVID-19 seems to recover to their baseline neuropsychiatric function. Future larger studies are needed to put these observations into a broader context as well as to explore underlying mechanisms of risk factors.

This has led to an increase in the use of online healthcare resources by service users. Pregnant women have always been a group particularly motivated to seek out information online. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of mothers who were using an existing National Health Service social media based antenatal support service during the early stages of the UK COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: A short online survey with four closed questions (scale response) and one open-ended free-text question was given to pregnant women who were using the online service 3 weeks after the start of the UK lockdown. Descriptive statistics are used to present the closed question data. Thematic analysis was applied to the free-text responses. RESULTS: 320 women were sent the survey. 156 completed it (49% response rate). Participants provided information relating to frequency of use, information access, relative level of antenatal care and ease of contact. 105 (66%) participants completed the open-ended free-text question.

Une des priorités au cours de cette crise a été de limiter la transmission du virus au sein des institutions où résident les personnes les plus à risques de formes graves, notamment les EHPAD. Le but de cette étude est de rechercher s’il existe une corrélation entre l’infection des personnels des établissements de long séjour et la maladie/mortalité spécifique au COVID-19 des résidents. Matériels et méthodes Suite à l’injonction de l’ARS, un dépistage systématique de tous les personnels des établissements médicosociaux (EHPAD et maison d’accueil spécialisée, ou MAS) a été réalisé entre le 15 et le 30 avril 2020 (soit un mois après l’interdiction des visites de ces établissements), dès lors qu’un cas au moins avait été dépisté parmi le personnel. Ils ont bénéficié d’une PCR nasopharyngée et d’une sérologie, et ont répondu à un questionnaire sur la symptomatologie : les cas correspondaient à une PCR et/ou une sérologie positive(s) quels que soient les symptômes. Parmi les résidents, seuls les premiers cas d’un établissement étaient prouvés par une PCR nasopharyngée : le total des cas et des décès imputés au COVID-19 étaient basés sur les chiffres validés quotidiennement par l’ARS pour le décompte national. Une régression linéaire pondérée (par la taille de chaque établissement) a été utilisée pour corréler le nombre des cas parmi les personnels avec les cas et les décès parmi les résidents. Résultats Parmi les 65 établissements, 17 établissements (15 EHPAD et 2 MAS) ayant au moins un cas de COVID-19 dépisté ont été investigués durant cette période. Les établissements comprenaient entre 35 et 279 employés et entre 30 et 270 résidents. Parmi les employés : 111 des 1285 testés (8,6 %) étaient positifs pour le SARS-CoV-2, dont 64/111 (58 %) étaient symptomatiques le jour du dépistage. La proportion d’employés infectés variait de 2 à 32 %.

Currently, there are three approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in the USA, including two based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology that has demonstrated high vaccine efficacy. We sought to characterize humoral immune responses, at high resolution, during immunization with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine in individuals with or without prior history of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We determined antibody responses after each dose of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in individuals who had no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (seronegative) and individuals that had previous viral infection 30–60 days prior to first vaccination (seropositive). To do this, we used both an antibody isotype-specific multiplexed bead-based binding assays targeting multiple SARS-CoV-2 viral protein antigens and an assay that identified potential SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels. Moreover, we mapped antibody epitope specificity after immunization using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peptide arrays. RESULTS: Antibody levels were significantly higher after a single dose in seropositive individuals compared to seronegative individuals and were comparable to levels observed in seronegative individuals after two doses. While IgG was boosted by vaccination for both seronegative and seropositive individuals, only seronegative individuals had increased IgA or IgM antibody titers after primary immunization. We identified immunodominant peptides targeted on both SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 and S2 subunits after vaccination. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 immunization in seropositive and seronegative individuals and provide support for the concept of using prior infection history as a guide for the consideration of future vaccination regimens. Moreover, we identified key epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are targeted by antibodies after vaccination that could guide future vaccine and immune correlate development.

We show here that NF-κB RelA/p65 is required for the tumour growth of human NSCLC cells grown in vivo as xenografts in immune-compromised mice. RNA-seq transcriptome profile analysis identified the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1/TSPAN27 as a canonical NF-κB target. Loss of CD82 correlated with malignancy. RelA/p65 stimulates cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), mediated, in part, by CD82/KAI1, through integrin-mediated signalling, thus, identifying a mechanism mediating NF-κB RelA/p65 lung tumour promoting function. ABSTRACT: Background: The development of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) involves the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes. These include somatic oncogenic KRAS and EGFR mutations and inactivating TP53 tumour suppressor mutations, leading to activation of canonical NF-κB. However, the mechanism(s) by which canonical NF-κB contributes to NSCLC is still under investigation. Methods: Human NSCLC cells were used to knock-down RelA/p65 (RelA/p65(KD)) and investigate its impact on cell growth, and its mechanism of action by employing RNA-seq analysis, qPCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and functional assays. Results: RelA/p65(KD) reduced the proliferation and tumour growth of human NSCLC cells grown in vivo as xenografts in immune-compromised mice. RNA-seq analysis identified canonical NF-κB targets mediating its tumour promoting function. RelA/p65(KD) resulted in the upregulation of the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1/TSPAN27 and downregulation of the proto-oncogene ROS1, and LGR6 involved in Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Immunohistochemical and bioinformatics analysis of human NSCLC samples showed that CD82 loss correlated with malignancy. RelA/p65(KD) suppressed cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT), mediated, in part, by CD82/KAI1, through integrin-mediated signalling involving the mitogenic ERK, Akt1 and Rac1 proteins. Conclusions: Canonical NF-κB signalling promotes NSCLC, in part, by downregulating the metastasis suppressor CD82/KAI1 which inhibits cell migration, EMT and tumour growth.","Roupakia, Eugenia; Chavdoula, Evangelia; Karpathiou, Georgia; Vatsellas, Giannis; Chatzopoulos, Dimitrios; Mela, Angeliki; Gillette, Jennifer M.; Kriegsmann, Katharina; Kriegsmann, Mark; Batistatou, Anna; Goussia, Anna; Marcu, Kenneth B.; Karteris, Emmanouil; Klinakis, Apostolos; Kolettas, Evangelos",Cancers (Basel),511,21

Fever has been observed as one of the most common clinical manifestations, although the prevalence and characteristics of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients is inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of fever and chills in addition to fever characteristics (low, medium, and high temperature) in both adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020176327). PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases were searched between 1(st) December 2019 and 3(rd) April 2020 without language restrictions. Both adult (≥18 years) and paediatric (<18 years) COVID-19 patients were considered eligible. We used random-effects model for the meta-analysis to obtain the pooled prevalence and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic and Cochran’s Q test. Robustness of the pooled estimates was checked by different subgroups and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We identified 2055 studies, of which 197 studies (n = 24266) were included in the systematic review and 167 studies with 17142 adults and 373 paediatrics were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of fever in adult and paediatric COVID-19 patients were 79.43% [95% CI: 77.05–81.80, I(2) = 95%] and 45.86% [95% CI: 35.24–56.48, I(2) = 78%], respectively. Besides, 14.45% [95% CI: 10.59–18.32, I(2) = 88%] of the adult COVID-19 patients were accompanied with chills. In adult COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of medium-grade fever (44.33%) was higher compared to low- (38.16%) and high-grade fever (14.71%). In addition, the risk of both low (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.69–3.22, p<0.00001, I(2) = 84%) and medium grade fever (RR: 2.79, 95% CI: 2.21–3.51, p<0.00001, I(2) = 75%) were significantly higher compared to high-grade fever, however, there was no significant difference between low- and medium-grade fever (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.94–1.44, p = 0.16, I(2) = 87%). 88.8% of the included studies were of high-quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that our findings of fever prevalence for both adult and paediatric patients are reliable and robust. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of fever in adult COVID-19 patients was high, however, 54.14% of paediatric COVID-19 patients did not exhibit fever as an initial clinical feature. Prevalence and risk of low and medium-grade fevers were higher compared to high-grade fever.","Islam, Md Asiful; Kundu, Shoumik; Alam, Sayeda Sadia; Hossan, Tareq; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Hassan, Rosline",PLoS One,511,10

Following the bailout policy principles established in the literature, we suggest that bankruptcy protection should be considered as the first solution to a failing carrier. A bailout decision should be guided by a set of principles and procedures, which should not be taken lightly. Our analysis also shows that the government cannot take a hands-off approach in the absence of private lenders and investors, as the costs to consumers and regional residents would be huge if the carrier could not get through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using a nationally representative sample (N = 1,304), we examined the effects of network size, heterogeneity, ego-alter dissimilarity, and social norms.

There is limited understanding of how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual’s perceived risk of infection.","Nardin, Luis G.; Miller, Craig R.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Krone, Stephen M.; Joyce, Paul; Baumgaertner, Bert O.",bioRxiv,511,3

Recent reports suggest that both clinical and genetic risk factors may contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To investigate genetic risk factors, we collected over 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses between April and May 2020 with accompanying genetic data from the AncestryDNA database. We conducted sex-stratified and meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) and severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). The severity GWAS replicated associations with severe COVID-19 near ABO and SLC6A20 (P<0.05). Furthermore, we identified three novel loci with P<5x10-8. The strongest association was near IVNS1ABP, a gene involved in influenza virus replication, and was associated only in males. The other two novel loci harbor genes with established roles in viral replication or immunity: SRRM1 and the immunoglobulin lambda locus. We thus present new evidence that host genetic variation likely contributes to COVID-19 outcomes and demonstrate the value of large-scale, self-reported data as a mechanism to rapidly address a health crisis.","Roberts, G.

Recent historic firsts on behalf of racial and ethnic minorities taken by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Office of Minority Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in response to COVID-19, if proven effective, should be considered for permanency within policy, practice and funding.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk factors associated with ventilation need and mortality. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We established a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients from Mass General Brigham hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and admission laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before May 19(th), 2020. Using patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, derivation cohort), multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to construct the Ventilation in COVID Estimator (VICE) and Death in COVID Estimator (DICE) risk scores. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes were ventilation status and death. RESULTS: The entire cohort included 1042 patients (median age, 64 years; 56.8% male). The derivation and validation cohorts for the risk scores included 578 and 464 patients, respectively. We found seven factors to be independently predictive for ventilation requirement (diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, alanine aminotransferase, troponin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase), and 10 factors to be predictors of in-hospital mortality (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic statin use, albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, and procalcitonin). Using these factors, we constructed the VICE and DICE risk scores, which performed with C-statistics of at least 0.8 in our cohorts. Importantly, the chronic use of a statin was associated with protection against death due to COVID-19. The VICE and DICE score calculators have been placed on an interactive website freely available to the public (https://covid-calculator.com/). LIMITATIONS: One potential limitation is the modest sample sizes in both our derivation and validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: The risk scores developed in this study may help clinicians more appropriately determine which COVID-19 patients will need to be managed with greater intensity.","Nicholson, Christopher J.; Wooster, Luke; Sigurslid, Haakon H.; Li, Rebecca F.; Jiang, Wanlin; Tian, Wenjie; Cardenas, Christian L.

Here, we have isolated DNA aptamers against the SARS‐CoV helicase from a combinatorial DNA library. These aptamers show two distinct classes of secondary structure, G‐quadruplex and non‐G‐quadruplex, as shown by circular dichroism and gel electrophoresis. All of the aptamers that were selected stimulated ATPase activity of the SARS‐CoV helicase with low‐nanomolar apparent K (m) values. Intriguingly, only the non‐G‐quadruplex aptamers showed specific inhibition of helicase activities, whereas the G‐quadruplex aptamers did not inhibit helicase activities. The non‐G‐quadruplex aptamer with the strongest inhibitory potency was modified at the 3′‐end with biotin or inverted thymidine, and the modification increased its stability in serum, particularly for the inverted thymidine modification. Structural diversity in selection coupled to post‐selection stabilisation has provided new insights into the aptamers that were selected for a helicase target. These aptamers are being further developed to inhibit SARS‐CoV replication.","Shum, Ka To; Tanner, Julian A.",Chembiochem,511,32

RSV P recruits multiple proteins to the polymerase complex and, with the exception of its oligomerization domain, is thought to be intrinsically disordered. Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-Å cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates.

The scope and diversity of these unwanted events highlight the need to evaluate the resilience of a system to a specific disruptive circumstance. The broad scope and generic form of the previous studies limit their usefulness as a practical tool for analyzing the factors affecting system performance. To overcome this problem, we are only focusing on the behavior of systems that produce, distribute, and deliver food, energy, and water (FEW) during and after the occurrence of a sudden shortage of labor. Resilience metrics are first developed to measure the resilience of the FEW systems. Next, the performance levels of the FEW systems are clearly defined based on the FEW demands that are not served. Third, the labor intensity of FEW productions is calculated to assess the impact of a sudden labor shortage. This study recognizes the complex interdependencies among the FEW systems and, thus, aims to examine their resilience as a single system. Last, the labor shortage in the USA caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is chosen as a use case to measure the system performance and role of adjustments on the FEW systems. The results show that a labor shortage can significantly impact the FEW system performance, possibly due to the high energy dependency of food and water systems and the high cost of storing energy. Also, the current food system has shown more resilience to a sudden labor shortage compared to the energy and water systems because of the availability of various food alternatives to meet the demand for each food category.","Karan, Ebrahim; Asgari, Sadegh",Environ Syst Decis,511,16

However, little research has included key workers outside of the healthcare sector or has disaggregated key workers into different subgroups. Aims: To examine longitudinal changes in mental health over 12 months during the COVID-19 pandemic comparing four different groups of key workers with non-key workers. Method: Longitudinal data were from 21,874 adults living in England (21 March 2020 to 22 February 2021). Latent growth modelling (LGM) was utilised to compare growth trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms in non-key workers and four types of key workers: i) health and social care workers, ii) teachers and childcare workers, iii) public service workers, and iv) essential services key workers (e.g., food chain or utility workers). Results: When accounting for both time-invariant and time-varying covariates, key workers in the essential services category had consistently higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than non-key workers across the whole of the study period. There was little difference in mental health trajectories between health/social care, teachers/childcare and public service worker categories and non-key workers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest risk for poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic varies within the broad category of key workers generally, and that those working in utility, food chain, and transport roles are especially at risk. Future research should focus on identifying which aspects of working conditions may be contributing to occupational stress in these groups.","Paul, E.; Mak, H. W.; Fancourt, D.; Bu, F.",,511,1

While the majority of EAV infections are asymptomatic, acutely infected animals may develop a wide range of clinical signs, including pyrexia, limb and ventral edema, depression, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. The virus may cause abortion and has caused mortality in neonates. After natural EAV infection, most horses develop a solid, long-term immunity to the disease. Marzz and geldings eliminate the virus within 60 days, but 30 to 60% of acutely infected stallions will become persistently infected. These persistently infected animals maintain EAV within the reproductive tract, shed virus continuously in the semen, and can transmit the virus venereally. Mares infected venereally may not have clinical signs, but they shed large amounts of virus in nasopharyngeal secretions and in urine, which may result in lateral spread of the infection by an aerosol route. The consequences of venereally acquired infection are minimal, with no known effects on conception rate, but mares infected at a late stages of gestation may abort. Identification of carrier stallions is crucial to control the dissemination of EAV. The stallions can be identified by serological screening using a virus neutralization (VN) test. If positive at a titer of ≥ 1:4, the stallion should be tested for persistent infection by virus isolation from the sperm-rich fraction of the ejaculate, or by test mating Shedding stallions should not be used for breeding, or should be bred only to mares seropositive from a natural infection or from vaccination, the mares should be subsequently isolated from seronegative horses for three weeks after natural or artificial insemination. A live attenuated (ARVAC) and a formalin-inactivated (ARTERVAC) vaccine are available. Both vaccines induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, the presence of which correlates with protection from disease, abortion, and the development of a persistent infection. Serological investigations indicate that EAV has a worldwide distribution and that its prevalence is increasing. As a consequence, an increasing number of equine viral arteritis (EVA) outbreaks is being reported. This trend is likely to continue unless action is taken to slow or halt the transmission of this agent through semen.","Glaser, A. L.; Chirnside, E. D.; Horzinek, M.

OAA homologues bind high-mannose glycans on viral surface proteins, thereby interfering with viral entry into host cells. As such, OAA homologues have potential utility as antiviral agents, but a more detailed understanding of their structure–function relationships would enable us to develop improved constructs. Here, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of free and glycan-bound forms of Pseudomonas taiwanensis lectin (PTL), an OAA-family lectin consisting of two tandem repeats. Like other OAA-family lectins, PTL exhibited a β-barrel-like structure with two symmetrically positioned glycan-binding sites at the opposite ends of the barrel. Upon glycan binding, the conformation of PTL undergoes a more significant change than expected from previous OAA structural analysis. Moreover, the electron density of the bound glycans suggested that the binding affinities are different at the two binding sites. Next, based on analysis of these structures, we used site-specific mutagenesis to create PTL constructs expected to increase the population with a conformation suitable for glycan binding. The engineered PTLs were examined for their antiviral activity against the influenza virus. Interestingly, some exhibited stronger activity compared with that of the parent PTL. We propose that our approach is effective for the generation of potential microbicides with enhanced antiviral activity.","Matoba, Yasuyuki; Sato, Yuichiro; Oda, Kosuke; Hatori, Yuta; Morimoto, Kinjiro",J Biol Chem,511,23

Measures were taken to prioritize surgical care in order to maintain capacity for COVID-19 healthcare. However, the influence of these measures on emergency surgery is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the trends in emergency surgery and determine the factors influencing the risk of postoperative complications during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This multicentre retrospective cohort study investigated all emergency patients operated on from March 9th to June 30th, 2020. The primary endpoint was identifying the number of emergency surgical procedures performed. Secondary endpoints were determining the number of postoperative complications and factors determining the risk of postoperative complications, which were calculated by multivariate analysis with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence (CI) intervals. Results In total, 1,399 patients who underwent an emergency surgical procedure were included. An increase in the number of emergency vascular and trauma surgical procedures occurred during the study period. In contrast, the number of emergency general and oncological surgical procedures performed remained stable. An increased age (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00 – 1.02; p=0.024), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 – 1.64; p=0.005), and surgical discipline were independent predictors for an increased risk of postoperative complications. Conclusion The performance of emergency vascular and trauma surgical procedures increased. The performance of emergency general and oncological surgical procedures remained stable. In addition, increased age, ASA, and surgical discipline were independent predictors for an increased risk of postoperative complications.","de Bock, E.; Filipe, M.

NMR spectroscopic structural studies of envelope proteins from both the SARS CoV-1/2 reveal that this protein assembles into a homopentamer. Proof of concept studies via truncation mutants on either transmembrane (VFLLV), glycosylation motif (CACCN), hydrophobic helical bundle (PVYVY) as well as replacing C-terminal “DLLV” segments or point mutants such as S68, E69 residues with cysteine have significantly reduced viral titers of SARS-CoV-1. In this present study, we have first developed SARS-2 E protein homology model based on the pentamer coordinates of SARS-CoV-1 E protein (86.4% structural identity) with good stereochemical quality. Next, we focused on the glycosylation motif and hydrophobic helical bundle regions of E protein shown to be important for viral replication. A four feature (4F) model comprising of an acceptor targeting S60 hydroxyl group, a donor feature anchoring the C40 residue, and two hydrophobic features anchoring the V47 L28, L31, Y55, and P51 residues formed the protein based pharmacophore model targeting the glycosylation motif and helical bundle of E protein. Database screening with this 4F protein pharmacophore, ADMET property filtering on enamine small molecule discovery collection yielded a focused library of ~7000 hits. Further molecular docking and visual inspection of docked pose interactions at the above mention V47 L28, L31, Y55, P51, S60, C40 residues led to the identification of 10 best hits. Our STD NMR binding assay results demonstrate that the smaller molecule ligand 3, 2-(2-amino-2-oxo-ethoxy)-N-benzyl-benzamide, binds to NCOVID19 E protein with a binding affinity (K(D)) of 141.7 ± 13.6 μM. Furthermore, the ligand 3 also showed binding to C-terminal peptide (NR25) as evidenced with the STD spectrums of wild type E protein would serve to confirm the involvement of C-terminal helical bundle as envisaged in this study.","Mukherjee, Shruti; Harikishore, Amaravadhi; Bhunia, Anirban",Int J Biol Macromol,511,7

To summarize FDA updates applicable to neuro-oncology practitioners, we sought to review oncology product approvals and Guidances that were pertinent to the field in the past year. METHODS: Oncology product approvals between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were reviewed for clinical trial outcomes involving tumors of the nervous system. FDA Guidances relevant to neuro-oncology were also reviewed. RESULTS: Five oncology product approvals described outcomes for nervous system tumors in the year 2020. These included the first regulatory approval for neurofibromatosis type 1: selumetinib for children with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. Additionally, there were 4 regulatory approvals for non-central nervous system (CNS) cancers that described clinical outcomes for patients with brain metastases. These included the approval of tucatinib for metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer including patients with brain metastases, brigatinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and pralsetinib and selpercatinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

Clinical Research Associates are a largely unexplored source for informing understanding of potential causes of missing PRO data. The purpose of this qualitative research was to describe factors that influence missing PRO data, as revealed through the lived experience of CRAs. METHODS: Maximum variation sampling was used to select CRAs having a range of experiences with missing PRO data from academic or nonacademic centers in different geographic locations of Canada. Semistructured interviews were audio‐recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed according to descriptive phenomenology. RESULTS: Eleven CRAs were interviewed. Analysis revealed several factors that influence missing PRO data that were organized within themes. PROs for routine clinical care compete with PROs for RCTs. Both the paper and electronic formats have benefits and drawbacks. Missing PRO data are influenced by characteristics of the instruments and of the patients. Assessment of PROs at progression of disease is particularly difficult. Deficiencies in center research infrastructure can contribute. CRAs develop relationships with patients that may help reduce missing PRO data. It is not always possible to provide sufficient time to complete the instrument. There is a need for field guidance and a motivation among CRAs to contribute their knowledge to address issues. CONCLUSION: These results enhance understanding of factors influencing missing PRO data and have important implications for designing operational solutions to improve data quality on cancer RCTs.","Palmer, Michael J.; Krupa, Terry; Richardson, Harriet; Brundage, Michael D.",Cancer Med,511,30

Some research also examined the effect of stress and warning on the true and false recognitions; however, so far most of the studies have yielded contradictory results or seems inadequate to understand the effect of these factors on false memory phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to examine the joint effects of stress and warning on the frequency of false and true memories elicited by the list-learning paradigm. The word lists derived from the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm were used in order to measure false and true recognition rates. Participants (N = 126) were exposed to either the Trier Social Stress Test (a stress condition) or a filler task at the beginning of the experiment (no-stress condition). Then, they were either subjected to a warning about false memories before DRM (pre-warning condition), subjected to a warning about false memories after DRM (post-warning condition), or given no warning at all (no-warning condition). Results showed that stress had a statistically significant effect on true recognition but not on false recognition. Furthermore, warning given after the DRM lists had a decreasing effect on the frequency of false memories. No significant interaction effect between stress and warning was found. Although our hypotheses were not confirmed, this study can contribute to the existing body of research by providing evidence that stress and warning have differential effects on both true and false memories derived from the DRM paradigm.","Guzey, Melike; Yılmaz, Banu",Cogn Process,511,1

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days. RESULTS: The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient.

Several preventative and therapeutic options may be applied in order to preserve life. These traditional approaches include administration of seasonal influenza vaccines, pharmacological interventions in the form of antiviral drug therapy and supportive clinical approaches including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. While these measures have shown varying degrees of success, antiviral therapies and vaccination are constrained due to ongoing antigenic drift. Moreover, clinical approaches can also be associated with complications and drawbacks. These factors have led to the exploration and development of more sophisticated and nuanced therapeutic approaches involving host proteins. Advances in immunotherapy in the cancer field or administration of steroids following virus infection have highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting host immune responses. We have now reached a point where we can consider the contribution of other “non-traditional” host components such as the extracellular matrix in immunity. Herein, we will review current, established therapeutic interventions and consider novel therapeutic approaches involving the extracellular matrix.","Pedrina, Jess; Stambas, John",Front Mol Biosci,511,1

PURPOSE: To provide pharmacy residents’ perspective on how the department of pharmacy at a large academic medical center prepared and managed the surge in admissions of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to describe how residents were trained for intensive care unit (ICU) staffing, and to provide recommendations on how residency programs nationally could navigate a second wave of COVID-19 admissions or other disaster response situations. SUMMARY: The majority of postgraduate year 1 (PGY1) pharmacy residents at the institution were trained for ICU staffing and deployed throughout the hospital to ICU units converted to dedicated COVID-19 ICUs to assist in patient care. The training process included live videoconference lectures about relevant ICU topics and on-site experiences with critical care clinical pharmacists. Based on their experience in training for and participating in ICU care of patients with COVID-19, the pharmacy residents recommend considering additional cross-training of residents, integration of additional clinical education, creation of opportunities for resident involvement in telehealth, advancement of residents’ roles in emergency responses, building robust mental health services, and continued advocacy for the advancement of pharmacists’ and pharmacy residents’ scope of practice. CONCLUSION: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the institution to reevaluate the allocation of resources, and the department of pharmacy elected to deploy PGY1 pharmacy residents with previous ICU experience to assist in caring for an ICU patient census that had doubled. This experience will be valuable in preparing for another potential wave of COVID-19 cases and a surge in admissions of other groups of patients who deferred care due to the pandemic.","Uchida, Emma; Long-Fazio, Bianca; Marshall, John; Fortier, Christopher",Am J Health Syst Pharm,511,16

In this study, the cleavage mechanism of the SARS coronavirus main proteinase (M(pro) or 3CL(pro)) on the octapeptide NH(2)-AVLQ ↓ SGFR-COOH was investigated using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics simulations based on the experimental structure of the proteinase. It has been observed that the catalytic dyad (His-41/Cys-145) site between domains I and II attracts the π electron density from the peptide bond Gln–Ser, increasing the positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and the negative charge on N(NH) of Ser, so as to weaken the Gln–Ser peptide bond. The catalytic functional group is the imidazole group of His-41 and the S in Cys-145. N(δ1) on the imidazole ring plays the acid–base catalytic role. Based on the “distorted key theory” [K.C. Chou, Anal. Biochem. 233 (1996) 1–14], the possibility to convert the octapeptide to a competent inhibitor has been studied. It has been found that the chemical bond between Gln and Ser will become much stronger and no longer cleavable by the SARS enzyme after either changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH(2) or CF(2) or changing the NH of Ser to CH(2) or CF(2). The octapeptide thus modified might become an effective inhibitor or a potential drug candidate against SARS.","Du, Qishi; Wang, Shuqing; Wei, Dongqing; Sirois, Suzanne; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Anal Biochem,511,22

To understand better the effects of prolonged storage, this investigation evaluated the filtration efficiency of 21 different models of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified disposable N95 filtering face piece respirators. These respirators had been stored in their original packaging for a period of at least 6 years in research laboratories and dry warehouse facilities, ranging in temperature between 15°C and 32°C and relative humidity between 20% and 80%. METHODS: Filter penetration was measured using an abbreviated version of the NIOSH respirator certification test incorporating a polydisperse sodium chloride aerosol at 85 L/min. RESULTS: Of the 21 respirator models tested, 19 models had both average penetration results of less than 5%. Mean initial penetration values ranged from 0.39% to 5.83%, whereas mean maximum penetration values ranged from 0.95% to 5.83%. There did not appear to be any correlation between the length of storage and failure to pass the filtration test. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that most N95 filtering face piece respirators stored for up to 10 years at warehouse conditions will likely have expected levels of filtration performance and that the degree of filtration efficiency degradation is likely model specific.","Viscusi, Dennis J.; Bergman, Mike; Sinkule, Edward; Shaffer, Ronald E.",Am J Infect Control,511,23

PURPOSE: There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At the onset of the pandemic, off-label medication use was supported by limited or no clinical data. We sought to characterize experimental COVID-19 therapies and identify safety signals during this period. METHODS: We conducted a noninterventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19–targeted therapies. The secondary objective was to describe adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: A total of 352 patients treated for COVID-19 at 15 US hospitals From April 18 to May 8, 2020, were included in the study. Most patients were treated at academic medical centers (53.4%) or community hospitals (42.6%). Sixty-seven patients (19%) were receiving drug therapy in addition to supportive care. Drug therapies used included hydroxychloroquine (69%), remdesivir (10%), and interleukin-6 antagonists (9%). Five patients (7.5%) were receiving combination therapy.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by a novel betacoronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). After the rapid spread of COVID-19, many researchers have investigated diagnosis and treatment for this terrifying disease quickly. Identifying COVID-19 from the other types of coronaviruses is a difficult problem due to their genetic similarity. In this study, we propose a new efficient COVID-19 detection method based on the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier using the complete genome sequences of human coronaviruses in the dataset recorded in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource. We also describe two features based on CpG island that efficiently detect COVID-19 cases. Thus, genome sequences including approximately 30,000 nucleotides can be represented by only two real numbers. The KNN method is a simple and effective non-parametric technique for solving classification problems. However, performance of the KNN depends on the distance measure used. We perform 19 distance metrics investigated in five categories to improve the performance of the KNN algorithm. Some efficient performance parameters are computed to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method achieves 98.4% precision, 99.2% recall, 98.8% F-measure, and 98.4% accuracy in a few seconds when any L 1 type metric is used as a distance measure in the KNN.","Arslan, Hilal; Arslan, Hasan",,511,24

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data‐fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS‐CoV‐2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four‐phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients’ being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy.

However, introduction and uptake timelines have not been comprehensively assessed across the portfolio of Gavi-supported vaccines. METHODS: We analysed median times between introduction milestones from vaccine licensure to country introduction and uptake across six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), three delivery platforms and 69 Gavi-supported countries. Data were gathered from public, partner and manufacturer records. VPDs and prequalified vaccines analysed included Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-HepB-Hib, pentavalent), pneumococcal disease (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV), rotavirus diarrhoea (rotavirus vaccine, RVV), cervical cancer (human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV), polio (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) and meningococcal meningitis (meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine, MenA). RESULTS: Median time from first vaccine licensure to first Gavi-supported country introduction across VPDs at a ‘global level’ (Gavi-supported countries) was 5.4 years. Once licensed, MenA vaccines reached first introduction fastest (campaign=0.6 years; routine immunisation (RI)=1.7 years). Most introductions were delayed. Country uptake following first introduction was accelerated for more recently Gavi-supported RI vaccines compared with older ones. CONCLUSION: Factors accelerating timelines across delivery platforms included rapid product prequalifications by WHO, strong initial recommendations by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, achieving target product profiles on first vaccine licensure within a VPD and completing several VPD milestones at a global level prior to licensure. Milestones required for introduction in Gavi-supported countries should start prior or in parallel to licensure to accelerate uptake of vaccines delivered through diverse delivery platforms.","Luthra, Karuna; Zimmermann Jin, Anna; Vasudevan, Prarthana; Kirk, Karen; Marzetta, Carol; Privor-Dumm, Lois",BMJ Glob Health,511,16

Nanoscale drug delivery systems have the ability to improve the pharmacokinetics and pharmakodynamics of agents allowing an increase in the biodistribution of therapeutic agents to target organs, resulting in improved efficacy with reduction in drug toxicity. These systems are exploited for therapeutic purpose to carry the drug in the body in a controlled manner from the site of administration to the therapeutic target. Hence, it is an attractive strategy to test potential targets for ALI/ARDS using nanotechnology. To this end, we have identified several potential targets and proposed the delivery of these agents using nanomicelles to improve the drug delivery.","Sadikot, Ruxana T.",Methods Enzymol,511,20

IoT sensors like temperature sensors, motion sensors, GPS or connected devices convey the activity of the environment. Sensor information acquired by such IoT devices are then stored in a blockchain. Data on a blockchain remains immutable however its scalability still remains a challenging issue and thus represents a hindrance for its mass adoption in the IoT. Here a communication system based on IOTA and DLT is discussed with a systematic architecture for IoT devices and a future machine-to-machine (M2M) economy. The data communication between IoT devices is analyzed using multiple use cases such as sending DHT-11 sensor data to the IOTA tangle. The value communication is analyzed using a novel “micro-payment enabled over the top” (MP-OTT) streaming platform that is based on the “pay-as-you-go” and “consumption based” models to showcase IOTA value transactions. In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the classical “masked authenticated message” (MAM) communication protocol and two architectures called dual signature masked authenticated message (DSMAM) and index-based address value transaction (IBAVT). Further, we provided an empirical analysis and discussion of the proposed techniques. The implemented solution provides better address management with secured sharing and communication of IoT data, complete access control over the ownership of data and high scalability in terms of number of transactions that can be handled.","Akhtar, Mohd Majid; Rizvi, Danish Raza; Ahad, Mohd Abdul; Kanhere, Salil S.; Amjad, Mohammad; Coviello, Giuseppe",Sensors (Basel),511,16

A narrative review on lights and shadows,18.095182,6.065786,2021,"Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β and the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase PKR are two sentinel kinases that carry-out multiple similar yet distinct functions in both the cytosol and the nucleus. While these kinases belong to separate signal transduction cascades, they demonstrate an uncanny propensity to regulate many of the same proteins either through direct phosphorylation or by altering transcription/translation, including: c-MYC, NF-κB, p53 and TAU, as well as each another. A significant number of studies centered on the GSK3 kinases have led to the identification of the GSK3 interactome and a number of substrates, which link GSK3 activity to metabolic control, translation, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, cellular division, DNA repair and stress/inflammatory signaling. Interestingly, many of these same pathways and processes are controlled by PKR, but unlike the GSK3 kinases, a clear picture of proteins interacting with PKR and a complete listing of its substrates is still missing. In this review, we take a detailed look at what is known about the PKR and GSK3 kinases, how these kinases interact to influence common cellular processes (innate immunity, alternative splicing, translation, glucose metabolism) and how aberrant activation of these kinases leads to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer.","Piazzi, Manuela; Bavelloni, Alberto; Faenza, Irene; Blalock, William",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,511,22

This has been conventionally achieved by using methodologies such as single nucleotide insertion/deletion in coding sequences, exon(s) deletion, mutations in the promoter region, introducing stop codon for protein truncation, and addition of foreign DNA for functional elucidation of genes. However, recent years have witnessed the advent of novel techniques that use programmable site-specific nucleases like CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, ZFNs, Cre/loxP system, and gene trapping. These have revolutionized the field of experimental transgenesis as well as contributed to the existing knowledge base of classical genetics and gene mapping. Yet there are certain experimental/technological barriers that we have been unable to cross while creating genetically modified organisms. Firstly, while interfering with coding strands, we inadvertently change introns, antisense strands, and other non-coding elements of the gene and genome that play integral roles in the determination of cellular phenotype. These unintended modifications become critical because introns and other non-coding elements, although traditionally regarded as “junk DNA,” have been found to play a major regulatory role in genetic pathways of several crucial cellular processes, development, homeostasis, and diseases. Secondly, post-insertion of transgene, non-coding RNAs are generated by host organism against the inserted foreign DNA or from the inserted transgene/construct against the host genes. The potential contribution of these non-coding RNAs to the resulting phenotype has not been considered. We aim to draw attention to these inherent flaws in the transgenic technology being employed to generate mutant mice and other model organisms. By overlooking these aspects of the whole gene and genetic makeup, perhaps our current understanding of gene function remains incomplete. Thus, it becomes important that, while using genetic engineering techniques to generate a mutant organism for a particular gene, we should carefully consider all the possible elements that may play a potential role in the resulting phenotype. This perspective highlights the commonly used mouse strains and the most probable associated complexities that have not been considered previously, resulting in possible limitations in the currently utilized transgenic technology. This work also warrants the use of already established mouse lines in further research.","Ghosh, Anuran; Chakrabarti, Rituparna; Shukla, Praphulla Chandra",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,511,29

Under such circumstances, individuals with the features of cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, and metacognitive beliefs in negative thoughts may suffer more fears than those without these features. Therefore, the present study proposed a model to understand the associations between problematic internet use (PIU), cyberchondria, anxiety sensitivity, metacognition beliefs, and fear of COVID-19. Utilizing a cross-sectional online survey, 651 Iranians completed the following psychometric scales: Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30), Anxiety Sensitivity Questionnaire (ASI), Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Form (CSS-12), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV–19S), and Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the proposed model via several fit indices. The indices include Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The fit indices (CFI = 0.948, TLI = 0.938, RMSEA = 0.053, and SRMR = 0.001) indicated the good fit between the data and the proposed model. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 was significantly and directly predicted by cyberchondria (β = 0.479, p < .001) and anxiety sensitivity (β = 0.286, p < .001). The relationship between PIU and cyberchondria with fear of COVID-19 was mediated significantly by anxiety sensitivity and metacognitive beliefs. Because fear of COVID-19 was found to be significantly associated with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity, healthcare providers may want to provide additional support for those with cyberchondria and anxiety sensitivity tendencies.","Seyed Hashemi, Seyed Ghasem; Hosseinnezhad, Shalaleh; Dini, Solmaz; Griffiths, Mark D.; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H.",Heliyon,511,26

In the U.S.A., some governing bodies have already weakened or repealed guidelines for nonpharmaceutical intervention use, despite a recent spike in national COVID-19 cases and majority population of unvaccinated individuals. Recent modeling suggests that repealing nonpharmaceutical intervention guidelines too early into vaccine rollouts will lead to localized increases in COVID-19 cases, but the magnitude of nonpharmaceutical intervention effects on individual-level SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in fully- and partially-vaccinated populations is unclear. We use a previously-published agent-based model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in indoor gatherings of varying durations, population densities, and vaccination coverage levels. By simulating nonpharmaceutical interventions in some gatherings but not others, we were able to quantify the difference in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk when nonpharmaceutical interventions were used, relative to scenarios with no nonpharmaceutical interventions. We found that nonpharmaceutical interventions will often reduce secondary attack rates, especially during brief interactions, and therefore there is no definitive vaccination coverage level that makes nonpharmaceutical interventions completely redundant. However, the reduction effect on absolute SARS-CoV-2 infection risk conferred by nonpharmaceutical interventions is likely proportional to COVID-19 prevalence. Therefore, if COVID-19 prevalence decreases in the future, nonpharmaceutical interventions will likely still confer protective effects but potential benefits may be small enough to remain within “effectively negligible” risk thresholds.","Farthing, Trevor S.; Lanzas, Cristina",medRxiv,511,9

Emergency medicine interns this year began their training during a time of great need for skilled medical professionals and with less clinical experience than those of prior years. Methods: We conducted a 60-minute semi-structured focus group with 18 EM interns at a single residency program in July 2020. A recording of the interview was transcribed and de-identified. Using qualitative methods, initial coding was performed independently using an inductive and iterative process by two study authors with experience in qualitative methodology. Once saturation was achieved, final codes were re-applied by an initial coder and a third author. After consensus discussion, agreement reached 100%, and codes were grouped for thematic analysis. Results: We identified two major themes: education and professional identity formation. Interns expressed concerns about the quality and breadth of their medical training during the COVID pandemic. Interns also voiced frustration with the politicization of medicine and uncertainty about their roles as physicians and public health advocates during the pandemic. Minor themes included physical health, mental health, and grief related to COVID-19. Interns reported experiencing several unique challenges to their emotional and mental health, including socially distancing during a period in their training when they traditionally rely on additional support systems and build new relationships. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that new EM interns have significant concerns about their medical knowledge and the quality of their education as well as their identity as emergency physicians and public health advocates during the COVID pandemic. EM interns also reported unique challenges to their physical and mental health. These results may inform future decisions regarding dedicated support and training necessary for this unique group of learners.

The professional culture of the house of medicine not only mimics society in attributing stigma to people with mental health issues but may also contribute to high rates of suicide in the ranks of health care professionals by leading to a delay in seeking treatment. Acculturation accelerates in the first year of medical school such that medical students experience an increase in burnout and depressive symptoms from prematriculation levels. It follows that faculty have a responsibility to improve the learning environment. Survey data from medical faculty at the author’s institution showed that depression decreased respondents’ willingness to seek mental health treatment because of the stigma and issues of access to help. Faculty attitudes toward mental health issues, including reluctance to admit having such issues, may be conveyed to medical students in the hidden curriculum that teaches them to keep depression hidden. Moreover, the fear of mental disorders is manifested in licensing and privileging applications under the guise of patient safety, contributing to a culture of shame and silence. As creators and guardians of this professional culture, medical faculty and other physicians must be the ones who change it. The same faculty who play a part in causing and perpetuating stigma related to mental health issues have the power to derive and enact some of the solutions.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done in HCWs belonging to various occupational roles and socio-cultural backgrounds across India through online platforms and telephonic interviews from July 30, 2020 to August 30, 2020. A scientifically designed and pre-validated questionnaire with good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85) was used. RESULTS: The responses of 956 participants were analysed. Various suboptimal practices like touching outer surface of masks, lack of social distancing in cafeteria and duty rooms, inability to wash hands for adequate duration and properly follow steps of hand hygiene, inability to don and doff PPE properly, carrying PPE to duty rooms before completely doffing, use of personal mobile phones during duty and improper sleep were identified. Lack of knowledge, long duty hours, shortage of PPE, high patient workload, and casual attitude regarding own safety were identified as important barriers. Resident doctors and paramedical staff in the age group 18–30 years reported lower adherence.

The results show that as time changed COVID-19 presented an obvious dynamic distribution in space. It gradually migrated from the southwest region of Hebei Province to the northeast region. The factors affecting the moving patterns may be the migration and flow of population between and within the province, the economic development level and the development of road traffic of each city. It can be divided into three stages in terms of time.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the changes in perceived stress following a 10-week digital MBSR program that combined an app-based digital program with weekly one-on-one remote sessions with a health coach. METHODS: This study used a retrospective, observational design. A total of 229 participants with moderate-to-high perceived stress scores as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-10 enrolled in the 10-week Vida Health MBSR program. The program included weekly remote sessions with a certified health coach and digital content based on concepts fundamental to mindfulness practice. The PSS-10 was used to evaluate perceived stress. Of the 229 participants, 131 (57.2%) were considered program completers and provided at least one follow-up PSS-10. A secondary analysis examined the changes in stress scores at 6 months. This analysis was restricted to participants who had been enrolled in the program for at least 6 months (n=121). To account for random and fixed effects, linear mixed effects modeling was used to assess changes in stress scores over time. An intention-to-treat approach was used to evaluate the changes in perceived stress across the entire study cohort, including those who were lost to follow-up. In addition, a reliable change index was computed to evaluate the changes in scores from the baseline. RESULTS: The findings revealed a significant positive association between program time and stress reduction (B=−0.365; P<.001) at 12 weeks. We observed an average reduction in stress scores of 3.17 points (95% CI −3.93 to −2.44) by program week 6 and 4.86 points (95% CI −5.86 to −3.85) by program week 12. Overall, 83.2% (109/131) of participants showed a reduction in stress scores by week 12, with 40.5% (53/131) of participants showing reliable improvement at 12 weeks and 47.8% (56/131) of participants showing a shift to a lower stress level category (ie, moderate-to-low stress). The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a significant, although attenuated, reduction in stress scores at 12 weeks (B=−0.23; P<.001). Participants who completed more lessons had an increased likelihood of moving down at least one stress level category (odds ratio 1.512, 95% CI 1.056 to 2.166; P=.02). In assessing medium-term outcomes, among participants who had completed at least 6 months in the program, 48.8% (59/121) of members provided a 6-month assessment. We observed a significant reduction in stress scores at 6 months (t58=10.24; P<.001), with 61% (36/59) of participants showing reliable improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this retrospective, observational study suggest that a blended, digital mindfulness-based intervention may support program uptake and meaningful, sustained reduction in stress outcomes.","Venkatesan, Aarathi; Krymis, Holly; Scharff, Jenny; Waber, Art",JMIR Form Res,511,1

Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2–spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody.

Consequently, the conventional CACC system relies heavily on the quality of communications, which means that the regular CACC platoon is sensitive to the communication failure. Therefore, in this paper, a Safety Reinforced Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (SR-CACC) strategy is proposed to resist unexpected communication failure. Different from the regular CACC system, the safety enhanced platoon control system is embedded with a dual-branch control strategy. When a fatal wireless communication failure is detected and confirmed, the SR-CACC system will automatically activate the alternative sensor-based adaptive cruise control strategy. Moreover, to make the transforming process smooth, a linear smooth transition algorithm is added to the SR-CACC system. Then, to verify the performance of the proposed SR-CACC system, we conducted a simulation experiment with a heterogonous platoon constructed with eight vehicles. The experiments results reveal that, under the extremely poor communication environment, the proposed SR-CACC strategy can significantly improve the safety performance of the organized vehicle platoon.","Liu, Yi; Wang, Wei",Sensors,511,30

Though various therapeutic possibilities have been tested against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most adequate treatment has not yet been established. Propolis is a natural product with considerable evidence of immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, and experimental data point to potential against viral targets. We hypothesized that propolis can reduce the negative effects of COVID-19. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, open-label, single center trial, hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients were treated with a standardized green propolis extract (EPP-AF®️) as an adjunct therapy. Patients were allocated to receive standard care plus an oral dose of 400 mg or 800 mg/day of green propolis for seven days, or standard care alone. Standard care included all necessary interventions, as determined by the attending physician. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the length of hospital stay or oxygen therapy dependency duration. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury and need for intensive care or vasoactive drugs. Patients were followed for 28 days after admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 124 patients; 40 were assigned to EPP-AF®️ 400 mg/day, 42 to EPP-AF®️ 800 mg/day, and 42 to the control group. The length of hospital stay post-intervention was shorter in both propolis groups than in the control group; lower dose, median 7 days versus 12 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.23 to -0.07; p=0.049) and higher dose, median 6 days versus 12 days (95% CI -7.00 to -1.09; p=0.009). Propolis did not significantly affect the need for oxygen supplementation. In the high dose propolis group, there was a lower rate of acute kidney injury than in the controls (4.8 vs 23.8%), (odds ratio [OR] 0.18; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.84; p=0.048). No patient had propolis treatment discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of propolis to the standard care procedures resulted in clinical benefits for the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially evidenced by a reduction in the length of hospital stay. Consequently, we conclude that propolis can reduce the impact of COVID-19.","Silveira, Marcelo Augusto Duarte; Jong, David De; Berretta, Andresa Aparecida; Galvão, Erica Batista dos Santos; Ribeiro, Juliana Caldas; Cerqueira-Silva, Thiago; Amorim, Thais Chaves; Conceição, Luis Filipe Miranda Rebelo da; Gomes, Marcel Miranda Dantas; Teixeira, Maurício Brito; Souza, Sergio Pinto de; Santos, Marcele Helena Celestino Alves dos; Martin, Raissa Lanna Araújo San; Silva, Márcio de Oliveira; Lírio, Monique; Moreno, Lis; Sampaio, Julio Cezar Miranda; Mendonça, Renata; Ultchak, Silviana Salles; Amorim, Fabio Santos; Ramos, João Gabriel Rosa; Batista, Paulo Benigno Pena; Guarda, Suzete Nascimento Farias da; Mendes, Ana Verena Almeida; Passos, Rogerio da Hora",Biomed Pharmacother,511,1

We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years. Methods By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021. Findings As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9. Interpretation Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.","Victora, C.

The repositioning process involves lower risks and costs than the de novo development of novel antimicrobial drugs. Currently, infections by adenovirus show a steady increment with a high clinical impact in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. The lack of a safe and efficacious drug to treat these infections supports the search for new antiviral drugs. Here we evaluated the anti-adenovirus activity of niclosanide, oxyclozanide, and rafoxanide, three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs. Also, we carried out the cytotoxicity evaluation and partial characterization of the mechanism of action of these drugs. The salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs showed significant anti-adenovirus activity at low micromolar concentrations with little cytotoxicity. Moreover, our mechanistic assays suggest differences in the way the drugs exert anti-adenovirus activity. Niclosamide and rafoxanide target transport of the HAdV particle from the endosome to the nuclear envelope, whilst oxyclozanide specifically targets adenovirus immediately early gene E1A transcription. Data suggests that the studied salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs could be suitable for further clinical evaluation for the development of new antiviral drugs to treat infections by adenovirus in immunosuppressed patients and in immunocompetent individuals with community-acquired pneumonia.","Marrugal-Lorenzo, José A.; Serna-Gallego, Ana; Berastegui-Cabrera, Judith; Pachón, Jerónimo; Sánchez-Céspedes, Javier",Sci Rep,511,28

Although evidence shows that improving gender equality contributes to the achievement of health outcomes, gender-based constraints faced by CHWs working with social enterprises in Africa have not yet been empirically studied. This study is the first of its kind to address this important gap in knowledge. METHODS: We conducted 36 key informant interviews and 21 focus group discussions between 2016 and 2019 (for a total of 175 individuals: 106 women and 69 men) with four health social enterprises in Uganda and Kenya and other related key stakeholders and domain experts. Interview and focus group transcripts were coded according to gender-based constraints and strategies for enhanced performance as well as key sites for intervention. RESULTS: We found that CHW programs can be more gender responsive. We introduce the Gender Integration Continuum for Health Social Enterprises as a tool that can help guide gender equality efforts. Data revealed female CHWs face seven unique gender-based constraints (compared to male CHWs): 1) higher time burden and lack of economic empowerment; 2) risks to personal safety; 3) lack of career advancement and leadership opportunities; 4) lack of access to needed equipment, medicines and transport; 5) lack of access to capital; 6) lack of access to social support and networking opportunities; and 7) insufficient financial and non-financial incentives. Data also revealed four key areas of intervention: 1) the health social enterprise; 2) the CHW; 3) the CHW’s partner; and 4) the CHW’s patients. In each of the four areas, gender responsive strategies were identified to overcome constraints and contribute to improved gender equality and community health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of its kind to identify the key gender-based constraints and gender responsive strategies for health social enterprises in Africa using CHWs. Findings can assist organizations working with CHWs in Africa (social enterprises, governments or non-governmental organizations) to develop gender responsive strategies that increase the gender and health outcomes while improving gender equality for CHWs, their families, and their communities.

Despite ART-mediated suppression of viral replication, ART is not a cure and is associated with viral persistence, residual inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. Indeed, due to the presence of viral reservoirs, lifelong ART therapy is required to control viremia and prevent disease progression into acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Successful ART treatment allows people living with HIV (PLHIV) to achieve a similar life expectancy to uninfected individuals. However, recent studies have illustrated the presence of increased comorbidities, such as accelerated, premature immune aging, in ART-controlled PLHIV compared to uninfected individuals. Studies suggest that both HIV-infection and ART-treatment lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately resulting in cellular exhaustion, senescence, and apoptosis. Since mitochondria are essential cellular organelles for energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism, their compromise leads to decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ATP synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and beta-oxidation, abnormal cell homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of mitochondrial DNA mutations and cellular apoptosis. The progressive mitochondrial damage induced by HIV-infection and ART-treatment likely contributes to accelerated aging, senescence, and cellular dysfunction in PLHIV. This review discusses the connections between mitochondrial compromise and cellular dysfunction associated with HIV- and ART-induced toxicities, providing new insights into how HIV and current ART directly impact mitochondrial functions and contribute to cellular senescence and aging in PLHIV. Identifying this nexus and potential mechanisms may be beneficial in developing improved therapeutics for treating PLHIV.","Schank, Madison; Zhao, Juan; Moorman, Jonathan P.; Yao, Zhi Q.",Cells,511,1

This is supported by the clinical observation that about half of COVID-19 patients exhibit gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We asked whether the analysis of plasma could provide insight into gut barrier dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 infection. Plasma samples of COVID-19 patients (n=30) and healthy control (n=16) were collected during hospitalization. Plasma microbiome was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, metatranscriptomic analysis, and gut permeability markers including FABP-2, PGN and LPS in both patient cohorts. Almost 65% (9 out 14) COVID-19 patients showed abnormal presence of gut microbes in their bloodstream. Plasma samples contained predominately Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The abundance of gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter, Nitrospirillum, Cupriavidus, Pseudomonas, Aquabacterium, Burkholderia, Caballeronia, Parabhurkholderia, Bravibacterium, and Sphingomonas) was higher than the gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus) in COVID-19 subjects. The levels of plasma gut permeability markers FABP2 (1282±199.6 vs 838.1±91.33; p=0.0757), PGN (34.64±3.178 vs 17.53±2.12; p<0.0001), and LPS (405.5±48.37 vs 249.6±17.06; p=0.0049) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy subjects. These findings support that the intestine may represent a source for bacteremia and may contribute to worsening COVID-19 outcomes.

Although they signal through distinct receptors, type I (IFN-α/β) and type III IFNs elicit remarkably similar responses in cells. However, in vivo, type III and type I IFN responses are not fully redundant as their respective contribution to the antiviral defense highly depends on virus species. IFN-λ is much more potent than IFN-α/β at controlling rotavirus infection. In contrast, clearance of several other viruses, such as influenza virus, mostly depends on IFN-α/β. The IFN-λ receptor was reported to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. Cells responsible for IFN-λ production are still poorly characterized but seem to overlap only partly IFN-α/β-producing cells. Accumulating data suggest that epithelial cells are also important IFN-λ producers. Thus, IFN-λ may primarily act as a protection of mucosal entities, such as the lung, skin or digestive tract. Type I and type III IFN signal transduction pathways largely overlap, and cross talk between these IFN systems occurs. Finally, this review addresses the potential benefit of IFN-λ use for therapeutic purposes and summarizes recent results of genome-wide association studies that identified polymorphisms in the region of the IFN-λ3 gene impacting on the outcome of treatments against hepatitis C virus infection.","Hermant, Pascale; Michiels, Thomas",Journal of Innate Immunity,511,20

However, others, including cardiovascular conditions, do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development. Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity. This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics, such as COVID-19. To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure, we analyzed time-series for the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of men’s population (mmHg) and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC) for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearson’s correlation (r). Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted-U shaped curve, or a ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’. There is a positive correlation (increase GDPPC, increase SBP) in low-income countries, and a negative correlation in high-income countries (increase GDPPC, decrease SBP). As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education, which affects blood pressure. However, the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income. Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop, and therefore, avoiding the ‘Heart Kuznets Curve’ and its economic and human impacts.","Nagano, Hitoshi; Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Barros, Allan Kardec; Costa Junior, Altair da Silva",World Development,511,24

To date, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) entry and altered biochemistry of the glial cell upon infection are elusive. In this study, we detected biomolecular changes in human glial cells, namely, HMC-3 (microglia) and U-87 MG (astrocytes), at two variable cellular locations (nucleus and periphery) by Raman spectroscopy post-EBV infection at different time points. Two possible phenomena, one attributed to the response of the cell to viral attachment and invasion and the other involved in duplication of the virus followed by egress from the host cell, are investigated. These changes corresponded to unique Raman spectra associated with specific biomolecules in the infected and the uninfected cells. The Raman signals from the nucleus and periphery of the cell also varied, indicating differential biochemistry and signaling processes involved in infection progression at these locations. Molecules such as cholesterol, glucose, hyaluronan, phenylalanine, phosphoinositide, etc. are associated with the alterations in the cellular biochemical homeostasis. These molecules are mainly responsible for cellular processes such as lipid transport, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the cells. Raman signatures of these molecules at distinct time points of infection indicated their periodic involvement, depending on the stage of virus infection. Therefore, it is possible to discern the details of variability in EBV infection progression in glial cells at the biomolecular level using time-dependent in vitro Raman scattering.","Tiwari, Deeksha; Jakhmola, Shweta; Pathak, Devesh K.; Kumar, Rajesh; Jha, Hem Chandra",ACS Omega,511,23

Even if the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms (ECG) performed in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ. 50 consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500mg Day 1 and 250mg daily days 2 to 5). Twelve-lead ECG were performed before treatment, at Day 3, 5 and at discharge. Median age of patients was 68 years, 55.2% were males. Main comorbidities were hypertension (37%) and diabetes (17%). Mean QTc was 408 ms at baseline and rose up to 437 ms at Day 3 and to 456 ms at Day 5. 38 patients (76 %) presented short term modifications of QTc (> 30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%) leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No death, no cardiac arrhythmic event were observed in this cohort. Our report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ + AZ modifies QTc interval. Treatment has to be stopped for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequence of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ+AZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow to do it in safe conditions.","Voisin, Olivier; Lorc’h, Erwan le; Mahé, Annabelle; Azria, Philippe; Borie, Marie-Françoise; Hubert, Sidonie; Ménage, Elodie; Guillerm, Jean-Christophe; Mourad, Jean-Jacques",Mayo Clin Proc,511,1

Advancements in care mean improved chances of survival at 6-months for older adults following injury to the brain or spine. The Covid-19 pandemic also resulted in local and national policies aimed at protecting the elderly. We sought to evaluate referral patterns and outcomes for patients ≥80 years referred to our institution during this period. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate referral patterns and outcomes for patients ≥80 years referred to our institution both before and during the coronavirus pandemic. Design Retrospective observational cohort study Setting Tertiary care in a developing major trauma centre (Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow) Participants All patients ≥80 years referred to the on-call neurosurgical service over two four-month periods before (2016-17; n= 1573) and after the onset of Covid-19 (2020; n=2014) METHODS: Data on demographics, ASA, diagnosis and referral decision were collected. 30-day and 6-month mortality and functional independence assessed. RESULTS: 246(before) and 335(during Covid-19) referred patients were ≥80 years. No gender bias. A significant increase (17%) in acute trauma was seen during the pandemic months. Fewer older adults were transferred (6% to 2% Covid-19) for specialist care, most commonly for chronic subdural haematoma. Most (47% pre and 63% during Covid-19) were alive, home and independent at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians feature disproportionately in acute adult neurosurgical referrals.

This issue of Clinical Kidney Journal provides further evidence of complement activation involvement in COVID-19. Taking advantage of the unique repeat access to chronic haemodialysis patients, the differential time course of C3 and C5 activation in relation to inflammation and severity of disease have been characterized. This further points to complement as a therapeutic target. Indeed, clinical trials targeting diverse components of complement are ongoing. However, a unique case of COVID-19 in a patient with pre-existent atypical haemolytic syndrome on chronic eculizumab therapy suggests that even early eculizumab may fail to prevent disease progression to a severe stage. Finally, preclinical studies in endotoxaemia, another hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by lung and kidney injury, suggest that cilastatin, an inexpensive drug already in clinical use, may provide tissue protection against hyperinflammation in COVID-19.","Ortiz, Alberto",Clin Kidney J,511,1

There is a limited availability of hospital resources in this or any pandemic, and appropriately gauging severity would allow for some patients to safely recover in home quarantine, while ensuring that sicker patients get needed care. Methods We here developed a blood-based generalizable host-gene-expression-based classifier for the severity of viral infections and validated it in multiple viral infection settings including COVID-19. We used training data (N=705) from 21 retrospective transcriptomic clinical studies of influenza and other viral illnesses looking at a preselected panel of host immune mRNAs. Results We selected 6 host mRNAs and trained a logistic regression classifier with a training cross-validation AUROC of 0.90 for predicting 30-day mortality in viral illnesses. Next, in 1,417 samples across 21 independent retrospective validation cohorts the locked 6-mRNA classifier had an AUROC of 0.91 for discriminating patients with severe vs. non-severe infection. Next, in an independent cohort of prospectively enrolled patients with confirmed COVID-19 (N=97) in Athens, Greece, the 6-mRNA locked classifier had an AUROC of 0.89 for identifying patients with severe respiratory failure or 30-day mortality. Finally, we developed an isothermal qRT-LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal gene expression) assay for the 6-mRNA panel to facilitate implementation as a rapid assay. Conclusions With further study, the classifier could assist in the risk assessment of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 to determine severity and level of care, thereby improving patient management and healthcare burden.","Buturovic, L.; Zheng, H.; Tang, B.; Lai, K.; Kuan, W.

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computer vision (CV) approaches find useful for the recognition, analysis, and prediction of COVID-19. Several ML and DL techniques are trained to resolve the supervised learning issue. At the same time, the potential measure of the unsupervised learning technique is quite high. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques can be designed in the existing DL models for proficient COVID-19 prediction. In this view, this paper introduces a novel unsupervised DL based variational autoencoder (UDL-VAE) model for COVID-19 detection and classification. The UDL-VAE model involved adaptive Wiener filtering (AWF) based preprocessing technique to enhance the image quality. Besides, Inception v4 with Adagrad technique is employed as a feature extractor and unsupervised VAE model is applied for the classification process. In order to verify the superior diagnostic performance of the UDL-VAE model, a set of experimentation was carried out to highlight the effective outcome of the UDL-VAE model. The obtained experimental values showcased the effectual results of the UDL-VAE model with the higher accuracy of 0.987 and 0.992 on the binary and multiple classes respectively.","Mansour, Romany F.; Escorcia-Gutierrez, José; Gamarra, Margarita; Gupta, Deepak; Castillo, Oscar; Kumar, Sachin",Pattern Recognit Lett,511,16

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 and has been linked with severe hyperinflammation. Dexamethasone has emerged as standard of care for COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. In a non-randomized prospective phase II multi-center study, we asked whether targeted inhibition of Janus kinase-mediated cytokine signaling using ruxolitinib is feasible and efficacious in SARS-CoV-2- induced ARDS with hyperinflammation. Sixteen SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for ARDS were treated with ruxolitinib in addition to standard treatment. Ruxolitinib treatment was well tolerated and 13 patients survived at least the first 28 days on treatment, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. Immediate start of ruxolitinib after deterioration was associated with improved outcome, as was a lymphocyte-to-neutrophils ratio above 0.07. Together, treatment with the janus-kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib is feasible and might be efficacious in COVID-19 induced ARDS patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with peer support workers (PSWs) experience not only the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences but also feel hope in the possibility of recovery. So far, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs with PSWs that has been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a web-based intervention facilitated by PSWs. The five principal research questions are whether this intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery, (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. This will help us assess the impact of PSWs in this setting. METHODS: PSWs will lead a typical informal peer support group within the larger context of online peer support groups, focusing on personal-civic recovery. They will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be 2 experimental subgroups—patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10) and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10)—compared to a control group (n=10). Random assignment to the intervention and control arms will be conducted using a 2:1 ratio. Several instruments will be used to assess clinical recovery (eg, the Recovery Assessment Scale, the Citizenship Measure questionnaire). The COVID-19 Stress Scales will be used to assess effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to COVID-19. Changes will be compared between groups from baseline to endpoint in the intervention and control groups using the Student paired sample t test. RESULTS: This pilot study was funded in March 2020. The protocol was approved on June 16, 2020, by the Research Ethics Committees of the Montreal Mental Health University Institute. Recruitment took place during the months of July and August, and results are expected in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Study results will provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of a web-based intervention provided by PSWs. The investigators, alongside key decision makers and patient partners, will ensure knowledge translation throughout, and our massive open online course (MOOC), The Fundamentals of Recovery, will be updated with the evidence and new knowledge generated by this feasibility study.

The usage of microbial cell-free DNA for the detection and identification of invasive fungal infection has been considered as a potential alternative to invasive procedures allowing for rapid results. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to assess the budget implications of using the Karius(®) Test in patients suspected of invasive fungal infection in an average state in the USA from a healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: The analysis used a decision tree to capture key stages of the patient pathway, from suspected invasive fungal infection to either receiving treatment for invasive fungal infection or being confirmed as having no invasive fungal infection. The analysis used published costs and resource use from a targeted review of the literature. Because of the paucity of published evidence on the reduction of diagnostic tests displaced by the Karius Test, the analysis used a 50% reduction in the use of bronchoscopy and/or bronchoalveolar lavage. The impact of this reduction was tested in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: The results of the analysis show that the introduction of the Karius Test is associated with a cost saving of US$2277 per patient; when multiplied by the estimated number of cases per year, the cost saving is US$17,039,666. The scenario analysis showed that the Karius Test only had an incremental cost of US$87 per patient when there was no reduction in bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS: The Karius Test may offer a valuable and timely option for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection through its non-invasive approach and subsequent cost savings.","MacIntyre, Ann T.; Hirst, Alex; Duttagupta, Radha; Hollemon, Desiree; Hong, David K.; Blauwkamp, Timothy A.",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,511,15

Adopting a ‘uses and gratifications’ approach, and using a previously established five-factor scale, we examine the relationship between individuals’ motives for using social media and their personality traits. Hundred and eighty-nine social media users living in the United Kingdom completed surveys assessing their motives for using social media and their personality. Our findings demonstrate that participants were generally motivated to use social media to ‘pass time’ and to ‘maintain relationships.’ Further, we find that those high in extraversion in particular use social media to ‘maintain relationships.’ By comparing our findings to previous studies where face-to-face interaction was not restricted, our findings indicate that individuals’ motives for using social media change when they are placed under physical distancing restrictions. We reflect on the potential application of our findings for others experiencing similar conditions, such as those working in remote locations, as well as the potential implications for living in a post-pandemic world with increased virtual ‘meetings’ using social media.","Bowden-Green, Thomas; Hinds, Joanne; Joinson, Adam",Front Psychol,511,16

The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the spike precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons (IFNs) and, more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2, rather than IFITM3, and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Importantly, removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH and cathepsin dependent in late endosomes, where, like SARS-CoV-1 spike, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we found that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests that therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs. IMPORTANCE The furin cleavage site in the spike protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals, compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2 and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site, which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest that one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus, it may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.","Winstone, Helena; Lista, Maria Jose; Reid, Alisha C.; Bouton, Clement; Pickering, Suzanne; Galao, Rui Pedro; Kerridge, Claire; Doores, Katie J.; Swanson, Chad M.; Neil, Stuart J.

SPS affects approximately 1 patient per million population per year. The effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been established, but studies on the long‐term efficacy of regular IVIG are limited. OBJECTIVES: To review clinical details and long‐term treatment response using a patient‐reported questionnaire in SPS and related syndromes. METHODS: Patients were identified from a tertiary neuroimmunology clinic based on classical clinical symptoms, autoimmune profiles, and neurophysiological changes (Dalakas criteria). They were followed up after treatment to assess the response to IVIG. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Patients' demographic profiles and clinical presentations were akin to that reported in literature. There was significant improvement in the functional ability (assessed by the modified Rankin scale [mRS]) and quality of life (QoL) following treatment with IVIG within 4 to 10 weeks (pre‐mRS vs. post‐mRS, P < 0.0001; pre‐QoL vs. post‐QoL, P = 0.0003) and sustained after 5 years of treatment (pre‐mRS vs. present mRS, P = 0.0003; pre‐QoL vs. present QoL, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This article describes one of the largest single‐center experiences of 23 patients with SPS and related syndromes and is the first to establish the long‐term efficacy of regular IVIG using a patient‐reported scoring system (Birmingham Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy [BRIT]). Consistent improvement in QoL and functional scores were seen over nearly 5 years after regular use of IVIG. It is recommended to use BRIT scores to assess the initial response as well as to monitor continued improvement to immunomodulation in SPS.","Bose, Smriti; Thompson, Joseph P.; Sadalage, Girija; Karim, Abid; Jacob, Saiju",Mov Disord Clin Pract,511,20

Information technology offers an opportunity to more closely engage patients with chronic HIV infection in their long-term management and support a focus on HRQL. However, the implementation of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, such as HRQL in routine care, is challenged by the need to synthesize data generated by questionnaires, the complexity of collecting data between patient visits, and the integration of results into clinical decision-making processes. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to design and pilot-test a multimedia software platform to overcome these challenges and provide a vehicle to increase focus on HRQL issues in HIV management. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team in France and Australia conducted the study with 120 patients and 16 doctors contributing to the design and development of the software. We used agile development principles, user-centered design, and qualitative research methods to develop and pilot the software platform. We developed a prototype application to determine the acceptability of the software and piloted the final version with 41 Australian and 19 French residents using 2 validated electronic questionnaires, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items, and the Patient Reported Outcomes Quality of Life-HIV. RESULTS: Testing of the prototype demonstrated that patients wanted an application that was intuitive and without excessive instruction, so it felt effortless to use, as well as secure and discreet. Clinicians wanted the PRO data synthesized, presented clearly and succinctly, and clinically actionable. Safety concerns for patients and clinicians included confidentiality, and the potential for breakdown in communication if insufficient user training was not provided. The final product, piloted with patients from both countries, showed that most respondents found the application easy to use and comprehend. The usability testing survey administered found that older Australians had reduced scores for understanding the visual interface (P=.004) and finding the buttons organized (P=.02). Three-fourths of the respondents were concerned with confidentiality (P=.007), and this result was more prevalent in participants with higher anxiety and stress scores (P=.01), as measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items. These statistical associations were not observed in 15 French patients who completed the same questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Digital applications in health care should be safe and fit for purpose. Our software was acceptable to patients and shows potential to overcome some barriers to the implementation of PROs in routine care. The design of the clinicians’ interface presents a solution to the problem of voluminous data, both synthesizing and providing a snapshot of longitudinal data. The next stage is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether patients experience increased satisfaction with care and whether doctors perceive that they deliver better clinical care without compromising efficiency.","Herrmann, Susan; Power, Brad; Rashidi, Amineh; Cypher, Mark; Mastaglia, Frank; Grace, Amy; McKinnon, Elizabeth; Sarrot, Pierre; Michau, Christophe; Skinner, Matthew; Desai, Renae; Duracinsky, Martin",J Med Internet Res,511,12

Furthermore, MTb infection, Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 ligands, and several proinflammatory cytokines induce IFITM1–3 gene expression in human myeloid cells. We find that IFITM3 co-localizes with early and, in particular, late MTb phagosomes, and overexpression of IFITM3 enhances endosomal acidification in MTb-infected monocytic cells. These findings provide evidence that the antiviral IFITMs participate in the restriction of mycobacterial growth, and they implicate IFITM-mediated endosomal maturation in its antimycobacterial activity.","Ranjbar, Shahin; Haridas, Viraga; Jasenosky, Luke D.; Falvo, James V.; Goldfeld, Anne E.",Cell Rep,511,16

Patients with autoimmune disorders have been reported with a variety of elevated cytokines and cytokines (such as rheumatoid arthritis); thus, we evaluated a limited number of cytokines/chemokines in POTS patients with elevated adrenergic and muscarinic receptor autoantibodies. We utilized the plasma of 34 patients from a previous study; all of the patients (100%) had autoantibodies against the A1 adrenergic receptor and 55.9% (19/34) had autoantibodies against the M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. In particular, the plasma cytokine/chemokine levels were measured as biomarkers of inflammation by Quantibody(®) technology (Raybiotech, Peachtree Corners, GA, USA).

Research Question The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. Study Design and Methods PubMed was searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Results Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.71, p<0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26 - 35.1, p=0.03). No difference in BNP was seen between the two groups.

However, even after a drug, device, diagnostic tool or unique therapeutic procedure successfully navigates through clinical testing to approval, real barriers remain in applying and scaling the innovation in practice. METHODS: Mayo Clinic initiated the Transform the Practice programme to facilitate multidisciplinary team and convergence science to continuously reinvent solutions to address unmet patient needs and accelerate the application of next-generation healthcare solutions. During a 5-year period, 24 programme teams received financial resources, barrier-removing engagement from clinical and research leadership, and enhanced administrative support, including dedicated project managers. RESULTS: The approach created value in facilitating consistent progress toward project objectives and resulted in multiple publications, new extramural funding sources, and implementation of new tests and services into the clinical practice. This report describes the concentrated institutional effort to accelerate the discovery–translation–application continuum in an academic medical centre and highlights successful applications and persistent obstacles. CONCLUSIONS: The Transform the Practice approach is effective in moving high-potential research discoveries closer to implementation in the clinical practice.

Rural communities often have a higher proportion of residents who lack health insurance, live with comorbidities or disabilities, are aged ≥65 years, and have limited access to health care facilities with intensive care capabilities, which places these residents at increased risk for COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality (2,3). To better understand COVID-19 vaccination disparities across the urban-rural continuum, CDC analyzed county-level vaccine administration data among adults aged ≥18 years who received their first dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or a single dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) during December 14, 2020-April 10, 2021 in 50 U.S. jurisdictions (49 states and the District of Columbia [DC]). Adult COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower in rural counties (38.9%) than in urban counties (45.7%) overall and among adults aged 18-64 years (29.1% rural, 37.7% urban), those aged ≥65 years (67.6% rural, 76.1% urban), women (41.7% rural, 48.4% urban), and men (35.3% rural, 41.9% urban). Vaccination coverage varied among jurisdictions: 36 jurisdictions had higher coverage in urban counties, five had higher coverage in rural counties, and five had similar coverage (i.e., within 1%) in urban and rural counties; in four jurisdictions with no rural counties, the urban-rural comparison could not be assessed. A larger proportion of persons in the most rural counties (14.6%) traveled for vaccination to nonadjacent counties (i.e., farther from their county of residence) compared with persons in the most urban counties (10.3%). As availability of COVID-19 vaccines expands, public health practitioners should continue collaborating with health care providers, pharmacies, employers, faith leaders, and other community partners to identify and address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in rural areas (2).","Murthy, Bhavini Patel; Sterrett, Natalie; Weller, Daniel; Zell, Elizabeth; Reynolds, Laura; Toblin, Robin L.; Murthy, Neil; Kriss, Jennifer; Rose, Charles; Cadwell, Betsy; Wang, Alice; Ritchey, Matthew D.; Gibbs-Scharf, Lynn; Qualters, Judith R.; Shaw, Lauren; Brookmeyer, Kathryn A.; Clayton, Heather; Eke, Paul; Adams, Laura; Zajac, Julie; Patel, Anita; Fox, Kimberley; Williams, Charnetta; Stokley, Shannon; Flores, Stephen; Barbour, Kamil E.; Harris, LaTreace Q.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,511,1

The research goal was to compare the effects of weekly personal feedback, based on objectively measured physical activity, on the trends of both daily sedentary time and on the physical activity of BCS (E(−) group) with those of an intervention also including online supervised physical exercise sessions (E(+) group), during the Italy COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: The Italian COVID-19 emergency allowed the possibility to also observe the effects of social and personal limitations. A total of 51 BCS were studied over an 18-week period and had an objective registration of day-to-day sedentary time, physical activity, and sleep. Both subsamples received weekly or fortnight personal feedback. Data were analysed considering four key periods, according to the COVID-19 emergency steps. Results: Statistical analysis showed an additive effect for sedentary time and a multiplicative effect both for light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities. The E(−) group had a high overall sedentary time and a different trend of light-to vigorous and light-intensity physical activities, with a reduction from the 1st to the 2nd periods (national and personal restrictions), showing a significant rise just at the end of the national restrictions. Conclusions: The use of an activity tracker and its accompanying app, with the reception of weekly tailored advice and supervised online physical exercise sessions, can elicit proper physical activity recomposition in BCS in the COVID-19 era.","Di Blasio, Andrea; Morano, Teresa; Lancia, Federica; Viscioni, Gianluca; Di Iorio, Angelo; Grossi, Simona; Cianchetti, Ettore; Cugusi, Lucia; Gobbo, Stefano; Bergamin, Marco; D’Eugenio, Anna; Masini, Laura; Rinaldi, Massimo; Scognamiglio, Maria Teresa; Vamvakis, Anastasios; Napolitano, Giorgio",J Funct Morphol Kinesiol,511,14

METHODS From 312 Malian samples collected prior to 2020, we measured antibodies to the commonly tested SARS-CoV-2 antigens and four other betacoronaviruses by ELISA. In a subset of samples, we assessed antibodies to a panel of P. falciparum antigens by suspension bead array and functional antiviral activity by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. We then evaluated the performance of an ELISA using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain developed in the US using Malian positive and negative control samples. To optimize test performance, we compared single and two-antigen approaches using existing assay cutoffs and population-specific cutoffs. RESULTS Background reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens was common in pre-pandemic Malian samples. SARS-CoV-2 reactivity varied between communities, increased with age, and correlated negligibly-weakly with other betacoronavirus and P. falciparum antibodies. No pre-pandemic samples demonstrated functional activity. Regardless of the cutoffs applied, test specificity improved using a two-antigen approach. Test performance was optimal using a two-antigen assay with population-specific cutoffs [Sensitivity: 73.9% (51.6-89.8), Specificity: 99.4% (97.7-99.9)]. CONCLUSIONS We have addressed the problem of SARS-CoV-2 seroassay performance in Africa by using a two-antigen assay with cutoffs defined by performance in the target population.","Woodford, John; Sagara, Issaka; Dicko, Alassane; Zeguime, Amatigue; Doucoure, M'Bouye; Kwan, Jennifer; Zaidi, Irfan; Doritchamou, Justin; Snow-Smith, Maryonne; Alani, Nada; Renn, Jonathan; Kosik, Ivan; Holly, Jaroslav; Yewdell, Jonathan; Esposito, Dominic; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Duffy, Patrick",The Journal of infectious diseases,511,16

Natural Killer (NK) cells and innate-immune TRAIL suppress transformed and virally-infected cells. ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity. We show MEK inhibitors (MEKi) VS-6766, trametinib and selumetinib reduce ACE2 expression in human cells. In some human cells, remdesivir increases ACE2-promoter luciferase-reporter expression, ACE2 mRNA and protein, and ACE2 expression is attenuated by MEKi. In serum-deprived and stimulated cells treated with remdesivir and MEKi we observed correlations between pRB, pERK, and ACE2 expression further supporting role of proliferative state and MAPK pathway in ACE2 regulation. We show elevated cytokines in COVID-19-(+) patient plasma (N = 9) versus control (N = 11). TMPRSS2, inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-1α, IL-6 and MCP-1 are suppressed by MEKi alone or with remdesivir. We observed MEKi stimulation of NK-cell killing of target-cells, without suppressing TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus with a lentiviral core and SARS-CoV-2 D614 or G614 SPIKE (S) protein on its envelope infected human bronchial epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells, or lung cancer cells and MEKi suppressed infectivity of the pseudovirus. We show a drug class-effect with MEKi to stimulate NK cells, inhibit inflammatory cytokines and block host-factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection leading also to suppression of SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus infection of human cells. MEKi may attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infection to allow immune responses and antiviral agents to control disease progression.","Zhou, Lanlan; Huntington, Kelsey; Zhang, Shengliang; Carlsen, Lindsey; So, Eui-Young; Parker, Cassandra; Sahin, Ilyas; Safran, Howard; Kamle, Suchitra; Lee, Chang-Min; Geun Lee, Chun; A.

An implicit version of the traditional facial emotion recognition task, grounded on the attentional and unconscious mechanism of the redundant target effect, was used. The experiment was scripted through the free software OpenSesame (Mathôt et al., 2012) and published on the Internet through the free software Jatos (Lange et al., 2015). The Reaction Time and level of Accuracy in detecting fearful expressions were computed. Overall, the data of 86 Italian individuals were collected. When their performance was scored in terms of Reaction Time, the redundant target effect did not emerge; instead, the expected effect was observed when the level of Accuracy was considered. Overall, the performance registered in this Italian sample in terms of accuracy was in line with previous results reported in Scarpina et al.

Although often asymptomatic, a relevant percentage of affected people can develop severe pneumonia. Initial evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis, as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV. The presence of genome composition features involved in delaying viral recognition is herein investigated for human coronaviruses (HCoVs), with a special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. A broad collection of HCoVs polyprotein, envelope, matrix, nucleocapsid and spike coding sequences was downloaded and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were investigated. A model able to evaluate and test the presence of a significant under- or over-representation of dinucleotide pairs while accounting for the underlying codon bias and protein sequence was also implemented. The study revealed the significant under-representation of CpG dinucleotide pair in all HcoV, but especially in SARS-CoV and even more in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of forces acting to minimize CpG content was confirmed by relative synonymous codon usage pattern. Codons containing the CpG pair were severely under-represented, primarily in the polyprotein and spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a significant under-representation of the TpA pair was observed in the N and S region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Increasing experimental evidence has proven that CpG and TpA are targeted by innate antiviral host defences, contributing both to RNA degradation and RIG-1 mediated interferon production. The low content of these dinucleotides could contribute to a delayed interferon production, dysregulated immune response, higher viral replication and poor outcome. Significantly, the RIG-1 signalling pathway was proven to be defective in elderlies, suggesting a likely interaction between limited viral recognition and lower responsiveness in interferon production that could justify the higher disease severity and mortality in older patients.","Franzo, Giovanni",Sci Rep,511,20

We conducted a natural experiment in the United States of America in April 2020, in which we compare responses from states with “stay-at-home orders” (3 states) and no such orders (6 states). We surveyed 458 participants (55.6% female, age range 25–64, M(age) = 36.5) and examined the effects of these government-imposed restrictions on social, mental, physical, and financial well-being as well as the mediating role of resilience. Structural equation modeling reveals that resilience buffers stay-at-home orders’ potential side-effects on well-being. Specifically, individuals living in states with stay-at-home orders report lower functional well-being than individuals living in states without such orders, which negatively relates to resilience. Resilience in turn is associated with higher social, mental, physical, and financial well-being. Thus, resilience can be seen as an effective means of buffering stay-at-home orders’ potential negative effects on the components of well-being. Our results indicate the central role of resilience, which is crucial in dampening the effects of stay-at-home orders on well-being. Following our results, governments and policymakers should focus their efforts on strengthening individuals’ resilience, which is a key predictor of social, mental, financial, and physical well-being.","Barrett, Adriana M.; Hogreve, Jens; Brüggen, Elisabeth C.",Front Psychol,511,1

During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals’ adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups. A sample of 1000 adults aged ≥18 years who are representative of the population of the United States by gender, race and ethnicity, and age will be randomly assigned (via a 1:1 allocation) to an intervention or a placebo-control arm. The intervention will be a digital infographic with content based on principles of trust in science, developed by a health communications expert. The intervention will then be both pretested and pilot-tested to determine its viability. Study outcomes will include trust in science, a COVID-19 narrative belief latent profile membership, and the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors, which will be controlled by 8 theoretically selected covariates. RESULTS: This study was funded in August 2020, approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board on September 15, 2020, and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 misinformation prophylaxis is crucial. This proposed experiment investigates the impact of a brief yet actionable intervention that can be easily disseminated to increase individuals’ trust in science, with the intention of affecting misinformation believability and, consequently, preventive behavioral intentions.

We discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium with strain variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both pro-fibrotic and pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells responding to microbial stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue barrier that serves to prevent systemic dissemination of bacteria.","Ha, Connie W.Y.; Martin, Anthony; Sepich-Poore, Gregory D.; Shi, Baochen; Wang, Yizhou; Gouin, Kenneth; Humphrey, Gregory; Sanders, Karenina; Ratnayake, Yasiru; Chan, Kelvin S.L.; Hendrick, Gustaf; Caldera, J.R.; Arias, Christian; Moskowitz, Jacob E.; Ho Sui, Shannan J.; Yang, Shaohong; Underhill, David; Brady, Matthew J.; Knott, Simon; Kaihara, Kelly; Steinbaugh, Michael J.; Li, Huiying; McGovern, Dermot P.B.; Knight, Rob; Fleshner, Phillip; Devkota, Suzanne",Cell,511,16

Viral maturation requires the activity of the main viral protease (M(pro)), so its inhibition stops the progress of the disease. To evaluate possible inhibitors, a computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme M(pro) was constructed in complex with 26 synthetic ligands derived from coumarins and quinolines. Analysis of simulations of molecular dynamics and molecular docking of the models show a high affinity for the enzyme (∆E (binding) between −5.1 and 7.1 kcal mol(−1)). The six compounds with the highest affinity show K (d) between 6.26 × 10(–6) and 17.2 × 10(–6), with binding affinity between −20 and −25 kcal mol(−1), with ligand efficiency less than 0.3 associated with possible inhibitory candidates. In addition to the high affinity of these compounds for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), low toxicity is expected considering the Lipinski, Veber and Pfizer rules.

There is general feasibility, validity, and substantial reliability in performing most examination components, and primary diagnoses established virtually were found to be either the same or similar in the vast majority of cases. Despite the current literature focusing mainly on adult populations, we describe how each aspect of the exam can be reliably incorporated into a virtual appointment specific to the pediatric population. Currently available smartphone-based applications that measure joint range of motion were generally found to have high reliability and validity. Caregivers are needed for most of the consultation, especially in younger children, but select physical exam maneuvers can be self-performed by older children and adolescents alone. By providing an overview of the available smartphone tools as well as the reliability and validity of remote assessments, this review not only establishes a foundation for a structured pediatric musculoskeletal examination, but also aims to increase providers’ confidence in incorporating telemedicine into their practice.","Noutsios, Constantinos Dean; Boisvert-Plante, Virginie; Laberge, Erika; Perez, Jordi; Ingelmo, Pablo",J Pain Res,511,20

Numerous fatal causalities were described in the international environment. For example fatal causalities during the SARS-Epidemic as well as cases of death caused by influenza. METHODS AND RESULTS: Selective literature review of occupationally acquired aerogene infections like SARS-coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, adenovirus, tuberculosis as well as pertussis. Currently available data demonstrate that personal protective measures (e.g. appropriate use of hand washing and oronasal mask), as well as vaccinations (if available) reduces the risk for transmission of infectious diseases. DISCUSSION: The risk for occupationally acquired infections is sometimes an unavoidable part of daily patient care. From occupational medicine point of view and for control of infectious diseases preventive measures should be implemented to provide the best possible protection of HCW involved. With regard to a possible pandemic (e.g. influenza pandemic) this procedure is absolutely required.","Wicker, Sabine; Rabenau, Holger F.; Groneberg, David A.; Gottschalk, René",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,511,24

In this article, we present a comprehensive study of the changes in scholarly publication landscape for biomedical sciences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with special emphasis on preprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv servers. We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review process of 43 days and journal’s production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation in publication delays between journals. Only one third of COVID-19 preprints posted during the first nine months of the pandemic appeared as peer-reviewed journal articles. These journal articles display high Altmetric Attention Scores further emphasizing a significance of COVID-19 research during 2020.

A dysregulated immune response not only compromises the ability of the host to resolve the viral infection, but may also predispose the individual to secondary bacterial and fungal infections, a risk to which the current therapeutic immunomodulatory approaches significantly contribute. Among the secondary infections that may occur in COVID-19 patients, coronavirus-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is emerging as a potential cause of morbidity and mortality, although many aspects of the disease still remain unresolved. With this opinion, we present the current view of CAPA and discuss how the same mechanisms that underlie the dysregulated immune response in COVID-19 increase susceptibility to Aspergillus infection. Likewise, resorting to endogenous pathways of immunomodulation may not only restore immune homeostasis in COVID-19 patients, but also reduce the risk for aspergillosis. Therefore, CAPA represents the other side of the coin in COVID-19 and our advances in the understanding and treatment of the immune response in COVID-19 should represent the framework for the study of CAPA.","Costantini, Claudio; van de Veerdonk, Frank L.; Romani, Luigina",Vaccines (Basel),511,20

The medical staff in emergency rooms, in particular, have borne the brunt of the pandemic, and strict protection measures are needed to avoid infection in these units. Taiwan as a whole has performed extremely well in this epidemic, an achievement that has been acknowledged internationally. This success can be attributed to the Taiwan Epidemic Prevention Management Center's extensive experience and courageous strategy. The emergency department professionals of all hospitals, in conjunction with the outstanding performance of the center's policy, have also done much to control the infection's spread. However, excessive protection can also negatively affect patients' safety and the quality of medical care, especially for pregnant and parturient women. This article uses two actual cases from a medical center in northern Taiwan to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women. This case study serves to highlight that, to ensure more effective coordination during severe epidemics, a comprehensive infection prevention plan should be formulated. In addition, pregnant women's human rights must be safeguarded so that various protective mechanisms can be effectively used to achieve win–win solutions. Hospitals need to plan their production methods and timing in advance for when pregnant patients are in critical condition. The findings include that obstetricians recommend caesarean sections as a safer method in during epidemics.

Yet, whether and to what extent a highly prevalent and more elusive environmental factor, such as psychosocial stress (PSS), can also increase ACM disease progression is unexplored. Here, we first quantified perceived stress levels in patients with ACM and found these levels correlated with the extent of arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction. To determine whether the observed correlation is due to causation, we inflicted PSS-via the resident-intruder (RI) paradigm—upon Desmoglein-2 mutant mice, a vigorously used mammalian model of ACM. We found that ACM mice succumbed to abnormally high in-trial, PSS mortality. Conversely, no sudden deaths occurred in wildtype (WT) counterparts. Desmoglein-2 mice that survived RI challenge manifested markedly worse cardiac dysfunction and remodeling, namely apoptosis and fibrosis. Furthermore, WT and ACM mice displayed similar behavior at baseline, but Desmoglein-2 mice exhibited heightened anxiety following RI-induced PSS. This outcome correlated with the worsening of cardiac phenotypes. Our mouse model demonstrates that in ACM-like subjects, PSS is incisive enough to deteriorate cardiac structure and function per se, i.e., in the absence of any pre-existing anxious behavior. Hence, PSS may represent a previously underappreciated risk factor in ACM disease penetrance.","Agrimi, Jacopo; Scalco, Arianna; Agafonova, Julia; Williams III, Larry; Pansari, Nainika; Keceli, Gizem; Jun, Seungho; Wang, Nadan; Mastorci, Francesca; Tichnell, Crystal; Murray, Brittney; James, Cynthia A.; Calkins, Hugh; Zaglia, Tania; Paolocci, Nazareno; Chelko, Stephen P.",J Clin Med,511,2

While many tests have been authorized for diagnosis of COVID-19 using respiratory samples, no fully validated stool tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 are currently available. We sought to adapt and validate an available test specifically for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in human stool. Methods Stool samples were spiked with inactivated SAR-CoV-2 virus for development and validation of the assay. A modified version of the CDC rRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test was used for detection of virus. Analytical sensitivity, assay reproducibility, and sample stability under a variety of storage conditions were assessed. We also performed the assay on stool samples collected from known COVID positive individuals. Findings The lower limit of detection (LoD) of the assay was found to be 3000 viral RNA copies per gram of original stool sample, with 100% detection across 20 replicates assessed at this concentration. Samples were relatively stable in all buffers tested at both 4{degrees}C and ambient temperature, with the exception of storage in STAR buffer at ambient temperature. Assay sensitivity was slightly diminished in low-copy-number samples after a single freeze-thaw cycle at -80{degrees}C. Thirty contrived SARS-CoV-2 samples were tested by a second laboratory and were correctly identified as positive or negative in at least one of two rounds of testing. Additionally, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool of known COVID-19 positive individuals using this method. Interpretation This is a sensitive, reproducible, and validated assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human stool with potential uses in FMT donor screening, sewage monitoring, and further research into the impact of fecal shedding on the epidemiology of this pandemic.

Nonetheless, explicit therapeutic drugs or clinically approved vaccines are not available for COVID-19. Thus, a comprehensive research is crucially needed to decode the pathogenic tools, plausible drug targets, committed to the development of efficient therapy. Host-pathogen interactions via host cellular components is an emerging field of research in this respect. miRNAs have been established as vital players in host-virus interactions. Moreover, viruses have the capability to manoeuvre the host miRNA networks according to their own obligations. Besides protein coding mRNAs, noncoding RNAs might also be targeted in infected cells and viruses can exploit the host miRNA network via ceRNA effect. We have predicted a ceRNA network involving one miRNA (miR-124-3p), one mRNA (Ddx58), one lncRNA (Gm26917) and two circRNAs (Ppp1r10, C330019G07RiK) in SARS-CoV infected cells. We have identified 4 DEGs-Isg15, Ddx58, Oasl1, Usp18 by analyzing a mRNA GEO dataset. There is no notable induction of IFNs and IFN-induced ACE2, significant receptor responsible for S-protein binding mediated viral entry. Pathway enrichment and GO analysis conceded the enrichment of pathways associated with interferon signalling and antiviral-mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes. Further, we have identified 3 noncoding RNAs, playing as potential ceRNAs to the genes associated with immune mechanisms. This integrative analysis has identified noncoding RNAs and their plausible targets, which could effectively enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with viral infection. However, validation of these targets is further corroborated to determine their therapeutic efficacy.","Arora, Shweta; Singh, Prithvi; Dohare, Ravins; Jha, Rishabh; Ali Syed, Mansoor",Gene,511,20

Design: Population-based cohort study Setting: Primary care electronic health records including ~80% of the population in Catalonia, Spain, linked to hospital and mortality records between 1 March and 6 May 2020. Participants: Individuals aged [≥]18 years with at least one year of prior medical history available from the general population. Cancer was defined as any prior diagnosis of a primary invasive malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Main outcome measures: Cause-specific hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals for each outcome. Estimates were adjusted by age, sex, deprivation, smoking status, and comorbidities. Results: We included 4,618,377 adults, of which 260,667 (5.6%) had a history of cancer. Patients with cancer were older and had more comorbidities than cancer-free patients. A total of 98,951 individuals (5.5% with cancer) were diagnosed and 6,355 (16.4% with cancer) were directly hospitalised (no prior diagnosis) with COVID-19. Of those diagnosed, 6,851 were subsequently hospitalised (10.7% with cancer) and 3,227 died without being hospitalised (18.5% with cancer). Among those hospitalised, 1,963 (22.5% with cancer) died. Cancer was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis (aHR: 1.08; 95% confidence interval [1.05-1.11]); direct COVID-19 hospitalisation (1.33 [1.24-1.43]); and death following a COVID-19 hospitalisation (1.12 [1.01-1.25]). These associations were stronger for patients recently diagnosed with cancer, aged <70 years, and with haematological cancers. Conclusions: Patients recently diagnosed with cancer, aged <70 years, or with haematological cancers are a high-risk population for COVID-19 diagnosis and severity.

The biggest cluster of cases occurred in Lombardy, the most populous Italian region, and elderly men were the population hit in the hardest way.

In centenarians inflammaging is much lower than predicted by their chronological age and females, presenting survival advantage in almost all centenarian populations, outnumber males, a phenomenon particularly evident in Northern Italy. Within this scenario, we wondered if: a) the COVID-19 mortality in centenarians was lower than that in people aged between 50 and 80 and b) the mortality from COVID-19 in nonagenarians and centenarians highlighted gender differences.

Patients et méthodes Au cours d’une étude rétrospective multicentrique nationale française, nous avons inclus entre le 6 et le 28 avril 2020, les patients atteints de COVID-19 confirmée par RT-PCR, hospitalisés en service de Médecine Interne ou de Pneumologie, avec un angioscanner thoracique réalisé au Service d’Accueil des Urgences pour suspicion d’EP. Les données de base, les traitements et l’évolution ont été recueillies lors de l’admission et au dernier suivi disponible. Des modèles de régression uni et multivariés ont été utilisés pour identifier les facteurs prédictifs associés au diagnostic d’EP confirmée. Résultats Au total, 88 patients (âge médian [interquartile range IQR] de 68 ans [60-78]) ont été analysés. Sur la base de l’angioscanner thoracique, une EP a été confirmée chez 47 (53,4 %) patients, et réfutée chez 41 autres.

A pragmatic solution to this problem may be emphasizing a single exercise strategy that maximizes health benefits. The loss of muscle mass and strength at an accelerated rate are hallmarks of aging that, without intervention, eventually lead to physical disability and loss of independence. Additionally, OAs are at risk of developing several chronic diseases. As such, participating in activities that can maintain or increase muscle mass and strength, as well as decrease chronic disease risk, is essential for healthy aging. Unfortunately, there is a widely held belief that adaptations to aerobic and resistance exercise are independent of each other, requiring the participation of both types of exercise to achieve optimal health. However, we argue that this assertion is incorrect, and we discuss crossover adaptations of both aerobic and resistance exercise. Aerobic exercise can increase muscle mass and strength, though not consistently and may be limited to exercise that overloads a particular muscle group, such as stationary bicycling. In contrast, resistance exercise is effective at maintaining muscle health with increasing age, and also has significant effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cancer, and mortality. We posit that resistance exercise is the most effective standalone exercise strategy for improving overall health in OAs and should be emphasized in future guidelines.","Tavoian, Dallin; Russ, David W.; Consitt, Leslie A.; Clark, Brian C.",Front Physiol,511,16

METHODS Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were admitted to the ICU of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen from January 1 to February 7, 2020, were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without septic shock. RESULTS In this study, 35 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included. Among them, the median age was 64 years (interquartile range [IQR] 59-67 years), and 10 (28.4%) patients were female. The median ICU length of stay was 16 days (IQR 8-23 days). Three (8.6%) patients died during hospitalization. Nine (25.7%) patients developed septic shock in the ICU, and these patients had a significantly higher incidence of organ dysfunction and a worse prognosis than patients without septic shock. CONCLUSIONS Septic shock is associated with a poor outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients and is one of the hallmarks of the severity of patients receiving ICU care. A dysregulated immune response, uncontrolled inflammation, and coagulation disorders are strongly associated with the development and progression of COVID-19-related septic shock.","Yao, Ren-Qi; Ren, Chao; Ren, Di; Li, Jin-Xiu; Li, Ying; Liu, Xue-Yan; Huang, Lei; Liu, Yong; Peng, Mian; Feng, Yong-Wen; Yao, Yong-Ming",World journal of emergency medicine,511,21

Methods: We collected publication data from five print-based medical journals and one online journal--JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet (Lancet), The New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, The BMJ (BMJ), and BMC Medicine (BMC Med)--for the December 2019 through May 2020 period. We categorized each article as either ""COVID-19-related"" or ""non-COVID-19-related"". When available, we further extracted data on submission-to-acceptance dates and acceptance-to-publication dates for original research articles for the January through July 2019 and January through July 2020 periods. We compared the time from submission to publication for non-COVID-19 original research articles during the two periods and tested for statistical significance with a one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: We found that non-COVID-19-related articles began decreasing in volume as COVID-19-related articles increased. In BMJ and Lancet, the COVID-19-related articles began overtaking the non-COVID-19-related articles in number during April and May 2020. However, COVID-19-related primary research articles only began consistently appearing in journal issues during May 2020. Only BMJ and BMC Med publicly recorded complete data regarding their publication timelines. After removing outliers, we found that the mean time from submission to publication for articles published in BMJ from January through July 2019 was 204 days (median: 194 days; IQR: 163-236), and from January through July 2020 was 223 days (median: 218 days; IQR: 177-261) (p=0.04). In BMC Med, the mean time from submission to publication from February through July 2019 was 153 days (median: 150 days; IQR: 123-181), and from February through July 2020 was 163 days (median: 157 days; IQR: 132-191) (p=0.06). Conclusion: We discovered a steadily increasing trend in the percentage of COVID-19-related articles and a concomitant decreasing trend in the percentage of non-COVID-19-related articles published in high-impact print journals during the period from December 2019 through May 2020. For non-COVID-19-related articles published in BMJ, we found a statistically significant increase upon comparing the submission-to-publication times for the period from January through July 2020 with the submission-to-publication times for the period from January through July 2019.","Shan, Judy; Ballard, Dustin; Vinson, David R",Cureus,511,27

Translation in mammalian cells expressing 2B protein is inhibited by hygromycin B (HB) but remains unaffected in mock cells, which are not permeable to the inhibitor. Here we describe a previously unreported bystander effect in which healthy baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells become sensitive to HB when co‐cultured with a low proportion of cells expressing poliovirus 2B. Viroporins E from mouse hepatitis virus, 6K from Sindbis virus and NS4A protein from hepatitis C virus were also able to permeabilize neighbouring cells to different extents. Expression of 2B induced permeabilization of neighbouring cell lines other than BHK. We found that gap junctions are responsible mediating the observed bystander permeabilization. Gap junctional communication was confirmed in 2B‐expressing co‐cultures by fluorescent dye transfer. Moreover, the presence of connexin 43 was confirmed in both mock and 2B‐transfected cells. Finally, inhibition of HB entry to neighbouring cells was observed with 18α‐glycyrrhethinic acid, an inhibitor of gap junctions. Taken together, these findings support a mechanism involving gap junctional intercellular communication in the bystander permeabilization effect observed in healthy cells co‐cultured with poliovirus 2B‐expressing cells.","Madan, Vanesa; Redondo, Natalia; Carrasco, Luis",Cell Microbiol,511,29

Existing research has long identified and analyzed various barriers that may impede ATM at the global, national, or local levels. However, it tends to adopt a normative perspective to prescribe what infrastructures, resources, and measures should be put in place to improve ATM. Little scholarship has explored how and why countries may prioritize certain dimensions of ATM over others in pharmaceutical governance within specific historical contexts. This article fills that gap by deconstructing and historicizing the concept of ATM. The author aims to make two arguments. First, tensions easily arise between different dimensions of ATM, and prioritizing certain dimensions in pharmaceutical policy may impede improvements in others (e.g., availability vs. affordability). Second, which dimension(s) of ATM might be prioritized in the state’s pharmaceutical policy hinges upon social, economic, and political forces. To substantiate these arguments, the author draws on interview and archival evidence from China. Specifically, the author provides a historical account of how and why the priorities of pharmaceutical governance in China changed over time: 1) 1949—late 1970s: pursuing both drug availability and affordability through socialist planning; 2) early 1980s—2015: priority shifting from availability (before the mid-1990s) to affordability (after the mid-1990s); 3) 2015—present: striving for a rebalance between drug availability and affordability.","Li, Lantian",Front Sociol,511,20

Effective treatments and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 infection do not currently exist. Previous studies demonstrated that nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) of coronavirus is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent 2’-O-methyltransferase (2’-O-MTase) that has an important role in viral replication and prevents recognition by the host innate immune system. In the present study, we employed structural analysis, virtual screening, and molecular simulation approaches to identify clinically investigated and approved drugs which can act as promising inhibitors against nsp16 2′-O-MTase of SARS-CoV-2. Comparative analysis of primary amino acid sequences and crystal structures of seven human CoVs defined the key residues for nsp16 2-O’-MTase functions. Virtual screening and docking analysis ranked the potential inhibitors of nsp16 from more than 4,500 clinically investigated and approved drugs. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on eight top candidates, including Hesperidin, Rimegepant, Gs-9667, and Sonedenoson, to calculate various structural parameters and understand the dynamic behavior of the drug-protein complexes.

Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games, played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential changes to the home advantage. However, we argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate and use simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression (Karlis and Ntzoufras in J R Stat Soc Ser D Stat 52(3):381–393, 2003) reduces absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85%. Next, with data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans. In contrast to current research that suggests a drop in the home advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen. Altogether, this suggests a more complex causal mechanism for the impact of fans on sporting events.","Benz, Luke S.; Lopez, Michael J.",Adv Stat Anal,511,1

Such interactions might arise from COVID-19 immune responses, from infection of neurons themselves or may reflect social-psychological causes. To clarify this we sought the key gene expression pathways altered in COVID-19 also affected in bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, since this may identify pathways of interaction that could be treatment targets. We performed large scale comparisons of whole transcriptome data and immune factor transcript data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COVID-19 patients and patients with psychiatric disorders. We also analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, comparing GWAS and whole-genome sequence data from patients with bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia patients. These studies revealed altered signalling and ontology pathways shared by COVID-19 patients and the three psychiatric disorders. Finally, co-expression and network analyses identified gene clusters common to the conditions. COVID-19 patients had peripheral blood immune system profiles that overlapped with those of patients with psychiatric conditions. From the pathways identified, PTSD profiles were the most highly correlated with COVID-19, perhaps consistent with stress-immune system interactions seen in PTSD. We also revealed common inflammatory pathways that may exacerbate psychiatric disorders, which may support the usage of anti-inflammatory medications in these patients. It also highlights the potential clinical application of multi-level dataset studies in difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders in this COVID-19 pandemic.","Moni, Mohammad Ali; Lin, Ping-I; Quinn, Julian M.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the ‘My Health too’ CBT program—a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic—on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). METHODS: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction. Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4 weeks), end of active treatment (at 8 weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers. Given the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers’ mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.

Our earlier study explored experiences of vaping when e-cigarettes were first introduced and most participants were dual tobacco and e-cigarette users. Here we present findings of a subsequent study of vaping among a different sample of PiC when use of tobacco was prohibited in prison, and smokefree policy had become the norm. METHODS: Twenty-eight qualitative interviews were conducted with PiC who were current or former users of e-cigarettes in prison, 6–10 months after implementation of a smokefree policy. Data were managed and analyzed using the framework approach. RESULTS: PiC reported that vaping helped with mandated smoking abstinence. However, findings suggest that some PiC may be susceptible to heavy e-cigarette use potentially as a consequence of high nicotine dependence and situational factors such as e-cigarette product choice and availability in prisons; issues with nicotine delivery; prison regimes; and use of e-cigarettes for managing negative emotions. These factors may act as barriers to cutting down or stopping use of e-cigarettes by PiC who want to make changes due to dissatisfaction with vaping or lack of interest in continued use of nicotine, cost, and/or health concerns. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarettes helped PiC to cope with smokefree rules, although concerns about e-cigarette efficacy, cost, and safety were raised. PiC may desire or benefit both from conventional smoking cessation programs and from interventions to support reduction, or cessation, of vaping. IMPLICATIONS: Findings highlight successes, challenges, and potential solutions in respect of use of e-cigarettes to cope with mandated smoking abstinence in populations with high smoking prevalence and heavy nicotine dependence. Experiences from prisons in Scotland may be of particular interest to health and/or justice services in other jurisdictions, with similar legislation on e-cigarettes to the United Kingdom, who are planning for institutional smokefree policies in their prisons or inpatient mental health settings in the future.","Brown, Ashley; O’Donnell, Rachel; Eadie, Douglas; Ford, Allison; Mitchell, Danielle; Hackett, Alison; Sweeting, Helen; Bauld, Linda; Hunt, Kate",Nicotine Tob Res,511,20

Immature immune system and lack of fully established microbiota at birth predispose neonatal piglets to infection with enteric pathogens. The microorganisms that for decades have been associated with enteritis and diarrhea in suckling piglets are: rotavirus A, coronavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens type C, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora suis and Strongyloides ransomi. However, in recent years, the pig industry has experienced an increased number of neonatal diarrhea cases in which the above mentioned pathogens are no longer detected. Potentially pathogenic bacteria have recently received focus in the research on the possible etiology of neonatal diarrhea not caused by common pathogens. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., C. perfringens and C. difficile in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea with no established casual agents. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes was applied on the fixed intestinal tissue samples from 51 diarrheic and 50 non-diarrheic piglets collected from four Danish farms during outbreaks of neonatal diarrhea not caused by well-known enteric pathogens. Furthermore, an association between the presence of these bacteria and histological lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of fluorescence signals specific for E. coli, C. perfringens and C. difficile was similar in both groups of piglets. However, Enterococcus spp. was primarily detected in the diarrheic piglets. Furthermore, adherent bacteria were detected in 37 % diarrheic and 14 % non-diarrheic piglets. These bacteria were identified as E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and their presence in the intestinal mucosa was associated with histopathological changes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that simultaneous colonization of the intestinal mucosa by adherent non-ETEC E. coli and Enterococcus spp. can be involved in the pathogenesis of neonatal porcine diarrhea. These bacteria should be considered in diagnosis of diarrhea in piglets, when detection of common, well-known enteric agents is unsuccessful.","Jonach, Beata; Boye, Mette; Stockmarr, Anders; Jensen, Tim Kåre",BMC Vet Res,511,20

CONCLUSIONS: Combining virtual platforms and in-person clinical rotation is an effective surgery clerkship curriculum, particularly in pandemic covid 19. There are no different skill and knowledge results before and during the pandemic analyzed from MCQs and OSCE exam.","Setiawan, Eko; Sugeng, Bambang; Luailiyah, Afridatul; Makarim, Fadhli Rizal; Trisnadi, Setyo",Ann Med Surg (Lond),511,16

No prior studies using molecular techniques to examine RSV transmission in the community childcare setting have been performed. OBJECTIVES: We seek to characterize the molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission in childcare to evaluate the impact of RSV disease in a community-based population. METHODS: We sequenced RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples from a prospective longitudinal study of respiratory illnesses among children enrolled in childcare during three winter seasons. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify unique viral strains. RESULTS: RSV was detected in 59 (11%) illnesses. Compared to RSV-negative illnesses, RSV-positive illnesses were associated with longer symptom duration and increased frequency of health care visits. Another respiratory virus was detected in 42 (71%) RSV-positive illnesses. RSV viral load did not differ between RSV-positive illnesses with and without another respiratory virus identified (P = 0.38). In two childcare rooms, 50% of the children had RSV detected within six days of the first case. Five (38%) of 13 illness episodes from one childcare room were sequenced and shown to be the same viral strain, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the room over a 16 day period. CONCLUSIONS: RSV is rapidly transmitted within childcare. Childcare facilities may serve as ideal sites for evaluation of new prevention strategies given the high burden of RSV disease in this population and the rapidity of RSV spread between children.","Chu, Helen Y.; Kuypers, Jane; Renaud, Christian; Wald, Anna; Martin, Emily; Fairchok, Mary; Magaret, Amalia; Sarancino, Misty; Englund, Janet A.",Journal of Clinical Virology,511,8

To assess admission rates to seven General Hospital Psychiatric Wards (GHPWs) located in the Lombardy Region in the 40 days after the start of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, compared to similar periods of 2020 and 2019. METHODS. Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS. In the 40-day period (February 21–March 31, 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to February 21, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates. The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions. The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of ‘Other’ diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS. Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset. We suggest that the reduction in admission rates may be due to fear of hospitals, seen as possible sites of contagion, as well as to a change in thresholds of behavioral problems acting as a trigger for admission requests from family relatives or referrals from treating clinicians. It is unclear from the study whether the reduction in admissions was contributed to most by the current pandemic or the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic.","Clerici, M.; Durbano, F.; Spinogatti, F.; Vita, A.; de Girolamo, G.; Micciolo, R.",Irish journal of psychological medicine,511,1
