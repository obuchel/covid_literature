15472,Feasibility of enhanced recovery protocol in minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy,2021-02-18,"IMPORTANCE: Low-dose intradermal influenza vaccines could be a suitable alternative to full intramuscular dose during vaccine shortages. OBJECTIVE: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of the influenza vaccine at reduced or full intradermal doses with full intramuscular doses to inform policy design in the event of vaccine shortages. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies published from 2010 until June 5, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: All comparative studies across all ages assessing the immunogenicity or safety of intradermal and intramuscular influenza vaccinations were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted by a single reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through consensus. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included geometric mean titer, seroconversion, seroprotection, and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 30 relevant studies were included; 29 studies were randomized clinical trials with 13 759 total participants, and 1 study was a cohort study of 164 021 participants. There was no statistically significant difference in seroconversion rates between the 3-µg, 6-µg, 7.5-µg, and 9-µg intradermal vaccine doses and the 15-µg intramuscular vaccine dose for each of the H1N1, H3N2, and B strains, but rates were significantly higher with the 15-µg intradermal dose compared with the 15-µg intramuscular dose for the H1N1 strain (rate ratio [RR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.20) and B strain (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.13-1.73). Seroprotection rates for the 9-µg and 15-µg intradermal doses did not vary significantly compared with the 15-µg intramuscular dose for all the 3 strains, except for the 15-µg intradermal dose for the H1N1 strain, for which rates were significantly higher (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09). Local adverse events were significantly higher with intradermal doses than with the 15-µg intramuscular dose, particularly erythema (3-µg dose: RR, 9.62; 95% CI, 1.07-86.56; 6-µg dose: RR, 23.79; 95% CI, 14.42-39.23; 9-µg dose: RR, 4.56; 95% CI, 3.05-6.82; 15-µg dose: RR, 3.68; 95% CI, 3.19-4.25) and swelling (3-µg dose: RR, 20.16; 95% CI, 4.68-86.82; 9-µg dose: RR, 5.23; 95% CI, 3.58-7.62; 15-µg dose: RR, 3.47 ; 95% CI, 2.21-5.45). Fever and chills were significantly more common with the 9-µg intradermal dose than the 15-µg intramuscular dose (fever: RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.80; chills: RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03-1.50) while all other systemic adverse events were not statistically significant for all other doses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that reduced-dose intradermal influenza vaccination could be a reasonable alternative to standard dose intramuscular vaccination.","Egunsola, Oluwaseun; Clement, Fiona; Taplin, John; Mastikhina, Liza; Li, Joyce W.; Lorenzetti, Diane L.; Dowsett, Laura E.; Noseworthy, Tom",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7873776/,667

56457,Wastewater-Based Epidemiology for Community Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2: Progress and Challenges,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Artistic competitive gymnastics results in a wide, unique spectrum of injuries. Due to the high number of injuries and the current lack of research related to pre-competitive testing in adolescent gymnasts, it is crucial to find a method to predict the likelihood of an athlete sustaining an in-season injury. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to 1) describe the frequency and type of pre-season and in-season injuries, 2) determine if there were differences in physical performance tests between those who had a lower extremity (LE) injury in-season and those who did not, and 3) determine if there were differences in age, level, sex, BMI, sport modifications, previous injury, and current injury between those who had a LE injury and those who didn’t. METHODS: Thirty-seven adolescent gymnasts (average age: 12.81 years) were included with levels ranging from 5 (novice) to 10 (elite). Participants (15 males and 22 females) were surveyed for previous and current injury. The athletes completed a performance battery before the competition season including: Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test (LQYBT), Closed Kinetic Chain dorsiflexion (CKCDF), single hop (SH), triple hop (TH), and the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). Follow-up data was collected at the end of the competitive season for comparison. The data was analyzed using descriptive methods and comparative analyses including chi-square and independent t-tests with an alpha level set at .05. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent reported an injury in the last year and seventy-eight percent reported pre-season injuries at testing day. The most common location for pre-season injury was the ankle/foot (24% and 31% respectively). There were no differences between injured and non-injured athletes when comparing asymmetries in CKCDF, LQYBT posteromedial or posterolateral reach, hop testing, or FMS. The LQYBT-anterior scores were significantly different at p=.049 between the injured versus uninjured groups, with 91% of the in-season injury group having a difference <4cm. Similarly, the LQYBT-composite score using a cut-off of 95% was significant at p=.043 with those >95% category being more likely to get injured. There were no significant differences in demographic information comparing injury occurrence. CONCLUSION: The tested physical performance battery may be useful in tracking gymnasts over time, but may not be beneficial in forecasting injuries in a sport with high percentages of acute injuries. The collected injury volume may not be reflective of a standard season as COVID-19 decreased the number of competitions. Additional research to identify athletes at risk for injury requires further investigation.","Farzanegan, Danielle A; Francione, Emily; Melfi, Nicole",Orthop J Sports Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283231/,667
59447,Robotic spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy: how I do it (with video).,2015,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the effects of early-life, preconception, and prior-generation exposures on reproductive health in women. RECENT FINDINGS: Women’s early-life factors can affect reproductive health by contributing to health status or exposure level on entering pregnancy. Alternately, they can have permanent effects, regardless of later-life experience. Nutrition, social class, parental smoking, other adverse childhood experiences, environmental pollutants, infectious agents, and racism and discrimination all affect reproductive health, even if experienced in childhood or in utero. Possible transgenerational effects are now being investigated through three- or more-generation studies. These effects occur with mechanisms that may include direct exposure, behavioral, endocrine, inflammatory, and epigenetic pathways. SUMMARY: Pregnancy is increasingly understood in a life course perspective, but rigorously testing hypotheses on early-life effects is still difficult. In order to improve the health outcomes of all women, we need to expand our toolkit of methods and theory.

59465,Robotic versus laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy: A comparative study of clinical outcomes and costs analysis.,2017,"Introduction: Research in recent years has explored the vocabulary size (lexical breadth) of bilingual children, but less is known about the richness of bilingual word knowledge (lexical depth), and about how knowledge of words in the two languages interact. This study explores how bilingual narrative intervention with vocabulary instruction in each language may modulate crosslinguistic influence (CLI) between the languages of bilingual kindergarten children, focusing on CLI of lexical knowledge, and which factors modulate performance. Methods: Forty-one typically developing English-Hebrew bilingual children (M = 64.63 months) participated. A bilingual adaptation of Story Champs narrative intervention program (Spencer and Petersen, 2012) was used to deliver vocabulary instruction in separate blocks of home language (HL) and school language (SL) sessions. Different intervention words were targeted in each language, but the children were tested on all target words in both languages. Lexical knowledge was assessed with a definition task four times throughout the study: prior to intervention, after each intervention block, and 4–6 weeks later. Learner characteristics (chronological age, age of onset of bilingualism and length of exposure) and proficiency in each language (standardized tests, familiarity with the vocabulary introduced in the intervention at baseline) were examined as possible modulators of performance. Results: Children showed growth in lexical breadth and depth in their HL/English after HL intervention and in lexical breadth in the SL/Hebrew following SL intervention, with CLI for semantic depth observed via a qualitative analysis, but not quantitatively. Better HL/English performance was correlated with later AoB (and shorter SL exposure) and higher HL language proficiency scores. Children with higher HL/English proficiency responded better to the SL/Hebrew intervention, gaining more than those with lower English proficiency. Children with SL/Hebrew vocabulary dominance at the outset of the study also gained more from the HL/English intervention. No correlations were found between learner characteristics and SL performance. Discussion: The current study indicates that bilingual narrative intervention with vocabulary instruction may be efficacious for improving the lexical breadth and depth of bilingual kindergarten children. It suggests that CLI may enhance bilingual children’s language learning success, and points to the importance of strengthening both languages of bilingual children.","Lipner, Minna; Armon-Lotem, Sharon; Walters, Joel; Altman, Carmit",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516401/,667
59468,Outcomes of Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Using a 5-mm Versus 10-mm Laparoscope: A Randomized Control Trial.,2016,"Oxidative stress (OS) arises when the body is subjected to harmful endogenous or exogenous factors that overwhelm the antioxidant system. There is increasing evidence that OS is involved in a number of diseases, including ovarian cancer (OC). OC is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, and risk factors include genetic factors, age, infertility, nulliparity, microbial infections, obesity, smoking, etc. OS can promote the proliferation, metastasis, and therapy resistance of OC, while high levels of OS have cytotoxic effects and induce apoptosis in OC cells. This review focuses on the relationship between OS and the development of OC from four aspects: genetic alterations, signaling pathways, transcription factors, and the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, strategies to target aberrant OS in OC are summarized and discussed, with a view to providing new ideas for clinical treatment.","Ding, Dan-Ni; Xie, Liang-Zhen; Shen, Ying; Li, Jia; Guo, Ying; Fu, Yang; Liu, Fang-Yuan; Han, Feng-Juan",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516553/,667

BACKGROUND Studies have examined waiting rooms in hospitals and doctors' offices, but there is little published literature on waiting rooms in psychotherapy offices. Waiting rooms in psychotherapy offices may affect clients' perceived quality of care and their comfort level. METHOD Psychotherapists in Connecticut and Rhode Island were interviewed and agreed to have the waiting rooms (20 in total) of their practices photographed. Then, in a within-subjects design, 250 participants (225 retained for analyses) from MTurk answered questions about the quality of care and comfort in the environment expected in those 20 waiting rooms. RESULTS Factor analytic results showed that waiting rooms that were welcoming and comfortable as well as large and spacious rated higher for the quality of care and comfort in the environment anticipated by the participant; those that were cramped and crowded rated lower. Few therapists reported any design education about counseling environments and none about the waiting room. CONCLUSION Information from this study can guide the design of psychotherapy waiting rooms and enhance healthcare experience.","Noble, Lilly; Devlin, Ann Sloan",HERD,https://doi.org/10.1177/19375867211001885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840240/,667
60196,Is transperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy suitable for patients with a history of abdominal surgery?,2018,"Difficulty during placement of the tracheal tube is a known problem when intubating with the GlideScope® , which may lead to subglottic airway injury. This randomised, controlled clinical trial was designed to compare the resistance to passage of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), reinforced or BlockBuster tracheal tubes during intubation with the GlideScope. Secondary outcomes included the time taken to intubate and assessment of subglottic airway injury. One-hundred and seventy-seven patients were included in the data analysis. There was difficult tracheal tube passage (moderate or severe resistance) in 15 (21.4%) patients using the PVC tube compared with 4 (7.4%) and 1 (1.9%) using the reinforced and BlockBuster tubes, respectively (p = 0.003 for PVC vs. BlockBuster). The median (IQR [range]) time taken to intubate was 35 (27-45 [15-115]) s, 25 (20-27 [15-110]) s and 25 (22-30 [16-90]) s, respectively, (p < 0.001 for PVC vs. reinforced as well as PVC vs. BlockBuster). Subglottic airway injury, assessed using a fibreoptic bronchoscope after extubation, was higher with the PVC tube (p < 0.001) and the reinforced tube (p = 0.012) compared with the BlockBuster tube. We conclude that the BlockBuster tracheal tube is a better choice for orotracheal intubation with the GlideScope than PVC or reinforced tubes.","Su, K; Gao, X; Xue, F-S; Ding, G-N; Zhang, Y; Tian, M",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.13755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27995626/,667

Recently, MRI-guided treatment decision in wake-up stroke(WUS) was shown to be effective. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and outcome of IVT in patients with a time window beyond 4.5 hours selected by computed tomography perfusion(CTP) imaging. METHODS We analyzed all consecutive patients last seen well beyond 4.5 hours after stroke onset treated with IVT based on CTP between 01/2015-10/2018. CTP was visually assessed to estimate the mismatch between cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume maps. Early infarct signs were documented according to Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS). Safety data were obtained for mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage(sICH). Follow-up was assessed with the modified Rankin scale(mRS). RESULTS 70 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (mean age±SD 77.6±11.5 years, 50.0% female). Median NIHSS on admission was 8.0 (IQR: 4, 14). The most frequent reasons for an extended time window were WUS (60.0%) and delayed hospital admission (27.1%). Median time from last seen well to IVT was 11.4 hours. Median ASPECTS was 10 (9, 10) and CTP-mismatch 90% (80%, 100%). Twenty-four patients (34.3%) underwent additional mechanical thrombectomy. SICH occurred in 4 patients (5.7%). At follow-up, 49.3% had mRS of 0-2 and 22.4% mRS of 0-1. CONCLUSIONS In patients presenting in an extended time window beyond 4.5 hours, IVT-treatment with decision-making based on CTP might be a safe procedure. Further evaluation in clinical trials is needed. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: The 25-cm Gore Viabahn Endoprosthesis study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01263665) is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm study that enrolled 71 patients (50 men; mean age 66.7 ± 8.34 years) with lifestyle-limiting claudication (Rutherford class 2 to 4) and lesions longer than 20 cm (mean length 26.5 ± 5.31 cm, range 20-40). The majority of lesions (92.9%) were total occlusions. The primary performance outcome was post-deployment stent length within ± 10% of the pre-deployment stent length determined angiographically by quantitative vascular analysis. The primary safety outcome was device- and procedure-related serious adverse events occurring within 30 days of the procedure. The patients underwent follow-up examinations at 1 month and 1 year. Results : The median follow-up was 12.3 months (mean 12.3 ± 0.6). Nine (12.7%) patients discontinued the study due to different reasons including 2 bypass surgeries. Angiography was available in 60 patients to determine the primary performance outcome, which was met in all cases. Two (2.8%) patients experienced a procedure-/device-related adverse event (dissection) during the 30-day follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 1-year primary and secondary patency were 67.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 53.5% to 77.3%] and 96.9% (95% CI 88.0% to 99.2%), respectively. Changes in ankle-brachial index and Rutherford category at 1 and 12 months each showed sustained improvement. Conclusion : This study confirms that the 25-cm Viabahn endoprosthesis acutely performs as intended and is safe when used as indicated in complex femoropopliteal lesions. One-year primary and secondary patency rates are satisfying and comparable to historical prosthetic bypass graft outcomes.","Zeller, Thomas; Peeters, Patrick; Bosiers, Marc; Lammer, Johannes; Brechtel, Klaus; Scheinert, Dierk; Rastan, Aljoscha; Noory, Elias; Beschorner, Ulrich",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/14-4790r.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453876/,667
61506,Correlation between age and weight loss after bariatric surgery.,2013,"Highly correlated positioning of ions underlies Coulomb interactions between ions and electrified interfaces within dense ionic fluids such as biological cells and ionic liquids. Recent work has shown that highly correlated ionic systems behave differently than dilute electrolyte solutions and interest is focused upon characterizing the electrical and structural properties of the dense electrical double layers (EDL) formed at internal interfaces. It has been a challenge for experiments to characterize the progressive development of the EDL on the nanoscale as the interfacial electric potential is varied over a range of positive and negative values. Here we address this challenge by measuring X-ray reflectivity from the interface between an ionic liquid (IL) and a dilute aqueous electrolyte solution over a range of interfacial potentials from -450 mV to 350 mV. The growth of alternately charged cation-rich and anion-rich layers was observed along with a polarity reversal of the layers as the potential changed sign. These data show that the structural development of an ionic multilayer-like EDL with increasing potential is similar to that suggested by phenomenological theories and MD simulations, although our data also reveal that the excess charge beyond the first ionic layer decays more rapidly than predicted.","Katakura, Seiji; Amano, Ken-Ichi; Sakka, Tetsuo; Bu, Wei; Lin, Binhua; Schlossman, Mark L; Nishi, Naoya",The journal of physical chemistry.

61544,Clinical outcomes of CO2-less single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy versus open thymectomy: comparative study.,2016,"Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.","Fabelo-Roche, Justo R; Iglesias-Moré, Serguei; Gómez-García, Ana M",MEDICC review,https://doi.org/10.37757/mr2021.v23.n2.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974609/,667

Through a snowball sampling procedure, in Wave 1 424 respondents completed a survey in March 2020. One hundred thirteen of these participants completed the same survey in Wave 2 in May 2020. Consistent with research on SARS, females and older individuals engaged in the behaviors more often than men and younger individuals. After accounting for these variables in predicting frequency of protective health behaviors, components of the PMT accounted for an additional 12% of the variance in Wave 1 and 16% in Wave 2, with perceived severity and outcome efficaciousness correlating positively with frequency. Anticipatory regret mediated the relationship between PMT and protective health behavior frequency. The results suggest that public health announcements that are tailored toward the severity of the virus and the efficacy of the health behaviors in decreasing the spread of the virus may meet with more success than those that heighten people's vulnerability to the disease.","Kowalski, Robin M; Black, Kelly J",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1847448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190547/,667
61660,SILS: Is It Cost- and Time-Effective Compared to Standard Pediatric Laparoscopic Surgery?,2012,"BACKGROUND Surgical conditions in laparoscopic surgery are largely determined by the depth of neuromuscular relaxation. Especially in procedures that are confined to a narrow working field, such as retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery, deep neuromuscular relaxation may be beneficial. Until recently, though, deep neuromuscular block (NMB) came at the expense of a variety of issues that conflicted with its use. However, with the introduction of sugammadex, rapid reversal of a deep NMB is feasible. In the current protocol, the association between the depth of NMB and rating of surgical conditions by the surgeon and anesthesiologist is studied. METHODS/DESIGN This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel group and controlled trial. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) deep NMB (post-tetanic count, one or two twitches; n = 12) and (2) moderate NMB (train-of-four, 1 to 2 twitches, n = 12) by administration of high-dose rocuronium in Group 1 and a combination of atracurium and mivacurium in Group 2. The NMB in Group 1 is reversed by 4 mg/kg sugammadex; the NMB in Group 2 by 1 mg neostigmine and 0.5 mg atropine. Patients are eligible if they are over 18 years, willing to sign the informed consent form, and are scheduled to undergo an elective laparoscopic renal procedure or laparoscopic prostatectomy. A single surgeon performs the surgeries and rates the surgical conditions on a five-point surgical rating scale (SRS) ranging from 1 (poor surgical conditions) to 5 (excellent surgical conditions). The intra-abdominal part of the surgeries is captured on video and a group of five anesthesiologists and ten surgical experts will rate the videos using the same SRS. The primary analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. Evaluation will include the association between the level of NMB and SRS, as obtained by the surgeon performing the procedure and the agreement between the scoring of the images by anesthesiologists and surgeons. DISCUSSION We aim to show that under the right conditions the perceived opposing goals of surgeons and anesthesiologists (optimal surgical conditions vs. optimal postoperative conditions) may be met without compromise to either.

The debate about reducing the number of prescribed medications remains controversial, and more evidence is needed to understand the relationship between polypharmacy and fall-related hospital admissions. We examined the effect of polypharmacy on hospitalization due to a fall, using a large nationally representative sample of older adults. METHODS Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) were used. We included 6220 participants aged 50+ with valid data collected between 2012 and 2018.The main outcome measure was hospital admission due to a fall. Polypharmacy -the number of long-term prescription drugs- was the main exposure coded as: no medications, 1-4 medications, 5-9 medications (polypharmacy) and 10+ medications (heightened polypharmacy). Competing-risk regression analysis was used (with death as a potential competing risk), adjusted for common confounders, including multi-morbidity and fall risk-increasing drugs. RESULTS The prevalence of people admitted to hospital due to a fall increased according to the number of medications taken, from 1.5% of falls for people reporting no medications, to 4.7% of falls among those taking 1-4 medications, 7.9% of falls among those with polypharmacy and 14.8% among those reporting heightened polypharmacy. Fully adjusted SHRs for hospitalization due to a fall among people who reported taking 1-4 medications, polypharmacy and heightened polypharmacy were 1.79 (1.18; 2.71), 1.75 (1.04; 2.95), and 3.19 (1.61; 6.32) respectively, compared with people who were not taking medications. CONCLUSIONS The risk of hospitalization due to a fall increased with polypharmacy. It is suggested that prescriptions in older people should be revised on a regular basis, and that the number of medications prescribed be kept to a minimum, in order to reduce the risk of fall-related hospital admissions.","Zaninotto, P; Huang, Y T; Di Gessa, G; Abell, J; Lassale, C; Steptoe, A",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09920-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243195/,667
62318,Natural orifice proctectomy using a transanal endoscopic microsurgical technique in a porcine model.,2010,"This study was designed to compare feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of microwave (MW) ablation versus radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lung tissue in a rabbit model. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits were submitted to MW (n = 10, group A) or RF ablation (n = 10, group B). The procedures were performed with a prototype MW ablation device with a 1.6-cm radiating section antenna (Valleylab MW Ablation System) and with a 2-cm exposed-tip RF electrode (Cool-tip RF Ablation System). At immediate computed tomography increase in density, maximum diameters (D1-D3) of ablation zones were measured and ablation volume was calculated. Histopathologic assessment was performed 3 and 7 days after the procedure. Technical success was achieved in nine of 10 rabbits in each group. One death occurred in group B. Complications included pneumothorax (group A, n = 4; group B, n = 4), abscess (group A, n = 1; group B, n = 1), and thoracic wall burn (group A, n = 4). No significant differences were demonstrated in attenuation increase (P = 0.73), dimensions (P = 0.28, 0.86, 0.06, respectively, comparing D1-D3) and volume (P = 0.17). At histopathology, ablation zones were similar, with septal necrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and peripheral lymphocytic infiltrate. Complete thrombosis of more than 90% of vessels up to 2 mm in diameter was depicted at the periphery of the ablation zone in group A specimens. In group B specimens, complete thrombosis was depicted in 20% of vessels. Feasibility and safety of MW and RF ablation are similar in a lung rabbit model. MW ablation produces a greater damage to peripheral small vessels inducing thrombosis.","Crocetti, Laura; Bozzi, Elena; Faviana, Pinuccia; Cioni, Dania; Della Pina, Clotilde; Sbrana, Alberto; Fontanini, Gabriella; Lencioni, Riccardo",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-010-9869-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20442998/,667
62337,Laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer: preoperative radiochemotherapy versus surgery alone.,2012,"BACKGROUND The development of hypotension on administration of intravenous propofol is common, and independently associated with adverse outcomes. Identifying patients with a high risk for anesthesia-induced hypotension may help anesthesiologists prepare for such an event. AIM The authors hypothesized that propofol-induced hypotension is predictable by variables related to fluid responsiveness and investigated such variables to determine the factors which can predict hypotensive events. METHODS Patients 3-6 years of age who underwent general were included. Intravenous midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 was administered as premedication, and preoperative noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate, perfusion index, pleth variability index and respiratory variation of pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform were measured. Intravenous propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 was given, and blood pressure was measured 5 times at 1-min intervals. Subjects with significant hypotension (mean blood pressure decrease ≥ 20%) were allocated to the hypotensive group; those without significant hypotension were allocated to the relatively normotensive group. RESULTS Of 77 patients, 50 (64.9%) developed significant hypotension. Patients in the hypotensive group exhibited significantly higher respiratory variation of pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform (mean difference 11 (3.3) [95% confidence interval 4.9-18.1]; P=0.001] and higher pleth variability index [mean difference 7.1 (2.8) [95% confidence interval 1.6-12.6]; P=0.013] than the normotensive group. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for respiratory variation of pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform and pleth variability index were 0.722 and 0.649, respectively. CONCLUSION High preoperative respiratory variation of pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform and pleth variability index were both independently associated with propofol-induced hypotension in children.","Choi, Sheung-Nyoung; Ji, Sang-Hwan; Jang, Young-Eun; Kim, Eun-Hee; Lee, Ji-Hyun; Kim, Jin-Tae; Kim, Hee-Soo",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34018647/,667
62340,Ultrasound-guided laparoscopic liver resections.,2015,"BACKGROUND Hemorrhagic shock (HS) can develop into multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), among which acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) usually lead to poor outcomes. The underlying molecular mechanisms of HS-induced ALI/ARDS remain unclear. This study sought to investigate gene expression profiles and predict ceRNA regulatory networks in an HS-induced ALI/ARDS preclinical model. METHODS SD rats were subjected to a fixed volume of hemorrhage (HS, 40% estimated total blood volume) or not (sham) randomly. After 8 hours of observation, left lung tissue was harvested to evaluate lung injury. Right lung was collected for RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed and the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA linkages were predicted using the ceRNA theory. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the RNA sequencing findings. RESULTS HS lungs showed noticeable ALI/ARDS features, and 437 mRNAs, 31 miRNAs, 734 lncRNAs, and 29 circRNAs were differentially expressed. In GO and KEGG pathway analyses, the differentially expressed transcripts were enriched in the following terms: the metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, necroptosis, DNA damage recognition and repair, inflammatory cell migration and chemotaxis, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling, etc. And this study identified lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA linkages with 12 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs, 15 mRNAs, and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA linkages with 10 circRNAs, 16 miRNAs, 39 mRNAs. These networks might play important regulatory roles. CONCLUSIONS This is the first high-throughput analysis of gene expression profiles in HS-induced ALI/ARDS. It shows that metabolism, cell signaling, DNA damage and repair, and necroptosis related RNAs altered, and inflammatory response associated RNAs and pathways have pivotal roles in HS-induced ALI/ARDS progression. It also prompts some important RNAs and regulatory networks for future research.

62377,Practical ex-vivo evaluation of application of surgical clips to sutures during re-approximation of renal tissue in partial nephrectomy.,2016,"Owing to its broad substrate specificity of mainly xenobiotic and its preferential extrahepatic expression, cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is a principle member of the CYP450 detoxifying enzyme superfamily involving in carcinogenesis. In this study, we analyzed methylation status of 93 CpG sites, densely scattered within approximately 1.5 kb 5' regulatory region of CYP1A1, and its association with gene transcription in tissue cohorts dissected from 40 patients with gastric cancer. Bisulfite sequencing and the resulting methylation percentages revealed dynamically methylated CpG sites located within or around xenobiotic response elements (XRE) 4-10, and a region of consistent hypermethylation located near proximal promoter, encompassing XRE2-3. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences of the methylation percentages at CpG sites -1415 (0.032) and -1524 (P=0.041) (located at the close upstream region of XRE10) between cancerous and normal gastric tissues as well as between those with and without lymphatic involvement. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that the CYP1A1 gene expression significantly increased in cancerous tissues compared to their normal tissue cohort, and is significantly associated with hypomethylation at the CpG sites -1383 (P=0.018) existing within the XRE10 motif. These data suggest that the variably methylated CpG site existing in the 5' regulatory region of CYP1A1 gene, corresponding with the XRE10 regulatory region, is associated with the CYP1A1 gene upregulation and likely involved in gastric cancer incidence and metastasis. Methylation analysis of the CpG sites located within or around the XRE10 motif of the CYP1A1 promoter can be used as a potential marker to evaluate individual susceptibility to gastric cancer.","Sadeghi-Amiri, L; Barzegar, A; Nikbakhsh-Zati, N; Mehraban, P",Gene,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069801/,667

For otolaryngology evaluations, examination of the ear and oropharynx is important but difficult to achieve remotely. Objective To assess the feasibility of patient use of low-cost digital videoscopes and smartphones for examination of the ear and oropharynx. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective quality improvement study was conducted in an academic adult otolaryngology clinic including 23 patients who presented for an in-person appointment and owned a smartphone device. The study was conducted from July 1 to 15, 2020. Interventions Participants were asked to capture pictures and videos of their ear canals and oropharynx with digital videoscopes and their smartphones under real-time guidance over a telehealth platform. They were then surveyed about their experience. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were ratings by health care clinicians and a blinded otolaryngologist reviewer of image acceptability. Secondary outcomes included participant time to image acquisition and willingness to purchase digital videoscopes for telehealth use. Results Of the 23 participants included, 14 were women (61%); mean age was 50 years (range, 21 to 80 years). Of the images obtained using the digital otoscope ear examination, 95% were considered acceptable by the health care clinicians and 91% were considered acceptable by the blinded reviewer; 16 participants (70%) reported that the otoscope was easy to use. The mean time to acquire images for both ears was 114 seconds (95% CI, 84-145 seconds). Twenty-one participants (91%) were willing to pay for a digital otoscope for telehealth use. For the oropharyngeal examination, a greater proportion of smartphone video examinations were considered acceptable by clinicians (63% acceptability) and the blinded reviewer (55%) compared with the digital endoscope (clinicians, 40%; blinded reviewer, 14%). The mean time required for the oropharyngeal examination smartphone video capture was shorter at 35 seconds compared with both the digital endoscope (difference, -27 seconds; 95% CI, -7 to -47 seconds) and smartphone photo capture (difference, -53 seconds; 95% CI, -20 to -87 seconds). Conclusions and Relevance Digital otoscopes and smartphones apparently can facilitate remote head and neck physical examination in telehealth. Digital otoscopes were useful for ear examinations, and smartphone videos appeared to be the most useful for oropharyngeal examinations. Further studies are required to determine specific diagnostic capabilities in various telehealth practice settings.","Cai, Yi; Zheng, Yixuan James; Gulati, Arushi; Butrymowicz, Anna; Krauter, Roseanne; Pletcher, Steven D; Sharon, Jeffrey D; Goldberg, Andrew N; Chang, Jolie L",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.5223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475683/,667

To describe a simple and convenient method for detection and manual compensation of cyclotorsion during the procedure. METHODS In this retrospective study, a total of 164 eyes from 114 patients over 20 years of age with at least 1.5 diopters (D) of myopic astigmatism were treated by SMILE. Any cyclotorsion was manually compensated by gently rotating the cone to align the horizontal marks on the cornea to the 0° to 180° axis of the reticule after activating the suction. RESULTS The mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.3±2.01 D, and the mean cylinder was -2.01±0.67 D. Three months after surgery, a total of 87% of eyes were within±0.50 D of attempted post-operative SE, and 98% of eyes were within±1.00 D. Overall, the predictability of cylinder correction was excellent, with 96.3% of eyes within±1.00 D of attempted post-operative cylinder. The mean postoperative cylinder at three months was -0.3±0.39 D. We noted a slight undercorrection with treatment of high cylinder. However, 82% of eyes achieved postoperative refractive astigmatism less than 0.5 D. 91% of eyes achieved uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) equal to or better than 8/10. 22% of eyes gained one line of visual acuity. CONCLUSION SMILE is a predictable and safe technique for the surgical correction of astigmatism. Manual compensation may be an effective approach to improve astigmatic outcomes of SMILE, especially in moderate and high astigmatism.","Assad, M; Chazalon, T; Naguszewski, D; Muraine, M",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2019.11.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004196/,667

OBJECTIVES The current study characterized current video usage behaviors and their relationship with appearance dissatisfaction and interest in aesthetic procedures in the general population. METHODS An online survey was completed by 335 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in 'video manipulation' techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video calls (ie, on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video use behaviors were associated with greater body image disturbance. RESULTS Over 1/3 of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, greater engagement in video manipulation behaviors, and increasing appearance concerns due to their time on video calls. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty treatments (eg, waxing) and aesthetic procedures (eg, non-surgical procedures such as anti-wrinkle injections). CONCLUSIONS This is one of first empirical studies to report the potential consequences of video call usage for increasing appearance dissatisfaction and dysmorphic concern, and to demonstrate a link between the use of video calls and interest in cosmetic procedures.","Pikoos, Toni D; Buzwell, Simone; Sharp, Gemma; Rossell, Susan L",Aesthetic surgery journal,https://doi.org/10.1093/asj/sjab257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34146086/,667

METHOD Description of the implementation of a combined teletherapy program for outpatient and day-hospital patients and the adaptations made to the inpatient protocol. Retrospective review of medical records and analysis of general and specific variables related to the pandemic and confinement. RESULTS We held 1,329 (73.10%) telehealth consultations and 489 (26.9%) face-to-face outpatient visits with 365 patients undergoing treatment in the outpatient clinic or day hospital. Twenty-eight (7.67%) were initial evaluations. Twenty-two patients were newly admitted and 68 ED-related emergencies were attended. Almost half of the children and adolescents studied experienced reactivation of ED symptoms despite treatment, and severe patients (25%) presented self-harm and suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of a combined teletherapy program has enabled continuity of care during confinement for children and adolescents with ED. Delivery of treatment to adolescents in the day hospital program posed the biggest challenge due to their greater degrees of severity and higher hospitalization rates. An adapted inpatient program should be maintained throughout confinement, as the need for hospitalization of children and adolescents with ED does not decrease with lockdown.","Graell, Montserrat; Morón-Nozaleda, M Goretti; Camarneiro, Ricardo; Villaseñor, Ángel; Yáñez, Silvia; Muñoz, Rudiger; Martínez-Núñez, Beatriz; Miguélez-Fernández, Carolina; Muñoz, María; Faya, Mar",European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729139/,667
63126,Robotic vs. laparoscopic colorectal surgery: an institutional experience.,2012,"BACKGROUND The prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is high after bariatric surgery. Vitamin D is supplied to counteract SHPT and bone disease, and we studied vitamin D associations with SHPT. METHODS We measured serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch. One hundred twenty-five patients were included, of whom 114 (91 %) had undergone gastric bypass and 11 (9 %) had undergone duodenal switch. SHPT was defined as PTH > 7.0 pmol/l in the absence of hypercalcemia. 25-OH vitamin D levels were divided into three categories: <50, 50-74, and ≥75 nmol/l. Serum ionized calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and creatinine were divided into tertiles. RESULTS Mean age ± SD was 44 ± 9 years at 5 years follow-up. Ninety out of 125 (72 %) patients were women. SHPT was present in 45 out of 114 (40 %) gastric bypass patients and in 11 out of 11 (100 %) duodenal switch patients. The prevalence was high in all vitamin D categories studied. An inverse association between ionized calcium and PTH was found. For the gastric bypass patients, the odds ratio for SHPT in the upper two tertiles of ionized calcium was 0.35; 95 % CI, 0.15-0.79; p = 0.011, compared with the lowest tertile. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium were not associated with a lower prevalence of SHPT at 5 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of SHPT was high 5 years after gastric bypass and duodenal switch. SHPT was inversely associated with serum ionized calcium, but not with vitamin D. The supplementation used was insufficient to compensate for the impaired calcium absorption after surgery.","Hewitt, Stephen; Søvik, Torgeir T; Aasheim, Erlend T; Kristinsson, Jon; Jahnsen, Jørgen; Birketvedt, Grethe S; Bøhmer, Thomas; Eriksen, Erik F; Mala, Tom",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0772-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23015268/,667
63374,Deformable three-dimensional model architecture for interactive augmented reality in minimally invasive surgery.,2012,"ABSTRACT Neuropathic pain (NeuP) can be difficult to diagnose and manage in children. Data regarding prevalence and sex-dependent differences is limited, and more detailed phenotyping is needed.This observational cohort study recruited adolescents (10-17years) with NeuP or complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Following pain and NeuP screening questionnaires, quantitative sensory testing (QST) was performed. Individual z-score plots were calculated with body-region control measures and matched to mechanism-related sensory profiles (sensory loss, thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia). Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) was assessed with pressure pain threshold (PPT) and a contralateral cold conditioning stimulus, and meaningful CPM defined as twice the standard error of measurement. Patients and parents completed validated questionnaires for child quality of life (QoL), pain catastrophizing, and self-reported anxiety/depression.Males (n=23) and females (n=43) with NeuP (n=52) or CRPS (n=14) reported moderate-severe pain with neuropathic sensory descriptors. Mixed patterns of sensory gain/loss at pain sites were not sex-dependent. Thermal hyperalgesia was common in both NeuP and CRPS, whereas sensory loss occurred only with NeuP and in a smaller proportion than adult cohorts. CPM was inhibitory in 54%, facilitatory in 14%, and non-responders had variable cold conditioning sensitivity. Males and females reported marked impairment of QoL, increased emotional distress and pain catastrophising. Child-parent QoL scores correlated, but catastrophizing scores were discordant in parents or adolescents with higher anxiety/depression.NeuP in adolescents is associated with significant pain, physical and psychosocial impairment. Quantifying alterations in somatosensory profiles, descending modulation and child-parent psychological function will inform individualized therapy and stratification for future clinical trials.","Verriotis, Madeleine; Peters, Judy; Sorger, Clarissa; Walker, Suellen M",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394878/,667

63609,Robotic-assisted laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in gynecology: initial report and technique.,2009,"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that overcome natural and vaccine-induced immunity threaten to exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and Membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses.IMPORTANCEWidespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the Spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virologic, immunologic, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Vidal, Samuel J; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Yu, Jingyou; McMahan, Katherine; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Ventura, John D; Aid, Malika; Peter, Lauren; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Anioke, Tochi; Chang, Aiquan; Wan, Huahua; Aguayo, Ricardo; Ngo, Debby; Gerszten, Robert E; Seaman, Michael S; Barouch, Dan H",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00404-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893169/,667
63630,Intentional Omission of Ureteral Stents During Robotic-assisted Intracorporeal Ureteroenteric Anastomosis: Is It Safe and Feasible?,2017,"INTRODUCTION The understanding of fatigue in hypoxia is limited due to: lack of control in arterial saturation, different exercise intensities and hypoxia levels, lag time between exercise cessation and fatigue evaluation. We aimed at evaluating fatigue during cycling and immediately after exhaustion in normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia at relative and absolute intensities. METHODS Thirteen subjects completed three sessions in normoxia, moderate and severe hypoxia with intensity based on percentage of normoxic maximal power output (NOR, MODABS, SEVABS) plus two sessions where intensity was based on the corresponding environmental condition (MODREL, SEVREL). Arterial saturation was clamped at 85% and 70% in moderate and severe hypoxia, respectively. Before, during cycling, and at exhaustion, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), peripheral fatigue [high-frequency doublet (Db100), twitch (Pt)], and central fatigue [cortical voluntary activation (VATMS)] were evaluated without delay using an innovative ergometer. RESULTS Time to exhaustion declined with hypoxia level at absolute but also relative intensities compared to NOR. At isotime, MVC, Pt and Db100 were similarly depreciated in NOR, MODREL and SEVREL. At exhaustion, there was a similar reduction among conditions in MVC (-26 to -31%), Db100 (-25 to -35%) and VATMS (-9 to -13%). However, Pt was less decreased in SEVREL compared to NOR (-33±17 vs. -46±16%). CONCLUSION The shorter time to EXH in relative hypoxia, and yet lower peripheral fatigue and similar central fatigue compared to normoxia suggests that hypoxia per se may affect brain areas not directly implicated in quadriceps motor function.","Mira, José; Floreani, Mirco; Savoldelli, Aldo; Amery, Khaled; Koral, Jerome; Oranchuk, Dustin J; Messonnier, Laurent; Rupp, Thomas; Millet, Guillaume Y",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175975/,667
63750,Retrospective analysis of the learning curve associated with laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs and associated perioperative complication rates.,2014,"Bats host a large number of zoonotic viruses, including several viruses that are highly pathogenic to other mammals. The mechanisms underlying this rich viral diversity are unknown, but they may be linked to unique immunological features that allow bats to act as asymptomatic viral reservoirs. Vertebrates respond to viral infection by inducing IFNs, which trigger antiviral defenses through IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Although the IFN system of several bats is characterized at the genomic level, less is known about bat IFN-mediated transcriptional responses. In this article, we show that IFN signaling in bat cells from the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) consists of conserved and unique ISG expression profiles. In IFN-stimulated cells, bat ISGs comprise two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast, human ISGs lack this decline phase and remained elevated for longer periods. Notably, in unstimulated cells, bat ISGs were expressed more highly than their human counterparts. We also found that the antiviral effector 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease, which is not an ISG in humans, is highly IFN inducible in black flying fox cells and contributes to cell-intrinsic control of viral infection. These studies reveal distinctive innate immune features that may underlie a unique virus-host relationship in bats.","De La Cruz-Rivera, Pamela C; Kanchwala, Mohammed; Liang, Hanquan; Kumar, Ashwani; Wang, Lin-Fa; Xing, Chao; Schoggins, John W",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29180486/,667
63805,Laparoscopic surgery for sigmoidocutaneous fistula due to diverticulitis: A case report.,2015,"Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) is increasingly being used in the management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction (RESP) score is most commonly used to predict survival of patients undergoing ECMO. However, the RESP score does not incorporate renal and hepatic dysfunction which are frequently a part of the constellation of multiorgan dysfunction associated with ARDS. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) incorporates both liver and kidney dysfunction and is used in the risk stratification of liver transplant recipients as well as those undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the MELD score in patients undergoing VV ECMO. Patients undergoing VV ECMO from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from our prospectively maintained institutional ECMO database and stratified based on MELD score. Baseline clinical, laboratory, and follow-up data, as well as post-ECMO outcomes, were compared. Of 71 patients, 50 patients (70.4%) had a MELD score <12 and 21 (29.6%) had a MELD score ≥12. The higher MELD score was associated with increased post-ECMO mortality but reduced risk of dialysis and tracheostomy. In multivariate analysis, higher MELD score (HR 1.35, 95% CI = 1.07-2.75), lower body surface area (HR 0.16, 0.04-0.65), RESP score (HR 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64-0.87), and platelet count (HR 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98-0.99), were significant predictors of postoperative mortality. We conclude that MELD score can be used complementarily to the RESP score to predict outcomes in patients with ARDS undergoing VV ECMO.","Watanabe, Satoshi; Kurihara, Chitaru; Manerikar, Adwaiy; Thakkar, Sanket; Saine, Mark; Bharat, Ankit",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315657/,667

Challenges and uncertainty remain in several aspects related to the management and surveillance of patients with germ cell tumors (GCT). Long-term effects of treatment on survivors of testicular cancer remain as continued areas of interest. This review aims to highlight pearls and perils in the management of patients with GCT. RECENT FINDINGS Uncertainty remain regarding complex aspects of first-line and salvage treatments of GCT, interpretation of tumor markers in cases of α-fetoprotein levels less than 25 ng/ml, plateau of β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in patients with initial hCG greater than 50 000 mIU/ml, supportive therapies throughout chemotherapy regimens, and long-term survivorship of patients who underwent surgery or received platinum-based chemotherapy. This review aims to highlight challenges that remain in GCT, review the emerging data in these areas, and provide our institutional opinion on the management in several aspects of GCT. SUMMARY Testicular cancer continues to present challenging clinical scenarios with respect to treatment, surveillance, and long-term management of patients. We review the data and share our institutional knowledge in several challenging areas related to the management of GCT.","Wei, Cynthia X; Einhorn, Lawrence H; Adra, Nabil",Current opinion in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1097/cco.0000000000000718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577208/,667
63910,Fluoroscopically guided wide-bore thoracostomy tube placement: Description of the technique and comparison to blind placement.,2018,"Many viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have a structure consisting of spikes protruding from an underlying spherical surface. Research in biological and colloidal sciences has revealed secrets of why spikes exist on virus surfaces. Specifically, the spikes favor virus attachment on surfaces via receptor-specific interactions (RSIs), mediate the membrane fusion, and determine or change viral tropism. The spikes also facilitate viruses to approach surfaces before attachment and subsequently escape back to the environment if RSIs do not occur (i.e., easy come and easy go). Therefore, virus spikes create the paradox of having a large capacity for binding with cells (high infectivity) and meanwhile great mobility in the environment. Such structure-function relationships have important implications for the fabrication of virus-like particles and analogous colloids (e.g., hedgehog- and raspberry-like particles) for applications such as the development of antiviral vaccines and drug delivery.","Shen, Chongyang; Bradford, Scott A",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.01339-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33597174/,667
64301,Initial operative experience of single-port retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy.,2012,"Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids), the most common benign tumor in women of childbearing age, can cause symptoms including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, urinary symptoms, pain and infertility. Hysterectomy is a common approach to treating uterine fibroids, and less invasive surgical approaches such as myomectomy and uterine artery embolization also have been shown to alleviate symptoms. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is the only totally non-invasive surgical approved method for treating uterine fibroids. In clinical trials, MRgFUS resulted in significant relief of uterine fibroid symptoms. The safe and effective use of MRgFUS is affected by fibroid type and location, position relative to adjacent anatomical structures and the presence of co-existent pelvic disease. Additionally, successful outcomes with MRgFUS have been correlated with the volume of fibroids ablated during the procedure. Thus, selection of patients in whom sufficient fibroid volumes can be treated safely using the MRgFUS system is critical for successful outcomes. The MR images in this pictorial essay provide examples of uterine fibroids for which MRgFUS should be considered and is designed to facilitate the selection of patients for whom MRgFUS is most likely to provide sustained symptom relief.","Yoon, Sang-Wook; Lee, Chan; Cha, Sun Hee; Yu, Jeong-Sik; Na, Young-Jeong; Kim, Kyoung Ah; Jung, Sang-Geun; Kim, Seung-Jo",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-008-1086-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18618119/,667

64803,Current status of robotic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: comparison with laparoscopic gastrectomy.,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND Many patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) who are otherwise candidates for endovascular treatment (EVT) have had previous strokes. We aimed to examine the effect of previous stroke on outcome after EVT. METHODS Consecutive patients with LVO were prospectively entered into a National Acute Stroke registry of patients undergoing EVT. Patients treated with EVT were divided into those with and without previous strokes. The rates of favorable reperfusion status, mortality, and excellent outcome at 90 days post-stroke as well as symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 390 underwent EVT and 35 had previous strokes. Patients with previous strokes were significantly older; more frequently had a history of prior myocardial infarction and more often had pre-existing functional disability. Favorable target vessel recanalization was less frequently achieved in patients with previous strokes (60% vs. 82%; p = 0.005) and ordinal regression analysis for functional outcome revealed higher frequency of deterioration at three months in patients with previous strokes. Nevertheless, 9% of these patients maintained their previous disability state and sICH rates did not differ between the groups. Mortality rates at one year post stroke were significantly higher in patients with previous strokes (37% vs. 16%; p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Previous strokes are associated with higher likelihoods of mortality and unfavorable outcome in patients with LVO undergoing EVT. However, because some of these patients maintain their previous disability state, the presence of previous stroke should not be used as an exclusion criterion from EVT.","Leker, Ronen R; Cohen, Jose E; Horev, Anat; Tanne, David; Orion, David; Raphaeli, Guy; Amsalem, Jacob; Streifler, Jonathan Y; Hallevi, Hen; Bornstein, Natan M; Yaghmour, Nour E; Telman, Gregory",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493019841244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30947643/,667

Refractory high-entropy alloys have drawn particular attention due to their high melting points and excellent softening resistance, which are the two key requirements for high-temperature applications. Their compositional space is immense even after considering cost and recyclability restrictions, providing abundant design opportunities. However, refractory high-entropy alloys often exhibit apparent brittleness and oxidation susceptibility, which remain important challenges for their processing and application. Here, utilizing natural-mixing characteristics among refractory elements, we designed a Ti38V15Nb23Hf24 refractory high-entropy alloy that exhibits >20% tensile ductility in the as-cast state, and physicochemical stability at high temperatures. Exploring the underlying deformation mechanisms across multiple length scales, we observe that a rare β'-phase plays an intriguing role in the mechanical response of this alloy.

Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients' serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway.","Wang, Qiong; Zhou, Xin; Yang, Long; Zhao, Yongjian; Chew, Zhihuan; Xiao, Jun; Liu, Chang; Zheng, Xin; Zheng, Yuxiao; Shi, Qi; Liang, Qianqian; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, Hongyan",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937124/,667

We expand on previous studies by analyzing cortical thinning in contralesional, homologous regions indirectly linked to primary stroke lesions via ipsilesional cortical areas. For this purpose, stroke patients were serially studied by magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion tensor imaging and high-resolution anatomical imaging) in the acute (days 3-5) and late chronic stage one year after stroke. We analyzed changes of gray and white matter integrity in 18 stroke patients (median age 68 years) with subcortical stroke. We applied probabilistic fiber tractography to identify brain regions connected to stroke lesions and contralesional homologous areas. Cortical thickness was quantified by semi-automatic measurements, and fractional anisotropy was analyzed. One year after stroke, significant decrease of cortical thickness was detected in areas connected to ischemic lesions (mean -0.15 mm; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.07 mm) as well as homologous contralateral brain regions (mean -0.13 mm; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.19 mm). We detected reduced white matter integrity of inter- and intrahemispheric fiber tracts. There were no significant associations with clinical recovery.

After removing duplicates and articles that did not cover the correct populations or subject matter, a total of 74 articles remained in our analysis. MAIN RESULTS Most articles recommended direct breastfeeding with enhanced precaution measures. Recommendations regarding post-partum social distancing varied, although articles published more recently often recommended keeping the mother and newborn in the same room when possible. Decontamination recommendations emphasized mask wearing, good hand hygiene, and proper cleaning of surfaces.

Recent PEDV eruption in East Asian and North American countries made it notorious and caused huge economic losses to the porcine industry. Nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) is a nucleic acid helicase/NTPase that plays a critical role in viral gene transcription and viral replication. To investigate the function of nsp13 in the context of PEDV infection, here, PEDV nsp13 gene was amplified and cloned into pET28a/pET30a/pGEX-6P-1 expression vectors. The recombinant his-tagged nsp13 and GST-tagged nsp13 were expressed. Purified his-tagged nsp13 from pET28a-nsp13 vectors was chosen for immunization. Three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) named 5A9, 5C7, and 5G7 were identified from the hybridoma cells, and were characterized by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent assay, which demonstrated high specificity of these three mAbs with pCAGGS-HA-nsp13. All three mAbs belong to IgG1+ kappa subclass. However, only mAb 5A9 could effectively and specifically recognize PEDV expressing nsp13. Furthermore, the generated antibody against nsp13 could be applied to investigate nsp13 function during PEDV replication.","Chen, Jun; Ding, Tong; Liang, Wenqi; Li, Ting; Wu, Shengqiang; Xie, Wenqing; Ding, Nengshui; Tang, Yuxin; Ding, Zhen",Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1089/mab.2020.0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351712/,667

METHODS Manual and electronic searches (Web of Science, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ProQuest) were conducted. We selected randomized controlled trials with older adults following hip fracture surgery that included either specific BT or gait, mobility, or transfer training. Two independent reviewers extracted data and rated the methodological quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. A third reviewer provided consensus. Extracted BT data included balance domain, progression, frequency, duration, intensity, level of supervision, setting, and rehabilitation phase. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We included 17 trials from 19 studies; 11 studies were rated as moderate to high methodological quality, but only 8 were considered to have high-quality BT components. Half of the interventions included only one balance domain, with stability during movement being the most commonly included domain. The primary balance progression utilized was reducing hand support. Dual task, anticipatory postural adjustment, reactive strategies, and perceptual training domains were rarely included. Balance training duration and intensity were poorly described. Although most programs were home-based with minimal levels of supervision, a few extended beyond postacute phase of rehabilitation. CONCLUSION Further consideration should be given to include more challenging BT domains with planned progressions to maximize patient recovery through hip fracture rehabilitation programs.","Lima, Camila Astolphi; Perracini, Monica Rodrigues; Funabashi, Martha; Weber, Sydnie; Beaupre, Lauren",Journal of geriatric physical therapy,https://doi.org/10.1519/jpt.0000000000000286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534338/,667

OBJECTIVE To compare the outcomes of HFOV with those of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in children with acute respiratory failure. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a retrospective, observational study using deidentified data obtained from all consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilation aged 1 month to 18 years in the Virtual PICU System database from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2011. The study population was divided into 2 groups: HFOV and CMV. The HFOV group was further divided into early and late HFOV. Propensity score matching was performed as a 1-to-1 match of HFOV and CMV patients. A similar matching process was performed for early HFOV and CMV patients. EXPOSURE High-frequency oscillatory ventilation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, ICU mortality, and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). RESULTS A total of 9177 patients from 98 hospitals qualified for inclusion. Of these, 902 (9.8%) received HFOV, whereas 8275 (90.2%) received CMV. A total of 1764 patients were matched to compare HFOV and CMV, whereas 942 patients were matched to compare early HFOV and CMV. Length of mechanical ventilation (CMV vs HFOV: 14.6 vs 20.3 days, P < .001; CMV vs early HFOV: 14.6 vs 15.9 days, P < .001), ICU length of stay (19.1 vs 24.9 days, P < .001; 19.3 vs 19.5 days, P = .03), and mortality (8.4% vs 17.3%, P < .001; 8.3% vs 18.1%, P < .001) were significantly higher in HFOV and early HFOV patients compared with CMV patients.

66053,Role of minimally invasive surgery in ovarian cancer.,2013,"RATIONALE Patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) present abnormal ventilatory mechanics during exercise and may require bronchodilator therapy. However, bronchodilation does not enhance cycling exercise tolerance in these patients whereas walking may be more sensitive to the effects of bronchodilation. OBJECTIVES To characterize the impact of bronchodilation on i) exercise tolerance ii) cardiopulmonary response and iii) dynamic hyperinflation following an endurance shuttle walking test in patients with mild COPD. METHODS In a randomized double-blind cross-over trial, 37 patients with GOLD stage I COPD (FEV(1), 96 ± 2% predicted, mean ± SEM) completed an endurance shuttle walking test up to exhaustion 90 ± 15 min following nebulization of a placebo [NaCl] or of ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate (500 μg/2.5 mg) combination. RESULTS FEV(1) significantly increased following bronchodilation compared with placebo (0.17 ± 0.02 vs. -0.02 ± 0.01 L, p < 0.0001, mean ± SEM). The difference in walking endurance time between bronchodilation and placebo was not statistically significant (Δ15 ± 12 s, p = 0.21), with the upper and lower boundaries of the 95% confidence interval [-9-40 s, 95% CI] within the proposed minimally important difference for this variable (65 s). The ratio of breathing frequency to tidal volume tended to be decreased with bronchodilation during exercise (p = 0.07), indicating a deeper and slower breathing pattern with bronchodilation. Bronchodilation had a significant effect on dynamic hyperinflation at isotime and at peak exercise. CONCLUSION Bronchodilation did not improve walking endurance in patients with mild COPD despite small physiological benefits of uncertain clinical relevance.","Gagnon, Philippe; Saey, Didier; Provencher, Steeve; Milot, Julie; Bourbeau, Jean; Tan, Wan C; Martel, Simon; Maltais, François",Respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2012.08.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999808/,667

METHODS The Harmonic ACE™ (ACE), Covidien Sonicision™ (SNC), and Olympus SonoSurg™ (SS) were applied using pre-set factory cutting and coagulation settings to Bovine mesentery and Lamb renal veins, respectively. The maximum temperature and cooling time to reach 60 °C were recorded using an infrared Fluke Ti55 thermal imager. Histological examination was evaluated after application of energy. RESULTS The ACE, Sonicision, and SonoSurg had emissivity measurements of 0.49 ± 0.01, 0.40 ± 0.00, and 0.39 ± 0.01, respectively. Maximum cutting temperatures were: ACE = 191.1°, SNC = 227.1°, and SNS 184.8° * (*p < 0.001). Maximum coagulation temperatures did not differ significantly among devices (p = 0.490). The cooling time to reach 60 °C after activation were 35.7 s (ACE), 38.7 s (SNC), and 27.4 s* (SS) (*p < 0.001). The cooling time of passive jaws to reach 60 °C after activation were 25.4 s* (ACE), 5.7 s (SNC), and 15.4 s (SS) (*p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic ultrasonic instruments obtain the same cutting and coagulation objectives but in different manners. The Sonicision improves cutting by getting the blade hotter while the SonoSurg has more precise coagulation effects by heating slower. Emissivity values varied among instruments, providing equally varied results. Depending on the purpose of the devices, a certain device may be more appropriate. Based on emissivity, more studies are needed to identify the ideal material that can predictably and effectively perform in clinical settings. Although different blade geometry is apparent between instruments, the jaws are also designed differently between the generations of instruments.","Kim, Fernando J; Sehrt, David; da Silva, Rodrigo Donalisio; Gustafson, Diedra; Nogueira, Leticia; Molina, Wilson R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3787-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159635/,667

DESIGN Observational cohort study and simulations of pathogen transfer. SETTING A Veterans' Affairs hospital. PARTICIPANTS Patients newly admitted to the hospital with no known carriage of healthcare-associated pathogens. METHODS Interactions between the participants and personnel or portable equipment were observed, and cultures of high-touch surfaces, floors, bedding, and patients' socks and skin were collected for up to 4 days. Cultures were processed for Clostridioides difﬁcile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Simulations were conducted with bacteriophage MS2 to assess plausibility of transfer from contaminated floors to high-touch surfaces and to assess the effectiveness of wearing slippers in reducing transfer. RESULTS Environmental cultures became positive for at least 1 pathogen in 10 (59%) of the 17 rooms, with cultures positive for MRSA, C. difficile, and VRE in the rooms of 10 (59%), 2 (12%), and 2 (12%) participants, respectively. For all 14 instances of pathogen detection, the initial site of recovery was the floor followed in a subset of patients by detection on sock bottoms, bedding, and high-touch surfaces. In simulations, wearing slippers over hospital socks dramatically reduced transfer of bacteriophage MS2 from the floor to hands and to high-touch surfaces. CONCLUSIONS Floors may be an underappreciated source of pathogen dissemination in healthcare facilities. Simple interventions such as having patients wear slippers could potentially reduce the risk for transfer of pathogens from floors to hands and high-touch surfaces.","Redmond, Sarah N; Pearlmutter, Basya S; Ng-Wong, Yilen K; Alhmidi, Heba; Cadnum, Jennifer L; Silva, Sandra Y; Wilson, Brigid M; Donskey, Curtis J",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.1367; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431099/,667

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine the efficacy of tDCS at modulating empathy. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving anodal or cathodal versus sham tDCS to modulate empathy in healthy adults and clinical populations. Random-effects modelling was applied to pooling overall efficacy estimates using standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) and 95% confidence intervals. Outcome measures for tasks designed to measure empathy were reaction time and accuracy. RESULTS We identified 20 trials (from 28 reports), involving 1013 participants (55% male; mean age 31.2 years; range 21-69 years). Most studies involved healthy volunteers. Anodal tDCS improved lab-based computerized measures of cognitive empathy by way of reduced reaction time after we excluded one outlier (g = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.06, k=21, I2 <0.1%) and improved lab-based computerized measures of accuracy (g = 0.37; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.56, p < 0.001, k = 13) on related tasks. However, cathodal tDCS did not impact performance on any of these tasks. CONCLUSION Anodal tDCS appears to improve lab-based computerized measures of cognitive empathy in healthy adult volunteers. While the evidence provided by this review may be of relevance to individuals with impaired empathic capabilities, the generalizability of our findings is geared towards nonclinical populations given the preponderance of healthy volunteers in our review. Hence, it is not clear if moderate improvements in speed and accuracy on lab-based computerized empathy measures would lead to meaningful clinical improvements. Future studies should consider the use of tDCS to modulate empathy in clinical populations.","Bahji, Anees; Forth, Evan; Yang, Cheng-Chang; Khalifa, Najat",Social neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1080/17470919.2021.1889657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567964/,667

However, rapid assays for assessing candidate drugs typically involve in vitro screens and cell lines that do not recapitulate human physiology at the tissue and organ levels. Here we show that a microfluidic bronchial-airway-on-a-chip lined by highly differentiated human bronchial-airway epithelium and pulmonary endothelium can model viral infection, strain-dependent virulence, cytokine production and the recruitment of circulating immune cells. In airway chips infected with influenza A, the co-administration of nafamostat with oseltamivir doubled the treatment-time window for oseltamivir. In chips infected with pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinically relevant doses of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine inhibited infection but clinical doses of hydroxychloroquine and other antiviral drugs that inhibit the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines under static conditions did not. We also show that amodiaquine showed substantial prophylactic and therapeutic activities in hamsters challenged with native SARS-CoV-2. The human airway-on-a-chip may accelerate the identification of therapeutics and prophylactics with repurposing potential.","Si, Longlong; Bai, Haiqing; Rodas, Melissa; Cao, Wuji; Oh, Crystal Yuri; Jiang, Amanda; Moller, Rasmus; Hoagland, Daisy; Oishi, Kohei; Horiuchi, Shu; Uhl, Skyler; Blanco-Melo, Daniel; Albrecht, Randy A; Liu, Wen-Chun; Jordan, Tristan; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Golynker, Ilona; Frere, Justin; Logue, James; Haupt, Robert; McGrath, Marisa; Weston, Stuart; Zhang, Tian; Plebani, Roberto; Soong, Mercy; Nurani, Atiq; Kim, Seong Min; Zhu, Danni Y; Benam, Kambez H; Goyal, Girija; Gilpin, Sarah E; Prantil-Baun, Rachelle; Gygi, Steven P; Powers, Rani K; Carlson, Kenneth E; Frieman, Matthew; tenOever, Benjamin R; Ingber, Donald E",Nature biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-021-00718-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941899/,667

Thoracic and lung ultrasound have become a rapid and accurate method of diagnosis of hypoxic diseases. The purpose of this article is to review the recent literature on POCUS, emphasizing on its use in the operating room. RECENT FINDINGS Many international critical care societies published guidelines on the use of ultrasound in the installation of central venous access. More recently, evidenced-based guidelines on the use of POC lung ultrasound were published. Lung ultrasound has shown its superiority over conventional chest radiography in the diagnosis of many disorders of significant importance in anesthesiology, particularly the pneumothorax. SUMMARY POC thoracic and lung ultrasound is used in many critical medicine fields.

Risks from this treatment approach include major ischemic complications. To date, there have been only a few reports of soft tissue necrosis following endovascular embolization for severe epistaxis; none involve the use of Onyx-18. CASE DESCRIPTION We report the case of a 52-year-old woman who presented with epistaxis that was refractory to medical and surgical management, which lead to endovascular intervention and embolization with Onyx-18. The patient subsequently developed nasal ala and facial necrosis as a result of the procedure. CONCLUSION We report the use of Onyx-18 for the endovascular embolization of a patient with severe epistaxis and subsequent complications. In cases of severe epistaxis that warrant intervention in the form of embolization, ischemic complications are rare; however, ischemic complications may be unavoidable and should factor into the discussion regarding procedural risks.","Grandhi, Ramesh; Panczykowski, David; Zwagerman, Nathan T; Gehris, Robin; Villasenor-Park, Jennifer; Ho, Jonhan; Grandinetti, Lisa; Horowitz, Michael",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.115388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23956938/,667

Molecular imaging of HER2 expression may provide essential prognostic and predictive information concerning disseminated cancer and aid in selection of an optimal therapy. Radiolabeled low molecular weight peptide ligands are particularly attractive as probes for molecular imaging, since they reach and bind to the target and clear from non-target organs and blood stream faster than bulky antibodies. In this study, we evaluated a potential HER2-imaging probe, an A9 nonapeptide, derived from the trastuzumab-Fab portion. Its cellular uptake was investigated by mass spectrometry analysis of the cytoplasmic cellular extracts. Moreover, based on in-silico modeling, DTPA chelator was conjugated to N-terminus of A9. 111In-labeled A9 demonstrated nanomolar affinity to HER2-expressing BT474 cells and favorable biodistribution profile in NMRI mice. This study suggests that the peptide A9 represents a good lead candidate for development of molecular probe, to be used for imaging purposes and for the delivery of cytotoxic agents.","Honarvar, Hadis; Calce, Enrica; Doti, Nunzianna; Langella, Emma; Orlova, Anna; Buijs, Jos; D'Amato, Valentina; Bianco, Roberto; Saviano, Michele; Tolmachev, Vladimir; De Luca, Stefania",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21283-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29445216/,667

67270,Identification of candidate protein markers of Bovine Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 infection using an in vitro model.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Nasal packing is the mainstay of epistaxis management; however, packs cause patient discomfort and can lead to hospital admission. Absorbable haemostats provide clotting factors or act as a substrate to stimulate clotting and represent a potential treatment alternative. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy of topical haemostats in the management of epistaxis. METHODS A systematic literature search of 7 databases was performed. Only eligible randomised controlled-trials (RCTs) and observational studies were included. The primary outcome was short-term haemostatic success (<7 days). Secondary outcomes included long-term haemostatic control (no re-bleeding 7-30 days), patient discomfort and adverse effects. Meta-analysis was performed where possible. RESULTS Of 2,249 records identified, 12 were included in the qualitative synthesis and 4 RCTs were included in meta-analysis. The following haemostats were reported: gelatin-thrombin matrix (n=8), aerosolised/gel tranexamic acid (n=1), cellulose agents (n=2), and fibrin sealants (n=1). Studies involving tranexamic acid on removable delivery devices (e.g. pledgets) were excluded. There was heterogeneity in outcome measures and inclusion criteria (coagulopathies/anticoagulants were excluded in 3 RCTs and 2 observational studies). The short-term haemostatic success varied between studies (13.9% to 100%). No significant post-procedural complications were reported. The meta-analysis favoured absorbable haemostatic agent versus packing (risk ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.37; p=0.007). The risk of bias across all studies was moderate to high. CONCLUSIONS The evidence suggests haemostatic agents are effective at managing acute epistaxis when compared with nasal packing.

DESIGN Population-based surveillance study July 2017 to June 2019. Cases were identified by paediatricians and hospital pharmacists using monthly electronic Welsh Paediatric Surveillance Unit (WPSU) reporting system. PATIENTS 'Definite' incident occurred when children received all or any of the incorrect dose of medication. 'Near miss' was where the prescribed, prepared or dispensed medication was not administered to the child. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incidence, patient characteristics, setting, drug characteristics, outcome, harm and enabling or preventive factors. RESULTS In total, 50 10-fold errors were reported; 20 definite and 30 near miss cases. This yields a minimum annual incidence of 1 per 3797 admissions, or 4.6/100 000 children. Of these, 43 were overdoses and 7 underdoses. 33 incidents occurred in children <5 years of age. Overall, 37 different medications were involved with the majority, 31 cases, being administered enterally. Of these 31 enteral medication errors, all definite cases (10) had received liquid preparations. Temporary harm occurred in 5/20 (25%) definite cases with one requiring intensive care; all fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS In this first ever population surveillance study in a high-resource healthcare system, 10-fold errors in children were rare, sometimes prevented and uncommonly caused harm. We recommend country-wide improvements be made to reduce iatrogenic harm. Understanding the enabling and preventive factors may help national improvement strategies to reduce these errors.","Tse, Yincent; Tuthill, David",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-319130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109522/,667

67699,The learning curve of single-port laparoscopic appendectomy performed by emergent operation.,2016,"BACKGROUND The use of autologous adipose tissue harvested through liposuction techniques for soft-tissue augmentation has become commonplace among cosmetic and reconstructive surgeons alike. Despite its longstanding use in the plastic surgery community, substantial controversy remains regarding the optimal method of processing harvested lipoaspirate before grafting. This evidence-based review builds on prior examinations of the literature to evaluate both established and novel methods for lipoaspirate processing. METHODS A comprehensive, systematic review of the literature was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE in January of 2015 to identify all relevant publications subsequent to the most recent review on this topic. Randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and comparative studies comparing at least two of the following techniques were included: decanting, cotton gauze (Telfa) rolling, centrifugation, washing, filtration, and stromal vascular fraction isolation. RESULTS Nine articles comparing various methods of processing human fat for autologous grafting were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five compared established processing techniques (i.e., decanting, cotton gauze rolling, centrifugation, and washing) and four publications evaluated newer proprietary technologies, including washing, filtration, and/or methods to isolate stromal vascular fraction. CONCLUSIONS The authors failed to find compelling evidence to advocate a single technique as the superior method for processing lipoaspirate in preparation for autologous fat grafting. A paucity of high-quality data continues to limit the clinician's ability to determine the optimal method for purifying harvested adipose tissue. Novel automated technologies hold promise, particularly for large-volume fat grafting; however, extensive additional research is required to understand their true utility and efficiency in clinical settings.","Cleveland, Emily C; Albano, Nicholas J; Hazen, Alexes",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000001581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26397249/,667

68016,Changes in Smoking Behavior Before and After Gastric Bypass: A 7-year Study.,2020-02-20,"MOTIVATION Ordinal classification problems arise in a variety of real-world applications, in which samples need to be classified into categories with a natural ordering. An example of classifying high-dimensional ordinal data is to use gene expressions to predict the ordinal drug response, which has been increasingly studied in pharmacogenetics. Classical ordinal classification methods are typically not able to tackle high-dimensional data and standard high-dimensional classification methods discard the ordering information among the classes. Existing work of high-dimensional ordinal classification approaches usually assume a linear ordinality among the classes. We argue that manually-labeled ordinal classes may not be linearly arranged in the data space, especially in high-dimensional complex problems. RESULTS We propose a new approach that can project high-dimensional data into a lower discriminating subspace, where the innate ordinal structure of the classes is uncovered. The proposed method weights the features based on their rank correlations with the class labels and incorporates the weights into the framework of linear discriminant analysis. We apply the method to predict the response to two types of drugs for patients with Multiple Myeloma, respectively. A comparative analysis with both ordinal and nominal existing methods demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a competitive predictive performance while honoring the intrinsic ordinal structure of the classes. We provide interpretations on the genes that are selected by the proposed approach to understand their drug-specific response mechanisms.

OBJECTIVE To explore patient and caregiver understanding and valuation of ""continuity of care"" while transitioning from an in-hospital to a home-based palliative care team. METHODS Longitudinal qualitative design using semi-structured interviews conducted with patients and their caregivers before and after transitioning from hospital to palliative care at home. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis within a post-positivist framework. Thirty-nine participants (18 patients, 7 caregivers and 7 patient-caregiver dyads) were recruited from two acute care hospitals wherein they received care from an inpatient palliative care consultation team and transitioned to home-based palliative care. RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 68, 60% were female and 60% had a diagnosis of cancer. Caregivers had a mean age of 62 and 50% were female. Participants perceived continuity of care to occur in three ways, depending on which stage they were at in their hospital-to-home transition. In hospital, continuity of care was experienced as consistency of information exchanged between providers. During the transition from hospital to home, continuity of care was experienced as consistency of treatments. When receiving home-based palliative care, continuity of care was experienced as having consistent providers. CONCLUSION Patients' and their caregivers' valuation of continuity of care was dependent on their stage of the hospital-to-home transition.

Here we characterize the lesions of infectious bronchitis (IB), IBV prevalence and identify the circulating strains in small flocks in California. Backyard chickens (BYCs) submitted to the Davis (Northern California; NorCal) and San Bernardino (Southern California; SoCal) branches of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System from January through March 2019 were included in the study. Trachea, kidney, and cecal tonsils were collected for qRT-PCR, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequence analysis. A total of 50 chickens out of 169 submissions tested positive for IBV by qRT-PCR. Of these, 16% (20/123) were from NorCal and 65% (30/46) from SoCal laboratory. The cecal tonsil was the most frequently positive tissue by qRT-PCR and IHC. Lymphoplasmacytic tracheitis was the most frequent histopathologic finding in 24 of 39 birds while the kidney showed interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, tubular dilation and/or gout in 14 of 43 chickens. Infectious bronchitis virus played a primary role or a synergistic effect in the mortality of chickens succumbed by other infectious diseases. The sequences of IBV detected in 22 birds were analyzed and 14 strains were most similar to CA1737. One strain each matched Conn46, Cal99, and ArkDPI, and the remaining five did not have a substantial match to any available reference strains. The findings in this study indicate that small flocks can be reservoirs of IBV and might facilitate evolution of new variants as well as reversion of attenuated strains to virulence.","Gonzales Viera, Omar Antonio; Crossley, Beate; Carvallo-Chaigneau, Francisco; Blair, Emily; Rejmanek, Daniel; Erdoǧan-Bamac, Őzge; Sverlow, Karen; Figueroa, Alejandra; Gallardo, Rodrigo A; Mete, Aslı",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/aviandiseases-d-20-00113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400768/,667
68342,Diabetes mellitus and colorectal carcinoma outcomes: a meta-analysis.,2020-06-20,"To manage complex aortic arch disease using minimally invasive techniques, interventionalists have reported the use of multiple stent-graft devices deployed in a parallel configuration. The structural device-device and device-artery interactions arising during aortic arch parallel endografting, also known as chimney thoracic endovascular aortic repair (ch-TEVAR), is not well understood. Through the use of a radial force testing system we sought to characterise both the loading and deformation behaviour of parallel endografts in representative ch-TEVAR configurations. Four commercially available devices (Bentley BeGraft, Gore TAG, Gore Viabahn, and Medtronic Valiant) were subjected to uniform radial load individually, and in six combinations, to quantify loading profiles. Image data collected during testing were analysed to evaluate mechanical deformations in terms of gutters, chimney and main endograft compression, as well as graft infolding. Parallel endografting was found to increase radial loads when compared to standard TEVAR. Chronic outward force during ch-TEVAR was dependent on main endograft manufacturer, with TAG combinations leading to consistently higher loads than Valiant, but independent of chimney graft type. Endograft deformations were dependent on chimney graft type, with Viabahn combinations presenting with lower gutter areas and increased lumen compression than BeGraft. Chimney graft deformations were also influenced by deployment arrangement in the case of double ch-TEVAR. This study emphasizes the significant variability in both radial loads and mechanical deformations between clinically relevant ch-TEVAR configurations.","Kwiecinski, Jakub; Cheng, Christopher P; Uberoi, Raman; Hadi, Mohammed; Hempel, Philipp; Degel, Christoph; You, Zhong",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740690/,667

Supplementation is debatable, but some individuals, e.g., pre-diabetic, low-grade inflammation, cardiometabolic yet otherwise healthy subjects, might benefit from supra-physiological omega-3 intake, particularly to lessen inflammation. We explored the feasibility of a large clinical trial by performing a pilot study to evaluate adherence, palatability, and self-reported side effects of ALA administration in a group of volunteers. We enrolled 12 individuals with borderline dyslipidemia or overweight, treated with dietary advice according to international guidelines and who had insufficient intakes of essential fatty acids. Subjects were followed for nutritional counselling and were matched with appropriate controls. Patients were administered 6 g/day of ALA, for two months.

METHODS Twenty-eight participants were exposed to monodispersed live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) particles (4.9 μm) in 6 groups: group 1, no precautions; group 2, ocular exposure only; group 3, surgical mask without eye protection; group 4, surgical mask with eye protection; group 5, fit-tested N95 respirator without eye protection; and group 6, fit-tested N95 respirator with eye protection. Influenza was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and culture in nasal washes. Exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS Influenza was detected in 4 of 4 participants in group 1 (95% CI, 0-.60), 3 of 4 in group 2 (95% CI, .006-.806]), 5 of 5 in group 3 (95% CI, 0-.522), 5 of 5 in group 4, (95% CI, 0-.522), 3 of 5 in group 5 (95% CI, .053-.853), and 1 of 5 in group 6 (95% CI, .05-.72).

Swab sample collection and recovery are vital for reducing false negative diagnostic tests, early detection of pathogens, and harvesting DNA from limited biological samples. In this study, we report a new class of nanofiber swabs tipped with hierarchical 3D nanofiber objects produced by expanding electrospun membranes with a solids-of-revolution-inspired gas foaming technique. Nanofiber swabs significantly improve absorption and release of proteins, cells, bacteria, DNA, and viruses from solutions and surfaces. Implementation of nanofiber swabs in SARS-CoV-2 detection reduces the false negative rates at two viral concentrations and identifies SARS-CoV-2 at a 10× lower viral concentration compared to flocked and cotton swabs. The nanofiber swabs show great promise in improving test sensitivity, potentially leading to timely and accurate diagnosis of many diseases.","McCarthy, Alec; Saldana, Lorenzo; Ackerman, Daniel N; Su, Yajuan; John, Johnson V; Chen, Shixuan; Weihs, Shelbie; Reid, St Patrick; Santarpia, Joshua L; Carlson, Mark A; Xie, Jingwei",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c04956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501831/,667

To encourage healthy eating and behaviour change, innovative public health interventions are required. Social marketing, in particular segmentation, can be used to understand and target specific population groups. However, segmentation often uses demographic factors, ignoring the reasons behind why people behave the way they do. This review aims to explore the food and nutrition related research that has utilised psycho-behavioural segmentation. Six databases from were searched in June 2020. Inclusion criteria were: published 2010 onwards, segmentation by psycho-behavioural variables, outcome related to food or nutrition, and healthy adult population over 18 years. 30 studies were included; most were quantitative (n = 28) and all studies used post-hoc segmentation methods, with the tools used to segment the population varying. None of the segments generated were targeted in future research. Psycho-behavioural factors are key in understanding people's behaviour. However, when used in post-hoc segmentation, do not allow for effective targeting as there is no prior understanding of behaviours that need to change within each segment. In future, we should move towards hybrid segmentation to assist with the design of interventions that target behaviours such as healthy eating.","Jenkins, Eva L; Legrand, Samara; Brennan, Linda; Molenaar, Annika; Reid, Mike; McCaffrey, Tracy A",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070404/,667

The guidelines contained a set of audit criteria. OBJECTIVE To evaluate current HS management against the audit standards in the BAD guidelines. METHODS BAD members were invited to complete audit questionnaires between January and May 2020 for five consecutive HS patients per department. RESULTS Eighty-eight centres participated, providing data for 406 patients. Disease staging using the Hurley system and disease severity using a validated tool during follow-ups were documented in 75% and 56%. Quality of life (QoL) and pain were documented in 49% and 50%. Screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors was as follows: smoking 75%, body mass index (BMI) 27% and others such as lipids and diabetes 57%. Screening for depression and anxiety was performed in 40% and 25%. Support for smokers or obese patients was documented in 35% and 23%. One hundred eighty-two patients were on adalimumab, of whom 68% had documentation of baseline disease severity, and 76% documented inadequate response or contraindications to systemic treatments. Forty-four percent of patients continued on adalimumab despite having less than 25% improvement in lesion count. CONCLUSION UK dermatologists performed well against several audit standards, including documenting disease staging at baseline and smoking status. However, improvements are needed, particularly with regard to screening and management of comorbidities that could reduce the long-term complications associated with HS. A re-audit is required to evaluate changes in practice in the future.","Hasan, S B; Smith, S P; Brain, A; Mohd Mustapa, M F; Cheung, S T; Ingram, J R; de Berker, D A R",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577133/,667

OBJECTIVE To investigates the technical feasibility and safety of thrombectomy for secondary posterior circulation distal, medium vessel occlusions (DMVO). METHODS TOPMOST (Treatment fOr Primary Medium vessel Occlusion STroke) is an international, retrospective, multicenter, observational registry of patients treated for distal cerebral artery occlusions. This study subanalysis endovascularly treated occlusions of the posterior cerebral artery in the P2 and P3 segment secondary preprocedural or periprocedural thrombus migration between January 2014 and June 2020. Technical feasibility was evaluated with the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale. Procedural safety was assessed by the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and intervention-related serious adverse events. RESULTS Among 71 patients with secondary posterior circulation DMVO who met the inclusion criteria, occlusions were present in 80.3% (57/71) located in the P2 segment and in 19.7% (14/71) in the P3 segment. Periprocedural migration occurred in 54.9% (39/71) and preprocedural migration in 45.1% (32/71) of cases. The first reperfusion attempt led in 38% (27/71) of all cases to mTICI 3. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased numbers of reperfusion attempts (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.39, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.88, p=0.009) and preprocedural migration (aOR=4.70, 95% CI,1.35 to 16.35, p=0.015) were significantly associated with mTICI 3. sICH occurred in 2.8% (2/71). CONCLUSION Thrombectomy for secondary posterior circulation DMVO seems to be safe and technically feasible. Even though thrombi that have migrated preprocedurally may be easier to retract, successful reperfusion can be achieved in the majority of patients with secondary DMVO of the P2 and P3 segment.","Meyer, Lukas; Stracke, Christian Paul; Wallocha, Marta; Broocks, Gabriel; Sporns, Peter B; Piechowiak, Eike I; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Maegerlein, Christian; Dorn, Franziska; Zimmermann, Hanna; Naziri, Weis; Abdullayev, Nuran; Kabbasch, Christoph; Behme, Daniel; Jamous, Ala; Maus, Volker; Fischer, Sebastian; Möhlenbruch, Markus; Weyland, Charlotte Sabine; Langner, Soenke; Meila, Dan; Miszczuk, Milena; Siebert, Eberhard; Lowens, Stephan; Krause, Lars Udo; Yeo, Leonard Ll; Tan, Benjamin Yq; Gopinathan, Anil; Gory, Benjamin; Arenillas, Juan F; Navia, Pedro; Raz, Eytan; Shapiro, Maksim; Arnberg, Fabian; Zeleňák, Kamil; Martínez-Galdámez, Mario; Kastrup, Andreas; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Kemmling, Andre; Psychogios, Marios N; Andersson, Tommy; Chapot, René; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272260/,667

All efforts to contain the pathogenesis either using inhibitory drugs or vaccines largelyremained futile due to a lack of better understanding of the genomic feature of this virus. In thepresent study, we compared the 2019-nCoV with other coronaviruses, which indicated that batSARS like coronavirus could be a probable ancestor of the novel coronavirus. The proteinsequence similarity of pangolin-hCoV and bat-hCoV with human coronavirus was higher ascompared to their nucleotide similarity denoting the occurrence of more synonymous mutationsin the genome. Phylogenetic and alignment analysis of 591 novel coronaviruses of differentclades from Group I to Group V revealed several mutations and concomitant amino acidchanges. Detailed investigation on nucleotide substitution unfolded 100 substitutions in thecoding region of which 43 were synonymous and 57 were of non-synonymous type. The nonsynonymous substitutions resulting into 57 amino acid changes were found to be distributed overdifferent hCoV proteins with maximum on spike protein. An important di-amino acid change RGto KR was observed in ORF9 protein. Additionally, several interesting features of the novelcoronavirus genome have been highlighted in respect to various other human infecting viruseswhich may explain extreme pathogenicity, infectivity and simultaneously the reason behindfailure of the antiviral therapies. SUMMARY: This study presents a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 isolates to understand discrete mutations that are occurring between patient samples. The analysis unravel various amino acid mutations in the viral proteins which may provide an explanation for varying treatment efficacies of different inhibitory drugs and a future direction towards a combinatorial treatment therapies based on the kind of mutation in the viral genome.","Tiwari, Manish; Mishra, Divya",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32442759/,667
68886,Barbed Suture versus Conventional Suture for Vaginal Cuff Closure in Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,2018,"AIMS To develop a clinical model of perennial ryegrass toxicosis (PRGT) based on feeding a known dose of lolitrem B and ergotamine, and to produce a consistent clinical presentation for assessment of disease pathophysiology, neurological changes and neurohistopathology. METHODS Male lambs, aged between 10-12 months, were randomly assigned to either Treatment (n=9) or Control (n=9) groups. Lambs in the Treatment group received feed containing a novel endophyte-infested perennial ryegrass seed, commencing on Day 0 of the Feeding phase with a low induction dose, then increasing after 3 days to provide 0.16 mg/kg live bodywight (LBW)/day of lolitrem B and 0.054 mg/kg LBW/day ergotamine. Lambs were examined daily and when defined signs of PRGT were observed they were transferred to the Testing phase. Neurological examinations, assessment of gait, surface electromyography (EMG) and mechanosensory nociceptive threshold testing were carried out and blood samples collected during both phases of the trial, with a full necropsy, histopathological examination and measurement of faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) performed on Day 2 of the Testing phase. RESULTS Typical clinical signs of PRGT, including ataxia of vestibulocerebellar origin leading to stumbling, were observed in all Treatment lambs. The median interval from the start of the Feeding phase to entry into the Testing phase was 21 (min 18, max 34) days. Histopathological characterisation of neurological lesions included the presence of Purkinje cell vacuolation, pyknotic granular layer neurons and proximal axonal Purkinje cell spheroids. Lesions were most apparent within the vestibulocerebellum. Mean root-mean-square voltages from triceps EMG increased in Treatment lambs between Feeding phase Day 0 and Testing phase Day 2 (p<0.001). Daily water intake during the Testing phase for the Treatment group was less than in Control group lambs (p=0.002), and concentrations of FCM at necropsy were higher in Treatment compared to Control lambs (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Lolitrem B and ergotamine dosing in feed on a live weight basis combined with neurological/gait assessment provides an effective model for investigation of PRGT and potential therapeutics. Assessment of gait changes using defined criteria and RMS voltages from EMG appear to be useful tools for the assessment of the severity of neurological changes.","Combs, M D; Edwards, S H; Scherpenhuizen, J M; Narayan, E J; Kessell, A E; Piltz, J; Raidal, S R; Ramsay, J; Quinn, J C",New Zealand veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2018.1492986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29949720/,667

This study evaluated performance of the Alfred 60 system combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) technology for rapid identification of uropathogens. The Alfred 60 system was used to screen urine cultures, followed by identifying the microbial pathogen in positive cultures using MALDI-TOF MS. The Alfred 60 detected positive cultures by measuring the turbidity of urine samples, which were transferred automatically to vials containing liquid medium and incubated for 3.5 h at 35 °C in the Alfred 60 system. Vials that showed growth were removed and centrifuged. The pellet was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS identification. In parallel, positive urine samples were inoculated onto agar plates for identification by conventional culture. The time required to detect positive urine cultures with Alfred 60 and identify the uropathogens with MALDI-TOF MS ranged from 15 min to 3.5 h. Among 146 positive urine samples tested, conventional cultures showed three culture groups: group 1 included 101 samples with growth of a single type of microorganism; group 2 included 34 samples with 2 types of microorganisms; and group 3 included 11 samples with ≥ 3 types of microorganisms. Direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS was concordant with 95% of the samples in group 1, 100% of the principal microorganism in group 2, but could not identify microorganisms in group 3.

METHODS During June and July 2020, we conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with 22 hospice leaders from across the USA. The interviews focused on inclusive strategy approaches. We analysed the data using qualitative methods. RESULTS Multiple themes emerged about racial/ethnic minority inclusion strategies: (1) hospices tailor strategies to the local communities they serve; (2) improvement involves addressing social determinants of health that extend beyond end-of-life care; (3) costs of strategies are not a primary concern and the benefits are worth the costs; and (4) hospices want to do more to improve their efforts. CONCLUSIONS Hospices want to improve racial/ethnic minority inclusion and can take specific action steps to educate community members about hospice and provide an environment within hospice care that is welcoming to all.

In this paper, we carry out further experimentation using a novel experimental setup, in which a strobe light is used to emulate impulsive temporal sampling, in order to investigate the spatiotemporal envelope of the human visual system and the effect of a stimulus. For non-periodic stimuli, experimental results show that critical sampling rates increase with motion speed and decrease with stimulus width. These interactions can be described using simple log-linear models, and characterized using the temporal aliasing visibility function, where maximum critical frame rates up to 1500 Hz are predicted. For periodic stimuli, we demonstrate that both perceptible temporal aliasing artifacts and stimulus aliasing can cause stroboscopic effects.","Mackin, Alex; Bull, David","Journal of the Optical Society of America.

69461,Optical trocar access for initial trocar placement in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery: A propensity score-matching analysis.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Nonunion after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is associated with poor long-term outcomes in terms of health-related quality of life. Biomechanical factors in the fusion segment may influence spinal fusion rates. There are no reports on the relationship between intervertebral union and the absorption of autografts or vertebral endplates. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors of nonunion after PLIF and identify preventive measures. METHODS The authors analyzed 138 patients who underwent 1-level PLIF between 2016 and 2018 (75 males, 63 females; mean age 67 years; minimum follow-up period 12 months). Lumbar CT images obtained soon after the surgery and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were examined for the mean total occupancy rate of the autograft, presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate (more than 50% of vertebral diameter), cage subsidence, and screw loosening. Complete intervertebral union was defined as the presence of both upper and lower complete fusion in the center cage regions on coronal and sagittal CT slices at 12 months postoperatively. Patients were classified into either union or nonunion groups. RESULTS Complete union after PLIF was observed in 62 patients (45%), while nonunion was observed in 76 patients (55%). The mean total occupancy rate of the autograft immediately after the surgery was higher in the union group than in the nonunion group (59% vs 53%; p = 0.046). At 12 months postoperatively, the total occupancy rate of the autograft had decreased by 5.4% in the union group and by 11.9% in the nonunion group (p = 0.020). A translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery was observed in 14 and 38 patients (23% and 50%) in the union and nonunion groups, respectively (p = 0.001). The nonunion group had a significantly higher proportion of cases with cage subsidence and screw loosening at 12 months postoperatively in comparison to the union group (p = 0.010 and p = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A lower occupancy rate of the autograft and the presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery were associated with nonunion at 12 months after PLIF. It may be important to achieve sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate intraoperatively for osseous union enhancement and to avoid excessive absorption of the autograft. The achievement of complete intervertebral union may decrease the incidence of cage subsidence or screw loosening.","Ushirozako, Hiroki; Hasegawa, Tomohiko; Ebata, Shigeto; Ohba, Tetsuro; Oba, Hiroki; Mukaiyama, Keijiro; Shimizu, Satoshi; Yamato, Yu; Ide, Koichiro; Shibata, Yosuke; Ojima, Toshiyuki; Takahashi, Jun; Haro, Hirotaka; Matsuyama, Yukihiro",Journal of neurosurgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients provided informed consent for this prospective institutional review board-approved study. Eighty patients (30 men, 50 women; mean age, 59.7 years ± 6.4; range, 48-68 years) underwent computed tomography-guided percutaneous microwave ablation of pulmonary metastatic lesions in 130 sessions. The tumors represented metastases from colorectal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma; there was no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis for any tumor. Logistic regression analysis was used for evaluation of the statistical significance of factors affecting the end result of microwave ablation therapy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation of survival rates. RESULTS Complete, successful ablation was achieved in 95 (73.1%) of 130 lesions. Successful tumor ablation was significantly more frequent for lesions with a maximal axial diameter of 3 cm or smaller (90 of 110) than for lesions greater than 3 cm in maximal axial diameter (five of 20) (P < .0001) and for peripheral lesions (80 [80%] of 100) than for centrally located lesions (15 [50%] of 30) (P = .002). The histopathologic type of the metastasis did not significantly correlate with the ablation result (P > .3). The 12- and 24-month survival rates were 91.3% and 75%, respectively. There was no intraprocedural death, and the overall 60-day mortality rate after ablation was 0%. Higher survival rates were observed in patients with tumor-free states after successful ablation than in patients with failed ablation (P = .001). The incidence of pneumothorax was 8.5% (11 of 130). An intercostal chest tube was applied in one (0.8%) of the 11 sessions. Pulmonary hemorrhage developed in eight (6.2%) of 130 sessions. CONCLUSION Microwave ablation therapy may be safely and effectively used as a therapeutic tool for treatment of pulmonary metastases. The efficacy of the treatment is primarily determined by preablation tumor size and location in relation to the hilum.","Vogl, Thomas J; Naguib, Nagy N N; Gruber-Rouh, Tatjana; Koitka, Karen; Lehnert, Thomas; Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin A",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.11101643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22012906/,667

69903,Ambulatory bariatric surgery: does it really lead to higher rates of adverse events?,2020-07-05,"HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. The role of platelet mitochondrial dysfunction in thrombosis, immunoregulation and age-related diseases is increasingly appreciated. Here, we studied platelet mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNApl) and mitochondrial function in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and related this to platelet function. In a cohort of 208 treated PLHIV and 56 uninfected controls, mtDNApl was quantified, as well as platelet activation, platelet agonist-induced reactivity and inflammation by circulating factors and flow cytometry. In a subgroup of participants, the metabolic activity of platelets was further studied by mitochondrial function tests and the Seahorse Flux Analyzer. PLHIV had significantly lower mtDNApl compared to controls (8.5 copies/platelet (IQR: 7.0-10.7) vs. 12.2 copies/platelet (IQR: 9.5-16.6); p < 0.001), also after correction for age, sex and BMI. Prior zidovudine-use (n = 46) was associated with a trend for lower mtDNApl. PLHIV also had reduced ex vivo platelet reactivity and mean platelet volume compared to controls. MtDNApl correlated positively with both platelet parameters and correlated negatively with inflammatory marker sCD163. Mitochondrial function tests in a subgroup of participants confirmed the presence of platelet mitochondrial respiration defects. Platelet mitochondrial function is disturbed in PLHIV, which may contribute to platelet dysfunction and subsequent complications. Interventions targeting the preservation of normal platelet mitochondrial function may ultimately prove beneficial for PLHIV.","van der Heijden, Wouter A; van de Wijer, Lisa; Jaeger, Martin; Grintjes, Karin; Netea, Mihai G; Urbanus, Rolf T; van Crevel, Reinout; van den Heuvel, Lambertus P; Brink, Maaike; Rodenburg, Richard J; de Groot, Philip G; van der Ven, Andre J; de Mast, Quirijn",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85775-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739024/,667
69912,Fully laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis involving percutaneous endoluminal colonic anvil control (PECAC).,2010,"A substantial body of prior research documents a gender gap in negotiation performance. Competing accounts suggest that the gap is due either to women's stereotype-congruent behavior in negotiations or to backlash enacted toward women for stereotype-incongruent behavior. In this article, we use a novel data set of over 2,500 individual negotiators to examine how negotiation performance varies as a function of gender and the strength of one's alternative to a negotiated agreement. We find that the gender gap in negotiation outcomes exists only when female negotiators have a strong outside option. Furthermore, our large data set allows us to examine an understudied performance outcome, rate of impasse. We find that negotiations in which at least one negotiator is a woman with a strong alternative disproportionately end in impasse, a performance outcome that leaves considerable potential value unallocated. In addition, we find that these gender differences in negotiation performance are not due to gender differences in aspirations, reservation values, or first offers. Overall, these findings are consistent with a backlash account, whereby counterparts are less likely to come to an agreement and therefore reach a potentially worse outcome when one party is a female negotiator empowered by a strong alternative.

70067,Prosthetic Mesh for Obliteration of the Nephrosplenic Space in Horses: 26 Clinical Cases.,2016,"The unusual dilatation of dermal capillaries and angiogenesis played important roles in psoriasis. Some genes and proteins of dermal mesenchymal stem cells (DMSCs) from psoriasis are abnormal and related to the function of endothelial cells (ECs). The present study was aimed to evaluate whether psoriatic DMSCs could affect adhesion and migration of ECs through neovascularization-related integrins in psoriasis. Human DMSCs, collected from psoriasis lesions and healthy skin respectively, were co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression levels of three integrins, i.e., αvβ3, αvβ5 and α5β1 in HUVECs were tested by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot. The adhesion and migration of HUVECs were detected by adhesion assay and migration assay. The results showed that in psoriasis group, the expression of αVβ3 and α5β1 of HUVECs markedly increased 2.50-fold and 3.71-fold in mRNA levels, and significantly increased 1.63-fold and 1.92-fold in protein levels, comparing to healthy control group (all P<0.05). But β5 was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). In addition, compared with control, psoriatic DMSCs promoted HUVECs adhesion by 1.62-fold and migration by 2.91-fold (all P<0.05). In conclusion, psoriatic DMSCs impact HUVECs adhesion and migration by up-regulating the expression of integrins αVβ3, α5β1. This article is protected by copyright.

We argue that the changing geography of migration, the diversification of jobs taken by migrants, the rapid growth of tourism and business trips, and the longer distance taken by people for family reunion are what make the spread of COVID-19 so differently from that of SARS. These changes in population movement are expected to continue.

DATA SOURCES A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed in February 2018 using SCOPUS for the intersection of ""cochlear implant,"" ""prelingual,"" ""deaf,"" and ""delay."" REVIEW METHODS Two independent reviewers screened all abstracts and titles for relevance, with conflicts resolved by either the primary or senior author. All articles passing this screen were subjected to a full-text review, during which the primary and senior author each examined manuscripts for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess potential sources of systematic error, and postoperative clinical outcomes were collected at the latest clinical follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-eight articles were yielded in the final systematic review, accounting for 542 patients. For open-set sentence scores, 10 studies representing 240 patients showed an overall estimated improvement of 44.6% (95% CI: 38.0-51.2%). In terms of quality of life, studies generally showed improvement when looking at specific emotional, social, or hearing-specific domains, but not in global measures. Nonuser rates ranged from 0 to 9.5%.

70508,New Laparoscopic Technique of Hysteropexy for Uterine Retrodisplacement: Bologna Technique.,2016,"BACKGROUND Expansion of the endovascular and surgical workforce in the USA might lead to carotid revascularization procedures being carried out at low volume centers. OBJECTIVE To evaluate trends in the treatment of carotid stenosis at high volume centers in the USA and compare outcomes by hospital volume. METHODS Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we evaluated trends in the proportion of carotid revascularization procedures performed at high volume centers in the USA from 2005 to 2011. High volume was defined as combined endarterectomy/stenting volume ≥ 130 patients/year, carotid endarterectomy volume ≥ 117 cases/year and carotid stenting volume ≥ 38 cases/year. In-hospital mortality, discharge to a long-term facility, intracranial hemorrhage, and postoperative stroke rates were compared between high and low volume centers. RESULTS A total of 181,972 patients were included in this study. Overall, 63,442 patients (34.9%) were treated at high volume centers. The proportion of patients treated at high volume carotid revascularization centers decreased from 38.3% in 2005-2006 to 30.2% in 2010-2011. The proportion of patients treated at high volume centers decreased from 35.7% to 30.0% for carotid endarterectomy (p<0.0001) and 45.2% to 35.1% for carotid stenting. Patients treated at low volume centers had significantly higher rates of discharge to a long-term facility than high volume center patients (6.3% vs 5.0%, p<0.0001). The same was true for endarterectomy patients (6.0% vs 4.7%, p<0.0001) and stenting patients (8.3% vs 6.5%, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS A trend toward a lower proportion of patients with carotid stenosis being treated in high volume centers from 2005 to 2011 is concerning as these high volume centers had lower complication rates.","Brinjikji, Waleed; Kallmes, David F; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Cloft, Harry J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714610/,667
70542,Robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical nephrectomy: surgical technique and comparative outcomes.,2011,"BACKGROUND Problems arising from medicines usage are recognised as a key patient safety issue. Children are a particular concern, given that they are more likely than adults to experience medication-related harm. While previous reviews have provided an estimate of prevalence in this population, these predate recent developments in the delivery of paediatric care. Hence, there is a need for an updated, focussed and critical review of the prevalence and nature of drug-related problems in hospitalised children in the UK, in order to support the development and targeting of interventions to improve medication safety. METHODS Nine electronic databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, IPA, Scopus, HMIC, BNI, The Cochrane library and clinical trial databases) were searched from January 1999 to April 2019. Studies were included if they were based in the UK, reported on the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), adverse drug events (ADEs) or medication errors (MEs) affecting hospitalised children. Quality appraisal of the studies was also conducted. RESULTS In all, 26 studies were included. There were no studies which specifically reported prevalence of adverse drug events. Two adverse drug reaction studies reported a median prevalence of 25.6% of patients (IQR 21.8-29.9); 79.2% of reactions warranted withdrawal of medication. Sixteen studies reported on prescribing errors (median prevalence 6.5%; IQR 4.7-13.3); of which, the median rate of dose prescribing errors was 11.1% (IQR 2.9-13). Ten studies reported on administration errors with a median prevalence of 16.3% (IQR 6.4-23). Administration technique errors represented 53% (IQR 52.7-67.4) of these errors. Errors detected during medicines reconciliation at hospital admission affected 43% of patients, 23% (Range 20.1-46) of prescribed medication; 70.3% (Range 50-78) were classified as potentially harmful. Medication errors detected during reconciliation on discharge from hospital affected 33% of patients and 19.7% of medicines, with 22% considered potentially harmful. No studies examined the prevalence of monitoring or dispensing errors. CONCLUSIONS Children are commonly affected by drug-related problems throughout their hospital journey. Given the high prevalence and risk of patient harm,, there is a need for a deeper theoretical understanding of paediatric medication systems to enable more effective interventions to be developed to improve patient safety.","Sutherland, Adam; Phipps, Denham L; Tomlin, Stephen; Ashcroft, Darren M",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1875-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31829142/,667
70585,Single-Port Laparoscopic Surgery Is Feasible and Safe for Hepatic Left Lateral Sectionectomy for Benign Liver Lesions.,2019,"This paper introduces a new hybrid approach (DBH) for solving gene selection problem that incorporates the strengths of two existing metaheuristics: binary dragonfly algorithm (BDF) and binary black hole algorithm (BBHA). This hybridization aims to identify a limited and stable set of discriminative genes without sacrificing classification accuracy, whereas most current methods have encountered challenges in extracting disease-related information from a vast amount of redundant genes. The proposed approach first applies the minimum redundancy maximum relevancy (MRMR) filter method to reduce the dimensionality of feature space and then utilizes the suggested hybrid DBH algorithm to determine a smaller set of significant genes. The proposed approach was evaluated on eight benchmark gene expression datasets, and then, was compared against the latest state-of-art techniques to demonstrate algorithm efficiency. The comparative study shows that the proposed approach achieves a significant improvement as compared with existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes. Moreover, the performance of the suggested method was examined on real RNA-Seq coronavirus-related gene expression data of asthmatic patients for selecting the most significant genes in order to improve the discriminative accuracy of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2, as a coronavirus receptor, is a biomarker that helps to classify infected patients from uninfected in order to identify subgroups at risk for COVID-19. The result denotes that the suggested MRMR-DBH approach represents a very promising framework for finding a new combination of most discriminative genes with high classification accuracy.","Pashaei, Elnaz; Pashaei, Elham",Analytical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.114242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974890/,667

To optimize both recurrence and complication rates, we developed a novel procedure that uses transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) to perform a sigmoidopexy via a perineal approach. METHODS We created a rectal prolapse model in six swine and two human cadavers using a previously published technique. The rectum was mobilized and eviscerated transanally. After marking the planned point of sigmoid transection, the rectum was returned to the peritoneal cavity. A TEM proctoscope was inserted transanally alongside the rectum, and the lateral sigmoid colon walls were sutured to the sacrum. The sigmoid colon was then transected where previously planned, and a primary sigmoid anastomosis was performed. Total operative time, sigmoidopexy operative time, and suture security were measured and compared to standard rectosigmoidectomy and abdominal sigmoidopexy times. RESULTS No sigmoid colon, iliac vessel, bladder, or ureteral injuries occurred. At least two sigmoidopexy sutures were secure on inspection in all animals and human cadavers, with increasing success of secure suture placement as experience increased. Operative length was similar to traditional abdominal sigmoidopexy. CONCLUSIONS TEM sigmoidopexy is technically feasible. This approach has the potential to reduce the recurrence rate associated with perineal approaches alone, but further study is needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Bordeianou, Liliana; Sylla, Patricia; Kinnier, Christine V; Rattner, David",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3722-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060682/,667

Screening the presence of human bocavirus infection among in-patients children suffering from lower respiratory tract infections was another aim of the current study. Nasopharyngeal swab samples from in-patients children suffering from lower respiratory tract infections were examined. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for the initial screening as a highly sensitive method to detect the HBoV. Genotyping of real-time positive samples was attempted by direct sequencing of PCR amplicons using NP, VP1/2 and the newly developed VP/NC primers. HBoV-1 was present in 56.8% of the examined children. The newly developed primer set successfully amplified all real-time PCR positive samples, however, the other primer pairs did not reliably detect real-time PCR positive samples. The gene sequences of the detected HBoV-1 showed conserved sequences to each other with a low rate of discrepancies.

However, expertise, supplies, and personnel to accomplish this task can be delayed or even absent in austere environments. An alternative approach that can ""buy time"" and improve circulation when i.v. fluids are absent is needed. Preclinical studies show that intrathoracic pressure regulation (ITPR) can increase perfusion in hypovolemia in the absence of i.v. fluid. We compared ITPR with placebo in humans undergoing a 15% hemorrhage under general anesthesia. Paired healthy volunteers (n = 7, aged 21 - 35 years) received either ITPR or placebo on different study days. Institutional review board informed consent was obtained. Subjects were anesthetized using propofol, intubated, and mechanically ventilated and hemorrhaged (10 mL/kg). Twenty minutes after hemorrhage, ITPR (-12 cm H2O vacuum) or placebo (device but no vacuum) was administered for another 60 min. Intravenous fluid was administered when systolic blood pressure was less than 85 mmHg. Hemodynamics, cardiac function by echocardiography, and volumetric data were compared. Data were expressed in Δmean ± SEM before and after ITPR/placebo intervention. There were no differences in mean arterial pressure (ITPR, 2.1 ± 3 mmHg; placebo, -0.7 ± 3 mmHg) or fluid infused (ITPR, 17.4 ± 4 mL/kg; placebo, 18.6 ± 5 mL/kg). Urinary output and plasma volume also were not significantly different. Intrathoracic pressure regulation augmented stroke volume (ITPR, 22 ± 5 mL, placebo, 6 ± 4 mL; P < 0.05), ejection fraction (ITPR, 4% ± 1%; placebo, 0% ± 1%), and diastolic function (ΔE/e') (ITPR, -0.8 ± 0.4 vs. placebo, +0.81 ± 0.6; P < 0.05). Intrathoracic pressure regulation did not improve mean arterial pressure in healthy volunteers aged 21 to 35 years. However, ITPR augmented stroke volume, which could be caused by improved ventricular function.","Patel, Neil; Branson, Rich; Salter, Michael; Henkel, Sheryl; Seeton, Roger; Khan, Muzna; Solanki, Daneshvari; Koutrouvelis, Aristides; Li, Husong; Indrikovs, Alex; Kinsky, Michael P",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25692251/,667

In addition, visibility may be impaired by lens fogging and smoke accumulation in the abdomen produced by electrocautery or ultrasonic devices. METHODS In 12 patients undergoing single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a peripheral venous catheter (PVC) was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct vision, and a three-way stopcock was screwed onto the catheter to allow controlled smoke evacuation. Cholangiography was attempted in all cases, four times by introducing a (CH5) feeding tube via PVC. RESULTS The described technique allowed controlled smoke evacuation via the PVC during SILS while reducing lens fogging and contamination by a constant air flow toward the venous catheter. Cholangiography was possible using a conventional cholangiography forceps (in 7 of 12 cases) or a feeding tube introduced via PVC (in 4 of 12 cases). Once, bleeding from an adjuvant vessel after incision of the cystic duct had to be controlled with clips, and no cholangiogram was achieved (in 1 of 12 cases). No procedure-related complications were observed. There was no conversion to conventional laparoscopic or open surgery. No visible scar was seen at the site of PVC introduction 5 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Visibility can be improved in SILS using a PVC without leaving apparent scars. Cholangiography via PVC is technically feasible and allows complete assessment of the biliary tract.","Dauser, Bernhard; Winkler, Thomas; Stelzhammer, Rudolf; Herbst, Friedrich",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1525-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21184103/,667

Moreover, in silico sequence analysis of azurin gene using globally reported sequences was intended. Materials and Methods Fifty-nine multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were selected from different clinical specimens of patients suffering from burn wound infections in two university hospitals and subjected to antibacterial susceptibility testing. The frequency and genetic diversity of the azurin gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The azurin gene sequences were compared with the sequence data from other countries. The expression level of azurin gene in P. aeruginosa isolates with different azurin sequences from different clinical specimens was evaluated by real-time PCR. Results and Conclusion About 98%-100% of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and imipenem, while 100% and 23.9% of the isolates were susceptible to colistin and ceftazidime, respectively. Only eight point mutations were detected with amino acid substitutions in only two positions (81 and 102). In global analysis, 93% of strains showed missense mutation at positions 81 (alanine to threonine). The majority (81%) of Iranian strains were allocated to two major clusters distinct from the rest of world, which may suggest that strains from Iran have made a distinct genetic stockpile through point mutations which has established them separate from the other counties. However, 19% were distributed in different clusters together with the strains from different countries of North and South America, Europe, South and East Asia. The expression level of the azurin gene was statistically higher in the isolates collected from the blood of burns patients with systemic infection compared to the isolates collected from other specimens (wound, catheter and tissue), which shows a positive correlation between azurin gene expression and increased pathogenicity and capability for dissemination. This study may open new insight about azurin genetic variation and significance in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.","Mohammadi Barzelighi, Hajar; Bakhshi, Bita; Daraei, Bahram; Fazeli, Hossein; Nasr Esfahani, Bahram",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s248043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765002/,667
72573,Increase of Clostridium perfringens in association with Eimeria in haemorrhagic enteritis in Japanese beef cattle.,2015,"BACKGROUND Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a frequent complication of tracheal intubation, particularly after surgery in the prone position. We designed this study to validate the non-inferiority of magnesium sulphate against dexamethasone for prevention of POST after lumbar spinal surgery. METHODS One hundred and forty-six patients were randomly allocated to receive either magnesium or dexamethasone. Before anesthetic induction, the magnesium group (n = 73) received magnesium sulphate 30 mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg/h by continuous infusion until the end of surgery. The dexamethasone group (n = 73) received dexamethasone 8 mg. The primary endpoint was the overall incidence of POST, which was assessed serially over 48 hr postoperatively. The predefined margin of non-inferiority for magnesium against dexamethasone was 15%. RESULTS Overall incidences of POST at rest (50.7% versus 49.3% in the magnesium and dexamethasone group, respectively, p = 0.869) and swallowing (65.8% versus 61.6% in the magnesium and dexamethasone group, respectively, p = 0.606) were not different between the groups. The upper limit of the 90% confidence interval, which must be lower than the predefined margin of non-inferiority to prove the non-inferiority of magnesium sulphate against dexamethasone, for at rest and swallowing were 14.97% (p = 0.0496) and 17.19% (p = 0.0854), respectively. The incidences and severities of POST and hoarseness were also not different between the groups throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic magnesium sulphate appears to be non-inferior to dexamethasone for the prevention of POST at rest in patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery in the prone position.","Park, Jin Ha; Shim, Jae-Kwang; Song, Jong-Wook; Jang, Jaewon; Kim, Ji Hoon; Kwak, Young-Lan",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.12831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26516308/,667

METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, to a large health network in New Jersey with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, rapid testing, or serum immunoglobulin G testing; we included demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes. RESULTS A total of 81 patients ≤21 years old were admitted with positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and/or serum immunoglobulin testing. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were admitted for management of acute COVID-19 infection, whereas 14 (17.3%) were admitted for management of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Of the 81 hospitalized patients, 28 (34.6%) required intensive care. A majority of patients (42 [51.9%]) admitted for both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C were Hispanic. Underlying chronic health conditions were not present in most patients. Obesity (mean BMI of 41.1) was noted in the patients with MIS-C requiring ICU care, although not statistically significant. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were statistically significant in the patients with MIS-C treated in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS This study adds to the growing literature of potential risk factors for severe disease in pediatric patients due to COVID-19 infection and MIS-C. Patients of Hispanic ethnicity represented the majority of patients with both acute COVID-19 infection and MIS-C, despite only representing 10% to 20% of the population our hospitals serve. Infants and patients with chronic health conditions were not at increased risk for severe disease. Absolute lymphopenia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers were associated with more severe disease.","Bhavsar, Sejal M; Clouser, Katharine N; Gadhavi, Jasmine; Anene, Okechukwu; Kaur, Ranbir; Lewis, Rachel; Naganathan, Srividya; Michalak, Zuzanna; Chen, Clara Q; Shah, Pooja; Siu, Anita; Ballance, Cathleen",Hospital pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/hpeds.2020-001719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386296/,667

This report describes how we successfully created and launched a for-fee systematic review core at our library. Case Presentation Throughout 2014 and 2015, library leadership proposed different models for getting institutional and financial support for librarians and staff to better support university researchers conducting systematic reviews. Though well received, initial requests for financial support were not funded. The executive director of the Health Sciences Library released two years' worth of salary and benefits to fund an evidence synthesis and retrieval librarian position. With this new position, the team formed a charge-back core facility in partnership with our university's Clinical Translation and Science Award hub. A series of procedural decisions and operational changes helped the group achieve success. Within eighteen months after launching the Systematic Review Core, we reached maximum capacity with more than twenty ongoing reviews. Discussion Assigning a dollar value to our expertise put us on par with other subject matter experts on campus and actually drove demand. We could act as paid consultants in research projects and shifted the perception of librarians from service providers to research partners. Affiliating with our partners was key to our success and boosted our ability to strengthen our campus' research infrastructure.","Lackey, Mellanye J; Greenberg, Heidi; Rethlefsen, Melissa L",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2019.711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607817/,667

STUDY DESIGN Systematic Review and Population analysis. METHODS A systematic review was performed to identify CRS clinical trials, conducted in the U.S. and published between 2010 and 2020 in which patients were prospectively enrolled. Pooled racial and ethnicity data were compared to national and corresponding regional census data. RESULTS Eighty-three studies were included, comprising 12,027 patients. 50.4% were male and the average age was 49.2 years. 8,810 patients underwent a surgical procedure. Of the 12,027 patients, 81.67% were identified as White, 5.35% as Black, 1.27% as Asian, 0.02% as Pacific Islander, 0.12% as American Indian, and 11.57% were classified as Other. The racial and ethnic composition of the pooled study population differs significantly from the national U.S. census data with the underrepresentation of each minority population (P ≤ .0002). Regional sub-analyses yield variable results. In the Northeast and West, there was an underrepresentation of all minority populations. In the South and Midwest, Black enrollment was similar to the U.S. census data, while all other minorities were underrepresented. CONCLUSIONS The racial and ethnic composition of patients enrolled in prospective CRS clinical trials differs significantly from the demographics of the U.S. POPULATION The generalizability and external validity of findings derived from studies comprised of demographically mismatched populations has not been established.

73621,Barbed versus conventional 2-layer continuous running sutures for laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure.,2016,"INTRODUCTION We describe a new service model, the Orthopaedic Assessment Unit (OAU), designed to provide care for trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients without COVID-19 symptoms and isolated musculoskeletal injuries were redirected to the OAU. METHODS We prospectively reviewed patients throughput during the peak of the global pandemic (7 May 2020 to 7 June 2020) and compared with our historic service provision (7 May 2019 to 7 June 2019). The Mann-Whitney and Fisher Exact tests were used to test the statistical significance of data. RESULTS A total of 1,147 patients were seen, with peak attendances between 11am and 2pm; 96% of all referrals were seen within 4h. The majority of patients were seen by orthopaedic registrars (52%) and nurse practitioners (44%). The majority of patients suffered from sprains and strains (39%), followed by fractures (22%) and wounds (20%); 73% of patients were discharged on the same day, 15% given follow up, 8% underwent surgery and 3% were admitted but did not undergo surgery. Our volume of trauma admissions and theatre cases decreased by 22% and 17%, respectively (p=0.058; 0.139). There was a significant reduction of virtual fracture clinic referrals after reconfiguration of services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Rapid implementation of a specialist OAU during a pandemic can provide early definitive trauma care while exceeding national waiting time standards. The fall in trauma attendances was lower than anticipated. The retention of orthopaedic staff in the department to staff the unit and maintain a high standard of care is imperative.","Lim, J W; Rehman, H; Gaba, S; Sargeant, H; Stevenson, I M; Boddie, D E",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645286/,667

Instead of quantifying the full-length HbA1c glycated protein, in the present study, we proposed the peptide-based strategy to quantify the depletion of the tryptic peptides of hemoglobin for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The peptides were discovered and validated as T2DM biomarkers by label-free LC-ESI-DMRM method without reference material. The glucose could react with hemoglobin's free amino group of N-terminus and ϵ-amino group of lysine residues and leave the modification on the hemoglobin tryptic peptides. Thus, there are two types of peptides in the hemoglobin: sensitive peptides and insensitive peptides to glucose due to the differential sensitivity of lysine residues to glycation. To discover two types of peptides of hemoglobin, we first developed the assay of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled with dynamic multiple reaction monitoring. The protein coverage reaches 94.2%. Moreover, the hemoglobin was incubated with the 500 mmol/L glucose for 20 days, 40 days and 60 days in vitro to screen the sensitive peptides and insensitive peptides to glucose. A total of 14 sensitive peptides and 4 insensitive peptides were discovered. Furthermore, the LC-ESI-DMRM method was also utilized to validated the glucose-sensitive peptides by 40 clinical samples with healthy control individuals (n = 20) and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n = 20). Three putative sensitive peptides (LLGNVLVCVLAHHFGK, VVAGVANALAHKYH, LRVDPVNFK) from the hemoglobin showed excellent sensitivity and specificity based on receiver operating characteristic analysis and were verified as the promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. And one peptide (LLVVYPWTQR) was found as glucose-insensitive peptide. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that quantification of hemoglobin tryptic peptides using label-free and standard-free LC-ESI-DMRM is an alternative method for the diagnosis of T2DM, which could be combined with other MS-based blood biomarkers for diagnosis of multiple diseases in MS single shot.","Hong, Jie; Xin, Shuchen; Min, Rui; Zhang, Yongqian; Deng, Yulin",Redox biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.101985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932868/,667
74281,Extraperitoneal colostomy in laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection using a laparoscopic retractor.,2013,"OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of coronary ostia cannulation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to assess potential predictors of coronary access impairment. BACKGROUND Certain data concerning the feasibility and reproducibility of coronary cannulation after TAVR are lacking. METHODS RE-ACCESS (Reobtain Coronary Ostia Cannulation Beyond Transcatheter Aortic Valve Stent) was an investigator-driven, single-center, prospective, registry-based study that enrolled consecutive patients undergoing TAVR using all commercially available devices. All patients underwent coronary angiography before and after TAVR. The primary endpoint was the rate of unsuccessful coronary ostia cannulation after TAVR. Secondary endpoints were the identification of factors associated with the inability to selectively cannulate coronary ostia after TAVR. RESULTS Among 300 patients enrolled in the RE-ACCESS study from December 2018 to January 2020, a total of 23 cases (7.7%) of unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR were documented. This issue occurred in 22 of 23 cases with the use of Evolut R/PRO transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) (17.9% vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the use of Evolut R/PRO TAVs (odds ratio [OR]: 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6 to 335.0; p < 0.01), the TAV-sinus of Valsalva relation (OR: 1.1 per 1-mm increase; 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.2; p < 0.01), and the mean TAV implantation depth (OR: 1.7 per 1-mm decrease; 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.3; p < 0.01) were found to be independent predictors of unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR. A model combining these factors was demonstrated to predict with very high accuracy the risk for unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR (area under the curve: 0.94; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Unsuccessful coronary cannulation following TAVR was observed in 7.7% of patients and occurred almost exclusively in those receiving Evolut TAVs. The combination of Evolut TAV, a higher TAV-sinus of Valsalva relation, and implantation depth predicts with high accuracy the risk for unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR.

Building on the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined day-level relationships between job demands, home demands and emotional exhaustion during telework. Moreover, we tested if leisure crafting (i.e., the proactive pursuit and enactment of leisure activities targeted at goal setting, socializing, growth and development) is negatively related to emotional exhaustion. We expected that proactive personality would be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was predicted to relate negatively to job performance. METHODS We tested our assumptions using a daily diary study on seven consecutive days with 178 employees (964 observations in total). RESULTS Multilevel path analysis supports the assumptions that daily job demands as well as daily home demands during telework are positively related to emotional exhaustion. As predicted, we found leisure crafting to be negatively related to emotional exhaustion, and proactive personality to be positively related to leisure crafting. Finally, emotional exhaustion was negatively related to job performance. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our study supports a health-promoting role of leisure crafting above the unfavorable relationships between job demands and home demands with emotional exhaustion.","Abdel Hadi, Sascha; Bakker, Arnold B; Häusser, Jan A","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1903447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769142/,667

To assess whether it is appropriate to consider infants' categories as taxonomies, 3 criteria are examined: (a) similarity to adults' choice of category members, (b) hierarchical understanding, and (c) agreement with adults' bases for classification. It is argued that infants' categories do not meet these criteria and that it may be erroneous to apply the same labels to categories formed in the first 2 years as those in later life.

Wildlife researchers are thus uniquely positioned to merge ecological and evolutionary studies with genomic technologies to exploit unprecedented ""Big Data"" tools in disease research; however, many researchers lack the training and expertise required to use these computationally intensive methodologies. To address this disparity, the inaugural ""Genomics of Disease in Wildlife"" workshop assembled early to mid-career professionals with expertise across scientific disciplines (e.g., genomics, wildlife biology, veterinary sciences, and conservation management) for training in the application of genomic tools to wildlife disease research. A horizon scanning-like exercise, an activity to identify forthcoming trends and challenges, performed by the workshop participants identified and discussed 5 themes considered to be the most pressing to the application of genomics in wildlife disease research: 1) ""Improving communication,"" 2) ""Methodological and analytical advancements,"" 3) ""Translation into practice,"" 4) ""Integrating landscape ecology and genomics,"" and 5) ""Emerging new questions."" Wide-ranging solutions from the horizon scan were international in scope, itemized both deficiencies and strengths in wildlife genomic initiatives, promoted the use of genomic technologies to unite wildlife and human disease research, and advocated best practices for optimal use of genomic tools in wildlife disease projects.

Furthermore, inguinal hernias are now considered to be one of the long-term complications of radical prostatectomy. In this report, we present our experience with the performance of totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP) along with extraperitoneal laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (ELRP). PRESENTATION OF CASE A 66-year-old man with prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernias was admitted to our hospital for surgery. He had a history of right inguinal hernioplasty without mesh placement and ascending colon diverticulitis. With a diagnosis of prostate cancer and bilateral inguinal hernia, concomitant TEP after ELRP was safely performed. DISCUSSION TEP combined with ELRP appears to be a rational procedure and easy to perform. The incidence of complications related to either TEP or ELRP might not be increased. TEP combined with ELRP might be safely performed for recurrent inguinal hernia after non-mesh hernioplasty.

76393,Misplaced batteries result in lead poisoning in suckler cows.,2016,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that increases the morbidity and mortality of immunocompromised individuals. The current FDA-approved treatments for CMV infection are intended to be virus specific, yet they have significant adverse side effects, including nephrotoxicity and hematological toxicity. Thus, there is a medical need for safer and more effective CMV therapeutics. Using a high-content screen, we identified the cardiac glycoside convallatoxin as an effective compound that inhibits CMV infection. Using a panel of cardiac glycoside variants, we assessed the structural elements critical for anti-CMV activity by both experimental and in silico methods. Analysis of the antiviral effects, toxicities, and pharmacodynamics of different variants of cardiac glycosides identified the mechanism of inhibition as reduction of methionine import, leading to decreased immediate-early gene translation without significant toxicity. Also, convallatoxin was found to dramatically reduce the proliferation of clinical CMV strains, implying that its mechanism of action is an effective strategy to block CMV dissemination. Our study has uncovered the mechanism and structural elements of convallatoxin, which are important for effectively inhibiting CMV infection by targeting the expression of immediate-early genes. IMPORTANCE Cytomegalovirus is a highly prevalent virus capable of causing severe disease in certain populations. The current FDA-approved therapeutics all target the same stage of the viral life cycle and induce toxicity and viral resistance. We identified convallatoxin, a novel cell-targeting antiviral that inhibits CMV infection by decreasing the synthesis of viral proteins. At doses low enough for cells to tolerate, convallatoxin was able to inhibit primary isolates of CMV, including those resistant to the anti-CMV drug ganciclovir. In addition to identifying convallatoxin as a novel antiviral, limiting mRNA translation has a dramatic impact on CMV infection and proliferation.","Cohen, Tobias; Williams, John D; Opperman, Timothy J; Sanchez, Roberto; Lurain, Nell S; Tortorella, Domenico",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01050-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654292/,667

76845,Comparison of Ultrasonic Dissection and Suture Ligation for Mesoappendix in Laparoscopic Appendectomy.,2021-04-06,"INTRODUCTION For more than a decade, following the ECTRIMS Congress, the Post-ECTRIMS Meeting has been held in Spain, where neurologists with expertise in multiple sclerosis (MS) from all over the country meet to review the most relevant latest developments presented at the ECTRIMS congress (on this occasion held together with ACTRIMS). AIM This article, published in two parts, summarises the presentations that took place at the Post-ECTRIMS Meeting, held online on 16 and 17 October 2020. DEVELOPMENT This first part includes the latest results regarding the impact of the environment and lifestyle on risk of MS and its clinical course, and the role of epigenetics and genetic factors on these processes. Findings from preclinical and clinical research on the lymphocyte subtypes identified and the involvement of lymphoid follicles and meningeal involvement in the disease are discussed. Changes in brain structure are addressed at the microscopic and macroscopic levels, including results from high-resolution imaging techniques. The latest advances on biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MS, and on the involvement of the microbiome in these patients are also reported. Finally, results from patient registries on the impact of COVID-19 in MS patients are outlined. CONCLUSIONS There have been new data on MS risk factors, the impact of MS at the cellular and structural level, the role of the microbiome in the disease, biomarkers, and the relationship between COVID-19 and MS.","Fernández, O; Montalban, X; Aladro, Y; Alonso, A; Arroyo, R; Calles, C; Castillo-Triviño, T; Comabella, M; Costa-Frossard, L; Forero, L; Ginestal, R; Landete, L; Llaneza, M; Llufriu, S; Martínez-Ginés, M L; Meca-Lallana, J; Mendibe, M; Oreja-Guevara, C; Oterino, A; Prieto, J M; Ramió-Torrentà, Ll; Romero-Pinel, L; Téllez, N; Rodríguez-Antigüedad, A",Revista de neurologia,https://doi.org/10.33588/rn.7211.2021172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042168/,667
76921,First case of robotic laparoendoscopic single-site radical prostatectomy with single-site VesPa platform.,2018,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic disease that was first identified in humans in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV causes acute and severe respiratory disease in humans. The mortality rate of MERS in humans is ∼35% and >800 deaths have been reported globally as of August 2020. Dromedary camels are a natural host of the virus and the source of zoonotic human infection. In experimental studies, Bactrian camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection similar to dromedary camels; however, neither the virus, viral RNA, nor virus-specific antibodies were detected in Bactrian camel field samples so far. The aim of our study was to survey Mongolian camels for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. A total of 180 camel sera, collected in 2016 and 2017, were involved in this survey: 17 of 180 sera were seropositive with an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed at the State Central Veterinary Laboratory in Mongolia. These 17 positive sera plus 53 additional negative sera were sent to the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID/NIH, and tested for the presence of antibodies with a similar ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and a virus neutralization test (VNT). In these additional tests, a total of 21 of 70 sera were positive with ELISA and 10 sera were positive with IFA; however, none was positive in the VNT. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the ELISA/IFA-positive antibodies are (1) non-neutralizing antibodies or (2) directed against a MERS-CoV-like virus circulating in Bactrian camels in Mongolia.","Bold, Dashzeveg; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Myagmarsuren, Odonchimeg; Zayat, Batsukh; Munster, Vincent J; Richt, Juergen A",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2020.2669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197370/,667

76967,Laminar and turbulent surgical plume characteristics generated from curved- and straight-blade laparoscopic ultrasonic dissectors.,2014,"BACKGROUND The clinical application of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for sigmoidectomy is associated with several difficulties that need to be overcome before wider clinical application of the procedure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of transgastric sigmoidectomy in a survival animal model, as well as to evaluate the safety and usability of a custom paired magnetic intraluminal device, which we developed for the NOTES procedure. METHODS Survival experiments were conducted on 24-33-kg dogs. After anesthesia, a gastrotomy was created using double-channel endoscope, and peritoneoscopy was performed. The sigmoid colon was retracted laterally using paired magnetic intraluminal device, the mesocolon was dissected, and the branch vessel was sealed. The anvil was placed into the descending colon through anus. A proximal and distal colonic transection was then performed. The circular stapler was passed through the anus and performed end-to-end anastomosis. Afterwards the specimen was removed through gastrotomy, and the gastric incision was closed. Postoperatively, all dogs were recovered and monitored for well-being during convalescence. Reexploration was practiced under anesthesia 2 weeks after surgery for evaluation of intra-abdominal complications, and intra-peritoneal cultures for microorganism. RESULTS The mean operative time was 141 (range, 122-157) min. There were no complications or physical evidence of sepsis or bowel obstruction during the observation period. Only one dog exhibited decreased body weight, decreasing to 20.4 kg from 22.4 kg after surgery; all of the other dogs exhibited increased body weight. We observed no evidence of peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, bleeding, or organ injury on reexploration conducted on day 14 after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric NOTES sigmoidectomy is a safe operation technique as evaluated in a dog model. The paired magnetic intraluminal device that was used in this study was useful to avoid an abdominal incision for retracting the sigmoid colon.","Cho, Yong Beom; Park, Jun Ho; Chun, Ho-Kyung; Park, Chi Min; Kim, Hee Cheol; Yun, Seong Hyeon; Lee, Woo Yong",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1365-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21046162/,667
77070,"Northern Ireland disease surveillance, April to June 2012.",2012,"How negative selection, positive selection, and population size contribute to the large variation in nucleotide substitution rates among RNA viruses remains unclear. Here, we studied the ratios of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates (d N/d S) in protein-coding genes of human RNA and DNA viruses and mammals. Among the 21 RNA viruses studied, 18 showed a genome-average d N/d S from 0.01 to 0.10, indicating that over 90% of nonsynonymous mutations are eliminated by negative selection. Only HIV-1 showed a d N/d S (0.31) higher than that (0.22) in mammalian genes. By comparing the d N/d S values among genes in the same genome and among species or strains, we found that both positive selection and population size play significant roles in the d N/d S variation among genes and species. Indeed, even in flaviviruses and picornaviruses, which showed the lowest ratios among the 21 species studied, positive selection appears to have contributed significantly to d N/d S We found the view that positive selection occurs much more frequently in influenza A subtype H3N2 than subtype H1N1 holds only for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, but not for other genes. Moreover, we found no support for the view that vector-borne RNA viruses have lower d N/d S ratios than non-vector-borne viruses. In addition, we found a correlation between d N and d S, implying a correlation between d N and the mutation rate. Interestingly, only 2 of the 8 DNA viruses studied showed a d N/d S < 0.10, while 4 showed a d N/d S > 0.22. These observations increase our understanding of the mechanisms of RNA virus evolution.","Lin, Jinn-Jy; Bhattacharjee, Maloyjo Joyraj; Yu, Chun-Ping; Tseng, Yan Yuan; Li, Wen-Hsiung",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907626116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31484772/,667
77188,Comparing the Postoperative Outcomes of Single-Incision Laparoscopic Appendectomy and Three Port Appendectomy With Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol for Acute Appendicitis: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULTS Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSIONS Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.","Montoya, J C; Li, Y; Strother, C; Chen, G-H",AJNR.

The primary outcome variables were pain, swelling, trismus, infection, and alveolar osteitis. The secondary outcome variables were wound dehiscence and food impaction. A total of 95 participants completed the study (47 in the irrigation group and 48 in the rinse group). In the irrigation group, alveolar osteitis and facial swelling had reduced significantly at seven days postoperatively (both p<0.01). Pain scores had also reduced significantly at seven days (p<0.01), but not at 48hours, and patients had lower levels of food impaction (p<0.01) and less severe symptoms (p=0.02).

The paper reminds readers of the application and shortcomings of the concept of New Public Management (NPM) in the French health system. Problem The paper investigates NPM health reforms in France. Reforms aimed at containing costs. What administrative restructuring was implemented? What were reform idiosyncrasies? What were their limitations? Which critical public health emergencies remain? Methods We examine the political and economic context of health-care reforms, the rise of the regulatory state, and its core element: the diagnostic-related group (DRG) scale. We critically examine the recentralization of health policy decisions and its impact on care providers and provide an international perspective on reforms. Results Reforms put priority on the use of yardsticks and also emphasized regulation and competition but rejected public-private partnerships on the Anglo-Saxon model. Central health authorities regain their authority over health policy decisions, and decentralization was weakened. Conclusion Restrictions in public service delivery triggered a general discontent among the population. The political repercussions of reforms eventually crystallized into the Yellow Vest movement.","Simonet, Daniel",Risk management and healthcare policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s306381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285611/,667

78097,Robotic subxiphoid thymectomy.,2016,"Alphavirus replicase complexes are initially formed at the plasma membrane and are subsequently internalized by endocytosis. During the late stages of infection, viral replication organelles are represented by large cytopathic vacuoles, where replicase complexes bind to membranes of endolysosomal origin. In addition to viral components, these organelles harbor an unknown number of host proteins. In this study, a fraction of modified lysosomes carrying functionally intact replicase complexes was obtained by feeding Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected HeLa cells with dextran-covered magnetic nanoparticles and later magnetically isolating the nanoparticle-containing lysosomes. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture combined with quantitative proteomics was used to reveal 78 distinct cellular proteins that were at least 2.5-fold more abundant in replicase complex-carrying vesicles than in vesicles obtained from noninfected cells. These host components included the RNA-binding proteins PCBP1, hnRNP M, hnRNP C, and hnRNP K, which were shown to colocalize with the viral replicase. Silencing of hnRNP M and hnRNP C expression enhanced the replication of SFV, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Sindbis virus (SINV). PCBP1 silencing decreased SFV-mediated protein synthesis, whereas hnRNP K silencing increased this synthesis. Notably, the effect of hnRNP K silencing on CHIKV- and SINV-mediated protein synthesis was opposite to that observed for SFV. This study provides a new approach for analyzing the proteome of the virus replication organelle of positive-strand RNA viruses and helps to elucidate how host RNA-binding proteins exert important but diverse functions during positive-strand RNA viral infection.","Varjak, Margus; Saul, Sirle; Arike, Liisa; Lulla, Aleksei; Peil, Lauri; Merits, Andres",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01105-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864636/,667
78111,Long-term evaluation of adhesion formation and foreign body response to three new meshes.,2015,"Although medication treatment in COVID-19 patients would have no direct effect on the spread of the disease, a shortening of the period of hospitalization by only a few days would release 25 - 30% of critical-care resources. However, there appears to be no well-established medication treatment available that can do this reliably at the present time. Anti-malarials currently being evaluated, i.e., chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, are not yet established as effective medications, and antiviral agents, including remdesivir, are only weakly active. This position paper report is focused on the modulation of the cytokine storm since it appears to be a major cause of the multi-organ failure in COVID-19. Whereas corticosteroids are not recommended in patients not on mechanical ventilation, immunotherapy with convalescent plasma and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have been used with some success in COVID-19. There is emerging new evidence that polyvalent immunoglobulins (PVIG) from bovine colostrum given orally can also modulate the immune response. Research using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients (a so called micro-cytokine storm) has shown that PVIG block the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and stimulate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We have been able to confirm these results in a similar model using mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and could demonstrate that the modulations produced by PVIG are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those obtained using human immunoglobulin (IVIG). Both immunoglobulins reduce the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-) 12/23p40 (-90%), IL-6 (-75%) and TNF-α (-60%) and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (+75%). Evidence is presented that PVIG can produce anti-inflammatory effects similar to these after oral application in patients. Its use is contraindicated in patients with lactose intolerance but is otherwise safe and free of complications in clinical studies including the treatment of infants with gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusion: PVIG appears to be a potential and safe anti-inflammatory agent and can be recommended as a candidate medication for studies in COVID-19 patients.","Sly, Laura M; Braun, Peter; Woodcock, Barry G",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141018/,667

MATERIALS AND METHODS A nine-question survey was administered with 428 dentists providing data for three specific areas: (1) demographic information-TLD ownership, device age, frequency of use, and observations of screw loosening; (2) recognition information-calibration, reading measurements of the TLD, and the meaning of preload; (3) usage information-screw-tightening protocols and effect of speed during actioning of the TLD. Data collection was compared with industry standards for use of hand torque tools including ISO-6789 1,2:2017 and related texts pertaining to screw fastener protocols. RESULTS The beam-type TLD was the most popular; however, 33% surveyed used it incorrectly. Most TLDs being used were older than 1 year, with only 6% calibrated. Forty-eight percent observed screw loosening less than once per year, while 44% reported three or more occurrences per year. A similar number used the TLD for implant placement and abutment screw tightening. Screw-tightening protocols varied. Preload was not understood by the majority of those surveyed. CONCLUSION Dentistry does not appear to adhere to the protocols and standards recommended by other industries that also rely on screw-fastening mechanisms and TLDs. Further education and training appears to be warranted in this area of implant dentistry to reduce the risks of screw-associated complications.","Wadhwani, Chandur Pk; Rosen, Paul S; Yang, Gang; Hu, Wenjie; Schoenbaum, Todd; Linkevicius, Tomas; Iyer, Shankar; Hess, Timothy; Kattadiyil, Mathew T; Chung, Kwok-Hung",The International journal of oral & maxillofacial implants,https://doi.org/10.11607/jomi.8590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115069/,667

Our objectives are to evaluate the clinic-radiological spectrum of pediatric patients with cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum (CC). METHODS Children (0-18 years) admitted between February 2017 and May 2020 with splenial lesions showing diffusion restriction on MRI, either isolated or within involvement of other parts of the brain, were included retrospectively. The primary lesions of the CC (e.g. acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute ischemic infarction, and glioblastoma multiforme) were excluded. CLOCCs were divided into infection-associated, metabolic disorder-associated, and trauma-associated lesions, as well as CLOCCs involving other entities. Data were collected from the medical databases. RESULTS Forty-one patients were determined to have CLOCCs. Twenty-five (61%) were infection-associated, nine (22%) were trauma-associated, and three (7%) were metabolic disorder-associated cases, including 2 inherited disorders of metabolism. There were four (10%) patients with other entities, three with epilepsy, and one had an apparent life-threatening event. Six patients had a known etiology among the infection-associated group; one had multisystem inflammatory syndrome caused by COVID-19 and one had been infected by COVID-19 without any complications. All the infection-associated patients with isolated splenial lesions recovered totally, although six patients required intensive care hospitalization. Four trauma-associated patients had sequela lesions. CONCLUSIONS CLOCCs are associated with a spectrum of diseases, including the new coronavirus, COVID-19 infection. Infection-associated CLOCCs has the best prognosis, although severe cases may occur. Sequelae are possible based on the etiology.","Aksu Uzunhan, Tuğçe; Maraş Genç, Hülya; Kutlubay, Büşra; Kalın, Sevinç; Bektaş, Gonca; Yapıcı, Özge; Çıracı, Saliha; Sözen, Hatice Gülhan; Şevketoğlu, Esra; Palabıyık, Figen; Gör, Zeynep; Çakar, Nafiye Emel; Kara, Bülent",Brain & development,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.braindev.2021.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120800/,667

The objectives of this study are to examine the effect of neoadjuvant therapy in regard to perioperative parameters, morbidity, and short-term mortality in patients undergoing a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE). METHODS : This is a retrospective review of 39 patients undergoing MIE for esophageal cancer during 2007-2010. RESULTS : Of the 39 patients, 14 (36%) did not receive neoadjuvant therapy (NCR) and 25 (64%) did receive either chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy (CR). On comparing NCR vs CR, there was no difference in operative time (361 vs 362 minutes; P = 0.94) or estimated blood loss (233 vs 190 mL; P = 0.06). All patients underwent an R0 resection, and there was no difference in the mean number of lymph nodes harvested (NCR 21.5 vs CR 21.6; P = 0.95). Both groups had mean intensive care unit stay of 1 day (P = 0.7), and there was no difference in length of stay (NCR 7.4 vs CR 8.2 days; P = 0.38). There were no deaths or anastomotic leaks in either group. The incidence of complications in the NCR group was 21% (3/14) while in the CR group was 48% (12/25). Complications were not associated with neoadjuvant therapy [CR vs NCR: odds ratio = 3.44 (0.72-16.38); P = 0.121], even after adjusting for comorbidities and age. CONCLUSIONS : MIE can be performed safely following neoadjuvant therapy with similar perioperative results, morbidity, and short-term mortality when compared with MIE alone.

The trial showed superior survival for a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (IN), compared with the previous standard of care, in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. When IN is not safe or feasible, alternative agents such as sunitinib, pazopanib, and cabozantinib should be considered. Furthermore, at present, the data from the trial are immature in favourable-risk patients. Therefore, sunitinib or pazopanib remains the favoured agent for this subgroup of patients.","Powles, Thomas; Albiges, Laurence; Staehler, Michael; Bensalah, Karim; Dabestani, Saeed; Giles, Rachel H; Hofmann, Fabian; Hora, Milan; Kuczyk, Markus A; Lam, Thomas B; Marconi, Lorenzo; Merseburger, Axel S; Fernández-Pello, Sergio; Tahbaz, Rana; Volpe, Alessandro; Ljungberg, Börje; Bex, Axel",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2017.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29223605/,667
78640,Are there predictors of outcome following rectovaginal fistula repair?,2010,"Human enterovirus 68 (HEV-68) is an enterovirus associated with respiratory illness. In China, no information about HEV-68 is available for children yet. This study aimed to investigate the presence of HEV-68 in mainland China between 2009 and 2012 and to explore the migration events of HEV-68 across the world. Among 1565 samples tested from children, 41 (2.6%) were positive for HEV and 223 (14.3%) for human rhinovirus (HRV). Seven (17.1%) of 41 HEVs were HEV-68. Two HEV-68- and five HRV-positive samples were detected in 585 adult samples. HEV-68 is the predominant type of enterovirus in children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), followed by HEV-71 and coxsackievirus A6. Three HEV-68-infected children presented with severe pneumonia and one presented with a severe asthma attack. The viruses were attributed to two novel distinct sublineages of HEV-68 based on phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 gene sequences. Migration events analysis showed that the USA and the Netherlands were possible geographical sources of HEV-68, from where three strains migrated to China. In conclusion, HEV-68 may play a predominant role among the enteroviruses associated with ARTI in children. Additional surveillance is needed to clarify the reason why HEV-68 causes such a wide spectrum of disease, from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease and even death.","Lu, Qing-Bin; Wo, Ying; Wang, Hong-Yu; Wei, Mao-Ti; Zhang, Lei; Yang, Hong; Liu, En-Mei; Li, Ting-Yu; Zhao, Zhong-Tang; Liu, Wei; Cao, Wu-Chun",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.068247-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324030/,667

DESIGN Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING Residential neighbourhoods (1000-metre circular buffers from the centroids of dissemination areas) across Canada for which the Canadian ALE Measure was derived, based on intersection density, points of interest and dwelling density. PARTICIPANTS 249 420 survey respondents from an individual-level record linkage between the Canadian Community Health Survey (2000-2010) and the Canadian Mortality Database until 2011, comprised of older women (65-85 years), older men (65-81 years), middle-aged women (45-64 years) and middle-aged men (45-64 years). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Premature cardiometabolic mortality and average daily energy expenditure attributable to walking. Multivariable proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, educational attainment, dissemination area-level median income, smoking status, obesity, the presence of chronic conditions, season of survey response and survey cycle. RESULTS Survey respondents contributed a total of 1 451 913 person-years. Greater walking was observed in more favourable ALEs. Walking was associated with lower cardiometabolic death in all groups except for middle-aged men. Favourable ALEs conferred a 22% reduction in death from cardiometabolic causes (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) for older women. CONCLUSIONS On average, people walk more in favourable ALEs, regardless of sex and age. With the exception of middle-aged men, walking is associated with lower premature cardiometabolic death. Older women living in neighbourhoods that favour active living live longer.","Mah, Sarah M; Sanmartin, Claudia; Riva, Mylène; Dasgupta, Kaberi; Ross, Nancy A",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444170/,667
79049,Institutional experience with laparoscopic partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis.,2010,"The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affects females in the home and workplace. This study aimed to acquire information regarding the gender-specific effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on aspects of professional and personal lives of a subset of pediatric cardiologists. We sent an online multiple-choice survey to a listserv of Pediatric Cardiologists. Data collected included demographics, dependent care details, work hours, leave from work, salary cut, childcare hours before and after the COVID-19 peak lockdown/stay at home mandate and partner involvement. 242 pediatric cardiologists with dependent care responsibilities responded (response rate of 20.2%). A significantly higher proportion of females reported a salary cut (29.1% of females vs 17.6% of males, p=0.04) and scaled back or discontinued work (14% vs 5.3%; p=0.03). Prior to the COVID-19 lockdown phase, females provided more hours of dependent care. Females also reported a significantly greater increase in childcare hours overall per week (45 h post/30 h pre vs. 30 h post/20 h pre for men; p<0.001). Male cardiologists were much more likely to have partners who reduced work hours (67% vs. 28%; p<0.001) and reported that their partners took a salary cut compared to partners of female cardiologists (51% vs. 22%; p<0.001). In conclusion, gender disparity in caregiver responsibilities existed among highly skilled pediatric cardiologists even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disproportionately affected female pediatric cardiologists with respect to dependent care responsibilities, time at work, and financial compensation.","Ferns, Sunita J; Gautam, Shiva; Hudak, Mark L",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.02.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640368/,667

The available data on stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 are relatively limited and have not been evaluated in Russia yet. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The cross-sectional anonymous survey included 1,090 healthcare workers. Stress and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin two component factor model, Cronbach's alpha and ROC-analysis were performed to determine the influence of different variables, internal structure and consistency, sensitivity and specificity of SAVE-9 compared with GAD-7. RESULTS The median scores on the GAD-7 and SAVE-9 were 5 and 14, respectively. 535 (49.1%) respondents had moderate and 239 (21.9%) had severe anxiety according to SAVE-9. 134 participants (12.3%) had severe anxiety, 144 (13.2%) had moderate according to GAD-7. The component model revealed two-factor structure of SAVE-9: ""anxiety and somatic concern"" and ""social stress"". Female gender (OR - 0.98, p=0.04) and younger age (OR - 0.65, p=0.04) were associated with higher level of anxiety according to regression model. The total score of SAVE-9 with a high degree of confidence predicted the GAD-7 value in comparative ROC analysis. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers in Russia reported high rates of stress and anxiety. The Russian version of the SAVE-9 displayed a good ratio of sensitivity to specificity compared with GAD-7 and can be recommended as a screening instrument for detection of stress and anxiety in healthcare workers.","Mosolova, Ekaterina; Chung, Seockhoon; Sosin, Dmitryi; Mosolov, Sergey",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370765/,667
79467,Bad bacteria in acute appendicitis: rare but relevant.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The frequency and amount of intracranial, intradural inflammatory vessel wall enhancement in giant cell arteritis remain unclear. The purpose of this work was to prospectively assess the intracranial extent of vasculitic changes in patients with giant cell arteritis using a dedicated MR imaging protocol optimized for assessment of mural changes of intracranial arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-eight patients with suspected giant cell arteritis underwent 3T MR imaging. Imaging included a fat-saturated T1WI pre- and postcontrast application optimized for assessment of intradural vessel wall enhancement and high-resolution fat-saturated T1WI to evaluate superficial extracranial vessels. Temporal artery biopsies were available in 11 cases. Vessel wall enhancement of intradural and extracranial vessels was evaluated by 2 observers independently. RESULTS Twenty patients had giant cell arteritis; 9 cases were biopsy-proved. Clear vessel wall enhancement of superficial extracranial and intradural internal carotid arteries was detected in 16 and 10 patients, respectively. Slight vessel wall enhancement of the vertebral arteries was seen. Of 9 patients with giant cell arteritis with vessel occlusion or stenosis, 2 presented with cerebral ischemic infarcts. Vessel occlusion or stenosis site coincided with the location of vessel wall enhancement of the vertebral arteries in 4 patients and of the intradural ICA in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS Vessel wall enhancement of intradural arteries, mainly the ICA, can be regularly found in patients with giant cell arteritis. Mural inflammatory changes of the intradural ICA detected on MR imaging may identify a subgroup of patients with giant cell arteritis and should be further evaluated in clinical studies.","Siemonsen, S; Brekenfeld, C; Holst, B; Kaufmann-Buehler, A-K; Fiehler, J; Bley, T A",AJNR.

79738,Pitfalls of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a comparison of positive surgical margins between robotic and laparoscopic surgery.,2014,"BACKGROUND Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. More evidence is needed regarding the effects of these drugs in patients across the broad spectrum of heart failure, including those with a markedly reduced ejection fraction. METHODS In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 3730 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or placebo, in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening heart failure. RESULTS During a median of 16 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 361 of 1863 patients (19.4%) in the empagliflozin group and in 462 of 1867 patients (24.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.86; P<0.001). The effect of empagliflozin on the primary outcome was consistent in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The total number of hospitalizations for heart failure was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.85; P<0.001). The annual rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was slower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (-0.55 vs. -2.28 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per year, P<0.001), and empagliflozin-treated patients had a lower risk of serious renal outcomes. Uncomplicated genital tract infection was reported more frequently with empagliflozin. CONCLUSIONS Among patients receiving recommended therapy for heart failure, those in the empagliflozin group had a lower risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure than those in the placebo group, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.

In this study, we identified endolysins ElyA1 and ElyA2 (GH108-PG3 family), present in the genome of bacteriophages Ab1051Φ and Ab1052Φ, respectively. The muralytic activity of these endolysins against MDR clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was tested using the turbidity reduction assay. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of endolysin, colistin and a combination of endolysin and colistin were determined, and the antimicrobial activity of each treatment was confirmed by time kill curves. Endolysin ElyA1 displayed activity against all 25 strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa tested and against 13 out of 17 strains of K. pneumoniae. Endolysin ElyA2 did not display any such activity. The combined antimicrobial activity of colistin and ElyA1 yielded a reduction in the colistin MIC for all strains studied, except K. pneumoniae. These results were confirmed in vivo in G. mellonella survival assays and in murine skin and lung infection models. In conclusion, combining colistin (1/4 MIC) with the new endolysin ElyA1 (350 µg) enhanced the bactericidal activity of colistin in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This will potentially enable reduction of the dose of colistin used in clinical practice.","Blasco, Lucia; Ambroa, Anton; Trastoy, Rocio; Bleriot, Ines; Moscoso, Miriam; Fernández-Garcia, Laura; Perez-Nadales, Elena; Fernández-Cuenca, Felipe; Torre-Cisneros, Julian; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesus; Oliver, Antonio; Canton, Rafael; Kidd, Tim; Navarro, Ferran; Miró, Elisenda; Pascual, Alvaro; Bou, German; Martínez-Martínez, Luis; Tomas, Maria",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64145-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346029/,667

Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of next-generation sequencing in identifying the causative organism(s) in patients with periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS In this prospective study, samples were collected from 65 revision arthroplasties (39 knees and 26 hips) and 17 primary arthroplasties (9 hips and 8 knees). Synovial fluid, deep tissue, and swabs were obtained at the time of the surgical procedure and were shipped to the laboratory for next-generation sequencing. Deep-tissue specimens were also sent to the institutional laboratory for culture. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for next-generation sequencing, using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) definition of periprosthetic joint infection as the standard. RESULTS In 28 revisions, the cases were considered to be infected; cultures were positive in 17 cases (60.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), 40.6% to 78.5%]), and next-generation sequencing was positive in 25 cases (89.3% [95% CI, 71.8% to 97.7%]), with concordance between next-generation sequencing and culture in 15 cases. Among the 11 cases of culture-negative periprosthetic joint infection, next-generation sequencing was able to identify an organism in 9 cases (81.8% [95% CI, 48.2% to 97.7%]). Next-generation sequencing identified microbes in 9 (25.0% [95% CI, 12.1% to 42.2%]) of 36 aseptic revisions with negative cultures and in 6 (35.3% [95% CI, 14.2% to 61.7%]) of 17 primary total joint arthroplasties. Next-generation sequencing detected several organisms in most positive samples. However, in the majority of patients who were infected, 1 or 2 organisms were dominant. CONCLUSIONS Next-generation sequencing may be a useful adjunct in identification of the causative organism(s) in culture-negative periprosthetic joint infection. Our findings suggest that some cases of monomicrobial periprosthetic joint infection may have additional organisms that escape detection when culture is used. Further study is required to determine the clinical implications of isolated organisms in samples from patients who are not thought to be infected. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level I.

Etiology and outcomes of acute lung injury in tropical countries may be different from those of western nations. We describe the etiology and outcomes of illnesses causing acute lung injury in a rural populace. Study Design. A prospective observational study. Setting. Medical ICU of a teaching hospital in a rural-urban fringe location. Patients. Patients ≥13 years, admitted between December 2011 and May 2013, satisfying AECC criteria for ALI/ARDS. Results. Study had 61 patients; 46 had acute lung injury at admission. Scrub typhus was the commonest cause (7/61) and tropical infections contributed to 26% of total cases. Increasing ARDS severity was associated with older age, higher FiO2 and APACHE/SOFA scores, and longer duration of ventilation. Nonsurvivors were generally older, had shorter duration of illness, a nontropical infection, and higher total WBC counts, required longer duration of ventilation, and had other organ dysfunction and higher mean APACHE scores. The mortality rate of ARDS was 36.6% (22/61) in our study. Conclusion. Tropical infections form a major etiological component of acute lung injury in a developing country like India. Etiology and outcomes of ARDS may vary depending upon the geographic location and seasonal illnesses.","George, Tarun; Viswanathan, Stalin; Karnam, Ali Hasan Faiz; Abraham, Georgi",Critical care research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/181593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24660060/,667

Detailed anatomical knowledge of the infra-pyloric vein (IPV) remains obscure. In this study, the aim was to classify the IPV vessel flow. METHODS From April 2009 to November 2012, 43 patients with clinical T1 gastric cancer underwent LAPPG with preservation of IPV. Operative videos were retrospectively reviewed, and an anatomical classification of IPV was proposed. RESULTS The IPV flow came into the right gastro-epiploic vein (RGEV) and/or the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal vein (ASPDV). The IPV anatomical flow pattern was classified according to the following 4 types: Type I, the IPV more than 2 flow into RGEV; Type IIa, only 1 IPV into RGEV without into ASPDV; Type IIb, one IPV flow into RGEV and one flow into ASPDV; Type III, IPV only into ASPDV. The proportion of each type was 39.5% (17/43) in Type I, 30.2% (13/43) in Type IIa, 14% (6/43) in Type IIb, and 16.3% (7/43) in Type III. CONCLUSIONS The anatomical flow pattern of the IPV was described. It would be beneficial to improve the anatomical knowledge of the IPV for more elaborate and safer lymph node dissection during laparoscopic gastrectomy.","Nishizawa, Nobuyuki; Yamashita, Keishi; Shinohara, Hisashi; Sakuramoto, Shinichi; Hosoda, Kei; Watanabe, Masahiko",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000445069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27119742/,667

However, empirical evidence around its effectiveness lacks clarity. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of goal-setting interventions on diabetes outcomes and to determine which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are frequently used within these interventions. METHODS A systematic search identified 14 studies, describing 12 interventions targeting diabetic-control which incorporated goal-setting as the main intervention strategy. Study characteristics, outcome measures and effect sizes of the included studies were extracted and checked by two authors. The BCT taxonomy v1 was used to identify intervention content. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome of average blood glucose levels (HbA1c) and on body-weight. Psycho-social and behavioural outcomes were summarised in narrative syntheses. RESULTS Significant post-intervention improvements in HbA1C were found (-.22, 95% CI, -.40, -.04) across studies. No other main effects were identified. The BCT 'goal-setting (behaviour)' was most frequently implemented and was identified in 84% of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS Goal-setting interventions appear to be associated with reduced HbA1C levels. However, the low numbers of studies identified and the risk biases across studies suggest more research is needed to further explore goal-setting BCTs in diabetes self-management.","Fredrix, Milou; McSharry, Jenny; Flannery, Caragh; Dinneen, Sean; Byrne, Molly",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2018.1432760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498547/,667

Many of these cell activities involve cell-cell interactions and remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Here, we analyze the requirement for Rasip1 (Ras-interacting protein 1), an endothelial-specific regulator of junctional dynamics, during blood vessel formation. Phenotype analysis of rasip1 mutants in zebrafish embryos reveals distinct functions of Rasip1 during sprouting angiogenesis, anastomosis and lumen formation. During angiogenic sprouting, loss of Rasip1 causes cell pairing defects due to a destabilization of tricellular junctions, indicating that stable tricellular junctions are essential to maintain multicellular organization within the sprout. During anastomosis, Rasip1 is required to establish a stable apical membrane compartment; rasip1 mutants display ectopic, reticulated junctions and the apical compartment is frequently collapsed. Loss of Ccm1 and Heg1 function mimics the junctional defects of rasip1 mutants. Furthermore, downregulation of ccm1 and heg1 leads to a delocalization of Rasip1 at cell junctions, indicating that junctional tethering of Rasip1 is required for its function in junction formation and stabilization during sprouting angiogenesis.","Lee, Minkyoung; Betz, Charles; Yin, Jianmin; Paatero, Ilkka; Schellinx, Niels; Carte, Adam N; Wilson, Christopher W; Ye, Weilan; Affolter, Markus; Belting, Heinz-Georg",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.197509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383884/,667

From 2013 to December 2019, 1568 cases have been reported with 616 deaths. H7N9 infection has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and vaccination is currently the most effective way to prevent infections and consequently flu-related severe illness. Developing and producing vaccines against pandemic influenza viruses is the main strategy for a response to a possible pandemic. This study aims to present the production of three industrial lots under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) of the active antigen used to produce the pandemic influenza vaccine candidate against A(H7N9). These batches were characterized and evaluated for quality standards and tested for immunogenicity in mice. The average yield was 173.50 ± 7.88 μg/mL of hemagglutinin and all the preparations met all the required specifications. The formulated H7N9 vaccine is poorly immunogenic and needs to be adjuvanted with an oil in water emulsion adjuvant (IB160) to achieve a best immune response, in a prime and in a boost scheme.

Hospitals face increasing risk of periods of scarcity of life-sustaining resources such as ventilators for mechanical respiratory support, as has been the case in Italy as of March, 2020. The National Academy of Medicine has provided guidance on crisis standards of care, which call for the reallocation of scarce medical resources to those who will benefit most during extreme situations. Given that this will require a departure from the usual fiduciary duty of the bedside clinician, we determined and mapped potential barriers to the implementation of the guidelines from stakeholders using an implementation science framework. Methods: A protocol was created to operationalize national and state guidelines for triaging ventilators during crisis conditions. Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted from July-September 2018 with clinicians at three acute care hospitals of an urban academic medical center. Respiratory therapists, intensivists, nursing leadership and the palliative care interdisciplinary team participated in focus groups. Key informant interviews were conducted with emergency management, respiratory therapy and emergency medicine. Subjects were presented the protocol and their reflections were elicited using a semi-structured interview guide. Data from transcripts and notes were categorized using a coding strategy based on the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results: Participants anticipated that implementing this protocol would challenge their roles and identities as clinicians including both their fiduciary duty to the patient and their decision-making autonomy. Despite this, many participants acknowledged the need for such a protocol to standardize care and minimize bias as well as to mitigate potential consequences for individual clinicians. Participants identified the question of considering patient quality of life in triage decisions as an important and unresolved ethical issue in disaster triage. Conclusion: Clinicians' discomfort with shifting roles and obligations could pose implementation barriers for crisis standards of care.","Chuang, Elizabeth; Cuartas, Pablo A; Powell, Tia; Gong, Michelle Ng",AJOB empirical bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1080/23294515.2020.1759731; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32369433/,667

Results from the LigaLongo Trial comparing transanal Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation with mucopexy and circular stapled hemorrhoidopexy.,2018,"OBJECTIVES In this literature review, we discuss 2 system-level, nurse-targeted patient safety practices (PSPs) that aim to reduce medication errors associated with infusion pumps, including smart pumps. One practice focuses on implementing structured process changes and redesigning workflows to improve efficiencies with pump use. The other focuses on investing in initial and ongoing staff training on the correct use, maintenance, and monitoring of infusion pumps. METHODS Two databases were searched for ""infusion pumps"" and related synonyms, along with relevant terms for each PSP. Articles were excluded if outcomes were not directly relevant to the PSP addressed in this review, the article was out of scope, or study design was insufficiently described. RESULTS Limited research was found on best practices for reducing errors and improving infusion pump use through workflow and process changes, as well as education and training. Four studies reported medication administration errors, procedural errors, or deviations from hospital policy as clinical outcomes of workflow or process changes. Mixed results were found examining process outcomes related to pump handling. Education on the correct use of smart pumps was found to decrease medication errors and adverse drug events, and 2 studies found an increase in nurses' adherence to using the medication safety software library as a result of education. CONCLUSIONS Standardization of process and integration of technology and workflows were found as facilitators. Type and content of education provided were identified as facilitators, whereas time and energy constraints on nurse educators can be barriers to implementing large hospital-wide education programs.","Bacon, Olivia; Hoffman, Lynn",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810000/,667
81017,"""Obama system:"" a new easy, safe, and economical technique for laparoscopic single-port surgery.",2012,"Autonomous vehicles are expected to take complete control of the driving process, enabling the former drivers to act as passengers only. This could lead to increased sickness as they can be engaged in tasks other than driving. Adopting different sickness mitigation techniques gives us unique types of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles to be studied. In this paper, we report on a study where we explored the possibilities of assessing motion sickness with electrogastrography (EGG), a non-invasive method used to measure the myoelectric activity of the stomach, and its potential usage in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator with a virtual reality (VR) headset. There separate EGG measurements were performed: before, during and after the driving AV simulation video in VR. During the driving, the participants encountered two driving environments: a straight and less dynamic highway road and a highly dynamic and curvy countryside road. The EGG signal was recorded with a proprietary 3-channel recording device and Ag/AgCl cutaneous electrodes. In addition, participants were asked to signalize whenever they felt uncomfortable and nauseated by pressing a special button. After the drive they completed also the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and reported on their overall subjective perception of sickness symptoms. The EGG results showed a significant increase of the dominant frequency (DF) and the percentage of the high power spectrum density (FSD) as well as a significant decrease of the power spectrum density Crest factor (CF) during the AV simulation. The vast majority of participants reported nausea during more dynamic conditions, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and the RMS value of EGG. Reported nausea occurred simultaneously with the increase in EGG amplitude. Based on the results, we conclude that EGG could be used for assessment of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles. DF, CF and FSD can be used as overall sickness indicators, while the relative increase in amplitude of EGG signal and duration of that increase can be used as short-term sickness indicators where the driving environment may affect the driver.","Gruden, Timotej; Popović, Nenad B; Stojmenova, Kristina; Jakus, Grega; Miljković, Nadica; Tomažič, Sašo; Sodnik, Jaka",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21020550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466805/,667

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 459 opioid-tolerant adults with chronic moderate to severe low back pain participated in an open-label, 2- to 4-week conversion/titration phase of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial, conducted at 70 centers in the United States. Patients were converted to once-daily OROS hydromorphone ER at 75% of the equianalgesic dose of their prior total daily opioid dose (5:1 conversion ratio), and titrated as frequently as every 3 days to a maximum dose of 64 mg/day. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity numeric rating scale; additional assessments included the Patient Global Assessment and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. Safety assessments were performed at each visit and consisted of recording and monitoring all adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs. RESULTS Mean (standard deviation) final daily dose of OROS hydromorphone ER was 37.5 (17.8) mg. Mean (standard error of the mean [SEM]) numeric rating scale scores decreased from 6.6 (0.1) at screening to 4.3 (0.1) at the final titration visit (mean [SEM] change, -2.3 [0.1], representing a 34.8% reduction). Mean (SEM) change in Patient Global Assessment was -0.6 (0.1), and mean change (SEM) in the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire was -2.8 (0.3). Patients achieving a stable dose showed greater improvement than patients who discontinued during titration for each of these measures (P < 0.001). Almost 80% of patients achieving a stable dose (213/268) had a ≥30% reduction in pain. Commonly reported AEs were constipation (15.4%), nausea (11.9%), somnolence (8.7%), headache (7.8%), and vomiting (6.5%); 13.0% discontinued from the study due to AEs. CONCLUSION The majority of opioid-tolerant patients with chronic low back pain were successfully converted to effective doses of OROS hydromorphone ER within 2 to 4 weeks.","Hale, Martin E; Nalamachu, Srinivas R; Khan, Arif; Kutch, Michael",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s39980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658495/,667

The layer dependent inhibitory effect of graphene nanosheets on spike receptor-binding domain of 6LZG, complexed with host receptor i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated through computational study. Graphene sample was synthesized using mechanical exfoliation with shear stress and its mechanism of inhibition towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus was explored by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method. The thermodynamics study for the free binding energy of graphene towards the SARS-CoV-2 virus was analyzed. The binding energy of graphene towards the virus increased with an increasing number of layers. It shows the highest affinity of -17.5 Kcal/mol in molecular docking while ΔGbinding is in the order of -28.01 ± 0.04 5 Kcal/mol for the seven-layers structure. The increase in carbon layers is associated with an increasing number of edge sp3 -type carbon, providing greater curvature, further increase the surface reactivity responsible for high binding efficiency. The MD simulation data reveals the high inhibition efficiency of the synthesized graphene towards SARS-CoV-2 virus which would help to design future in-vitro studies.

81666,Laparoscopic resection of large gastric GISTs: feasibility and long-term results.,2014,"OBJECTIVES Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by infection with feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoV is incredibly contagious and transmission is via the faecal-oral route. FCoV infection, and therefore FIP, is most common in breeder and rescue catteries, where many cats are kept indoors, using litter trays. Whether it is possible to break the cycle of FCoV infection and re-infection using cat litters has never been investigated. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of cat litters on FCoV infectivity and virus load in multi-cat households, and transmission frequency. METHODS Fifteen cat litters were mixed and incubated with FCoV, centrifuged and the supernatants tested in vitro for the ability to prevent virus infection of cell culture. To test applicability of in vitro results to real life, virus load was measured in two households in a double crossover study of four Fuller's earth-based cat litters by testing rectal swabs using FCoV reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS Four litters abrogated FCoV infection of cell culture, nine reduced it to a greater or lesser extent and two had no effect. One brand had different virus inhibitory properties depending on where it was manufactured. Fuller's earth-based litters performed best, presumably by adsorbing virus. In the field study, there appeared to be less virus shedding on one Fuller's earth-based cat litter. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The in vitro study successfully identified cat litters that inactivate FCoV; such litters exist so do not need to be developed. Fuller's earth-based litters best prevented infection of cell culture, but did not completely abrogate FCoV transmission in two multi-cat households. A dust-free clumping Fuller's earth litter appeared to fare best, but virus shedding also varied on the control litters, complicating interpretation. Sawdust-based cat litters are not useful in FCoV-endemic households because they track badly and have a poor effect on virus infection.","Addie, Diane; Houe, Lene; Maitland, Kirsty; Passantino, Giuseppe; Decaro, Nicola",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x19848167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094626/,667

The anatomy of the right posterior Glissonean pedicle and the caudal view of laparoscopy make such resections suitable for the Glissonean pedicle-first approach. METHODS The study population included all consecutive patients treated with laparoscopic liver resection from August 2019 to February 2020. The approach is based on the ultrasonographic identification of the right posterior or segmental pedicle from the dorsal side of the liver after complete mobilization. The pedicle of interest is isolated through mini-hepatotomy and clamped. The segment anatomy is defined by ischemia. The transection starts from the ventral side, close to the right hepatic vein that is exposed and followed craniocaudally. RESULTS Ten patients underwent anatomical laparoscopic resection of right posterolateral segments. There were 7 colorectal liver metastases, 2 hepatocellular carcinoma, and 1 biliary cysto-adenoma. Five patients underwent Sg7 resection, one patient underwent a Sg7 subsegmentectomy, and 4 underwent Sg6-7 bisegmentectomy. The Glissonean pedicle-first approach was feasible in eight patients. The craniocaudal approach to the RHV was feasible in six patients, not indicated in three cases and was abandoned in one patient for technical difficulty. There was no operative morbidity or mortality. Median post-operative hospital stay was 5 days. CONCLUSIONS The Glissonean pedicle-first approach is safe and effective for laparoscopic anatomic resections of the right posterior sector. The craniocaudal approach to right hepatic vein from the ventral side is a convenient procedure to follow the segmental anatomy deep in the parenchyma.","Ferrero, Alessandro; Lo Tesoriere, Roberto; Giovanardi, Francesco; Langella, Serena; Forchino, Fabio; Russolillo, Nadia",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07916-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833101/,667

First results of a prospective study.,2015,"OBJECTIVE To compare two suturing techniques for prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy in healthy dogs. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Thirty healthy client-owned dogs from breeds predisposed to gastric dilation volvulus. METHODS Medical records of dogs presented for prophylactic laparoscopic gastropexy performed with knotless unidirectional barbed suture were reviewed. Dogs were grouped based on the device used for suturing, consisting of an endoscopic needle driver (END) vs an endoscopic suturing device (ESD). Signalment, weight, surgery time, number of suture bites per side of gastropexy, and intraoperative complications were compared between groups. RESULTS The END group consisted of 10 dogs, with a median age of 1.09 years (range 0.5-2.67), weight of 41.5 kg (range 25-66), surgical time of 49.5 minutes (range 35-77), and a median of 5 suture bites per side (range 4-6). The ESD group included 20 dogs, with a median age of 1.75 years (range 0.6-8.75, P = .0944), weight was 37.5 kg (range 20-62, P = .5823), surgical time of 55 minutes (range 30-76, P = .808), and a median of 6 suture bites for the first side (range 4-7, P = .072) and 7 for the second side (range 4-8, P = .003). No major complications and no conversion to open celiotomy occured in either group. Minor complications occurred in 3 dogs in the ESD group, all related to device dysfunction and suture breakage.

The current review sought to examine barriers of social participation more broadly, as well as potential facilitators.Methods: We conducted a systematic review to collate identified barriers and facilitators to social participation in older adults. Seventy-six studies were eligible for inclusion.Results: Four main themes of barriers and facilitators to social participation associated with aging emerged: Demographic factors (such as age and socioeconomic status), Individual/Internal factors (such as motivations and health), Environmental/Infrastructure (such as accessibility, transport, and neighborhood cohesion), and Social Networks (particularly preexisting network size).Conclusions: These findings extended previous reviews to show that personal motivations, preexisting social networks, and neighborhood cohesion play vital roles in improving and maintaining quality social participation. The ability to facilitate this can occur at the individual therapeutic level and at the community level. Clinical implications: The findings highlight the need to consider barriers beyond logistical issues. In particular, healthy aging initiatives may benefit from matching social activities with individual motivations, and preventive measures to establish social networks early in the aging process are important.","Townsend, Braedon G; Chen, Jessamine T-H; Wuthrich, Viviana M",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2020.1863890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393443/,667

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study included patients with a clinical history of hip pain. All hip joints with evidence of quadratus femoris muscle edema on MR images were included in the ischiofemoral impingement patient group. An age- and sex-matched control group was derived from the same cohort by propensity score matching. On radiographs, two readers independently measured the following parameters: ischiofemoral space, quadratus femoris space, hamstring tendon area, ischiofemoral distance on supine radiograph, ischiofemoral distance on standing radiograph, and femoral neck-shaft angle. Group differences in parameters were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test. The intraclass correlation coefficient and the ROC AUC were obtained. Correlations between radiographic and MRI measures were assessed with Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman plot analyses. The Youden J index was used to select optimum cutoff points for each parameter. RESULTS There were 30 patients (44 hip joints; mean age, 54.8 ± 11 years) in the ischiofemoral impingement group and 88 patients (88 hip joints; mean age, 51.8 ± 13.4 years) in the control group. There were significant group differences in ischiofemoral space, quadratus femoris space, ischiofemoral distance on supine radiograph, ischiofemoral distance on standing radiograph, and neck-shaft angle (p < 0.05). Ischiofemoral distance on supine and standing radiographs exhibited good discriminative ability (AUC > 0.80). The optimal cutoff points for ischiofemoral distances on supine and standing radiographs were 19.9 and 19.1 mm for reader 1 and 21.1 and 17.0 mm for reader 2. Ischiofemoral space, quadratus femoris space, ischiofemoral distance on supine radiograph, and ischiofemoral distance on standing radiograph exhibited nearly perfect interobserver agreement (r > 0.8). CONCLUSION Ischiofemoral distances on supine and standing hip radiographs had good diagnostic performance and can be used as a screening tool, with optimal cutoff points.","Park, Sunghoon; Lee, Hyun Young; Cuong, Pham Manh; Won, Ye-Yeon; Ji, Hyung-Min; Yoon, Seung-Hyun; Kwack, Kyu-Sung",AJR.

82725,Rationale for the fundamental use of surgical Energy™ (FUSE) curriculum assessment: focus on safety.,2013,"BACKGROUND As a result of the growing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for treating malignancy, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been increasingly reported. Higher body mass index (BMI) has been highlighted as a potential risk factor for the development of irAEs. However, there are no meta-analyses summarizing the association between BMI and irAEs in patients on ICI therapies. METHODS PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and grey literature were searched up to January 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) 95% and confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity test, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (number registration: CRD42020168790). RESULTS Five studies (n = 1937) met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Being overweight or obese was associated with an increased odds of developing irAEs (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.70-4.03, P ≤ 0.00001, I2 = 53%). In subgroup analyses, higher BMI was associated with irAEs in patients using anti-CTLA-4 single agents or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.17-2.98, P = 0.009, I2 = 0%) and in patients using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 3.22, 95% CI 2.06-5.01, P = 0.00001, I2 = 32%) monotherapy. The increased odds of irAEs in patients with higher BMI was comparable (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.72, I2 = 0%) between studies with adjusted OR (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.44-3.38, P = 0.0003, I2 = 4%) and unadjusted OR (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08-6.50, P = 0.03, I2 = 66%). CONCLUSION Our meta-analysis provides evidence of a relationship between higher BMI (overweight-obesity) and increased risk of irAEs in patients on ICI therapies.

82855,Novel clip applicator for minimally invasive surgery.,2019,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a vital interface that supports normal brain functions. Endothelial cells (ECs) are the main component of the BBB and are highly specialized to govern the transfer of substances into brain. The EC lumen is enmeshed with an extracellular matrix (ECM), known as the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL). The lumen-facing EGL is primarily comprised of proteoglycans (PGs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which function as the first line of defense for blood-to-brain transfer of substances. Circulating factors must first penetrate the EGL before interacting with the EC. The abundance and composition of the PG and GAGs can dictate EGL function, and determine which circulating substances communicate with the ECs. The EGL can interact with circulating factors through physio-chemical interactions with the EC. Some disease states reveal a ""thinning"" of the EGL that may increase EC interactions with components of the systemic circulation and alter BBB function. EGL changes may also contribute to the cognitive complications of systemic diseases, such as sepsis and diabetes. For decades, researchers have measured how genetic and environmental factors influence the peripheral EGL constituents; however, much less is known about the neurovascular EGL. In this mini-review, we introduce components of the EGL and innovative ways to measure their abundance and composition that may contribute to BBB dysfunction.","Logsdon, Aric F; Rhea, Elizabeth M; Reed, May; Banks, William A; Erickson, Michelle A",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220977195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302738/,667

83181,Liver abscess as a complication of laparoscopic gastric banding bariatric surgery.,2013,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this review is to identify best evidence to define rehabilitative approaches to acute and post-acute phases of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease. METHODS A literature search (of PubMed, Google Scholar, PEDro and Cochrane databases) was performed for relevant publications from January to April 2020. RESULTS A total of 2,835 articles were retrieved, and the search resulted in a final total 31 published articles. A narrative synthesis of the selected articles was then performed. CONCLUSION For COVID-19 patients, an integrated rehabilitative process is recommended, involving a multidisciplinary and multi-professional team providing neuromuscular, cardiac, respiratory, and swallowing interventions, and psychological support, in order to improve patients' quality of life. The intervention of a physician expert in rehabilitation should be taken into consideration, and a dedicated intervention set up after thorough assessment of the patient's clinical condition, in collaboration with all rehabilitation team professionals.","Agostini, Francesco; Mangone, Massimiliano; Ruiu, Pierangela; Paolucci, Teresa; Santilli, Valter; Bernetti, Andrea",Journal of rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.2340/16501977-2776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284353/,667
83284,Is current surgery resident and GI fellow training adequate to pass FES?,2017,"Specifically designed gene expression studies can be used to prioritize candidate genes and identify novel biomarkers affecting resilience against mastitis and other diseases in dairy cattle. The primary goal of this study was to assess whether specific peripheral leukocyte genes expressed differentially in a previous study of dairy cattle with postpartum disease, also would be expressed differentially in peripheral leukocytes from a diverse set of different dairy cattle with moderate to severe clinical mastitis. Four genes were selected for this study due to their differential expression in a previous transcriptomic analysis of circulating leukocytes from dairy cows with and without evidence of early postpartum disease. An additional 15 genes were included based on their cellular, immunologic, and inflammatory functions associated with resistance and tolerance to mastitis. This fixed cohort study was conducted on a conventional dairy in Washington state. Cows >50 days in milk (DIM) with mastitis (n = 12) were enrolled along with healthy cows (n = 8) selected to match the DIM and lactation numbers of mastitic cows. Blood was collected for a complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemistry, leukocyte isolation, and RNA extraction on the day of enrollment and twice more at 6 to 8-days intervals. Latent class analysis was performed to discriminate healthy vs. mastitic cows and to describe disease resolution. RNA samples were processed by the Primate Diagnostic Services Laboratory (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Gene expression analysis was performed using the Nanostring System (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, Washington, USA). Of the four genes (C5AR1, CATHL6, LCN2, and PGLYRP1) with evidence of upregulation in cows with mastitis, three of those genes (CATHL6, LCN2, and PGLYRP1) were investigated due to their previously identified association with postpartum disease. These genes are responsible for immunomodulatory molecules that selectively enhance or alter host innate immune defense mechanisms and modulate pathogen-induced inflammatory responses. Although further research is warranted to explain their functional mechanisms and bioactivity in cattle, our findings suggest that these conserved elements of innate immunity have the potential to bridge disease states and target tissues in diverse dairy populations.","McConnel, Craig S; Crisp, Sierra A; Biggs, Tyler D; Ficklin, Stephen P; Parrish, Lindsay M; Trombetta, Sophie C; Sischo, William M; Adams-Progar, Amber",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.559279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195534/,667

We aimed to identify the risk factors for in-hospital fatal outcome and severe pneumonia of this disease.This is a retrospective, multicentre study, which included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 with definite outcomes (died or discharged) hospitalized between January 1st and March 4th 2020 in Wuhan. Of all 665 patients included: 70 died, 595 discharged (including 333 mild and 262 severe cases). Underlying comorbidity was more commonly observed among deaths (72.9%) than mild (26.4%) and severe (61.5%) survivors, with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular as dominant diseases. Fever and cough were the primary clinical magnifications. Older age (≥ 65 years) (OR=3.174, 95% CI=1.356-7.755), diabetes (OR=2.540, 95% CI=0.995-6.377), dyspnea (OR=7.478, 95% CI=3.031-19.528), respiratory failure (OR=10.528, 95% CI= 4.484-25.829), acute cardiac injury (OR=25.103, 95% CI=9.057-76.590), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR=7.308, 95% CI=1.501-46.348) were associated with in-hospital fatal outcome.

This article discusses recent literature documenting the impact of racism on early childhood development, disparities in access to developmental services and ways healthcare providers and health systems can promote physician well being during these difficult times. RECENT FINDINGS Exposure to racism begins prenatally, and early childhood experiences with racism are intimately tied to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Early intervention is key to treating children with developmental delay, but disparities exist in accessing eligibility screening and in the provision of services. Paediatric providers are at risk of developing secondary traumatic stress and burnout, which may affect the care that they provide. SUMMARY New research has led to the development of resources that help paediatric providers address racism, access developmental resources in a novel manner and protect the paediatric workforce from trauma and burnout.","Brodie, Nicola; Perdomo, Joanna E; Silberholz, Elizabeth A",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394742/,667

AIMS To identify children and young people's reported concerns or needs in relation to using health technologies to self-manage long-term conditions. METHODS A scoping review was conducted. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL in February 2019. Searches were limited to papers published between January 2008 and February 2019. We included any health technology used to manage long-term conditions. A thematic synthesis of the data from the included studies was undertaken. We engaged children with long-term conditions (and parents) to support review design, interpretation of findings and development of recommendations. RESULTS Thirty-eight journal articles were included, describing concerns or needs expressed by n=970 children and/or young people aged 5-18 years. Most included studies were undertaken in high-income countries with children aged 11 years and older. Studies examined concerns with mobile applications (n=14), internet (n=9), social media (n=3), interactive online treatment programmes (n=3), telehealth (n=1), devices (n=3) or a combination (n=5). Children and young people's main concerns were labelling and identity; accessibility; privacy and reliability; and trustworthiness of information. DISCUSSION This review highlights important concerns that children and young people may have before using technology to self-manage their long-term condition. In future, research should involve children and young people throughout the development of technology, from identifying their unmet needs through to design and evaluation of interventions.","Blower, Sarah; Swallow, Veronica; Maturana, Camila; Stones, Simon; Phillips, Robert; Dimitri, Paul; Marshman, Zoe; Knapp, Peter; Dean, Alexandra; Higgins, Steven; Kellar, Ian; Curtis, Penny; Mills, Nathaniel; Martin-Kerry, Jacqueline",Archives of disease in childhood,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-319103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444448/,667
83907,Laparo-endoscopic single-site (LESS) radical nephrectomy with renal vein thrombectomy: initial report.,2010,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Achalasia is a disorder of esophageal motility with a reported incidence of 0.5 to 1.6 per 100,000 persons per year in Europe, Asia, Canada, and America. However, estimates of incidence values have been derived predominantly from retrospective searches of databases of hospital discharge codes and personal communications with gastroenterologists, and are likely to be incorrect. We performed a cohort study based on esophageal manometry findings to determine the incidence of achalasia in South Australia. METHODS We collected data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the South Australian population. Cases of achalasia diagnosed by esophageal manometry were identified from the 3 adult manometry laboratory databases in South Australia. Endoscopy reports and case notes were reviewed for correlations with diagnoses. The annual incidence of achalasia in the South Australian population was calculated for the decade 2004 to 2013. Findings were standardized to those of the European Standard Population based on age. RESULTS The annual incidence of achalasia in South Australia ranged from 2.3 to 2.8 per 100,000 persons. The mean age at diagnosis was 62.1 ± 18.1 years. The incidence of achalasia increased with age (Spearman rho, 0.95; P < .01). The age-standardized incidence ranged from 2.1 (95% CI, 1.8-2.3) to 2.5 (95% CI, 2.2-2.7). CONCLUSIONS Based on a cohort study of esophageal manometry, we determined the incidence of achalasia in South Australia to be 2.3 to 2.8 per 100,000 persons and to increase with age. South Australia's relative geographic isolation and the population's access to manometry allowed for more accurate identification of cases than hospital code analyses, with a low probability of missed cases.","Duffield, Jaime A; Hamer, Peter W; Heddle, Richard; Holloway, Richard H; Myers, Jennifer C; Thompson, Sarah K",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2016.05.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266979/,667
83969,Recognition of sentience.,2020-12-19,"Human memory T cells that cross-react with epitopes from unrelated viruses can potentially modulate immune responses to subsequent infections by a phenomenon termed heterologous immunity. However, it is unclear whether similarities in structure rather than sequence underpin heterologous T cell cross-reactivity. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism of heterologous immunity involving immunodominant epitopes derived from common viruses restricted to high-frequency HLA allotypes (HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -B*08:01). We examined EBV-specific memory T cells for their ability to cross-react with CMV or influenza A virus-derived epitopes. Following T cell immunoassays to determine phenotype and function, complemented with biophysical and structural investigations of peptide/HLA complexes, we did not detect cross-reactivity of EBV-specific memory T cells toward either CMV or influenza A virus epitopes presented by any of the selected HLA allomorphs. Thus, despite the ubiquitous nature of these human viruses and the dominant immune response directed toward the selected epitopes, heterologous virus-specific T cell cross-reactivity was not detected. This suggests that either heterologous immunity is not as common as previously reported, or that it requires a very specific biological context to develop and be clinically relevant.","Rowntree, Louise C; Nguyen, Thi H O; Halim, Hanim; Purcell, Anthony W; Rossjohn, Jamie; Gras, Stephanie; Kotsimbos, Tom C; Mifsud, Nicole A",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29735483/,667
84017,Advice and guidance on coronavirus.,2020-02-22,"While the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) with radiotherapy (RT) is complemented more and more by immunotherapy in clinical trials, little is known about the impact of the human papillomavirus (HPV) status or the applied RT scheme on the immune phenotype of the tumor cells. Therefore, we aimed to examine the impact of the HPV status of four human HNSCC cell lines on cell death and the expression of immune checkpoint molecules (ICMs) after RT with either hypofractionation irradiation (5x3.0Gy) or a high single dose (1x19.3Gy) via multicolor flow cytometry and quantitative PCR at an early time point after therapy. In our study, 5x3.0Gy RT induced high numbers of early and late apoptotic cells independent of the HPV status, but necrosis was only increased in the HPV-positive UM-Scc-47 cells. Generally, the immune stimulatory ICMs (CD70, CD137-L, ICOS-L) were less affected by RT compared to the immune suppressive ones (PD-L1, PD-L2, and the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM)). A significant higher surface expression of the analyzed ICMs was found after hypofractionated RT compared to a single high dose; however, regardless of the HPV status, with the exception of ICOS-L. Here, HPV-positive HNSCC tumor cells showed a stronger response to 5x3.0Gy than HPV-negative ones. On the RNA level, only minor alterations of ICMs were observed following RT, with the exception of the HPV negative cell line CAL33 treated with 5x3.0Gy, where PD-L2, HVEM and CD70 were significantly increased. We conclude that the HPV status may not distinctly predict immunological responses following RT, and thus cannot be used as a single predictive marker for therapy responses in HNSCC. In contrast, the patient-specific individual expression of ICMs following RT is preferable for the targeted patient selection for immune therapy directed against distinct ICM.","Wimmer, Sebastian; Deloch, Lisa; Hader, Michael; Derer, Anja; Grottker, Fridolin; Weissmann, Thomas; Hecht, Markus; Gostian, Antoniu-Oreste; Fietkau, Rainer; Frey, Benjamin; Gaipl, Udo S",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22179114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502022/,667

ECA has been preferred over curettage adenoidectomy due to its lower intraoperative bleeding rates, decreased procedure time, and higher subjective success. However, post-ECA symptoms of pain and halitosis have never been studied. The objective of our study was to identify the pattern of post-ECA halitosis and pain in the paediatric population. Materials and Methods: This is a single centre, prospective observational study that uses visual analogue scales (VAS) by parent proxy to assess post-ECA pain and halitosis in paediatric patients (age < 18) in South Australia. A total of 19 patients were enrolled in the study and followed for seven days. Results: Postoperative pain and halitosis reaches a peak 3 days post-ECA (median = 2 for pain; median = 6 for halitosis) but resolves 7 days post-ECA (median = 0 for both). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that halitosis and pain occur over a seven-day period in patients undergoing ECA and will resolve post-operatively with simple analgesia and without antibiotics.","Soumya, S; Vissapragada, Ravi; Le, Julie; Ooi, Eng H",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina55060312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242702/,667

The resulting 3D models are based on a few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge available about the biological entity, represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new visual-programming technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we determine the statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, the spatial properties, and the distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in the construction of the 3D model. Once all the imaging evidence is incorporated into the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining the rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, and their distances and orientations relative to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization as a visual-programming feedback loop. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virion ultrastructure.

The role of flow-diverting devices in treating ruptured aneurysms is less clear. PURPOSE To estimate rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting devices. DATA SOURCES Systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane databases, and EMBASE from inception to December 2015 for articles that included ruptured aneurysms treated with flow diversion. STUDY SELECTION One hundred seventy-two records were screened, of which 20 articles contained sufficient patient and outcome data for inclusion. DATA ANALYSIS Clinical and radiologic characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes were extracted from these reports. Aggregated occlusion rates and clinical outcomes were analyzed by using the Fisher exact test (statistical significance, α = .05). DATA SYNTHESIS Complete occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved in 90% of patients, and favorable clinical outcome was attained in 81%. Aneurysm size greater than 7 mm was associated with less favorable clinical outcomes (P = .027). Aneurysm size greater than 2 cm was associated with a greater risk of rerupture after treatment (P < .001). LIMITATIONS Observational studies and case reports may be affected by reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS Although not recommended as a first-line treatment, the use of flow diverters to treat ruptured intracranial aneurysms may allow high rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in carefully selected patients. Aneurysm size contributes to treatment risk because the rerupture rate following treatment is higher for aneurysms larger than 2 cm.","Madaelil, T P; Moran, C J; Cross, D T; Kansagra, A P",AJNR.

Different coatings are used to improve polypropylene mesh properties. Collagen is a protein with unique biocompatibility and cell ingrowth enhancement potential. A novel acetic acid extracted collagen coating was developed to allow placement of polypropylene mesh in direct contact with viscera. The authors' aim was to evaluate the long-term influence of acetic acid extracted collagen coating on surgical aspects and biomechanical properties of polypropylene mesh implanted in direct contact with viscera, including complications, adhesions with viscera, strength of incorporation, and microscopic inflammatory reaction. METHODS Forty adult Wistar rats were divided into two groups: experimental (polypropylene mesh/acetic acid extracted collagen coating) and control (polypropylene mesh only). Astandardized procedure of mesh implantation was performed. Animals were killed 3 months after surgery and analyzed for complications, mesh area covered by adhesions, type of adhesions, strength of incorporation, and intensity of inflammatory response. RESULTS The mean adhesion area was lower for polypropylene mesh/acetic acid extracted collagen coating (14.5 percent versus 69.9 percent, p < 0.001). Adhesion severity was decreased in the experimental group: grades 0 and 1 were more frequent (p < 0.04 and p < 0.002, respectively) and grade 3 was less frequent (p < 0.0001). An association between adhesion area and severity was found (p < 0.0001). Complications, strength of incorporation, and intensity of inflammatory response to the mesh were similar. CONCLUSIONS Visceral adhesions to polypropylene mesh are significantly reduced because of acetic acid extracted collagen coating. The collagen coating does not increase complications or induce alterations of polypropylene mesh incorporation.","Lukasiewicz, Aleksander; Skopinska-Wisniewska, Joanna; Marszalek, Andrzej; Molski, Stanislaw; Drewa, Tomasz",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3182865d2c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23629112/,667

The causal agent is a negative-strand RNA virus 80-100 nm in diameter. It causes fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neural symptoms. The mortality rate of SFTS was 32.6% among 172 cases reported from 2012 to 2015 in South Korea. Thus, is necessary to develop an effective diagnostic method that selectively identifies the isolates circulating in South Korea. The real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay is a simple, rapid, and sensitive approach for molecular diagnosis. Here, we designed novel primers for this assay and found that the technique had very high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency.

85331,Reinforced staplers for distal pancreatectomy.,2017,"To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home orders. Numerous studies aim to estimate the effects of these policies. Many statistical and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated measurements, and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in the COVID-19 context. Although these methods are less common in epidemiology, epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities in studies of individual-level interventions. Target trial emulation emphasizes the need to carefully design a nonexperimental study in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome measurement-and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a similar careful approach to study design that we refer to as policy trial emulation. This approach is especially important when intervention timing varies across jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each treatment cohort (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from panel methods-with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics-can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often challenging.","Ben-Michael, Eli; Feller, Avi; Stuart, Elizabeth A",Epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000001369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001754/,667

85588,Semi-prone video-assisted thoracoscopy for the treatment of large infracarinal traction diverticula.,2019,"The failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been largely responsible for the existence of latent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reservoirs. The ""shock and kill"" strategy was confirmed to reactivate HIV-1 latent reservoirs by latency-reversing agents (LRAs) for accelerated HIV-1 clearance. However, a single LRA might be insufficient to induce HIV-1 reactivation from latency due to the complexity of the multiple signaling regulatory pathways that establish the HIV-1 latent reservoir. Therefore, combinations of LRAs or dual-mechanism LRAs are urgently needed to purge the latent reservoirs. We demonstrate here for the first time that a dual-target inhibitor with a specific suppressive effect on both BRD4 and TIP60, CPI-637, could reactivate latent HIV-1 in vitro by permitting Tat to bind positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and assembling Tat-super-elongation complex (SEC) formation. In addition, CPI-637-mediated TIP60 downregulation further stimulated BRD4 dissociation from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, allowing Tat to more effectively bind P-TEFb compared to BRD4 inhibition alone. Much more importantly, CPI-637 exerted a potent synergistic effect but alleviated global T cell activation and blocked viral spread to uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells with minimal cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that CPI-637 opens up the prospect of novel dual-target inhibitors for antagonizing HIV-1 latency and deserves further investigation for development as a promising LRA with a ""shock and kill"" strategy.","Zheng, Tengyi; Chen, Pei; Huang, Yifan; Qiu, Jiayin; Zhou, Chenliang; Wu, Ziyao; Li, Lin",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.686035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350133/,667
85616,Laparoscopic hand-assisted liver resection for tumours in the left lateral section.,2018,"STUDY OBJECTIVES To describe a technique to manually morcellate large uteri within a polyurethane endoscopic bag at the time of laparoscopic hysterectomy, and report perioperative outcomes from our 5 years of experience. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective review of all consecutive hysterectomies with uterine weight >500 g performed between January 2010 and December 2014 in which the uterus was manually morcellated within an endoscopic bag by either an abdominal or vaginal approach (Canadian Task Force Classification Level III). SETTING Tertiary care academic medical center. PATIENTS A total of 104 women with a uterine weight >500 g who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy using a manual morcellation technique. INTERVENTION Manual morcellation was done extracorporeally, within a partially exteriorized specimen bag, using a scalpel under direct visualization by the operating surgeon. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 104 laparoscopic hysterectomies were performed in women with a uterus weighing >500 g using a manual morcellation technique for specimen extraction. The median patient age was 48.1 years (range, 34-69 years), and the median body mass index was 31.0 kg/m(2) (range, 19.1-56.7 kg/m(2)). The median blood loss and specimen weight were 200 mL (range, 20-1200 mL) and 741.5 g (range, 500-1930 g), respectively. Morcellation was performed through an abdominal approach in 58.7% of the patients and through a vaginal approach in 41.3%. The median duration of morcellation was 14.8 minutes (range, 4.5-21.6 minutes) for the abdominal route and 11.7 minutes (range, 5.2-16.8 minutes) for the vaginal route. Occult malignancy was identified in 2 patients. There were no complications related to the morcellation technique or gross bag rupture. CONCLUSION Manual morcellation within an endoscopic bag allows for the extraction of large uteri without the use of a power morcellator. In our 5 years of experience, we have not experienced any incidence of gross spillage, visually noted bag rupture, or complications associated with our morcellation technique.","Serur, Eli; Zambrano, Nabila; Brown, Kevin; Clemetson, Emily; Lakhi, Nisha",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2016.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27058770/,667

85907,Single-port laparoscopic spleen preserving distal pancreatectomy.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Major causes of donor site morbidity after free flap harvest are lack of split-thickness skin graft (STSG) take and tendon exposure. Long-term cosmesis remains poor. AlloDerm has shown cosmetically better donor site healing, albeit prolonged healing. We sought to evaluate the use of STSG with AlloDerm compared with STSG alone. STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING Academic tertiary care medical center. METHODS AND SUBJECTS Institutional review board-approved study. Microvascular database queried from 2002 to 2012. Subjects with forearm free flaps and either AlloDerm + STSG or STSG alone for donor site reconstruction were included. Morbidity outcomes were compared. RESULTS Eighty patients (50 male, 30 female) received AlloDerm + STSG at the donor site. Major and minor donor site complications were 15.0% and 18.8% in the AlloDerm + STSG group compared with 10.2% and 16.9% in the STSG-only group (P = .30 and P = .72), respectively. Complete STSG loss (5.0% vs 3.0%, P = .48), tendon exposure (5.0% vs 5.4%, P = 1.0), functional impairment (2.5% vs 1.8%, P = .66), infection (8.8% vs 9.6%, P = 1.0), hematoma/seroma (5.0% vs 3.6%, P = .73), and paresthesia (1.3% vs 3.6%, P = .43) were not significant. No patients required a second STSG after loss in the AlloDerm + STSG group compared with 60% (P = .17). Cosmetic results were superior in the AlloDerm + STSG group as rated by the surgeon (3.5 vs 2.6, P = .03) and patients (3.7 vs 2.9, P = .05) on a scale of 1 to 5. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that the use of AlloDerm with STSG can provide thicker coverage of the forearm defect, with minimal donor site morbidity and superior cosmetic results compared with STSG alone.","Wester, Jacob L; Pittman, Amy L; Lindau, Robert H; Wax, Mark K",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599813513713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24270163/,667
86061,Fungal abortion in dairy cattle.,2020-04-18,"Acute viral infections typically generate functional effector CD8(+) T cells (TCD8) that aid in pathogen clearance. However, during acute viral lower respiratory infection, lung TCD8 are functionally impaired and do not optimally control viral replication. T cells also become unresponsive to Ag during chronic infections and cancer via signaling by inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). PD-1 also contributes to TCD8 impairment during viral lower respiratory infection, but how it regulates TCD8 impairment and the connection between this state and T cell exhaustion during chronic infections are unknown. In this study, we show that PD-1 operates in a cell-intrinsic manner to impair lung TCD8. In light of this, we compared global gene expression profiles of impaired epitope-specific lung TCD8 to functional spleen TCD8 in the same human metapneumovirus-infected mice. These two populations differentially regulate hundreds of genes, including the upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors by lung TCD8. We then compared the gene expression of TCD8 during human metapneumovirus infection to those in acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. We find that the immunophenotype of lung TCD8 more closely resembles T cell exhaustion late into chronic infection than do functional effector T cells arising early in acute infection. Finally, we demonstrate that trafficking to the infected lung alone is insufficient for TCD8 impairment or inhibitory receptor upregulation, but that viral Ag-induced TCR signaling is also required. Our results indicate that viral Ag in infected lungs rapidly induces an exhaustion-like state in lung TCD8 characterized by progressive functional impairment and upregulation of numerous inhibitory receptors.","Erickson, John J; Lu, Pengcheng; Wen, Sherry; Hastings, Andrew K; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Joyce, Sebastian; Shyr, Yu; Williams, John V",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1403004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26401005/,667
86149,Incidence and risk factors of incisional hernia formation following abdominal organ transplantation.,2015,"BACKGROUND Although an inverse relationship between body mass index (BMI) and Parkinson disease (PD) has been repeatedly reported, to our knowledge, the relationship between BMI and antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) has rarely been studied in patients with schizophrenia. Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMI and EPS in patients with schizophrenia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Using data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription Patterns for Antipsychotics (REAP-AP) study, we compared the prevalence of EPS in 1448 schizophrenia patients stratified as underweight, normal range, overweight pre-obese, overweight obese I, overweight obese II, and overweight obese III according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for body weight status, and with underweight, normal range, overweight at risk, overweight obese I, and overweight obese II according to the Asia-Pacific obesity classification. RESULTS In the first step of the WHO classification system for body weight status, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with greater rates of bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, and a lower rate of gait disturbance. In the second step of the Asia-Pacific obesity classification, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with a higher rate of muscle rigidity. CONCLUSION Findings of the present study consistently revealed that underweight was associated with a greater rate of muscle rigidity in a stepwise pattern among Asian patients with schizophrenia. Although the mechanism underlying the inverse relationship between BMI and muscle rigidity cannot be sufficiently explained, it is speculated that low BMI may contribute to the development of muscle rigidity regardless of antipsychotic ""typicality"" and dose in patients with schizophrenia.","Park, Seon-Cheol; Tripathi, Adarsh; Avasthi, Ajit; Grover, Sandeep; Tanra, Andi J; Kato, Takahiro A; Inada, Toshiya; Chee, Kok Yoon; Chong, Mian-Yoon; Yang, Shu-Yu; Lin, Sih-Ku; Sim, Kang; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Javed, Afzal; Sartorius, Norman; Shinfuku, Naotaka; Park, Yong Chon",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796782/,667

Three items from the IES were added to and one PSS item was removed from the PSS-10, creating a new PSS-12. Cronbach's α for the scale was 0.902 for faculty and 0.903 for students, indicating high internal consistency. Factor analyses also supported calculation of two subtotals similarly across groups. The PSS-12 is a valid instrument to measure perceived stress during a public health crisis, particularly among populations that already experience community health disparities.","Eubank, Jacob M; Burt, Kate G; Orazem, John",Journal of prevention & intervention in the community,https://doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2021.1908873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855930/,667

MATERIALS AND METHODS Single-center retrospective study. Patients with clinical suspicion and imaging diagnosis of osteoid osteoma were treated by CT-guided RFA using the same device with either a 7- or 10-mm active tip electrode. Specific precautions were applied in case of articular or spinal OO. Patients were contacted by phone to evaluate the long-term outcome in terms of pain, ability to perform daily activities (including sports), and long-term complications. Success was defined as the absence of residual pain and ability to perform daily activities normally. RESULTS From 2008 to 2015, 126 patients were treated by CT-guided RFA for OO in our institution. Mean patient age was 26.1 years (SD = 11, range 1-53); mean delay to diagnosis was 16.9 months (SD = 15.2, range 1-120). Among patients who answered the follow-up call (n = 88), the overall success rate was 94.3%: 79/88 (89.8%) had primary success of the procedure, and 4/88 (4.5%) had a secondary success (repeat-RFA after pain recurrence). Mean follow-up time was 34.6 months (SD = 24.7, range 3-90). Few complications occurred: two mild reversible peripheral nerve injuries, one brachial plexus neuropathy, one broken electrode tip fragment, and one muscular hematoma. CONCLUSION Osteoid osteoma can be effectively and safely treated by CT-guided RFA using the presented ablation protocol. Beneficial effects of the treatment persist at long-term follow-up.","Lassalle, Louis; Campagna, R; Corcos, G; Babinet, A; Larousserie, F; Stephanazzi, J; Feydy, A",Skeletal radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00256-017-2658-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429047/,667

SETTING New Hayesbank Ophthalmology Services, Kent, UK. DESIGN In vivo experimental human eyes study METHODS:: We measured aerosol particle counts sized ≤0.3µm, >0.3 ≤0.5µm, >0.5 ≤1µm, >1 ≤2.5µm, >2.5 ≤5µm, and >5 ≤10µm during elective phacoemulsification surgery of 25 eyes. The baseline particle count in our operating theatre was measured on 2 separate days to assess for fluctuation. Then we measured 5 readings each during pre-phacoemulsification, and phacoemulsification of all eyes. We also measured the difference in aerosol generation during pre-phacoemulsification and phacoemulsification with the use of the mobile laminar air flow (LAF) machine. Lastly, we measured aerosol generation during phacoemulsification with the use of HPMC (2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose). RESULTS There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol between the baseline measurements on both days and between each patient's pre-phacoemulsification and phacoemulsification stages of surgery. The LAF system showed statistically significant reduction in particles size of ≤0.3µm, >0.3µm ≤0.5µm, >0.5µm ≤1.0µm, >1.0µm ≤2.5µm, >2.5µm ≤5.0µm and >5.0µm ≤10µm during phacoemulsification compared to pre-phacoemulsification (t-test, p value 0.00 for all particle sizes). The use of HPMC (2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) did not show any statistically significant reduction in particle measurements.

The natural history of choroidal neurofibromas in NF1 is unknown. This study evaluates a predominantly pediatric patient cohort for ocular features in NF1, including presence and progression of choroidal abnormalities, to determine their natural history, relationship to other NF1 features, and additive value in NF1 diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 106 patients referred for Ophthalmic monitoring or diagnosis of NF1 between January 2012 and December 2018. Clinical records and Near-Infrared Reflectance (NIR) Optical Coherence Tomography imaging were analyzed for prevalence and progression of choroidal neurofibromas on NIR, and relation to other NF1 diagnostic criteria. Results: 54.7% of patients referred had a confirmed NF1 diagnosis, and 45.4% were NF1 suspects. First ophthalmic review resulted in an additional 6.6% patients meeting the diagnostic criteria, and 14.2% later developed sufficient features (total n = 80). Choroidal neurofibromas were present in 75.7% of patients that had NIR imaging and met diagnostic criteria, and detected in the absence of, or prior to Lisch nodules in 13.5%. Progression in the size and number of choroidal neurofibromas occurred in 26 eyes (32.5%) of 14 patients (35.0%), all under 16 years old. Patients without choroidal neurofibromas at first examination never developed them over the study period. Conclusion: Choroidal neurofibromas, detected by NIR imaging, are common in NF1, present early with frequent progression, and represent an additional tool to aid NF1 diagnosis in young children.","Chilibeck, Corina M; Shah, Shaheen; Russell, Heather C; Vincent, Andrea L",Ophthalmic genetics,https://doi.org/10.1080/13816810.2021.1881977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594930/,667

Notably, some studies report that GNG12-AS1 plays important functions and molecular mechanism in breast cancer, but there are no existing studies in glioma. OBJECTIVE To analyze the biological functions and potential mechanisms of GNG12-AS1 in glioma. METHODS: We detected the expression of GNG12-AS1 in glioma tissues through analyzing TCGA data as well as our clinical samples. We then evaluated cell proliferation through MTT assay and colony formation and cell migration by transwell assay, wound healing assay and single cell tracking assay. After, we analyzed the effects of the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin through western blotting and utilized the β-catenin agonist SKL2001 for the rescue experiment. RESULTS: GNG12-AS1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues. The silence of GNG12-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of glioma cells, and reduced the activity of the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway. Notably, SKL2001 could reverse cell migration as well as β-catenin expression in glioma cells with lower GNG12-AS1 expression. CONCLUSIONS GNG12-AS1 regulates proliferation and migration of glioma cells through the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling and can perhaps be a new target for the treatment of glioma.","Xiang, Zijin; Lv, Qiaoli; Chen, Xueru; Zhu, Xiuting; Liu, Shikun; Li, Dangchi; Peng, Xiangdong",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20201578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735016/,667

This study examines the authors' institutional experience and a systematic review of the literature for outcomes and complications using the Pipeline Embolization Device in unruptured cavernous carotid aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective search for cavernous carotid aneurysms from a prospectively collected data base of aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device at our institution was performed. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory values; intrainterventional data; and data at all follow-up visits were collected. A systematic review of the literature for complication data was performed with inquiries sent when clarification of data was needed. RESULTS Forty-three cavernous carotid aneurysms were included in the study. Our mean radiographic follow-up was 2.05 years. On last follow-up, 88.4% of the aneurysms treated had complete or near-complete occlusion. Aneurysm complete or near-complete occlusion rates at 6 months, 12 months, and 36 months were 81.4%, 89.7%, and 100%, respectively. Of patients with neuro-ophthalmologic deficits on presentation, 84.2% had improvement in their visual symptoms. Overall, we had a 0% mortality rate and a 2.3% major neurologic complication rate. Our systematic review of the literature yielded 227 cavernous carotid aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device with mortality and morbidity rates of 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Endoluminal reconstruction with flow diversion for large unruptured cavernous carotid aneurysms can yield high efficacy with low complications. Further long-term data will be helpful in assessing the durability of the cure; however, we advocate a revisiting of current management paradigms for cavernous carotid aneurysms.","Tanweer, O; Raz, E; Brunswick, A; Zumofen, D; Shapiro, M; Riina, H A; Fouladvand, M; Becske, T; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

87695,Periprosthetic Anesthetic for Postoperative Pain After Laparoscopic Ventral Hernia Repair: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2015,"OBJECTIVES Although both physical inactivity and poor sleep are deleteriously associated with mortality, the joint effects of these two behaviours remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the joint association of physical activity (PA) and sleep with all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks. METHODS 380 055 participants aged 55.9 (8.1) years (55% women) from the UK Biobank were included. Baseline PA levels were categorised as high, medium, low and no moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) based on current public health guidelines. We categorised sleep into healthy, intermediate and poor with an established composited sleep score of chronotype, sleep duration, insomnia, snoring and daytime sleepiness. We derived 12 PA-sleep combinations, accordingly. Mortality risks were ascertained to May 2020 for all-cause, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD subtypes (coronary heart disease, haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke), as well as total cancer and lung cancer. RESULTS After an average follow-up of 11.1 years, sleep scores showed dose-response associations with all-cause, total CVD and ischaemic stroke mortality. Compared with high PA-healthy sleep group (reference), the no MVPA-poor sleep group had the highest mortality risks for all-cause (HR (95% CIs), (1.57 (1.35 to 1.82)), total CVD (1.67 (1.27 to 2.19)), total cancer (1.45 (1.18 to 1.77)) and lung cancer (1.91 (1.30 to 2.81))). The deleterious associations of poor sleep with all outcomes, except for stroke, was amplified with lower PA. CONCLUSION The detrimental associations of poor sleep with all-cause and cause-specific mortality risks are exacerbated by low PA, suggesting likely synergistic effects. Our study supports the need to target both behaviours in research and clinical practice.","Huang, Bo-Huei; Duncan, Mitch J; Cistulli, Peter A; Nassar, Natasha; Hamer, Mark; Stamatakis, Emmanuel",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-104046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34187783/,667
87768,Postoperative Mesh Infection-Still a Concern in Laparoscopic Era.,2015,"The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","Sun, M L; Yang, J M; Sun, Y P; Su, G H",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32061198/,667
87956,Robot-assisted laparoscopic hepaticojejunostomy for advanced malignant biliary obstruction.,2015,"Obesity is closely associated with insulin resistance (IR). The most likely links between the two are obesity-mediated systemic low-grade chronic inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are all known to contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and eventually diabetic nephropathy (DN). Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) is an oligomer of chitosan prepared by the deacetylation of chitin commonly found in exoskeletons of crustaceans such as shrimp and crab as well as the cell walls of fungi. COS has various biological effects including lipid lowering, anti-inflammation, anti-diabetes, and anti-oxidant effects. Therefore, COS is a potential new therapeutic agent for treatment of the obesity-induced DN condition. It is an abundant natural polymer and therefore freely available. This review includes information regarding the relationship between obesity, IR, T2DM, and DN as well as the potential usefulness of COS in controlling lipid and cholesterol metabolism, T2DM and kidney injury models in both in vivo and in vitro studies. However, evidence is limited regarding the effect of COS on the DN model. Further studies, especially in obesity-induced DN, are needed to support the mechanisms proposed in this review.","Sutthasupha, Prempree; Lungkaphin, Anusorn",Food & function,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fo00302f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839793/,667
88037,Laparoendoscopic excision of sternal subcutaneous dermoids in children.,2013,"BACKGROUND Immunological memory is the basis for vaccination. Currently, the longitudinal profiles of antibody responses in recovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients have not been fully characterized. METHODS In this study we sequentially followed up 19 recovered SARS patients over a 3-y period in order to characterize the dynamic changes in antibody responses against viral components in detail. In addition, 4 blood samples were obtained at month 60. RESULTS We found that immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and their neutralizing activities decreased throughout the entire phase of the study. For IgG antibodies in the 3rd y, the positive rate of whole-virus-specific antibodies was 42%, which was tested with commercial kits at 1/10 dilution of the sera. In comparison, the positive rate of spike (S) protein-specific antibodies was 100%, which was tested by spike protein-based ELISA at 1/100 dilution; 4 samples at month 60 were included. The average optical density (OD) reading of nucleocapsid (N) protein-specific antibodies fell dramatically between month 3 and month 12, and it decreased gradually at low levels that were a little higher than the cut-off value from month 12. For neutralizing antibodies, neutralizing activity was detectable in 89% of recovered patients in the 3rd y. S protein-specific IgG levels (r = 0.717) correlated better with neutralizing activity than SARS coronavirus-specific IgG levels (r = 0.571). CONCLUSIONS These systematic findings provide valuable information on natural humoral memory responses, and the data will be helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus infection and for the rational design of vaccines.","Liu, Lifeng; Xie, Jing; Sun, Jianpin; Han, Yang; Zhang, Chao; Fan, Hongwei; Liu, Zhengyin; Qiu, Zhifeng; He, Yuxian; Li, Taisheng",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3109/00365548.2011.560184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21366405/,667

88280,Video-assisted thoracoscopic thoracic duct sealing is inconsistent when performed with a bipolar vessel-sealing device in healthy cats.,2018,"BACKGROUND Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is a serious fungal infection that affects people living with HIV. The best way to treat the condition is unclear. OBJECTIVES We assessed evidence in three areas of equipoise. 1. Induction. To compare efficacy and safety of initial therapy with liposomal amphotericin B versus initial therapy with alternative antifungals. 2. Maintenance. To compare efficacy and safety of maintenance therapy with 12 months of oral antifungal treatment with shorter durations of maintenance therapy. 3. Antiretroviral therapy (ART). To compare the outcomes of early initiation versus delayed initiation of ART. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane CENTRAL; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (Ovid); Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and BIOSIS Previews (all three in the Web of Science); the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry, all up to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA We evaluated studies assessing the use of liposomal amphotericin B and alternative antifungals for induction therapy; studies assessing the duration of antifungals for maintenance therapy; and studies assessing the timing of ART. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), single-arm trials, prospective cohort studies, and single-arm cohort studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors assessed eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data, and assessed certainty of evidence. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in randomized studies, and ROBINS-I tool to assess risk of bias in non-randomized studies. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS We identified 17 individual studies. We judged eight studies to be at critical risk of bias, and removed these from the analysis. 1. Induction We found one RCT which compared liposomal amphotericin B to deoxycholate amphotericin B. Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B may have higher clinical success rates (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; 1 study, 80 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B has lower rates of nephrotoxicity (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 study, 77 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found very low-certainty evidence to inform comparisons between amphotericin B formulations and azoles for induction therapy. 2. Maintenance We found no eligible study that compared less than 12 months of oral antifungal treatment to 12 months or greater for maintenance therapy. For both induction and maintenance, fluconazole performed poorly in comparison to other azoles. 3. ART We found one study, in which one out of seven participants in the 'early' arm and none of the three participants in the 'late' arm died. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Liposomal amphotericin B appears to be a better choice compared to deoxycholate amphotericin B for treating PDH in people with HIV; and fluconazole performed poorly compared to other azoles. Other treatment choices for induction, maintenance, and when to start ART have no evidence, or very low certainty evidence. PDH needs prospective comparative trials to help inform clinical decisions.","Murray, Marylou; Hine, Paul",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32343003/,667

In the wake of other emerging dangerous pathogens in recent times, such as Ebola, Nipah and Zika, it is important that such facilities are kept ready during the inter-epidemic period for training of health professionals and for managing cases of multi-drug resistant and difficult-to-treat pathogens. While endemic potential of such critically ill patients is not yet known, the health system should have surge capacity for such critical care units and preferably each tertiary government hospital should have at least one such facility. This article describes elements of design of such unit (e.g., space, infection control, waste disposal, safety of healthcare workers, partners to be involved in design and plan) which can be adapted to the context of either a new construction or makeshift construction on top of an existing structure.

The rare examples of complexes recognized by amino acid transporters, namely by the Na+-independent neutral l-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), are 99mTc(i)/Re(i) compounds. Herein, we describe conjugates comprising a pyrazolyl-diamine chelating unit and the cationic amino acid l-arginine (l-Arg) linked by a propyl (L1) or hexyl linker (L2), which allowed the preparation of stable complexes of the type fac-[99mTc(CO)3(k3-L)]+ (Tc1, L = L1; Tc2, L = L2) and of the respective surrogates Re1 and Re2. Interestingly, complex Tc2 exhibited moderate levels of time-dependent internalization in three human tumoural cell lines, with approximately 3% of total applied activity internalized, corresponding to 21% of the cell-associated activity. A putative mechanism of retention in the cytoplasm of cells could be the interaction of the complex with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is the enzyme responsible for the catalytic oxidation of l-Arg to citrulline and nitric oxide. However, the surrogate complex Re2 does not recognize iNOS, as demonstrated by the in vitro assays with purified iNOS and in studies with lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-activated macrophages. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the internalization of Tc2 is linked to the cationic amino acid transporters, namely system y+. This finding might open the way towards the development of novel families of metal-based radiotracers for probing metabolically active cancer cells.","Morais, Maurício; Ferreira, Vera F C; Figueira, Flávio; Mendes, Filipa; Raposinho, Paula; Santos, Isabel; Oliveira, Bruno L; Correia, João D G",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/c7dt01146f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28612866/,667

This clinical trial was designed to determine whether lower IPI values were associated with extubation failure. METHODS This prospective observational trial was conducted in an academic medical center. After institutional review board approval, 100 mechanically ventilated subjects were enrolled. A stand-alone respiratory monitor that measures IPI was placed on subjects before starting a spontaneous breathing trial and continued for up to 48 h postextubation. Clinicians were blinded, and data were recorded continuously. Extubation failure was defined as the need for positive-pressure ventilation within 48 h after extubation. Mixed-effects regression models were employed to examine differences in IPI patterns between subjects with extubation success or failure. Significant IPI changes from baseline were then evaluated to predict extubation outcome. RESULTS IPI was successfully recorded on 62 subjects (48 successful and 14 failed extubations). Although mean IPI 5 min before and after extubation were not significantly different, mean IPI 1 h after extubation in the failure group was significantly lower by 1.19 (P = .044) compared with the successful group. Negative change in IPI 1 h after extubation increased odds of failure (odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI 1.001-2.454). The last mean IPI recorded after extubation was also significantly lower in the failure group compared with the successful group by 3.03 (P < .001). Negative change in the last measured IPI increased odds of failure (odds ratio = 1.72, 95% CI 1.26-2.34). CONCLUSIONS Declining IPI measurements postextubation are predictive of extubation failure.

DESIGN Articles were eligible for inclusion when the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) was established for measurement instruments for headaches associated with musculoskeletal symptoms in an adult population. The databases searched were PubMed (1966-2018), Cochrane (1898-2018) and Cinahl (1988-2018). Methodological quality was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool (QUADAS-2) and COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist for criterion validity. When possible, a meta-analysis was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendations were applied to establish the level of evidence per measurement instrument. RESULTS From 3450 articles identified, 31 articles were included in this review. Eleven measurement instruments for migraine were identified, of which the ID-Migraine is recommended with a moderate level of evidence and a pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.85-0.89) and specificity of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.72-0.78). Six measurement instruments examined both migraine and tension-type headache and only the Headache Screening Questionnaire - Dutch version has a moderate level of evidence with a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.80) and specificity of 0.90 (95% CI 0.77-0.96) for migraine, and a sensitivity of 0.36 (95% CI 0.21-0.54) and specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.92) for tension-type headache. For cervicogenic headache, only the cervical flexion rotation test was identified and had a very low level of evidence with a pooled sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.72-0.94) and specificity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.91). DISCUSSION The current review is the first to establish an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of measurement instruments for headaches associated with musculoskeletal factors. However, as most measurement instruments were validated in one study, pooling was not always possible. Risk of bias was a serious problem for most studies, decreasing the level of evidence.

Recently, several papers have reported ataxia-myoclonus syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to present our two cases and compare them to previously reported cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS We present two video-accompanied new cases with ataxia-myoclonus syndrome following SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the studies published so far. RESULTS Ataxia-myoclonus syndrome, isolated myoclonus, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome as post-COVID-19 syndrome following infection have been described in 16 patients (including our two cases). Patients have been treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and/or steroids except for 4 patients, which resulted in a significant improvement within 1-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS The increasing number of patients with a similar symptomatology shows a significant relationship between COVID-19 infection and ataxia-myoclonus syndrome. The subacute onset of neurological symptoms after a resolved COVID-19 infection and prominent response to immunotherapy may suggest that the neurological manifestations are immune-mediated. Although recovery is highly possible, it may take several weeks/months, and clinicians should be aware of this diagnosis and the beneficial effects of immunological treatment administered as soon as possible.","Przytuła, Filip; Błądek, Szymon; Sławek, Jarosław",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096013/,667

Thus, the present research investigates the antibacterial properties of biodegradable cellulose acetate (CA) / cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) electrospun nanofibers, their aerosol filtration, and the possible use as a filter media of surgical face masks. To achieve this goal, samples of these nanofibers were produced over a nonwoven substrate, using three different volumes of polymeric solution (0.35, 0.15 and 0.13 mL) during the electrospinning process. The evaluation of the antibacterial properties of the nanofibers was performed for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using quantitative methods. The aerosol filtration performance was evaluated in these samples for NaCl nanoparticles (from 7 to 300 nm) and with 8 mL min-1 of air flow rate. The results show that the single use of the surfactant has antibacterial properties from a concentration of 39 µg mL-1 of solution. The CA/CPB nanofibers presented a reduction of 100% for both bacteria. Air filtration tests showed 126.03 and 207.73 Pa cm-² of pressure drops and 63 and 77% of aerosol filtration efficiency (FE) for samples with 0.13 and 0.15 mL, respectively. Regarding the nanofiber produced with 0.35 mL, the value obtained was 115.13 ± 33.64 Pa cm-2 and 3.15% of particle penetration. These breathability values are higher than those required for the surgical face mask standard, indicating that improvements in the porosity and thickness are necessary to meet the Brazilian requirements. However, the nanofibers could be applied as filter media for indoor air conditioning systems (in hospitals and vehicle cabins) due to their FE and biocidal properties.","de Almeida, Daniela S; Scacchetti, Fabio A P; Santos, Roberta; Aguiar, Monica Lopes; Beal, Alexandra; Rudke, Anderson P; de Souza Santana, Marcos Henrique; Valério Lisboa, Ana Maria; Bezerra, Fabricio M; Martins, Leila D",Environmental technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2021.1982020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524952/,667

The co-infection of PDCoV and PEDV is common in natural swine infections, but the clinical outcomes of the interaction between the co-circulating PDCoV and PEDV are unknown. In current study, we established a co-infection model by inoculating the cell culture-adapted PDCoV HNZK-02 strain and PEDV CV777 simultaneously or sequentially using 4-day-old piglets. The weight loss, clinical scores, viral load and titer, histopathological changes and serum cytokines expression were compared with piglets challenged by either virus. Our results indicated the piglets co-inoculated with PDCoV and PEDV showed more serious diarrheal symptoms, mainly characterized by longer diarrheal period when compared to those of the mono-infection piglets. Furthermore, we observed that PEDV could promote PDCoV replication in the co-inoculated piglets with evidence of prolonged fecal viral shedding, high viral titers in feces and intestine tissues. Histological analysis indicated the co-infected piglets showed more extensive and serious pathological lesions in small intestine tissues than the mono-infection piglets. Our data also suggested that the co-infection of PDCoV and PEDV caused the excessive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) in serum. These results proved there existed obvious synergistic pathogenic effects between PDCoV and PEDV co-infection, which provided new insights into the synergistic pathogenic mechanism caused by these two porcine coronaviruses.","Zhang, Honglei; Han, Fangfang; Shu, Xiangli; Li, Qianqian; Ding, Qingwen; Hao, Chenlin; Yan, Xiaoguang; Xu, Menglong; Hu, Hui",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960702/,667
91020,Less Morbidity with Robot-Assisted Gastric Bypass Surgery than with Laparoscopic Surgery?,2019,"We have evaluated the efficacy of short-interfering RNAs targeting the nucleoprotein gene and also the brain immune response in treated and non-treated infected mice. Mice were inoculated with wild-type virus, classified as dog (hv2) or vampire bat (hv3) variants and both groups were treated or left as controls. No difference was observed in the lethality rate between treated and non-treated groups, although clinical evaluation of hv2 infected mice showed differences in the severity of clinical disease (p=0.0006). Evaluation of brain immune response 5 days post-inoculation in treated hv2 group showed no difference among the analyzed genes, whereas after 10 days post-inoculation there was increased expression of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 12, interferon gamma, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 associated with higher expression of N gene in the same period (p<0.0001). In hv2 non-treated group only higher interferon beta expression was found at day 5. The observed differences in results of the immune response genes between treated and non-treated groups is not promising as they had neither impact on mortality nor even a reduction in the expression of N gene in siRNA treated animals. This finding suggests that the use of pre-designed siRNA alone may not be useful in rabies treatment.","Appolinario, Camila Michele; Allendorf, Susan Dora; Peres, Marina Gea; Fonseca, Clovis Reynaldo; Vicente, Acacia Ferreira; Antunes, João Marcelo Azevedo de Paula; Pantoja, José Carlos Figueiredo; Megid, Jane",The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2015.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26254692/,667

91284,A case of signet ring cell carcinoma of the ovary diagnosed after laparoscopic surgery.,2017,"Deficient ankle control after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) often accentuates walking impairments. Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has been shown to augment locomotor activity after iSCI, presumably due to modulation of spinal excitability. However, the effects of possible excitability modulations induced by tSCS on ankle control have not yet been assessed. This study investigated the immediate (i.e., without training) effects during single-sessions of tonic tSCS on ankle control, spinal excitability, and locomotion in ten individuals with chronic, sensorimotor iSCI (American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale D). Participants performed rhythmic ankle movements (dorsi- and plantar flexion) at a given rate, and irregular ankle movements following a predetermined trajectory with and without tonic tSCS at 15 Hz, 30 Hz, and 50 Hz. In a subgroup of eight participants, the effects of tSCS on assisted over-ground walking were studied. Furthermore, the activity of a polysynaptic spinal reflex, associated with spinal locomotor networks, was investigated to study the effect of the stimulation on the dedicated spinal circuitry associated with locomotor function. Tonic tSCS at 30 Hz immediately improved maximum dorsiflexion by +4.6° ± 0.9° in the more affected lower limb during the rhythmic ankle movement task, resulting in an increase of +2.9° ± 0.9° in active range of motion. Coordination of ankle movements, assessed by the ability to perform rhythmic ankle movements at a given target rate and to perform irregular movements according to a trajectory, was unchanged during stimulation. tSCS at 30 Hz modulated spinal reflex activity, reflected by a significant suppression of pathological activity specific to SCI in the assessed polysynaptic spinal reflex. During walking, there was no statistical group effect of tSCS. In the subgroup of eight assessed participants, the three with the lowest as well as the one with the highest walking function scores showed positive stimulation effects, including increased maximum walking speed, or more continuous and faster stepping at a self-selected speed. Future studies need to investigate if multiple applications and individual optimization of the stimulation parameters can increase the effects of tSCS, and if the technique can improve the outcome of locomotor rehabilitation after iSCI.","Meyer, Christian; Hofstoetter, Ursula S; Hubli, Michèle; Hassani, Roushanak H; Rinaldo, Carmen; Curt, Armin; Bolliger, Marc",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147884/,667

A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) was applied to a generic plan to identify weaknesses in pandemic management policies, in order to develop recommendations for improving national pandemic management systems. Policy components considered in our analysis are command and control, early case detection and disease surveillance, and community containment management. The main critical areas identified in national pandemic control were: communication systems among all institutions and levels involved in pandemic management, guidelines and regulations describing how key personal and institutions should operate during a pandemic, training and dissemination of information to health care personnel involved in outbreak management. The HACCP analysis highlighted the need for agreed communication structures, clear division of responsibilities and harmonised policy guidelines at all levels of pandemic management.

Cape Town was the SA metropole most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early observational data from Africa may provide valuable insight into what can be expected as the pandemic expands across the continent. OBJECTIVES To describe the prevalence, clinical features, comorbidities and outcome of an early cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted with COVID-19. METHODS This was a descriptive observational study of an early cohort of adults with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted from 25 March to 11 May 2020. RESULTS Of 116 patients (mean age 48 years, 61% female) admitted, 24 were HIV-positive (21%). The most common symptoms reported were cough (n=88; 73%), shortness of breath (n=78; 69%), fever (n=67; 59%), myalgia (n=29; 25%) and chest pain (n=22; 20%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=46; 41%), diabetes mellitus (n=43; 38%), obesity (n=32; 28%) and HIV (n=24; 21%). Mortality was associated with older age (mean (standard deviation) 55 (12) years v. 46 (14) years; p<0.01); the presence of hypertension or hypertension along with diabetes and/or obesity; lower partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; and higher urea level, white cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. The overall survival rate for all hospital admissions was 86/116 (73%). In this early cohort, survival was similar in patients with HIV (n=18; 75%) compared with those without HIV (n=67; 75%) (p=1). Of the 74 patients admitted to the wards, 63 (85%) survived, whereas 22 of 42 (52%) admitted to the intensive care unit survived.

Coatings are an avenue by which integration may be improved. Our aim was to evaluate tissue integration between uncoated, fibroblast- and mesenchymal stem cell-coated meshes placed as subcutaneous onlay (ON) or intraperitoneal underlay (UN). METHODS Three commonly used biologic and synthetic hernia meshes were tested including Parietex, TIGR and Strattice. Each mesh was coated with rat kidney fibroblasts (NRKs) or rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) along with an uncoated group. In the ON group, mesh was fixated on top of the external oblique fascia. In the UN group, mesh was placed against the intact peritoneum. Animals were survived for 30 days and killed for biomechanical and histologic analysis. A ""T""-peel test was performed on a mesh-tissue explant from each sample to analyze the strength of integration at the mesh-tissue interface. Tissue integration was evaluated histologically using an established scoring system. RESULTS All uncoated meshes demonstrated significantly higher tissue ingrowth in the UN compared to ON position. Cell-coating of synthetic meshes decreased tissue ingrowth as UN, but increased it as ON, with a net effect of minimizing biomechanical difference between the two positions. In the biologic group however, NRK-coating decreased tissue ingrowth regardless of position, while MSC-coating increased it in both ON and UN positions. CONCLUSIONS Both cell-coating and positioning affect mesh-tissue integration. Integration is superior in the underlay position compared to onlay when uncoated. Cell-coating of selected synthetic meshes can improve integration, particularly in the onlay position. Furthermore, MSCs appear to be a viable choice for biologic mesh coating, especially when implanted as an onlay. Overall, cell-coating of surgical meshes appears to a have a potential to improve mesh-tissue integration.","Majumder, Arnab; Gao, Yue; Sadava, Emanuel E; Anderson, James M; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4764-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895904/,667

A previously unknown polyomavirus genome was identified in a sample from a multimammate mouse (Mastomys species) and the entire viral genome of 4899 bp was subsequently sequenced. This viral genome contained potential ORFs for the capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3, and early proteins, small t antigen and large T antigen. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it was a novel member of the family Polyomaviridae, and thus the virus was tentatively named mastomys polyomavirus. After transfection of the viral genome into several mammalian cell lines, transient expression of the VP1 and large T antigen proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemical analyses. Comparison of large T antigen function in mastomys polyomavirus with that in rhesus monkey polyomavirus SV40 and human polyomavirus JC virus revealed that the large T antigen from mastomys polyomavirus interacted with the tumour suppressor protein pRb, but not with p53.","Orba, Yasuko; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Nakamura, Ichiro; Ishii, Akihiro; Hang'ombe, Bernard M; Mweene, Aaron S; Thomas, Yuka; Kimura, Takashi; Sawa, Hirofumi",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.027854-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21177925/,667

In this short commentary, I outline the structural (i.e., systemic) and reproductive (i.e., labour) character of this crisis, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. From here, I argue for the imperative to centre an expansive conception of care in critical community psychology work. Specifically, I posit that by working with and alongside activist care workers, community psychologists can assist in building socially just modalities of care. After reflecting on my work with collective caring initiatives, I offer five (tentative) guiding principles for a community psychology that is committed to addressing the crisis of care, namely: (1) commitment to building political coalitions; (2) commitment to refuting capitalist conceptions of care; (3) commitment to expanding conceptions of care; (4) commitment to embracing the psychological consequences of care work; and (5) a politicoethical commitment.","Malherbe, Nick",Journal of community psychology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789911/,667

Infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, but few recent data describe their incidence and effects. Objectives To describe the types of infections diagnosed in residents of pediatric long-term care facilities, calculate infection rates, and identify risk factors for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective cohort study, which was part of a larger trial called Keep It Clean for Kids, was conducted from September 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, at 3 pediatric long-term care facilities in New York. Residents of the facilities who were 21 years or younger and either residents or admitted during the study period (n = 717) were enrolled in the study. Medical records were reviewed to identify infections diagnosed by site clinicians. Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of infections, such as RTIs; skin and soft-tissue infections; chronic comorbid conditions, including neurologic and respiratory disorders; and device use, including gastrostomy tubes and tracheostomies, was determined. Risk factors for RTIs were assessed by generalized linear mixed method regression modeling. Results The 717 residents had a median (interquartile range) age at enrollment of 2.6 (0.4-9.1) years; 358 (49.9%) were male. Four hundred twenty-eight residents (59.7%) had feeding tubes and 215 (30.0%) had tracheostomies. Most chronic comorbid conditions were musculoskeletal or ambulation (532 residents [74.2%]), neurologic (505 [70.4%]), respiratory (361 [50.3%]), and gastrointestinal (230 [32.1%]) disorders, and 460 residents (64.2%) had 4 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Site clinicians diagnosed 2052 infections during the 3-year study period. Respiratory tract infections were most common and were diagnosed in 1291 residents (62.9%). The overall infection rate was 5.3 infections per 1000 resident-days, and RTI rates were 3.3 infections per 1000 resident-days. Overall infection rates and rates of RTI, skin and soft-tissue infection, urinary tract infection, and bloodstream infection varied among the 3 sites. In the multivariable model, younger age (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06), increased number of chronic comorbid conditions (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.19), and the use of feeding tubes (IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64) and tracheostomies (IRR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.17-1.69) were associated with RTIs. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, RTIs were the most common infections diagnosed, but modifiable risk factors for RTIs were not identified. Future work should focus on optimizing infection prevention and control strategies to reduce infections, particularly RTIs, in the pediatric long-term care population.","Saiman, Lisa; Maykowski, Philip; Murray, Meghan; Cohen, Bevin; Neu, Natalie; Jia, Haomioa; Hutcheon, Gordon; Simpser, Edwin; Mosiello, Linda; Alba, Luis; Larson, Elaine",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.1482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28738121/,667

Affected persons present a significant co-occurrence of autoimmune conditions, hence, clustering of autoimmunity is also predicted among their relatives. AIMS The aim of our study was to evaluate the burden of autoimmunity in families of people with AD. METHODS 116 individuals with AD were surveyed about the occurrence of 23 autoimmune diseases among their relatives. RESULTS 74.1% of persons with AD reported at least one relative with an autoimmune disorder - 257 cases were diagnosed in 221 relatives. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was found in 100 individuals, followed by Graves' disease and vitiligo - in 25 and 24 relatives, respectively. Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 23 relatives, psoriasis in 15, rheumatoid arthritis in 12, pernicious anaemia in 11, multiple sclerosis in 8, while premature menopause in 8 women. AD was found in 7 relatives, alopecia in 6, and celiac disease in 5. Other conditions were rare. Significant correlation was noticed between the number of autoimmune conditions in AD proband and the number of affected relatives (p = 0.031). 66.4% of people with AD had a first-degree relative suffering from autoimmunity. Autoimmune conditions were more frequent among females: sisters (p < 0.001), mothers (p = 0.002) and grandmothers (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Considerable prevalence of autoimmune conditions in relatives of persons with AD confirms substantial risk of autoimmunity, especially in females and relatives of patients affected by multiplex autoimmunity. Our data corroborate the recommendation of active screening for autoimmune disorders, particularly thyroid disease, among AD family members. This article is protected by copyright.

93272,Single-port access versus conventional multi-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy for very large uterus.,2015,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether cognition is associated with activity and participation outcomes in adult stroke survivors. Five databases were systematically searched for studies investigating the relationship between general- and domain-specific cognition and longer-term (>3 months) basic activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADLs, and participation outcomes. Eligibility for inclusion, data extraction, and study quality was evaluated by 2 reviewers using a standardized protocol. Effect sizes (r) were estimated using a random-effects model. Sixty-two publications were retained for review, comprising 7817 stroke survivors (median age 63.57 years, range:18-96 years). Median length of follow-up was 12 months (range: 3 months-11 years). Cognition (all domains combined) demonstrated a significant medium association with all 3 functional outcomes combined, r=0.37 (95% CI, 0.33-0.41), P<0.001. Moderator analyses revealed these effects persisted regardless of study quality, order in which outcomes were collected (sequential versus concurrent), age, sample size, or follow-up period. Small to medium associations were also identified between each individual cognitive domain and the separate ADL, instrumental ADL, and participation outcomes. In conclusion, poststroke cognitive impairment is associated with early and enduring activity limitations and participation restrictions, and the association is robust to study design factors, such as sample size, participant age, follow-up period, or study quality. Cognitive assessment early poststroke is recommended to facilitate early detection of disability, prediction of functional outcomes, and to inform tailored rehabilitation therapies.","Stolwyk, Renerus J; Mihaljcic, Tijana; Wong, Dana K; Chapman, Jodie E; Rogers, Jeffrey M",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.032215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493048/,667

93748,The decisive role of the patient-side surgeon in robotic surgery.,2010,"Methamphetamine (METH) exposure reportedly promotes microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion. Sustained inflammation in abusers of psychostimulant drugs further induces neural damage. Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) is a gut-brain peptide which exerts a wide range of biological activities in the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. We previously found that pre-treatment with CCK-8 inhibited behavioural and histologic changes typically induced by repeated exposure to METH. Here, we aimed to estimate the effects of CCK-8 on METH-induced neuro-inflammation, which is markedly characterized by microglia activation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines production in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we assessed the subtypes of the CCK receptor mediating the regulatory effects of CCK-8, and the changes in the NF-κB signalling pathway. We found that CCK-8 inhibited METH-induced microglial activation and IL-6 and TNF-α generation in vivo and in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, co-treatment of CCK-8 with METH significantly attenuated the activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway by activating the CCK2 receptor subtype in N9 cells. In conclusion, our findings indicated the inhibitory effect of CCK-8 on METH-induced neuro-inflammation in vivo and in vitro, and suggested the underlying mechanism may involve the activation of the CCK2 receptor, which downregulated the NF-κB signalling pathway induced by METH stimulation.","Gou, Hongyan; Sun, Donglei; Hao, Lijing; An, Meiling; Xie, Bing; Cong, Bin; Ma, Chunling; Wen, Di",Neurotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916201/,667

The Parent Artery Reconstruction for Large or Giant Cerebral Aneurysms Using the Tubridge Flow Diverter (PARAT) trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Tubridge flow diverter in the treatment of large or giant aneurysms in comparison with Enterprise stent-assisted coiling. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective, multicenter, randomized trial was conducted at 12 hospitals throughout China. Enrolled adults with unruptured large/giant intracranial aneurysms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either Enterprise stent-assisted coiling or Tubridge flow diverter implantation. The primary end point was complete occlusion at 6-month follow-up, while secondary end points included technical success, mortality, target vessel-related stroke, aneurysm bleeding, in-stent stenosis, parent artery occlusion, and the frequency of all adverse events. RESULTS Among 185 enrolled subjects, 41 withdrew before procedure initiation. Overall, 82 subjects underwent Tubridge implantation, and 62 subjects were primarily treated with stent-assisted coiling. The results of 6-month follow-up imaging included complete occlusion rates of 75.34% versus 24.53% for the Tubridge and stent-assisted coiling groups, respectively, with a calculated common odds ratio of 9.4 (95% confidence interval, 4.14-21.38; P < .001). There was a higher, nonsignificant frequency of complications for Tubridge subjects. Multivariate analysis showed a decreased stroke rate at the primary investigational site, with a marginal P value (P = .051). CONCLUSIONS This trial showed an obviously higher rate of large and giant aneurysm obliteration with the Tubridge FD over Enterprise stent-assisted coiling. However, this higher obliteration rate came at the cost of a nonsignificantly higher rate of complications. Investigational site comparisons suggested that a learning curve for flow-diverter implantation should be recognized and factored into trial designs.","Liu, J-M; Zhou, Y; Li, Y; Li, T; Leng, B; Zhang, P; Liang, G; Huang, Q; Yang, P-F; Shi, H; Zhang, J; Wan, J; He, W; Liang, C; Zhu, G; Xu, Y; Hong, B; Yang, X; Bai, W; Tian, Y; Zhang, H; Li, Z; Li, Q; Zhao, R; Fang, Y; Zhao, K",AJNR.

METHODS This cohort consisted of 202 pregnancies with poor obstetric history and immune system problems. Patients enrolled in special antenatal care program were administered low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose salicylic acid and low-dose corticosteroid (prophylaxis protocol) as soon as their pregnancies were confirmed. Pregnancies with systemic lupus erythematosis, Sjogren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis were additionally administered HCQ 200 mg daily as a part of their routine treatment. Pregnancies using HCQ were included in the study group (n = 39) while the remainders were included in control group (n = 163). We compared the groups in terms of the presence of miscarriage, fetal growth restriction (FGR), preeclampsia and preterm birth, as well as gestational week at birth, birthweight and ""APGAR score of <7"" at 10th minute. RESULTS Miscarriage rates were 28.2% and 28.2% while preterm birth rates were 16.6% and 28.2% in the control and study groups, respectively (P = 0.215). Preeclampsia and HCQ-related side effects were not detected in the groups. There were also no significant differences between the groups in terms of FGR, gestational day at birth, birthweight and the presence of ""APGAR score <7"" at 10th minute (P = 0.462, P = 0.064, P = 0.273 and P = 0.627, respectively). CONCLUSION Low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose salicylic acid and low-dose corticosteroid prophylaxis together with HCQ seem to be promising in pregnancies with immune system disorders.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine patients (two men and seven women; mean age, 61.6 y) with 45 lung metastases (mean diameter, 1.1 cm; range, 0.4-2.7 cm) from head and neck ACC underwent RF ablation in 30 sessions. Primary endpoints were technical success, technique effectiveness, and procedural complications. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS). RESULTS RF ablation was technically successful for all 45 metastases. The median tumor follow-up period was 37.1 months (range, 12.9-128.3 mo). Local progression occurred in six tumors, two of which were treated again and subsequently showed complete response. Major complications (pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement) occurred in five sessions (16.7%). The median patient follow-up period was 61.6 months (range, 20.5-134.5 mo). Two patients died of disease progression at 38.9 and 61.6 months after RF ablation, respectively, whereas the other seven remained alive at the end of the study. OS rates from the initial RF ablation were 100% at 3 years and 83.3% at 5 years (mean survival time, 106.4 mo). OS rates from the treatment of the primary site were 100% at 5 years and 62.5% at 10 years (mean survival time, 210.1 mo). CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation is an acceptable and effective local treatment for lung metastases from head and neck ACC. However, further study is needed to evaluate its effect on patient survival.","Iguchi, Toshihiro; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Matsui, Yusuke; Toyooka, Shinichi; Nishizaki, Kazunori; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2014.11.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25655029/,667

Therefore, this study aims to describe challenges faced by ODPs during the pandemic. The secondary aim is to use empirical evidence to inform the public health sector management about both ODP professional development and improvement in surgical procedures, with a specific focus on pandemics. A qualitative study has been conducted. Data collection was based on an interview guide with open-ended questions. Interviews with 39 ODPs in public sector teaching hospitals of Pakistan who have been working during the COVID-19 pandemic were part of the analysis. Content analysis was used to generate themes. Ten themes related to challenges faced by ODPs in delivering services during the pandemic for securing patient safety were identified: (i) Disparity in training for prevention of COVID-19; (ii) Shortcomings in COVID-19 testing; (iii) Supply shortages of personal protective equipment; (iv) Challenges in maintaining physical distance and prevention protocols; (v) Human resource shortages and role burden; (vi) Problems with hospital administration; (vii) Exclusion and hierarchy; (viii) Teamwork limitations and other communication issues; (ix) Error Management; and (x) Anxiety and fear.

One of the viral proteases called main protease or Mpro, plays a crucial role in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. As the structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the Mpro of SARS-CoV-1 (responsible for SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004), we hypothesize that the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro can also inhibit the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, a total of 79 isatin derivatives, which inhibited Mpro activity under in vitro conditions, were selected from the literature, and then screened through AutoDock Vina. The chemical features of the top 5 isatin derivatives with low binding energies (-8.5 to -8.2 kcal/mol) were used to screen similar types of compounds from several small-molecule libraries containing 15856508 compounds. A total of 1,609 compounds with similarity score ≥ 6 were screened and then subjected to docking as well as ADME analysis.

94863,Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in patients with benign adnexal disease: a comparative study.,2012,"Physician burnout and other forms of occupational distress are a significant problem in modern medicine, especially during the coronavirus disease pandemic, yet few doctors are familiar with the neurobiology that contributes to these problems. Burnout has been linked to changes that reduce a physician's sense of control over their own practice, undermine connections with patients and colleagues, interfere with work-life integration, and result in uncontrolled stress. Brain research has revealed that uncontrollable stress, but not controllable stress, impairs the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, a recently evolved brain region that provides top-down regulation over thought, action, and emotion. The prefrontal cortex governs many cognitive operations essential to physicians, including abstract reasoning, higher-order decision making, insight, and the ability to persevere through challenges. However, the prefrontal cortex is remarkably reliant on arousal state and is impaired under conditions of fatigue and/or uncontrollable stress when there are inadequate or excessive levels of the arousal modulators (eg, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine). With chronic stress exposure, prefrontal gray matter connections are lost, but they can be restored by stress relief. Reduced prefrontal cortex self-regulation may explain several challenges associated with burnout in physicians, including reduced motivation, unprofessional behavior, and suboptimal communication with patients. Understanding this neurobiology may help physicians have a more informed perspective to help relieve or prevent symptoms of burnout and may help administrative leaders to optimize the work environment to create more effective organizations. Efforts to restore a sense of control to physicians may be particularly helpful.","Arnsten, Amy F T; Shanafelt, Tait",Mayo Clinic proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673923/,667

Gaining a better understanding of patient demographics is essential to develop measures to counteract such spreading. In this context, from a viewpoint of occupational health, we analyzed the publicly available data on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tokyo, which reported the highest number of cases in Japan. A total of 243 cases aged 20 years or older (excluding students) were recorded between January 14 and March 27, 2020. Of 233 cases excluding 10 cases of the first cluster, 162 were men and 176 were of working age (20 to 69 years). Of 203 cases with valid information on employment status, 151 (74%) were workers: 114 employees, 31 self-employed, and 6 medical staff. Of the working patients, the majority were male: 72% in employed and 87% in self-employed. These data suggest the importance of occupational health in controlling the spread of COVID-19. In April 2020, a state of emergency was declared in response to a surge in the number of cases, especially in metropolitan areas. A working schedule associated with lower risks of infection, including telework and flexible working hours, should be rigorously promoted to minimize human-to-human contact.

The prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responds to visual stimuli, yet little is known about if and how visual experience modifies ACC circuits. We find that mouse ACC exhibits sequence plasticity, but in contrast to V1, the plasticity expresses as a change in response timing, rather than a change in response magnitude. Sequence plasticity is absent in ACC, but not V1, in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability and autism-like features. Our results demonstrate that simple sensory stimuli can be used to reveal how experience functionally (or dysfunctionally) modifies higher-order prefrontal circuits and suggest a divergence in how ACC and V1 encode familiarity.","Sidorov, Michael S; Kim, Hyojin; Rougie, Marie; Williams, Brittany; Siegel, Jennifer J; Gavornik, Jeffrey P; Philpot, Benjamin D",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937128/,667

This stable had 16 Thoroughbreds and 25 horses of other breeds, including Andalusians, ponies and miniature horses. Fifteen horses (37 %) showed mild clinical signs such as fever, lethargy, anorexia and diarrhoea, and they recovered within 3 days of onset. A virus neutralization test showed that all 41 horses were infected with ECoV, signifying that 26 horses (63 %) were subclinical. The results suggest that subclinical horses played an important role as spreaders. A genome sequence analysis revealed that the lengths from genes p4.7 to p12.7 or NS2 in ECoV differed from those of ECoVs detected previously, suggesting that this outbreak was caused by a virus different from those that caused previous outbreaks among draughthorses in Japan. Among 30 horses that tested positive by real-time RT-PCR, ECoV shedding periods of non-Thoroughbreds were significantly longer than those of Thoroughbreds. The difference in shedding periods may indicate that some breeds excrete ECoV longer than other breeds and can contribute to the spread of ECoV.","Kambayashi, Yoshinori; Bannai, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Hirama, Akiko; Ohta, Minoru; Nemoto, Manabu","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2021.101668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004508/,667

However, the efficacy of MSCs can still be promoted if pretreatment is applied to enhance their poor migration towards the damaged liver. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of IL-1β pretreatment on the efficacy and homing ability of MSCs in ALF. Methods MSCs were isolated by the whole bone marrow adherence method and characterized. The efficacy and homing ability of IL-1β-pretreated MSCs (Pre-MSCs) were examined in a rat ALF model and compared with that of MSCs and normal saline. Then, Western blot was performed to detect the c-Met and CXCR4 expression of MSCs and Pre-MSCs and followed by flow cytometry to detect the meaningful indicators. Finally, the migration abilities of different cells and different conditions were tested by the Transwell migration assay. Results MSCs of ideal purity were successfully isolated and cultured. Comparing with MSCs, Pre-MSCs had significantly better efficacy on improving the survival rate and liver function of ALF rats. Further analyses of damaged liver tissues showed that IL-1β pretreatment significantly enhanced the efficacy of MSCs on suppressing liver necrosis. Besides, Pre-MSCs exhibited better effects in inhibiting apoptosis and activating proliferation. The results of tracing experiments with CM-Dil-labeled cells confirmed that more cells migrated to the damaged liver in the Pre-MSC group. In terms of mechanism, the CXCR4 expression was significantly enhanced by IL-1β pretreatment, and an increased migration ability towards SDF-1 that could be reversed by AMD3100 was found in Pre-MSCs. Conclusion IL-1β pretreatment could enhance the homing ability of MSCs at least partially by increasing the expression of CXCR4 and further improve the efficacy of MSCs on ALF.","Nie, He; An, Fangmei; Mei, Jie; Yang, Cheng; Zhan, Qiang; Zhang, Qinglin",Stem cells international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1498315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724311/,667

METHODS A retrospective evaluation of the records between January 2005 and December 2019 was done. RESULTS A total of 43 infants were ≤5 kg at the time of PEG insertion. The mean age was 5±3 (19 days-16 months) months and the mean weight was 4.3±0.6 (2.7-5.0) kg. The primary diagnoses were neurological disorders in 25, metabolic disorders in nine, cleft palates in four, muscular disorders in four and a cardiac disorder in one. All procedures were completed successfully. A self-resolving pneumoperitoneum developed in one (2.3%). The tube was extruded in 6 (14%) patients postoperatively which required suture-approximation of the skin and subcuticular tissues. The tube was removed in four (9%) patients with achievement of oral feeds on the long-term. Eighteen (42%) died of primary diseases. Their median tube days was 12.4 (17 days-73 months) months. The median tube days of 20 (46.5%) patients who are currently being followed up is 50.3 (4.7 month-9.8 years) months. CONCLUSIONS PEG placement is safe in small infants with associated morbidities.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective randomized study. ANIMALS Mature female hound dogs (n = 6). METHODS Physical examination, baseline blood work and thoracic radiography confirmed the absence of preexisting disease in all dogs. Thoracoscopic observation was established through a subxiphoid portal and used for evaluation of differential lung lobe ventilation. Each dog was sequentially intubated using 1 of 3 DLT designs in random order; Robertshaw left-sided tube (RS-L), Carlens left-sided tube (C-L), Dr. White right-sided tube (DW-R). Incidence of initial and overall (after a maximum of 3 DLT manipulations) correct and complete OLV (CC-OLV) was recorded. After each blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement, bronchoscopic evaluation was performed to document correct DLT position. RESULT Blind DLT placement achieved overall CC-OLV in all dogs using RS-L, 66% using C-L, and all using DW-R. Successful initial left-sided OLV (L-OLV) was statistically more likely when RS-L DLTs were used compared to C-L or DW-R. Of cases where overall CC-OLV was achieved, correct DLT position was present in only 44% of intubations. CONCLUSIONS Blind DLT placement produced successful CC-OLV in all dogs using at least one DLT design evaluated. Use of thoracoscopic assistance may obviate the need for bronchoscopic observation during DLT placement in dogs. However, bronchoscopic observation may still refine DLT positioning in dogs after blind thoracoscopic-assisted DLT placement.","Mayhew, Philipp D; Culp, William T N; Pascoe, Peter J; Kass, Philip H; Johnson, Lynelle R",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2011.00979.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22822939/,667

Thereinto, Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1), an enzymatic node located in the conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), has been reported to accelerate the tumorigenesis of multiple cancers. However, its role in the metabolic process of gastric cancer remains largely unexplored. In this study, by in vitro, in vivo and in silico assessments, our results revealed that SCD1 exhibited the ability to promote tumor growth, migration and anti-ferroptosis of gastric cancer. The underlying mechanism might involve the alteration of cancer stemness and modulation of cell cycle-related proteins. Moreover, based on our findings, high expression of SCD1 might predict poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Our study provided new insights into the potential of SCD1 as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target in the treatment of gastric cancer.","Wang, Chao; Shi, Min; Ji, Jun; Cai, Qu; Zhao, Qianfu; Jiang, Jinling; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Huan; Zhu, Zhenggang; Zhang, Jun",Aging,https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726752/,667

96752,Laparoscopic colon surgery: does operative time matter?,2009,"INTRODUCTION The management of critically ill patients is challenged by increasing population age and prevalence of comorbid diseases. High-quality intensive care nursing practice is imperative to accommodate these issues. The roles of the nurse practitioner (NP) and the acute care NP have existed for decades in the USA, Canada and Australia but are still evolving in Europe. Some European countries have introduced the advanced practice nurse (APN), but the current standard of the advanced level of nursing is variable and consensus regarding the framework, role and definition is lacking. Literature and evidence are sparse as well. Identification of skills and competencies required for the APN is warranted. Mapping skills and competencies will enable future educational harmonisation and facilitate mobility of the advanced-level intensive care nursing workforce across Europe. The aim of our scoping review is to identify literature describing skills, competencies and policies characterising advanced nursing practice in intensive care across Europe. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will apply a five-stage scoping review methodology with a comprehensive systematic literature search as outlined by Arksey and O'Malley. In collaboration with a research librarian, we will search nine interdisciplinary databases and grey literature for publications originating in European countries in 1992-2018. Using a two-stage screening process with Covidence to remove duplicates, we will first scan the title and abstract and then perform full-text review to determine the eligibility of the papers. Qualitative content analysis will be used to chart the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our study is a part of the European Union-funded INACTIC project (International Nursing Advanced Competency-based Training for Intensive Care) with the overall aim of developing a common European curriculum for advanced practice critical care nursing. Results from this scoping review mapping the evidence of APNs in Europe will be presented at national and international conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Kaldan, Gudrun; Nordentoft, Sara; Herling, Suzanne Forsyth; Larsen, Anders; Thomsen, Thordis; Egerod, Ingrid",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494624/,667

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing interest on the experimental use of opioid agonists in the laboratory setting of ischemia and reperfusion; existing data suggest that there is a potential association between opioid agonism and the reduction of infarct size in several animal models of regional ischemia similar to that following ischemic preconditioning. Most of these studies seem to attribute these beneficial and cardioprotective effects to the stimulation of a specific opioid receptor type, the delta (δ) opioid receptor. This review focuses on the role of the delta opioid receptor agonism in several models of ischemia and reperfusion, as well as on hemorrhagic shock models, on the potential mechanisms of action following delta opioid receptor activation and on the time window for opioid administration in various animal studies.","Dragasis, Stylianos; Bassiakou, Eleni; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Papadimitriou, Louiza; Andreas Steen, Petter; Gulati, Anil; Xanthos, Theodoros",European journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24120367/,667

Symptomatic adult congenital Bochdalek hernia, on the other hand, is extremely rare with a prevalence of 0.17-6% of all diaphragmatic hernias. They present with recurrent abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Acute presentations could be life threatening especially if there is incarcerated or threatened bowel in the chest. Repair of symptomatic Bochdalek hernia is recommended in the adult population. We present two cases of right and left symptomatic Bochdalek hernias in adults, encountered over 15 years of practice in a tertiary referral centre in the UK. We discuss their presentation and surgical management and review the literature of similar cases treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Thoracic surgeons are increasingly becoming involved in these cases, which used to be the domain of upper gastrointestinal surgeons. A synthetic patch may be required to close the defect, therefore; the thoracic surgeon must be familiar with such techniques. The recent expansion in video format publishing in the internet and social media has revolutionized the way knowledge and how-to-do-it expertise is distributed around the world. It has the advantage of reaching far more viewer than subscription paper-printed format journals and has a rising significance in encouraging thoracic surgeons to do things they were not used to do. Finally; Symptomatic Bochdalek hernia, and possibly Morgagni hernia in the adult population could be safely repaired by VATS with good and lasting results.","Amer, Khalid",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/jovs.2017.10.05; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29302452/,667

BACKGROUND Due to the shortage of chronic nursing staff in Korea, many nursing services have been overlooked, which has led to a customary caregiving culture that relied on inpatient families. To improve this, Korea legislated the INCSS in 2015. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed policy formation process of the INCSS using Kingdon's Multiple-Streams Framework from on-offline materials generated between 1994 and 2015. RESULTS The caregiving culture, which was raised as one of the main causes of the MERS-CoV infection spread, was garnered intensive attention from media and politicians. So, the streams of problem, politics, and policy that each flowed independently were coupled. And window of policy finally opened. CONCLUSIONS The leading political activities of the United Healthcare Civic-Group, in which general nurses were the core, were effective in introducing the system.

SARS-3CL(pro), a cysteine protease indispensible to the viral life cycle, has been identified as one of the key therapeutic targets against SARS. A combined ligand and structure-based virtual screening was carried out against the Asinex Platinum collection. Multiple low micromolar inhibitors of the enzyme were identified through this search, one of which also showed activity against SARS-CoV in a whole cell CPE assay. Furthermore, multinanosecond explicit solvent simulations were carried out using the docking poses of the identified hits to study the overall stability of the binding site interactions as well as identify important changes in the interaction profile that were not apparent from the docking study. Cumulative analysis of the evaluated compounds and the simulation studies led to the identification of certain protein-ligand interaction patterns which would be useful in further structure based design efforts.","Mukherjee, Prasenjit; Shah, Falgun; Desai, Prashant; Avery, Mitchell",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/ci1004916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21604711/,667

The overall incidence of neonatal sepsis, based on clinical symptoms and defined as proven (by a positive blood culture) or suspected (no positive blood culture), was significantly higher in the EA group (6.0% vs 2.2%; p = 0.002), but the incidence of proven neonatal sepsis alone was not (0.4% vs 0%; p = 0.250). EA turned out to be an independent risk factor for neonatal sepsis (adjusted OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.15-5.13; p = 0.020). However, in the EA group as well as the non-EA group, the incidence of neonatal sepsis was significantly higher in mothers with intrapartum fever compared with afebrile mothers (11.0% vs 2.9% in the EA group; p = 0.004; 8.2% vs 1.3% in the non-EA group; p = 0.006). Therefore we conclude, that the positive association between neonatal sepsis and labour EA is possibly mediated by maternal intrapartum fever.","Wassen, M M L H; Winkens, B; Dorssers, E M I; Marcus, M A; Moonen, R M J; Roumen, F J M E",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.3109/01443615.2014.925858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24937098/,667

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients were randomly assigned to once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg, 3.0 mg, or 4.5 mg for 52 weeks. The primary objective was determining superiority of dulaglutide 3.0 mg and/or 4.5 mg over 1.5 mg in HbA1c reduction at 36 weeks. Secondary superiority objectives included change in body weight. Two estimands addressed efficacy objectives: treatment regimen (regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue medication) and efficacy (on treatment without rescue medication) in all randomly assigned patients. RESULTS Mean baseline HbA1c and BMI in randomly assigned patients (N = 1,842) was 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) and 34.2 kg/m2, respectively. At 36 weeks, dulaglutide 4.5 mg provided superior HbA1c reductions compared with 1.5 mg (treatment-regimen estimand: -1.77 vs. -1.54% [-19.4 vs. -16.8 mmol/mol], estimated treatment difference [ETD] -0.24% (-2.6 mmol/mol), P < 0.001; efficacy estimand: -1.87 vs. -1.53% [-20.4 vs. -16.7 mmol/mol], ETD -0.34% (-3.7 mmol/mol), P < 0.001). Dulaglutide 3.0 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for reducing HbA1c, using the efficacy estimand (ETD, -0.17% [-1.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.003) but not the treatment-regimen estimand (ETD, -0.10% [-1.1 mmol/mol ]; P = 0.096). Dulaglutide 4.5 mg was superior to 1.5 mg for weight loss at 36 weeks for both estimands (treatment regimen: -4.6 vs. -3.0 kg, ETD, -1.6 kg, P < 0.001; efficacy: -4.7 vs. -3.1 kg, ETD, -1.6 kg, P < 0.001). Common adverse events through 36 weeks included nausea (1.5 mg, 13.4%; 3 mg, 15.6%; 4.5 mg, 16.4%) and vomiting (1.5 mg, 5.6%; 3 mg, 8.3%; 4.5 mg, 9.3%). CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin, escalation from dulaglutide 1.5 mg to 3.0 mg or 4.5 mg provided clinically relevant, dose-related reductions in HbA1c and body weight with a similar safety profile.","Frias, Juan P; Bonora, Enzo; Nevarez Ruiz, Luis; Li, Ying G; Yu, Zhuoxin; Milicevic, Zvonko; Malik, Raleigh; Bethel, M Angelyn; Cox, David A",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-1473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397768/,667

The most common neurological symptoms are dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, ataxia, hypogosis, hyposmia, neuralgia and myalgia. The most common neurological diseases are acute cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, miyelitis and Gullian Barre Syndrome. Methods: In this case report, a patient infected with Covid 19 and diagnosed as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) with anamnesis, clinical and radiological findings is presented. Results: A 50 years old woman presented with weakness of both legs, urine retention, high fever, and cough. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed expensive long-segment and centrally located demyelinating lesion extending from the cervical cord (at the level of C3) to the conus. Thoracic computerized tomography revealed consolidation areas located on the lower segments of bilateral lungs and ground-glass density, air bronchograms, and peribronchial thickening surrounding these areas. Aquaporin-4 immune globulin-G was found to be positive.

In testing drugs which may be used to treat various diseases or injuries, reducing stress associated with chronic drug delivery to animal models should then be an imperative, which led us to design a reliable voluntary oral drug delivery method. Various drug combinations were tested versus vehicle controls in four different rat stocks or strains (Wistar, Fisher, Long Evans and Sprague Dawley) with our voluntary oral delivery system. Oral medications were placed into a store-bought sugar cookie dough ball (~4 g), thoroughly integrating the dry drugs with the dough. This method has worked consistently to deliver the medication (complete ingestion) in four different stocks or strains of rats, with reliabilities ranging from 98.6% to 100%. The percentage of rats in each stock or strain that have at any time during the study had incomplete ingestion of the drugs ranged from 1% in Sprague Dawley, approximately 4% in Wistar and Fisher, to approximately 16% in Long Evans. Both serum and brain samples were analysed for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection of one of our administered drugs: 5 mg/kg fluoxetine. HPLC analysis shows that serum levels are detectable 2-4 h after ingestion, but not 24 h after ingestion. Brain samples however, showed detectable levels of both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine more than a week following ingestion of a single dose, with higher norfluoxetine levels seen following a month of daily administered drugs.","Corbett, Adrian; McGowin, Audrey; Sieber, Scott; Flannery, Tiffany; Sibbitt, Bethany",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1258/la.2012.012018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22969146/,667

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based retrospective cohort studies. SETTING Not applicable. PATIENT(S) Men diagnosed with impaired fertility status and subsequently observed to determine incidence risk in developing testicular cancer (TCa) or prostate cancer (PCa). INTERVENTION(S) Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Pooled risk ratio (RR) differences among male factor infertility subjects compared with a fertile control population, and meta-regression analysis according to age at baseline, mean follow-up, range of study time, and year of publication. RESULT(S) Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were critically examined. Four studies examined male infertility and TCa (n = 161,634; 174 TCa cases), and four examined infertility in relation to PCa (n = 183,950 men; 377 PCa cases) from 1963 to 2014. The pooled RR was 2.033 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66-2.48); heterogeneity: Q = 3.04 (degree of freedom [df] = 3); I2 = 1.55% for TCa and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17-2.4); Q = 23.3(df = 3); I2 = 87.1% for PCa. CONCLUSION(S) Male infertility was associated with a subsequent risk of both TCa and PCa. Although the clinical significance of these findings remains uncertain, future studies should evaluate the underlying mechanisms to determine whether testis and prostate screening practices should be altered in men with male infertility.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently included 'sudden loss of taste (dysgeusia/ageusia) and smell (anosmia/hyposmia)' as symptoms of COVID-19. If indeed these symptoms are reliable and specific forerunner symptoms of COVID-19, then it may facilitate detection and containment of the disease. Hence, we systematically evaluated the contemporary evidence on dysgeusia and anosmia as trigger prodromal symptoms, and their prevalence in COVID-19 patients. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCO host and Web of Science databases were searched between 25 December 2019 and 30 May 2020. RESULTS Of the 13 identified records, eight studies, totalling 11,054 COVID-19 patients, were included, as per the selection criteria. Eligible articles reflected research conducted mostly in the European community, as well as China, the US and Iran. In total, anosmia and dysgeusia symptoms were present in 74.9% and 81.3% ambulatory as well as hospitalized, mild-to-severe cases of COVID-19 patients, respectively. The European, US and Iran data indicate olfactory and gustatory symptoms appear prior to general COVID-19 symptoms in 64.5% and 54.0% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analysing the meager data based on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19. Critical analysis of such macro-data, as and when available, is essential to evaluate their utility as harbingers of COVID-19 onset, and to establish clinical practice guidelines both in dentistry and medicine.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Panduwawala, Chamila",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016357.2020.1787505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762282/,667
99049,Remembering Dr David Allen Margolin.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Electronic health (eHealth) is a multidisciplinary and rapidly evolving field, and thus requires research focused on knowledge accumulation, curation, and translation. Cardiovascular diseases constitute a global health care crisis in which eHealth can provide novel solutions to improve the efficiency and reach of self-management support for patients where they most need it: their homes and communities. A holistic understanding of eHealth projects focused on such case is required to bridge the multidisciplinary gap formed by the wide range of aims and approaches taken by the various disciplines involved. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this review is to facilitate a holistic interpretation of eHealth projects aimed at providing self-management support of cardiovascular diseases in the natural setting of patients, thus priming the use of remote monitoring technologies. The review aims to synthesize the operationalization of frameworks, models, and theories applied to the research and development process of eHealth. METHODS We will use Noblit and Hare's metaethnography approach to review and synthesize researchers' and practitioners' reports on how they applied frameworks, models, and theories in their projects. We will systematically search the literature in 7 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library. We will thoroughly read and code selected studies to extract both raw and contextual data for the synthesis. The relation of the studies will be determined according to the elements of the frameworks, models, or theories the studies applied. We will translate these elements between each other and intend to synthesize holistic principles for eHealth development for the case at hand. RESULTS The search strategy has been completed, data extraction is almost finalized, and the first synthesis approaches are underway. The search yielded 1224 citations and, after we applied the selection criteria, 17 articles remained. We expect to submit the final results for publication in 2019. CONCLUSIONS This review is important because it aims to create a holistic understanding of a multidisciplinary topic at the crossroads of eHealth, cardiovascular diseases, and self-management. The value of metaethnography in contrast to other systematic review methods is that its synthesis approach seeks to generate a new understanding of a topic, while preserving the social and theoretical contexts in which findings emerge. Our results will show how useful this method can be in bridging the multidisciplinary gap of eHealth research and development, to inform and advance the importance of holistic approaches, while showcasing this approach for the case of self-management in cardiovascular diseases.

Approximately 15-20 % of cases of chronic liver diseases in India are caused by HCV infection. In North India, genotype 3 is predominant, whereas genotype 1 is predominant in southern parts of India. The aim of this study was to identify differentially regulated serum proteins in HCV-infected Indian patients (genotypes 1 and 3) using a two-dimensional electrophoresis approach. We identified eight differentially expressed proteins by MS. Expression levels of one of the highly upregulated proteins, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), was validated by ELISA and Western blotting in two independent cohorts. We also confirmed our observation in the JFH1 infectious cell culture system. Interestingly, the HCV core protein enhanced RBP4 levels and partial knockdown of RBP4 had a positive impact on HCV replication, suggesting a possible role for this cellular protein in regulating HCV infection. Analysis of RBP4-interacting partners using a bioinformatic approach revealed novel insights into the possible involvement of RBP4 in HCV-induced pathogenesis. Taken together, this study provided information on the proteome profile of the HCV-infected Indian population, and revealed a link between HCV infection, RBP4 and insulin resistance.","Gouthamchandra, K; Kumar, Anuj; Shwetha, Shivaprasad; Mukherjee, Anirban; Chandra, Madhavi; Ravishankar, B; Khaja, M N; Sadhukhan, Provash Chandra; Das, Saumitra",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.062430-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784414/,667
99104,Just another day for wildlife...,2020-04-04,"INTRODUCTION The environmental scan has been described as an important tool to inform decision-making on policy, planning and programme development in the healthcare sector. Despite the wide adoption of environmental scans, there is no consensus on a working definition within the health services delivery context and methodological guidance on the design and implementation of this approach is lacking in the literature. The objectives of this study are to map the extent, range and nature of evidence that describe the definitions, characteristics, conceptualisations, theoretical underpinnings, study limitations and other features of the environmental scan in the health services delivery literature and to propose a working definition specific to this context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol describes a scoping review based on the methodology outlined by Khalil and colleagues. A comprehensive search strategy was developed by experienced health science librarians in consultation with the research team. A Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) was completed. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles and select studies meeting the inclusion criteria from seven electronic databases: Academic Search Premier, Canadian Business & Current Affairs (CBCA), CINAHL, ERIC, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. The grey literature and reference lists of included articles will also be searched. The data will be analysed and presented in tabular format, and will include a descriptive numerical summary as well as a qualitative thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This protocol provides an audit trail for a scoping review that will advance understanding about the environmental scan and its application in the health services delivery context. The review will propose a working definition and will inform future research to explore the development of a conceptual framework in this context. Findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentations. The scoping review does not require ethics approval.","Charlton, Patricia; Doucet, Shelley; Azar, Rima; Nagel, Daniel A; Boulos, Leah; Luke, Alison; Mears, Kim; Kelly, Katherine J; Montelpare, William J",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494613/,667

99540,Short- and Mid-Term Outcomes after Endoscopic Transanal or Laparoscopic Transabdominal Total Mesorectal Excision for Low Rectal Cancer: A Single Institutional Case-Control Study.,2017,"OBJECTIVES The COVID-19 pandemic enforced an almost complete switch from face-to-face clinical work to tele-neurology. This study explores neurologists' perceptions of telephone and videophone remote consultations. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with neurologists and a GP with a specialist interest (n = 22). Interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom®, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS Four main themes emerged: 'unknown unknowns (risks/uncertainties)', 'better service', 'challenges', and 'beyond the pandemic'. Thematic saturation was achieved by interview 19. Participants highlighted a number of benefits of remote consultations but over 80% also complained of a reduction in work satisfaction. CONCLUSION The sudden introduction of tele-neurology is unlikely to be fully reversed when pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. However, this study confirms tele-neurology cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations. Some patient groups and consultation types require direct contact. Moreover, significant administrative and infrastructural investment will be required to develop the full potential of tele-neurology. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Tele-medicine is capable of improving access and efficiency of specialist neurology services, but limited by lack of non-verbal communication and technical problems. It could enhance service provision with sufficient infrastructural and administrative investment, but may reduce neurologists' job statisfaction.","Courtney, Ellie; Blackburn, Daniel; Reuber, Markus",Patient education and counseling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.12.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478853/,667
99792,Modified Peritoneal Flap Hernioplasty Versus Retromuscular Technique for Incisional Hernia Repair: a Retrospective Cohort Study.,2019,"Background Cardiorespiratory fitness may moderate the association between obesity and all-cause mortality (ie, the ""fat-but-fit"" hypothesis), but unaddressed sources of bias are a concern. Methods and Results Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated as watts per kilogram from a submaximal bicycle test in 77 169 men and women from the UK Biobank cohort and combined with World Health Organization standard body mass index categories, yielding 9 unique fitness-fatness combinations. We also formed fitness-fatness combinations based on bioimpedance as a direct measure of body composition. All-cause mortality was ascertained from death registries. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs. We examined the association between fitness-fatness combinations and all-cause mortality in models with progressively more conservative approaches for accounting for reverse causation, misclassification of body composition, and confounding. Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 1731 participants died. In our base model, unfit men and women had higher risk of premature mortality irrespective of levels of adiposity, compared with the normal weight-fit reference. This pattern was attenuated but maintained with more conservative approaches in men, but not in women. In analysis stratified by sex and excluding individuals with prevalent major chronic disease and short follow-up and using direct measures of body composition, mortality risk was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.17-2.71) times higher in unfit-obese men but not higher in obese-fit men (0.94 [95% CI, 0.60-1.48]). In contrast, there was no increased risk in obese-unfit women (1.09 [95% CI, 0.44-1.05]) as compared with the reference. Conclusions Cardiorespiratory fitness modified the association between obesity and mortality in men, but this pattern appeared susceptible to biases in women.","Tarp, Jakob; Grøntved, Anders; Sanchez-Lastra, Miguel A; Dalene, Knut Eirik; Ding, Ding; Ekelund, Ulf",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.019605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715383/,667

MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. From June 2002 to September 2009, 1459 patients underwent RF ablation of 1543 thyroid nodules with an RF system with internally cooled electrodes at 13 thyroid centers, which were members of Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology. Numbers and types of major and minor complications were assessed. RESULTS The authors observed 48 complications (3.3%), 20 major and 28 minor. The major complications were voice changes (n = 15), brachial plexus injury (n = 1), tumor rupture (n = 3), and permanent hypothyroidism (n = 1). The minor complications were hematoma (n = 15), skin burn (n = 4), and vomiting (n = 9). All patients recovered spontaneously except for one with permanent hypothyroidism and one who underwent surgery. CONCLUSION Although the complication rate of RF ablation is low, various complications may occur; comprehension of complications and suggested technical tips may prevent complications or properly manage those that occur.","Baek, Jung Hwan; Lee, Jeong Hyun; Sung, Jin Yong; Bae, Jae-Ik; Kim, Kyung Tae; Sim, Jungsuk; Baek, Seon Mi; Kim, Young-sun; Shin, Jung Hee; Park, Jeong Seon; Kim, Dong Wook; Kim, Ji-hoon; Kim, Eun-Kyung; Jung, So Lyung; Na, Dong Gyu",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.11110416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21998044/,667
100029,Single-port transumbilical laparoscopic appendectomy: a preliminary multicentric comparative study in 87 patients with acute appendicitis.,2012,"BACKGROUND Congenital inguinal hernia (CIH) is a commonly performed surgical procedure in infants and children. Single port laparoscopic hernia repair using percutaneous internal inguinal ring (IIR) suturing procedure is a widely employed technique for indirect inguinal hernia repair in children. The majority of extracorporeal techniques use extracorporeal knotting and burying the knot subcutaneously. This may result in many drawbacks. The aim of this multicenter study is to introduce a new technique for pediatric inguinal hernia repair using only needles without any laparoscopic instruments. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a multicenter study which was conducted at Pediatric Surgical Departments of Al-Azhar, Mansoura, Alexandria and Tanta Universities during the period from January 2015 to June 2017. 314 patients with CIH underwent Needlescopic Assisted Internal Ring Suturing (NAIRS) after cauterization of the hernia sac at its neck. The main outcome measures were: feasibility, safety of the technique, operative time, recurrence rate, hydrocele and cosmetic results. RESULTS A total of 314 patients with CIH were corrected by NAIRS. They were 232 males and 82 females. The mean age was 28.12 ± 1.3 months (range 6-120 months). The mean operative time was 12.6 ± 1.7 min (range 8-15 min) for unilateral cases and 18.6 ± 1.7 min (range 14-20 min) for the bilateral repairs. All cases were completed laparoscopically without major intraoperative complications. No recurrence was detected in this study. No wound complications or umbilical hernias developed. Hydrocele occurred in five males (2.16%), without detection of testicular atrophy or iatrogenic ascent of the testis. CONCLUSION This preliminary study showed that NAIRS after cauterization of the neck of the hernia sac in infants and children is safe, feasible, reproducible with excellent cosmetic results.","Shalaby, R; Elsaied, A; Shehata, S; Shehata, Sh; Hamed, A; Alsamahy, O; Ashour, Y; Elsayaad, I; Shahin, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-019-01982-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129795/,667

100350,Single-port laparoscopy and extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy for locally advanced cervical cancer: assessment after 52 consecutive patients.,2014,"Long-term inhalation of carbon black nanoparticles (CBNPs) leads to pulmonary inflammatory diseases. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has been identified as an important regulator in the development of inflammatory disorders. However, the direct involvement of HDAC6 in CBNPs-induced pulmonary inflammatory responses remains unclear. To explore whether HDAC6 participates in CBNPs-induced pulmonary inflammation, human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE cells) was transfected with HDAC6 small interference RNA (siRNA) and then exposed to CBNPs at concentrations of 0, 25, and 50 µg/ml for 24 h. Intracellular HDAC6 and intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) mRNA and protein were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The secretions of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CBNPs induced a significant increase in the expressions of IL-8 and IL-6, accompanied by a high level of intracellular HDAC6 mRNA when compared with a blank control group (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant changes in the levels of TNF-α secretion, intracellular HDAC6 and IFT88 protein induced by CBNPs (p > 0.05). The HDAC6 mRNA expression was significantly suppressed in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells (p < 0.05). The secretions of IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 were significantly less in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells than that in normal 16HBE cells with exposure to 25 or 50 µg/ml of CBNPs, but intracellular IFT88 mRNA expression was markedly increased in HDAC6 siRNA-transfected cells when compared with normal 16HBE cells exposed to 50 µg/ml of CBNPs (all p < 0.05). Downregulation of the HDAC6 gene inhibits CBNPs-induced inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells, partially through regulating IFT88 expression. It is suggested that CBNPs may trigger inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells by an HDAC6/IFT88-dependent pathway.","Lin, Hui; Fu, Guoqing; Yu, Qimei; Wang, Zhenyu; Zuo, Yao; Shi, Yuqin; Zhang, Ling; Gu, Yingying; Qin, Lingzhi; Zhou, Ting",Toxicology and industrial health,https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233720947214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783763/,667

To our knowledge, our study is the first one to evaluate the local effects of inhalation anesthetics in human bronchoalveolar cells in patients. METHODS American Society of Anesthesiologists group I-II patients scheduled for lumbar discectomy surgery were enrolled in this randomized prospective study. Patients were randomized to sevoflurane or desflurane for anesthesia maintenance. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples and peripheral blood samples were taken at 2-time points: the first point (baseline, T1); and the second point (postexposure, T2). Final number of 48 samples were the sevoflurane (n = 22) and desflurane (n = 26) groups. Comet assay was applied to examine genotoxic properties. Oxidative DNA damage in plasma was measured with 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). RESULTS T2 values were higher than baseline values in both the desflurane group (tail-length: 66 ± 24, %DNA in tail: 72 ± 60, tail moment: 47.52 ± 14.4; P = .001, P = .005, P = .001, respectively) and the sevoflurane group (tail-length: 58 ± 33, %DNA in tail: 88 ± 80, tail moment: 51.04 ± 26.4; P = .001, P = .012, P = .001, respectively). T2 plasma 8-OHdG levels were also higher than baseline levels in the desflurane group (3.91 ± 0.19 ng/ml vs 1.32 ± 0.20 ng/ml, P = .001) and sevoflurane group (3.98 ± 0.18 ng/ml vs 1.31 ± 0.11 ng/ml, P = .001). There were no differences between the 2 groups in comet parameters and 8-OHdG levels. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that both inhalation agents cause DNA damage in the bronchoalveolar cells. Also, we detected increases in plasma 8-OHdG concentrations. Local genotoxicity and systemic oxidized DNA damage were similar in both groups.","Cukurova, Zafer; Cetingok, Halil; Ozturk, Sukru; Gedikbasi, Asuman; Hergunsel, Oya; Ozturk, Derya; Don, Burak; Cefle, Kivanc; Palanduz, Sukru; Ertem, Devrimsel Harika",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000016518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31393354/,667

This narrowing typically consists of fibrotic scar tissue, which may be due to a variety of diseases. This review focuses on post-intubation (PI) SGS. SGS can result in partial or complete narrowing of the airway. This narrowing is caused by fibrosis and can cause serious breathing difficulties. It can occur in both adults and children. The pathogenesis of post-intubation SGS is not well understood; however, it is considered to be the product of an abnormal healing process. This review discusses how intubation can change the local micro-environment, leading to dysregulated tissue repair. We discuss how mucosal inflammation, local hypoxia and biomechanical stress associated with intubation can promote excess tissue deposition that occurs during the pathological process of SGS.","Dorris, Emma R; Russell, John; Murphy, Madeline",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0218-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472959/,667

Viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) account for most ARTIs. The virus causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections mostly in young children and contributes to hospitalization of individuals with asthma,chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cancer. Moreover, hMPV pauses a considerable socio-economic impact creating a substantial disease burden wherever it has been studied, although hMPV testing is relatively new in many countries. We aimed to comprehensively analyze the epidemiological aspects including prevalence, disease burden and seasonality of hMPV infections in children in the world. We acquired published data extracted from PubMed and PubMed Central articles using the title and abstract (TIAB)search strategy for the major key words on hMPV infections from 9/54 African, 11/35 American, 20/50 Asian, 2/14 Australian/Oceanian and 20/51 European countries. According to the findings of this review, the prevalence of hMPV infection ranges from 1.1 to 86% in children of less than 5 years of age globally. Presence of many hMPV genotypes (A1, A2, B1, B2) and sub-genotypes (A2a, A2b, A2c, B2a, B2b) suggests a rapid evolution of the virus with limited influence by time and geography. hMPV infection mostly affects children between 2 to 5 years of age. The virus is active throughout the year in the tropics and epidemics occur during the winter and spring in temperate climates, contributing to a substantial disease burden globally.","Divarathna, Maduja V M; Rafeek, Rukshan A M; Noordeen, Faseeha",Reviews in medical virology,https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31788915/,667
100764,Total laparoscopic hysterectomy with single-port access without vaginal surgery.,2009,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate associations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration with duration of hospitalization and with outcome in puppies with canine parvoviral enteritis. DESIGN Prospective observational study. Animals-79 client-owned puppies with naturally acquired canine parvovirus infection. PROCEDURES All puppies received supportive care. Serum CRP concentration was measured at the time of admission, approximately every 10 to 12 hours for the first 48 hours, and then every 24 hours until discharge from the hospital or death. Associations between outcome and CRP concentration at various time points or changes in CRP concentration over time were assessed via multiple logistic regression. Associations of CRP concentration with survival time and duration of hospitalization among survivors were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression. Use of CRP concentration to predict outcome was evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS Serum CRP concentrations at admission and 12 and 24 hours later were positively associated with odds of death, and CRP concentrations at 12 and 24 hours after admission were negatively associated with survival time for puppies. Among survivors, duration of hospitalization was positively associated with CRP concentrations at 12, 24, and 36 hours after admission. Sensitivity and specificity of CRP concentration to differentiate between survivors and nonsurvivors at 24 hours after admission were 86.7% and 78.7%, respectively (considered moderately accurate). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although serum CRP concentration was associated with outcome in puppies with canine parvovirus enteritis, it did not prove to be a good predictor of outcome when used alone.","McClure, Vanessa; van Schoor, Mirinda; Thompson, Peter N; Kjelgaard-Hansen, Mads; Goddard, Amelia",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.243.3.361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23865878/,667
100967,"Northern Ireland disease surveillance, July to September 2012.",2012,"BACKGROUND Emergency tapes like the ""Paediatric-Emergency-Ruler"" (PaedER) provide drug dosing and recommend medical airway equipment based on estimated patient bodyweight and age. Previous studies have revealed unsatisfactory accuracy in bodyweight estimation, due to the tapes' length-based weight categories. Therefore, we developed a digital algorithm allowing continuous length-based estimation of weight and age. The aim of this study was to compare the new algorithm with the PaedER regarding accuracy in estimating bodyweight and recommendation of medical airway equipment. METHODS Patients with a body length suitable for the PaedER were included in this single centre, prospective clinical observation trial after obtaining informed written parental consent. Bodyweight estimations by the algorithm and PaedER within ± 10% and ± 20% of the actual bodyweight were compared. Furthermore, medical airway equipment suggested by the PaedER and algorithm were compared with the equipment actually used for anaesthesia. Wilcoxon- and McNemar-Tests were used for statistical analysis. Results are median (interquartiles), P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS In total, 489 patients aged 2.0 years (0.4-5.9), with a body length of 89.0 cm (63.5-114.5), weighing 12.8 kg (6.3-19.6), were included. The algorithm's precision of bodyweight estimation within ± 10%/± 20% was significantly higher at 64.0%/91.6% than the PaedER at 55.4%/81.8% (P < 0.001). Compared to PaedER the algorithm showed a higher incidence of correctly recommended medical airway equipment based on its accuracy for age and bodyweight estimation. CONCLUSION The new digital algorithm is an alternative to conventional emergency tapes, showing improved accuracy regarding length-based estimation of bodyweight and recommendation of medical airway equipment.","Both, Ch; Schmitz, A; Buehler, P K; Wittwer, J; Weiss, M; Schmidt, A R",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28791696/,667

A 16-year-old male was referred for an x-ray of the right knee after patellar dislocation following a football injury. The lateral view showed an osteochondral lesion in the lateral femoral condyle and a skyline was suggested to be performed. Despite the patient could manage only 70° of flexion from full extension, a skyline view was obtained by adapting the standard technique which revealed an avulsion fracture at the medial aspect of the patella. Advanced imaging is used for further evaluation when x-ray findings are equivocal, or as a management or intervention tool(s). But not every patient is referred for advanced imaging unless there is an informed clinical reason. Skyline view should therefore be performed as part of trauma knee radiographic series when it is clinically indicated that patellar dislocation has occurred. When the standard skyline view positioning technique is not possible due to limited flexion, it can still be achieved depending on the degree of flexion at the knee.","Gyimah, Prince",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2021.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140261/,667
102055,Single-port gynecologic surgery with a novel surgical platform.,2012,"Our aim was to evaluate the potential role of standard extrinsically activated thromboelastometry (EXTEM) assay in the early detection of neonatal sepsis. We studied 91 hospitalized neonates categorized in two groups: group A included 35 neonates with confirmed sepsis, while group B included 56 neonates with suspected sepsis; 274 healthy neonates served as controls. Whenever sepsis was suspected, EXTEM assay was performed, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE) and Tοllner score were calculated, and clinical findings and laboratory results were recorded. Septic neonates had significantly prolonged clotting time (CT) and clot formation time (CFT), and reduced maximum clot firmness (MCF), compared to neonates with suspected sepsis (p values 0.001, 0.001, and 0.009, respectively) or healthy neonates (p values 0.001, 0.001, and 0.021, respectively). EXTEM parameters (CT, CFT, MCF) demonstrated a more intense hypocoagulable profile in septic neonates with hemorrhagic diathesis than those without (p values 0.021, 0.007, and 0.033, respectively). In septic neonates, CFT was correlated with platelet count, SNAPPE, Tollner score, and day of full enteral feeding (p values 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A ROTEM hypocoagulable profile at admission seems promising for the early detection of sepsis in neonates while the degree of hypocoagulation may be associated with sepsis severity. What is Known: • The early phase of septicemia might be difficult to be recognized in neonates. In adult septic patients, the diagnostic and prognostic role of thromboelastometry (ROTEM) have been extensively investigated. • Limited data are available on the role of ROTEM as an indicator of early neonatal sepsis. What is New: • ROTEM measurements indicate an early appearance of hypocoagulability in neonatal sepsis, while the degree of hypocoagulation might be associated with severity of sepsis. • ROTEM could be a useful tool in the early detection of sepsis in neonates.","Sokou, Rozeta; Giallouros, George; Konstantinidi, Aikaterini; Pantavou, Katerina; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bonovas, Stefanos; Lytras, Theodore; Kyriakou, Elias; Lambadaridis, Ioannis; Gounaris, Antonis; Douramani, Panagiota; Valsami, Serena; Kapsimali, Violetta; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Tsantes, Argirios E",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-017-3072-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29255948/,667
102067,Hand-assisted laparoscopic colectomy: benefits of laparoscopic colectomy at no extra cost.,2009,"BACKGROUND Video-laryngoscopes are marketed for intubation in difficult airway management. They provide a better view of the larynx and may facilitate tracheal intubation, but there is no adequately powered study comparing different types of video-laryngoscopes in a difficult airway scenario or in a simulated difficult airway situation. METHODS/DESIGN The objective of this trial is to evaluate and to compare the clinical performance of three video-laryngoscopes with a guiding channel for intubation (Airtraq™, A. P. Advance™, King Vision™) and three video-laryngoscopes without an integrated tracheal tube guidance (C-MAC™, GlideScope™, McGrath™) in a simulated difficult airway situation in surgical patients. The working hypothesis is that each video-laryngoscope provides at least a 90% first intubation success rate (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval >0.9). It is a prospective, patient-blinded, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 720 patients who are scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia, requiring tracheal intubation at one of the three participating hospitals. A difficult airway will be created using an extrication collar and taping the patients' head on the operating table to substantially reduce mouth opening and to minimize neck movement. Tracheal intubation will be performed with the help of one of the six devices according to randomization. Insertion success, time necessary for intubation, Cormack-Lehane grade and percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score at laryngoscopy, optimization maneuvers required to aid tracheal intubation, adverse events and technical problems will be recorded. Primary outcome is intubation success at first attempt. DISCUSSION We will simulate the difficult airway and evaluate different video-laryngoscopes in this highly realistic and clinically challenging scenario, independently from manufacturers of the devices. Because of the sufficiently powered multicenter design this study will deliver important and cutting-edge results that will help clinicians decide which device to use for intubation of the expected and unexpected difficult airway.

102108,"Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery, experience with 50 consecutive cases.",2011,"Hemodialysis catheters are used to support blood filtration, yet there are multiple fundamentally different approaches to catheter tip design with no clear optimal solution. Side-holes have been shown to increase flow rates and decrease recirculation but have been associated with clotting/increased infection rates. This study investigates the impact of changing the shape, size and number of side-holes on a simple symmetric tip catheter by evaluating the velocity, shear stress and shear rate of inflowing blood. A platelet model is used to examine the residence time and shear history of inflowing platelets. The results show that side-holes improve the theoretical performance of the catheters, reducing the maximum velocity and shear stress occurring at the tip compared to non-side-hole catheters. Increasing the side-hole area improved performance up to a point, past which not all inflow through the hole was captured, and instead a small fraction slowly 'washed-out' through the remainder of the tip resulting in greater residence times and increasing the likelihood of platelet adhesion. An oval shaped hole presents a lower chance of external fibrin formation compared to a circular hole, although this would also be influenced by the catheter material surface topology which is dependent on the manufacturing process. Overall, whilst side-holes may be associated with increased clotting and infection, this can be reduced when side-hole geometry is correctly implemented though; a sufficient area for body diameter (minimising residence time) and utilising angle-cut, oval shaped holes (reducing shear stress and chances of fibrin formation partially occluding holes).","Owen, David G; de Oliveira, Diana C; Qian, Shuang; Green, Naomi C; Shepherd, Duncan E T; Espino, Daniel M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764790/,667

DESIGN Cross-sectional. SETTING Community ice hockey teams from Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Parents and coaches of ice hockey players (ages 11-17, all divisions of play). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Participants completed a questionnaire developed and validated to measure concussion knowledge, beliefs and concussion management behaviour (ie, coaches removing athletes from play; parents taking children with suspected concussions to physicians) consistent with the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). The questionnaire examined specific HAPA constructs (ie, risk perception, outcome expectancies, action self-efficacy, intention, action planning, maintenance self-efficacy, recovery self-efficacy) relevant to concussion management behaviour. RESULTS Participants included 786 parents (31.8% with coaching experience) and 10 non-parent coaches. Of the participants, 649 (82.6%) previously received concussion education. Based on a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for coaching experience, previous history of a child sustaining one or more concussions, first aid experience and cluster by team, exposure to concussion education was associated with a mean score difference of 1.36 (95% CI 0.68 to 2.03), p<0.0001, in the knowledge score. Exposure to concussion education was not significantly associated with any of the HAPA constructs based on Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. CONCLUSION Exposure to concussion education may be associated with small overall differences in concussion knowledge but may not be associated with significant differences in beliefs or intended behaviours related to concussion management among youth hockey parents and coaches.When providing education or recommendations for concussion education sources to coaches and parents, educational strategies grounded in behavioural change theory that specifically target the motivators of behavioural change should be considered.","Black, Amanda M; Yeates, Keith Owen; Babul, Shelina; Nettel-Aguirre, Alberto; Emery, Carolyn A",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830117/,667

METHODS We utilized a combination of in silico- and molecular-based approaches to profile and compare CYP expression/activity in human adult liver and fetal tissues. Using public datasets, we evaluated human CYP expression between: 1) placenta vs. adult livers; 2) fetal vs. adult livers; or 3) five compartments of the human placenta. We generated new experimental data, characterizing expression levels of nine CYPs in placenta/fetal liver vs. adult liver. In a subset of samples, we evaluated CYP3A4 activity. Finally, we summarized evidence of human fetal CYP expression/activity and environmental exposures during pregnancy. RESULTS In silico, CYPs were predominately expressed at higher levels in the adult liver vs. fetal tissues, with a few noted exceptions. Sixty percent of CYP enzymes were expressed at nominal levels in the placenta. In wet-lab analyses, we observed significant CYP-specific differences in expression/activity between adult and fetal tissues; CYP2E1 and -3A4 were expressed significantly lower in fetal vs. adult livers, while CYP2J2 levels were similar. DISCUSSION We provide a qualitative review of the expression of the CYP enzyme family in critical sites of xenobiotic distribution during human pregnancy and novel quantitative data regarding fetal CYP expression and activity during mid-gestation.

The authors provide a thorough analysis of clinical and angiographic outcomes across a large patient cohort. METHODS The authors reviewed their endovascular database from January 1996 to September 2015 to identify patients harboring cranial dAVFs who were treated initially with endovascular approaches. They extracted demographic, presentation, angiographic, detailed treatment, and long-term follow-up data, and they evaluated natural history, initial angiographic occlusion, complications, recurrence, and symptomatic resolution rates. RESULTS Across a cohort of 251 patients with 260 distinct dAVFs, the overall initial angiographic occlusion rate was 70%; recurrence or occult residual lesions were seen on subsequent angiography in 3% of cases. The overall complication rate was 8%, with permanent neurological complications occurring in 3% of cases. Among 102 patients with dAVFs without cortical venous reflux, rates of resolution/improvement of pulsatile tinnitus and ocular symptoms were 79% and 78%, respectively. Following the introduction of Onyx during the latter half of the study period, the number of treated dAVFs doubled; the initial angiographic occlusion rate increased significantly from 60% before the use of Onyx to 76% after (p = 0.01). In addition, during the latter period compared with the pre-Onyx period, the rate of dAVFs obliterated via a transarterial-only approach was significantly greater (43% vs 23%, p = 0.002), as was the number of dAVFs obliterated via a single arterial pedicle (29% vs 11%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Overall, in the Onyx era, the rate of initial angiographic occlusion was approximately 80%, as was the rate of meaningful clinical improvement in tinnitus and/or ocular symptoms after initial endovascular treatment of cranial dAVFs.","Gross, Bradley A; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Moon, Karam; McDougall, Cameron G",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.5.jns16331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27588586/,667

However, data on the biological significance of SOX-10 expression is limited. Therefore, we investigated immunhistological SOX-10 expression in TNBC and correlated the results with genetic alterations and clinical data. METHODS A tissue microarray including 113 TNBC cases was stained by SOX-10. Immunohistological data of AR, BCL2, CD117, p53 and Vimentin was available from a previous study. Semiconductor-based panel sequencing data including commonly altered breast cancer genes was also available from a previous investigation. SOX-10 expression was correlated with clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and genetic data. RESULTS SOX-10 was significantly associated with CD117 and Vimentin, but not with AR expression. An association of SOX-10 with BCL2, EGFR or p53 staining was not observed. SOX-10-positive tumors harbored more often TP53 mutations but less frequent mutations of PIK3CA or alterations of the PIK3K pathway. SOX-10 expression had no prognostic impact either on disease-free, distant disease-free, or overall survival.

BACKGROUND Patients with CLTI and/or DFI are at risk of amputations if not treated in a timely manner. METHODS We compared the outcomes in patients with CLTI or DFI during two periods; Period 1[P1] (15/03/2019-31/05/2019) and period 2[P2] (15/03/2020-31/05/2020- corresponding to COVID-19 pandemic). RESULTS 139 patients were treated in P1 [mean age 70 years (±11), Male:Female=102:37] while 95 patients were treated in P2 [mean age 67(±12), Male:Female=64:31]. The two cohorts were matched regarding Rutherford category (P=0.25) and GLASS classification (P=0.38). Notably, the time from onset of symptom to clinical presentation was significantly longer [31(1-105) days vs 27(0-78) days, (P=0.017)], whereas the time from presentation to first intervention was significantly shorter [3 (0-61) days vs 5 (0-65) days, (P=0.013)] in P2 compared to P1. There was a significantly higher WCC(P=0.014) and CRP(P=0.004) on admission in P2. Having treatment for CLTI or DFI in P2 was an independent predictor of worse primary patency rate and Freedom from major adverse limb events (F-MALE). At 90 days, amputation-free survival (AFS) and Limb salvage (LS) were noticeably worse in P2 compared to P1 (AFS was 80% and 87% while LS was 64% and 72% in P2 and P1 respectively). CONCLUSIONS Patients with CLTI and DFI experienced a significantly delayed presentation with features of sepsis on admission in P2. Treatment in P2 was a predictor of worse primary patency and F-MALE and therefore close and long follow-up is advisable.","Musajee, Mustafa; Zayed, Hany; Thulasidasan, Narayanan; Sayed, Mohamed; Francia, Federica; Green, Meryl; Arissol, Martin; Lakhani, Alpa; Biasi, Lukla; Patel, Sanjay",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630476/,667

Although previous studies examined the inspiratory work of breathing (WOB), investigation of WOB in the expiratory phase is rare. We estimated tracheal pressure at the tip of the ETT (Ptrach) and calculated expiratory WOB imposed by the ETT, the HME, and the expiratory valve. We examined imposed expiratory WOB in patients under a continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode and during spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs). We hypothesized that imposed expiratory WOB would increase with heightened ventilatory demand. METHODS We measured airway pressure (Paw) and respiratory flow (V). We estimated Ptrach using the equation Ptrach = Paw - K1 × V(K2) - 2.70 × V(L/s)(1.42). K1 and K2 were determined by the inner diameter (ID) of the ETT. Imposed expiratory WOB was calculated from the area of Ptrach above PEEP versus lung volume. We examined imposed expiratory WOB and imposed expiratory resistance in relation to mean expiratory flow. RESULTS We examined 28 patients under CMV mode, and 29 during SBT. During both CMV and SBT, as mean expiratory flow increased, imposed expiratory WOB increased. The regression curves between mean expiratory flow (x) (L/s) and imposed expiratory WOB (y) (J/L) were y = 1.35x(0.83) (R(2) = 0.79) for 7 mm ID ETT under CMV, y = 1.12x(0.82) (R(2) = 0.73) for 8 mm ID ETT under CMV, y = 1.07x(1.04) (R(2) = 0.85) for 7 mm ID ETT during SBT, and y = 0.84x(0.93) (R(2) = 0.75) for 8 mm ID ETT during SBT. Levels of imposed expiratory WOB were affected by ETT diameter and ventilator mode. The reason for increasing imposed expiratory WOB was an increase in expiratory resistance imposed by the ETT and HME. CONCLUSIONS Under mechanical ventilation, imposed expiratory WOB should be considered in patients with higher minute ventilation.","Uchiyama, Akinori; Yoshida, Takeshi; Yamanaka, Hidenori; Fujino, Yuji",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23232731/,667
103620,Feasibility of Catheter Placement Under Ultrasound Guidance for Progressive Preoperative Pneumoperitoneum for Large Incisional Hernia with Loss of Domain.,2015,"The validation of diagnostic methods (and the subsequent results generated by a laboratory) are improved through participation in inter-laboratory comparisons (IC), such as proficiency-testing (PT) programmes and other exercises referred to as 'ring tests' or 'ring trials' (RTs). This is a requirement to comply with international quality standards. Validating a method is a continuous process and taking part in ongoing PT programmes supports the management of a method's life cycle, providing continuing assessment of fitness (sometimes referred to as the 'validation retention status'). Proficiency-testing panel designs ensure that the methods used, particularly diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, are suitably challenged. Appraising PT results over time can illustrate whether the laboratory's performance is stable, improving or worsening, and proficiency tests can also highlight variations in the performance of assays. The development of new proficiency tests can support the implementation of novel diagnostics technologies, such as whole genome sequencing and point-of-care testing, and assist in cross-sectoral partnerships focusing on One Health approaches, which are high on the agenda for infectious disease control. For example, the rapid design and distribution of emergency exempted assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) means that these assays were not as rigorously evaluated as assays for established infectious diseases. Therefore, participation in PT programmes for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand the performance of these assays. While other mechanisms help to underpin laboratory activities, PT has been, and should remain, an integral part of laboratory quality assurance. Resources must be directed towards increasing and improving the quality of PT (for example, availability and accessibility of suitable biological and reference materials are essential for a PT provider to execute its duties), to support established and novel methods such as genomic and point-of-care tests.","Johnson, P; Cabuang, L",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.40.1.3217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140731/,667

Patients with cancer comprised 8.4% of deceased individuals1. Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-194. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. From 10 March to 7 April 2020, 423 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were diagnosed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (from a total of 2,035 patients with cancer tested). Of these, 40% were hospitalized for COVID-19, 20% developed severe respiratory illness (including 9% who required mechanical ventilation) and 12% died within 30 d. Age older than 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, whereas receipt of chemotherapy and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 in patients with cancer is marked by substantial rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes. The association observed between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes in our study will need further interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts.","Robilotti, Elizabeth V; Babady, N Esther; Mead, Peter A; Rolling, Thierry; Perez-Johnston, Rocio; Bernardes, Marilia; Bogler, Yael; Caldararo, Mario; Figueroa, Cesar J; Glickman, Michael S; Joanow, Alexa; Kaltsas, Anna; Lee, Yeon Joo; Lucca, Anabella; Mariano, Amanda; Morjaria, Sejal; Nawar, Tamara; Papanicolaou, Genovefa A; Predmore, Jacqueline; Redelman-Sidi, Gil; Schmidt, Elizabeth; Seo, Susan K; Sepkowitz, Kent; Shah, Monika K; Wolchok, Jedd D; Hohl, Tobias M; Taur, Ying; Kamboj, Mini",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0979-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581323/,667

Applications range from labels for detection in different analytical assays to the creation of new drugs by conjugation to molecules which improves the pharmaceutical effect. In many of these applications, it has been proven advantageous to control both the site and the stoichiometry of the conjugation to achieve a homogeneous product with predictable, and often also improved, characteristics. For this purpose, many research groups have, during the latest decade, reported novel methods and techniques, based on small molecules, peptides, and proteins with inherent affinity for the antibody, for site-specific conjugation of antibodies.

Methods Postmortem examination data from 61 cases of children whose causes of death were identified as viral pneumonia in recent years were collected from the Center of Forensic Identification, Southern Medical University. The gender, age, clinical symptoms and pathological features were comparatively analyzed. Results Among the 61 cases of children who died of viral pneumonia, most were within 2 years old （83.61%）, and a large proportion died within 2 weeks after the onset of the disease （91.80%）. Gross changes in postmortem examination included respiratory mucosal hyperemia, pleural effusion, pulmonary swelling, variegated pulmonary pleura and serosa, as well as focal pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary edema. A large proportion of sick children had enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes （83.61%） and thymic dysplasia （21.31%）. Histopathological changes included edema of alveoli and interstitial substance, pneumorrhagia，shedding of alveolar epithelial cells, serous and （or） fibrous exudation in the alveoli, formation of viral inclusions, formation of transparent membranes, infiltration of inflammatory cells that mainly consisted of macrophages and lymphocytes in interstitial substance and alveoli. Viral infections often affected the heart and gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion The clinical symptoms of children with viral pneumonia are difficult to notice, and because the immune systems of children are not fully developed and they have poor immunity, they can easily become severely ill and even die. Analyzing the forensic autopsies and the histopathological characteristics could provide reference for pathological diagnosis of viral pneumonia.","Chen, X B; Du, S H; Lu, J C; Tan, X H; Li, D R; Yue, X; Wang, Q; Wang, H J; Qiao, D F",Fa yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12116/j.issn.1004-5619.2020.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530160/,667
104139,Effects of bariatric surgery in different obesity phenotypes: Tehran Obesity Treatment Study (TOTS).,2019,"Health care workers have an increased incidence of allergic disease compared to the general public and are exposed to a variety of high-level disinfectants. While exposure to these agents has been associated with allergic disease, findings between epidemiology and animal studies often conflict respecting immunological mechanisms. Therefore, we hypothesized that previous exposure to a representative IgE-mediated sensitizer, (Ortho-phthalaldehyde [OPA]) alters immune responses to a representative T-cell mediated sensitizer (didecyldimethlyammonium chloride [DDAC]). Here, BALB/c mice were topically exposed to OPA (0.5%) for 3-days, rested, then topically exposed to DDAC (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25%) for 14-days. Co-exposure resulted in phenotypic changes in draining lymph node (dLN) cells, including a decreased frequency of CD8+ T cells and increased frequency and number of B cells compared to DDAC-only treated mice. The co-exposed mice also had enhanced Th2 responses, including significant alterations in: dLN Il4 (increased), B-cell activation (increased), CD8 T-cell activation (decreased), and local and systemic IgE production (increased). These changes were not observed if mice were exposed to DDAC prior to OPA. Exposure to OPA alone shows Th2 skewing, indicated by increased activation of skin type 2 innate lymphoid cells, increased frequency and activation of draining lymph node B cells, and increased levels of type 2 cytokines. These findings suggest that the OPA-induced immune environment may alter the response to DDAC, resulting in increased IgE mediated immune responses. This data may partially explain the discordance between epidemiological and laboratory studies regarding disinfectants and provide insight into the potential immunological implications of mixed chemical exposures.","Shane, Hillary L; Lukomska, Ewa; Weatherly, Lisa; Baur, Rachel; Anderson, Stacey E",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647894/,667

The significance of auricular reconstruction in patients with microtia in terms of quality of life has already been demonstrated. In these patients the use of porous polyethylene combined with a temporoparietal fascia flap has proven to be a suitable method for achieving good cosmetic results. Here, we describe how to use porous polyethylene combined with an endoscopically harvested temporoparietal fascia flap and autologous skin grafts for the reconstruction of acquired partial auricle defects and present outcomes and patient benefit. Ten consecutive patients were asked to answer validated questionnaires [modified Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)] determining the effects of partial ear reconstruction on their health-related quality of life. These patients were seen regularly in our outpatient clinic for documentation and postoperative counseling. All patients returned a valid questionnaire; 80% were satisfied with the esthetic result. In retrospect, all patients would again decide to undergo surgery. The mean total GBI score was 27.8 (median 29.2, p < 0.05) reflecting an improvement of the health-related quality of life due to the operation. Odd feeling, numbness and the formation of scar tissue were the main complaints. Partial auricular reconstruction using porous polyethylene combined with an endoscopically harvested temporoparietal fascia flap and autologous skin grafts yields good esthetic results and can significantly increase patient's health-related quality of life.","Hempel, John-Martin; Braun, Thomas; Patscheider, Martin; Berghaus, Alexander; Kisser, Ulrich",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-013-2797-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24213274/,667

104184,Single-port laparoscopic surgery is applicable to most gynecologic surgery: a single surgeon's experience.,2012,"INTRODUCTION The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation prioritized the need to update the review on the use of targeted temperature management (TTM) in paediatric post cardiac arrest care. In this meta-analysis, the effectiveness of TTM at 32-36 °C was compared with no target or a different target for comatose children who achieve a return of sustained circulation after cardiac arrest. METHODS Electronic databases were searched from inception to December 13, 2018. Randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies with a comparator group that evaluated TTM in children were included. Pairs of independent reviewers extracted the demographic and outcome data, appraised risk of bias, and assessed GRADE certainty of effects. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken where possible. RESULTS Twelve studies involving 2060 patients were included. Two randomized controlled trials provided the evidence that TTM at 32-34 °C compared with a target at 36-37.5 °C did not statistically improve long-term good neurobehavioural survival (risk ratio: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.69-1.93), long-term survival (RR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.93-1.39), or short-term survival (risk ratio: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.96-1.36). TTM at 32-34 °C did not show statistically increased risks of infection, recurrent cardiac arrest, serious bleeding, or arrhythmias. A novel analysis suggests that another small RCT might provide enough evidence to show benefit for TTM in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. CONCLUSION There is currently inconclusive evidence to either support or refute the use of TTM at 32-34 °C for comatose children who achieve return of sustained circulation after cardiac arrest. Future trials should focus on children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.","Buick, Jason E; Wallner, Clare; Aickin, Richard; Meaney, Peter A; de Caen, Allan; Maconochie, Ian; Skifvars, Markus B; Welsford, Michelle",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.03.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30951842/,667

ISG15, a di-ubiquitin-like protein, is one of the most abundantly induced ISGs and is critical for control of certain viral and bacterial infections. Like ubiquitin, ISG15 is covalently conjugated to target proteins. In addition, free unconjugated ISG15 is present both intra- and extracellularly. Although much remains to be learned about conjugated ISG15, even less is known about the 2 free forms of ISG15.

A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to detect nucleic acids from viruses and bacteria known to be associated with respiratory disease in cattle: Bovine coronavirus (Betacoronavirus 1), Bovine herpesvirus 1, Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 and 2, Bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Bovine parainfluenza virus 3, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida. The most commonly diagnosed cause of death was respiratory disease (107/180, 59.4%), followed by lameness (n = 22, 12.2%), ketosis (n = 12, 6.7%), septicemia (n = 11, 6.1%), and enteric disease (n = 10, 5.6%). Two thirds (130/195) of animals from which lung samples were collected had histologic changes and/or positive qRT-PCR results indicative of infectious lung disease: 93 out of 130 (72%) had evidence of bacterial infection, 4 (3%) had viral infection, and 29 (22%) had mixed bacterial and viral infections, and for 4 (3%) the causative organism could not be identified. Bovine coronavirus was detected in up to 13% of cattle tested, and this finding is likely to have important implications for the management and treatment of respiratory disease in live export cattle.

As of August 22, 2020, the pandemic infected more than 23,329,752 including 807,054 patients who have died. Although the main clinical features of the pandemic disease are respiratory, cerebrovascular comorbidities emerged as one of the leading causes of death associated with COVID-19. Different case reports have indicated that C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer (pro-inflammatory biomarkers) were elevated in COVID-19 patients, which can significantly increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Available data on cerebrovascular complications in COVID-19 patients were collected and a meta-analysis was designed and carried out to evaluate the risk of severity and mortality associated with high levels of CRP and D-dimer levels in COVID-19 patients. In addition, we aimed to describe the overall event rate of pre-existing cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. In our analysis, 5,614 cases have been studied, out of these patients 164 cases have developed cerebrovascular comorbities. Cerebrovascular comorbidity increased the risk of disease severity (odd ratio = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.48 to 12.84) and mortality (odd ratio = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.56 to 18.99). Statistical analyses showed that CRP and D-dimer serum levels were elevated by six-folds in the severe cases of COVID-19 patients. This significant increase in these two proteins levels can serve as a vital indicator for COVID-19 patients who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 cerebrovascular complications, such as stroke.","Alzoughool, Foad; Alanagreh, Lo'ai; Abumweis, Suhad; Atoum, Manar",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,https://doi.org/10.3233/ch-201002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185593/,667

Several techniques have been described such as IPOM, MILOS, TES, EMILOS, SCOLA, e-TEP. e-TEP was originally conceptualized as an alternative approach to inguinal hernia in difficult cases (obese, previous scars) and for training surgery residents. Application of this approach for ventral hernia repair has recently been reported by few surgeons. We present our experience of e-TEP approach for ventral hernia from a tertiary care center in South India over one year duration. MATERIALS AND METHODS Electronically maintained data of patients who underwent e-TEP for ventral hernia during a period of November 2017 to November 2018 was reviewed retrospectively. Their demographic data, intraoperative details, postoperative complications and follow up data for a period of 6 months was noted. RESULTS 171 patients underwent e-TEP approach ventral hernia repair. Mean age was 49.34 ± 10.75 years with hypertension being most common comorbidity. Mean BMI was 29.2 ± 4.1 kg/m2. Mean defect area was 51.35 ± 45.09 cm2 and mean mesh size used was 397.56 ± 208.83 cm2. Fifty patients required TAR. Mean duration of surgery was 176.75 ± 62.42 min and blood loss was 78.7 ± 24.4 ml. Mean length of stay was 2.18 ± 1.27 days. Seven cases had paralytic ileus, 5 cases had surgical site infection, and 3 cases had recurrence at 6 months follow up. CONCLUSION e-TEP is a minimally invasive approach which is safe, feasible and also avoids placement of mesh in peritoneal cavity. Since it is a relatively new approach it requires further studies for standardization of techniques, criteria for patient selection and to study long-term outcomes.","Prakhar, Gupta; Parthasarathi, Ramakrishnan; Cumar, Bharath; Subbaiah, Rajapandian; Nalankilli, V P; Praveen Raj, P; Palanivelu, Chinnusamy",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07595-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347388/,667

In this study, chickens vaccinated with a low dose (1.6 × 10(3) EID50/bird, where EID50 is 50% embryo infectious dose) of CEK-adapted Ark vaccine at 5 days of age showed a significant reduction of IBV RNA in lachrymal fluids and decreased incidence of IBV RNA detection in tracheal swabs 5 days after challenge compared to unvaccinated challenged chickens. In a second experiment, 5-day-old chickens were vaccinated with 10(4) or 10(5) EID50/chicken of CEK-adapted Ark vaccine, and protection was compared to chickens vaccinated with 10(5) EID50/chicken of the commercial ArkDPI-derived vaccine from which the CEK-adapted virus originated. All vaccinated chicken groups showed a significant reduction of respiratory signs and viral load 5 days after Ark virulent challenge compared to unvaccinated challenged controls. No viral subpopulations different from the challenge virus were detected in chickens vaccinated with CEK-Ark after challenge. In contrast, IBV S1 sequences differing from the predominant population in the challenge virus were detected in several chickens vaccinated with the commercial Ark attenuated vaccine. From an applied perspective, the CEK-adapted IBV ArkDPI-derived vaccine is an improved and effective vaccine candidate with which to protect chickens against virulent Ark-type strains.","Ghetas, A M; van Santen, V L; Joiner, K; Toro, H",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11291-093015-reg; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309281/,667
105763,Totally stapled gastrojejunal anastomosis using hybrid NOTES: single 12-mm trocar approach in a porcine model.,2012,"Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and are emerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and automotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to holography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts. Although speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the previous works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is well studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual field, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we present the first method that reduces the ""perceived speckle noise"" by integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation. Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being adaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display. Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.","Chakravarthula, Praneeth; Zhang, Zhan; Tursun, Okan; Didyk, Piotr; Sun, Qi; Fuchs, Henry",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2021.3106433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449368/,667

This study investigated the role of electroacupuncture in the immune balance of SHRs using Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA techniques. Electroacupuncture significantly improved blood pressure, downregulated the expression of RORγt, and upregulated the expression of Foxp3, reduced the production of Th17 cells, promoted the production of Treg cells, reduced the secretion of IL-6 and IL-17, and increased the secretion of TGF-β1 and IL-10. These findings suggest that electroacupuncture therapy effectively improved the systolic blood pressure of SHRs, and its mechanism may be related to promotion of the immune balance between Th17 and Treg.","Wang, Yang; Zhang, Lili; Li, Li; Hu, Hantong; Pan, Pan; Zhang, Baoyu; Ning, Wenhua; Zhao, Mengxiong; Wang, Shu",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5375981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724324/,667

While ezetimibe gained Food and Drug Administration approval in 2002, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. Here, we present two cryo-electron microscopy structures of NPC1L1, one in its apo form and the other complexed with ezetimibe. The apo form represents an open state in which the N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts loosely with the rest of NPC1L1, leaving the NTD central cavity accessible for cholesterol loading. The ezetimibe-bound form signifies a closed state in which the NTD rotates ~60°, creating a continuous tunnel enabling cholesterol movement into the plasma membrane. Ezetimibe blocks cholesterol transport by occluding the tunnel instead of competing with cholesterol binding. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol transport and ezetimibe inhibition, paving the way for more effective therapeutic development.","Huang, Ching-Shin; Yu, Xinchao; Fordstrom, Preston; Choi, Kaylee; Chung, Ben C; Roh, Soung-Hun; Chiu, Wah; Zhou, Mingyue; Min, Xiaoshan; Wang, Zhulun",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb1989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596471/,667

106221,Initial experience of single-port surgery assisted by percutaneous instruments for gastric bypass: a combination of safety and minimally invasive surgery.,2013,"OBJECTIVES To assess the ability of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to visualise, differentiate and track periprostatic nerves in an in vivo rat model, mimicking real-time imaging in humans during RP and to investigate the tissue toxicity and reproducibility of in vivo MPM on prostatic glands in the rat after imaging and final histological correlation study. MATERIALS AND METHODS In vivo prostatic rat imaging was carried out using a custom-built bench-top MPM system generating real-time three-dimensional histological images, after performing survival surgery consisting of mini-laparotomies under xylazine/ketamine anaesthesia exteriorising the right prostatic lobe. The acquisition time and the depth of anaesthesia were adjusted for collecting multiple images in order to track the periprostatic nerves in real-time. The rats were then monitored for 15 days before undergoing a new set of imaging under similar settings. After humanely killing the rats, their prostates were submitted for routine histology and correlation studies. RESULTS In vivo MPM images distinguished periprostatic nerves within the capsule and the prostatic glands from fresh unprocessed prostatic tissue without the use of exogenous contrast agents or biopsy sample. Real-time nerve tracking outlining the prostate was feasible and acquisition was not disturbed by motion artefacts. No serious adverse event was reported during rat monitoring; no tissue damage due to laser was seen on the imaged lobe compared with the contralateral lobe (control) allowing comparison of their corresponding histology. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, we have shown that in vivo tracking of periprostatic nerves using MPM is feasible in a rat model. Development of a multiphoton endoscope for intraoperative use in humans is currently in progress and must be assessed.","Durand, Matthieu; Jain, Manu; Aggarwal, Amit; Robinson, Brian D; Srivastava, Abhishek; Smith, Rebecca; Sooriakumaran, Prasanna; Loeffler, Joyce; Pumill, Chris; Amiel, Jean; Chevallier, Daniel; Mukherjee, Sushmita; Tewari, Ashutosh K",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.12903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124551/,667
106327,Minimally invasive surgery for diverticulitis.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Quadrantectomy is a surgical procedure traditionally performed under general anaesthesia with intraoperative and postoperative opioid-based analgesia. The use of locoregional anaesthesia techniques in breast surgery has become widespread and allows excellent management of intraoperative and postoperative pain with reduced opioid consumption. We chose thoracic paravertebral block as regional anaesthesia technique in breast surgery to investigate the possibility of carrying out this surgery with the patient awake. METHODS A prospective observational study on 50 patients was designed. The primary outcome for this study was the possibility to carry out the surgery with only the paravertebral block associated with mild sedation without general anaesthesia. Forty minutes before the start of the surgery, an ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block was performed at two thoracic levels, and for each level, 7 mL of ropivacaine 0.7% was injected. Sedation was obtained with target-controlled infusion of propofol. RESULTS Forty-nine patients underwent the operation awake; in one case, we had to place an I-gel and perform general anaesthesia. No patient needed intraoperative or postoperative opioids. The numeric rating scale, recorded at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours, was greater than 3 in only five patients. CONCLUSIONS Quadrantectomy with exclusively regional anaesthesia and thoracic paravertebral block can be performed with the patient awake and collaborating.","Santonastaso, Domenico P; de Chiara, Annabella; Russo, Emanuele; Gamberini, Emiliano; Lucchi, Leonardo; Sibilio, Andrea; Bagaphou, Claude; Zani, Gianluca; Righetti, Roberto; Rispoli, Marco; Fusari, Maurizio; Agnoletti, Vanni",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891620951626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842912/,667

There was a positive correlation between aerosols and intraocular pressure (IOP), and the concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest. PURPOSE To investigate the effects of intraocular pressure (IOP) on the aerosol density generated during the use of a noncontact tonometer (NCT) and provide references and suggestions for daily protection of ophthalmic medical staff during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. METHODS This cross-sectional clinical trial included 214 eyes of 140 patients from a hospital in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province. All subjects' IOPs were measured by a NCT (39 eyes with low IOP, 90 eyes with normal IOP, 37 eyes with moderately high IOP, 48 eyes with very high IOP) between 7 March and 17 June 2020. The density of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 generated during the process of IOP measurement with a NCT was analyzed. IOP values were recorded simultaneously. The aerosols generated during different IOP measurements were plotted in scatter plots. RESULTS PM2.5 was generated more at the air jet port of the tonometer during the process of IOP measurement (H=2.731, P=0.019). Larger quantities of PM2.5 and PM10 were generated when the IOP was higher, and these differences were statistically significant (PM2.5, H=119.476, P<0.001; PM10: H=160.801, P<0.001). Linear correlation analysis with one variable demonstrated that IOP had significantly positive correlations with PM2.5 (r=0.756, P<0.001) and PM10 (r=0.864, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Aerosols can be generated while using a NCT to measure IOP, and aerosols and IOP are positively correlated. Patients with moderately high IOP or very high IOP tend to generate more aerosols during IOP measurement. The concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest.","Tang, Yuan; Chunchun, Li; Yanyan, Chen; Zhangyan, Chen; Peihua, Zhang; Aisun, Wang; Xiaoqiong, Huang; Jia, Qu; Mengchen, Li; Siwen, Ma; Vasudevan, Balamurali",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941321/,667
107017,[Single port distal pancreatectomy without spleen preserving].,2013,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is widely used although its clinical indications are often debated. The aim of this study is to describe our surgical experience in order to establish the safety, efficacy, feasibility of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and to identify the factors that influence the risk of recurrence in a group of patients treated with only one type of prosthetic mesh and by the same surgical team. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2016, 512 patients were admitted to the General and Urgent Surgery Unit, with diagnosis of ventral hernia. Of these, 244 were operated laparoscopically and 268 in a traditional open surgery. In 244 patients treated by laparoscopy we always used a composite mesh: 185 Parietex™ Composite mesh (Medtronic-Covidien, Minneapolis, USA), the remaining other with other types of prosthetic mesh. The type and size of surgical defects, features of surgical technique, length of hospital stay, rate of conversion, morbidity, mortality, and rate of recurrence at 5 years follow-up were retrospective analysed on the 185 patients who underwent surgery with Parietex™ Composite mesh. RESULTS We performed 185 laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with Parietex™ Composite mesh: 108 (58%) for incisional hernias and 77 (42%) for primary abdominal wall hernias. Mean age was 58 years (19-80). The mean size of abdominal defect was 5 cm (1,5-18), mean BMI was 30,4 kg/m2 (21-47), mean overlap of the mesh was 5 cm (3-6). The mean operative time was 54 min (30-180) and conversion rate was 3,2%. In 61 patients (33%) we performed a transversus abdominis plane block (T.A.P. block) to reduce postoperative pain. The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days (1-26) (2 days, mean value, in patient with preoperative T.A.P. block). The mortality rate was 0%; overall morbidity was 15,6%. At 5-year follow-up we observed 13 (7%) hernia recurrences. The features of patients with recurrence were as follows: mean age 50 years (19-74), mean ASA Score 3 (2-3), mean BMI 31 kg/m2 (21-44), mean size of hernial defect 7,5 cm (larger diameter), mean overlap 4,5 cm (3-6). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic repair of ventral hernia using composite mesh is an effective and safe procedure particularly suitable in the following cases: median and paramedian defects, diameter of defect between 5 and 15 cm, ""swiss cheese"" defects, obesity. In our experience the factors related to the patient and the surgical technique that may influence the onset of early or late recurrence as the follows: a defect size >5 cm (W2 of EHS Classification), an overlap of the mesh < 5 cm, a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or superior and the presence of significant comorbidities (ASA score: 3). Finally, we observed that the T.A.P. Block preoperative procedure can lead to reduced the clinical costs through a lower administration of analgesics used and a lower length of stay.","Nardi, Mario; Millo, Paolo; Brachet Contul, Riccardo; Lorusso, Riccardo; Usai, Antonella; Grivon, Manuela; Persico, Fabio; Ponte, Elisa; Bocchia, Paolo; Razzi, Salvatore",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.02.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28219819/,667

Web-based biosurveillance of childcare centers may represent a novel way to efficiently monitor illness outbreaks year-round. A web-based biosurveillance program ( sickchildcare.org ) was created and implemented in 4 childcare centers in a single Michigan county. Childcare providers were trained to report sick children who required exclusion or had parent-reported absences due to illness. Deidentified data on age range, number of illnesses, and illness categories were collected. Weekly electronic reports were sent to the county public health department. Data for reports were gathered beginning in December 2013 and were summarized using descriptive statistics. A total of 385 individual episodes of illness occurred during the study period. Children with reported illness were infants (16%, n = 61), toddlers (38%, n = 148), and preschoolers (46%, n = 176). Illness categories included: fever (30%, n = 116), gastroenteritis (30%, n = 115), influenzalike illness (8%, n = 32), cold without fever (13%, n = 51), rash (7%, n = 26), conjunctivitis (1%, n = 3), ear infection (1%, n = 5), and other (10%, n = 37). The majority of reports were center exclusions (55%, n = 214); others were absences (45%, n = 171). The detection of a gastroenteritis outbreak by web-based surveillance during winter 2013-14 preceded county health reports by 3 weeks; an additional outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease was detected during June 2014 when standard school-based surveillance was not available. Web-based biosurveillance of illness in childcare centers represents a novel and feasible method to detect disease trends earlier and year-round compared to standard school-based disease surveillance.","Schellpfeffer, Natalie; Collins, Abaigeal; Brousseau, David C; Martin, Emily T; Hashikawa, Andrew",Health security,https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2016.0124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28937791/,667

Mangroves vary substantially according to their geomorphic and sedimentary setting; while several conceptual frameworks describe these settings, their spatial distribution has not been quantified. Here, we present a new global mangrove biophysical typology and show that, based on their 2016 extent, 40.5% (54,972 km2) of mangrove systems were deltaic, 27.5% (37,411 km2) were estuarine and 21.0% (28,493 km2) were open coast, with lagoonal mangroves the least abundant (11.0%, 14,993 km2). Mangroves were also classified based on their sedimentary setting, with carbonate mangroves being less abundant than terrigenous, representing just 9.6% of global coverage. Our typology provides a basis for future research to incorporate geomorphic and sedimentary setting in analyses. We present two examples of such applications. Firstly, based on change in extent between 1996 and 2016, we show while all types exhibited considerable declines in area, losses of lagoonal mangroves (- 6.9%) were nearly twice that of other types. Secondly, we quantify differences in aboveground biomass between mangroves of different types, with it being significantly lower in lagoonal mangroves. Overall, our biophysical typology provides a baseline for assessing restoration potential and for quantifying mangrove ecosystem service provision.","Worthington, Thomas A; Zu Ermgassen, Philine S E; Friess, Daniel A; Krauss, Ken W; Lovelock, Catherine E; Thorley, Julia; Tingey, Rick; Woodroffe, Colin D; Bunting, Pete; Cormier, Nicole; Lagomasino, David; Lucas, Richard; Murray, Nicholas J; Sutherland, William J; Spalding, Mark",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71194-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887898/,667

Strous and Karni note that the revised physician's pledge in the World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva obligates individual physicians to share medical knowledge, which they interpret to mean a requirement to share knowledge publicly and through outreach. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Strous and Karni defend a form of medical paternalism insofar as the individual physician must reach out to communities who may not want, or know to seek out, medical advice, for reasons of public health and health equity. Strous and Karni offer a novel defence of why physicians ought to intervene even in insular communities, and they offer suggestions for how this could be done in culturally sensitive ways. Yet their view rests on an unfounded interpretation of the Geneva Declaration language. More problematically, their paper confuses shared and collective responsibility, misattributing the scope of individual physician obligations in potentially harmful ways. In response, this reply delineates between shared and collective responsibility, and suggests that to defend the obligation of medical outreach Strous and Karni propose, it is better conceptualised as a collective responsibility of the medical profession, rather than a shared responsibility of individual physicians. This interpretation rejects paternalism on the part of individual providers in favour of a more sensitive and collaborative practice of knowledge sharing between physicians and communities, and in the service of collective responsibility.","Lanphier, Elizabeth",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103368/,667

Through in vitro biofilm studies with HA, the hysA mutant was found to accumulate increased biofilm biomass compared to the wild type, and confocal microscopy showed that HA is incorporated into the biofilm matrix. Exogenous addition of purified HysA enzyme dispersed HA-containing biofilms, while catalytically inactive enzyme had no impact. Additionally, induction of hysA expression prevented biofilm formation and also dispersed an established biofilm in the presence of HA. These observations were corroborated in the implant model, where there was decreased dissemination from an hysA mutant biofilm infection compared to the S. aureus wild type. Histopathology demonstrated that infection with an hysA mutant caused significantly reduced distribution of tissue inflammation compared to wild-type infection. To extend these studies, the impact of HA and S. aureus HysA on biofilm-like aggregates found in joint infections was examined. We found that HA contributes to the formation of synovial fluid aggregates, and HysA can disrupt aggregate formation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HA is a relevant component of the S. aureus biofilm matrix and HysA is important for dissemination from a biofilm infection.","Ibberson, Carolyn B; Parlet, Corey P; Kwiecinski, Jakub; Crosby, Heidi A; Meyerholz, David K; Horswill, Alexander R",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.01418-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068096/,667
108128,Linear salpingotomy with suturing by single incision laparoscopic surgery for tubal ectopic pregnancy.,2010,"Introduction: Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inflammatory disease in people older than 50 years of Northern European descent. It is characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders, arms, hips, and neck. Relapses are common in patients with PMR. Areas covered: The review describes when and how relapses occur in patients with PMR. Potential predisposing factors associated with relapses and management are also discussed. An extensive literature search on PubMed database was conducted for publications on ""polymyalgia rheumatica"" AND ""relapses"" AND ""risk factors"". Expert opinion: Relapses are common in PMR being observed in approximately half of the patients. They often occur when the dose of prednisone is low, generally below 5-7.5 mg/day or when the prednisone has been discontinued. Several risk factors for the development of PMR relapses have been proposed. The speed of glucocorticoid tapering is considered the main factor influencing the development of relapses in isolated PMR. In addition, a genetic component may favor the presence of relapses in isolated PMR. Studies on the involvement of HLA genes revealed that HLA-DRB1*04 patients, particularly those carrying the HLA-DRB1*0401 allele, were at increased risk of relapse. An implication of the IL-6 promoter -174 G/C polymorphism was also reported. Furthermore, PMR patients with the HLA-DRB1 * 0401 and the GG241 ICAM-1 genotype had a higher risk of relapse after correction for age and sex. With regard to serological biomarkers, elevated levels of angiopoietin-2 were associated with an unfavorable course of PMR. Methotrexate and anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab may be required in PMR patients with multiple relapses.","Prieto-Peña, Diana; Castañeda, Santos; Atienza-Mateo, Belén; Blanco, Ricardo; González-Gay, Miguel A",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1890032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570454/,667

Increasingly, rehabilitation for these impairments has moved into the community and home settings through the use of home programs. However, adherence to these programs is often low, limiting effectiveness.Objective: This scoping review investigated home program implementation and measurement of adherence with persons post-stroke to identify commonly reported practices and determine areas for further research.Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PEDro were searched. Studies focused on post-stroke rehabilitation with an independent home program were selected. Qualitative studies, commentaries, and single-case studies were excluded. Title and abstract screenings were completed by two reviewers with a third for tie-breaking. The full-text review was completed by two reviewers using consensus to resolve any differences. Of the 1,197 articles initially found only 6% (n = 70) met criteria for data extraction. Elements for data extraction included: type of study, area of intervention, description of home program, presence of strategies to support adherence, methods to measure adherence and reported adherence.Results: Most commonly reported strategies to support home practice were the use of technology, personalization, and written directions. Only 20 studies reported achieving adherence at or greater than 75% and 18 studies did not report adherence outcomes.Conclusions: Future investigations that directly compare and identify the most effective strategies to support adherence to home programs for this population are warranted. The implementation of guidelines for reporting adherence to home programs is recommended.","Donoso Brown, Elena V; Nolfi, David; Wallace, Sarah E; Eskander, Joanna; Hoffman, Jeanne M",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/10749357.2019.1707950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31891554/,667

Our objective was to compare these two emerging strategies that challenge the use of intraoperative opioids. We aimed to assess if intraoperative esmolol infusion is not inferior to lidocaine infusion for opioid consumption after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority clinical trial, 90 female patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy received either intravenous (IV) lidocaine bolus 1.5 mg/kg at induction followed by an infusion (1.5 mg/ kg/h) or IV bolus of esmolol 0.5 mg/kg at induction followed by an infusion (5-15 μg/kg/min) till the end of surgery. Remaining aspect of anesthesia followed a standard protocol apart from no intraoperative opioid supplementation. Postoperatively, patients received either morphine or tramadol IV to maintain visual analogue scale (VAS) scores ≤3. The primary outcome was opioid consumption (in morphine equivalents) during the first 24 postoperative hours. Pain and sedation scores, time to first perception of pain and void, and occurrence of nausea/vomiting were secondary outcomes measured up to 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS Two patients in each group were excluded from the analysis. The postoperative median (IQR) morphine equivalent consumption in patients receiving esmolol was 1 (0-1.5) mg compared to 1.5 (1-2) mg in lidocaine group (p = 0.27). The median pain scores at various time points were similar between the two groups (p > 0.05). More patients receiving lidocaine were sedated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) than those receiving esmolol (p < 0.05); however, no difference was detected later. CONCLUSION Infusion of esmolol is not inferior to lidocaine in terms of opioid requirement and pain severity in the first 24 h after surgery. Patients receiving lidocaine were more sedated during their stay in PACU than those receiving esmolol. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov - NCT02327923.

108642,Effect of gastric bypass surgery on the absorption and bioavailability of metformin.,2011,"Molecular detection of pathogenic nucleic acids from patient samples requires incubating biochemical reactions at specific temperatures to amplify DNA. This incubation is typically carried out with an electrical heater and a temperature controller. To reduce test cost, to eliminate the need for manufacturing incubators, which may require significant time, and to enable electricity-free operation, we use energetic compounds such as an Mg(Fe) alloy mixed with a phase-change material (PCM) that undergoes phase transformation at the desired incubation temperature. We dubbed this composite Energetic Phase Change Material (EPCM). When the EPCM is brought into contact with water, the magnesium alloy interacts with the water to produce heat. The EPCM heats up to its phase transition temperature. Any excess heat is absorbed as latent heat and the system is maintained at its desired incubation temperature, independent of ambient temperatures, long enough to facilitate enzymatic amplification. The EPCM together with colorimetric amplicon detection facilitates an inexpensive, disposable, point-of-need diagnostic test that does not require any electric power. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by detecting SARS-Cov-2 in saliva samples either without any instrumentation or with a palm-size CCD camera that enables us to follow the amplification process in real time.","Li, Rui Jie; Mauk, Michael G; Seok, Youngung; Bau, Haim H",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1an00309g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075937/,667
108828,Transanal rectosigmoidectomy using a single port in a Swine model.,2013,"Background Stroke is a major cardiovascular disease that causes significant health and economic burden in the United States. Neighborhood community-based interventions have been shown to be both effective and cost-effective in preventing cardiovascular disease. There is a dearth of robust studies identifying the key determinants of cardiovascular disease and the underlying effect mechanisms at the neighborhood level. We aim to contribute to the evidence base for neighborhood cardiovascular health research. Methods and Results We created a new neighborhood health data set at the census tract level by integrating 4 types of potential predictors, including unhealthy behaviors, prevention measures, sociodemographic factors, and environmental measures from multiple data sources. We used 4 tree-based machine learning techniques to identify the most critical neighborhood-level factors in predicting the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke, and compared their predictive performance for variable selection. We further quantified the effects of the identified determinants on stroke prevalence using a Bayesian linear regression model. Of the 5 most important predictors identified by our method, higher prevalence of low physical activity, larger share of older adults, higher percentage of non-Hispanic Black people, and higher ozone levels were associated with higher prevalence of stroke at the neighborhood level. Higher median household income was linked to lower prevalence. The most important interaction term showed an exacerbated adverse effect of aging and low physical activity on the neighborhood-level prevalence of stroke. Conclusions Tree-based machine learning provides insights into underlying drivers of neighborhood cardiovascular health by discovering the most important determinants from a wide range of factors in an agnostic, data-driven, and reproducible way. The identified major determinants and the interactive mechanism can be used to prioritize and allocate resources to optimize community-level interventions for stroke prevention.","Hu, Liangyuan; Liu, Bian; Ji, Jiayi; Li, Yan",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.016745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140687/,667

Results of a retrospective cohort study.,2021-08-16,"INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to significant changes in healthcare systems and its impact on the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is unknown in countries where the healthcare systems were not saturated, as was the case in Portugal. As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (62±12 vs. 65±14 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","Azul Freitas, André; Baptista, Rui; Gonçalves, Valdirene; Ferreira, Cátia; Milner, James; Lourenço, Carolina; Costa, Susana; Franco, Fátima; Monteiro, Sílvia; Gonçalves, Francisco; Gonçalves, Lino",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.repc.2020.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849772/,667

The narrowing of cranial vessels may be asymptomatic or produce neurological symptoms. Very often nonspecific signs of ischemia occur, such as headache, vertigo, or dizziness. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to assess the effect of carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis on the function of the equilibrium organ on the basis of electronystagmography and posturography. MATERIAL The study was conducted in 63 patients, presenting with carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy persons. METHODS All patients were subjected to precise audiological and otoneurological diagnostic examinations. Prior to being qualified for the study, patients were subjected to the assessment of arteries by means of Doppler ultrasonography. The vestibular organ was assessed by means of physical examination as well as by electronystagmography and posturography testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The study revealed statistically significant reduction in the results of the equilibrium organ assessments in patients with carotid and vertebral arteries sclerosis as compared to the control group. Abnormal ENG records in the study group patients were observed particularly in the pendulum test, optokinetic test, and the assessment of positional nystagmus, possibly indicating disturbances within the central part of the equilibrium system. Disturbed blood flow in arteries had also an important impact on spinovestibular reflexes and resulted in disturbed postural stability control. On the basis of the conducted studies, it is concluded that diagnostic examinations for carotid and vertebral artery stenosis should be performed in patients with equilibrium system disorders.","Dorobisz, Karolina; Dorobisz, Tadeusz; Zatoński, Tomasz",Brain and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691535/,667
109037,Single port laparoscopic surgery: concept and controversies of new technique.,2012,"Background Pain medicine fellowship applicants often seek information about programs from the Internet, which is becoming even more relevant with the transition to virtual interviews as a consequence of the global pandemic. Previous literature has revealed the significance of training program websites as part of the application process in other specialties. Objectives The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the content, design, organization, and user friendliness by using a composite score to determine the quality of the pain medicine fellowship websites (PMFW). Methods Accredited pain medicine fellowship programs was queried from three databases for pain medicine education: (1) Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS); (2) the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA); and (3) the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). Programs that appeared within one and/or more databases were eligible for study inclusion. PMFW were evaluated for the accessibility of recruitment and education content items. The quality of PMFW was determined as multifactorial composed of four dimensions: content, design, organization, and user friendliness. Results For program recruitment, PMFW contained an average of 12 ± 4.0 of 32 content items (38%) for fellowship programs: (1) 83% of fellowship programs specified the number of positions available for the 2021 Match; (2) 17% indicated alumni career placement; (3) 6.8% supplied interview dates; and (4) merely 4.9% detailed the selection process. For program education, PMFW contained an average of 7 ± 3.4 of 16 content items (44%): (1) 70% of programs provided a rotation schedule; (2) 49% detailed operative experiences; and (3) just 16% included simulation training. Regarding the quality based on content, design, organization, and user friendliness, the average PMFW was not ""good"" with only 1% of PMFW meeting ""great"" standards. A kappa value of 0.92 was calculated for inter-rater reliability. Conclusions The web presence of pain medicine fellowship programs falls short of providing essential accessibility, content, design, organization, and user friendliness to allow applicants to adequately access information about program characteristics. There are ample opportunities to increase the effectiveness of PMFW to benefit training programs and to inform prospective applicants, especially given the rise of virtual applications and interviews.","Mukhdomi, Taif; Woolley, Parker; Mukhdomi, Junaid; Beck, Brandon; Patel, Deeran; Harris, Marcus; Yadav, Abhishek; Kendall, Mark C",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.5812/aapm.115981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540644/,667

109230,LigaSure™ vs. conventional dissection techniques in pancreatic surgery--a prospective randomised single-centre trial.,2013,"AIMS Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant inheritance disorder of the red blood cell membrane characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped erythrocytes (spherocytes) in the peripheral blood. The main clinical features include haemolytic anemia, variable jaundice, splenomegaly and cholelithiasis caused by hyperbilirubinemia from erythrocyte hemolysis. Splenectomy does not solve the congenital genetic defect but it stops pathological hemolysis in the enlarged spleen. If gallstones are present, it is appropriate to perform cholecystectomy at the time of splenectomy, although the patient has symptoms of gall bladder disease. We present the case of single incision laparoscopic surgical (SILS) concomitant splenectomy and cholecystectomy performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments in an 11-year-old girl with the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. METHODS A 2-3 cm umbilical incision was used for the placement of two 5 mm trocars and one 10 mm flexible videoscope. Conventional laparoscopic dissector, grasper, Ligasure, Harmonic Ace and hemoclips were the main tools during surgical procedure. We prefer Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery Foam Port (Covidien) as the single umbilical device for introduction into the abdominal cavity. First, we performed cholecystectomy, then the gallbladder was put aside over the liver and after that we peformed splenectomy. To remove the detached spleen and gallbladder, a nylon extraction bag is introduced through one of the port sites. The spleen is than morcellated in the bag with forceps and removed in fragments. After that we removed them and the umbilical fascial incision was closed. RESULT Splenectomy is the only effective therapy for this disorder and often it is performed in combination with cholecystectomy. Conventional surgery requires a wide upper abdominal incision for correct exposure of the gallbladder and spleen. Our experience shows that SILS splenectomy and cholecystectomy is feasible even in young children and despite the small number of cases in the world, we consider the combined laparoscopic approach safe and effective for the treatment of hereditary spherocytosis. CONCLUSION According to actually published guidelines, the laparoscopic approach to concomitant splenectomy and cholecystectomy is recommended, but it depends on the availability of appropriately trained surgeons and suitable equipment.","Cingel, Vladimir; Zabojnikova, Lenka; Kurucova, Patricia; Varga, Ivan","Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",https://doi.org/10.5507/bp.2013.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026144/,667

STUDY DESIGN This was a cadaveric radiographic anatomical study. that involved 20 short-haired domestic adult cats. METHODS Sagittal and frontal plane tibial and femoral joint angles of 40 limbs were measured twice by three observers with different levels of experience. Inter- and intraobserver reliability was determined by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). An ICC > 0.75 was considered high correlation, 0.74 > ICC > 0.60 good correlation, 0.59 > ICC > 0.4 fair correlation and an ICC < 0.40 poor correlation. RESULTS Mean ± standard deviation angles were anatomic lateral proximal femoral angle (aLPFA) 110.6 ± 3.6; anatomic lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA) 91.9 ± 2.1; mechanical lateral proximal femoral angle; mLPFA (mLPFA) 107.3 ± 3.6; mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA) 95.5 ± 1.7; femoral neck anteversion (FNA) 121.9 ± 4.1; anatomical caudal proximal femoral angle (aCPFA) 156.1 ± 3.9; anatomical caudal distal femoral angle (aCDFA) 101.4 ± 1.4; mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA) 93.5 ± 1.2; mechanical medial distal tibial angle (mMDTA) 100.5 ± 2.3; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrPTA) 113.1 ± 3.2; tibial plateau angle (TPA) 23.1 ± 3.2; mechanical cranial proximal tibial angle (mCrDTA) 86.7 ± 3.1.The intra-observer ICC indicated high correlation for 70% or more of the measurements. The inter-observer agreement among observers was high. These results show that the radiographic method for measuring femoral and tibial joint angles was good or high, except for FNA and mCrDTA.

Four genotypes of IBV and three new isolates were identified by phylogenetic analysis and BLAST searches of the entire S1 gene. The results showed that most IBV strains that have circulated in China in recent years belong to the genotype of QX-like strains, and that they could be grouped further into two clusters, regardless of the level of genetic variation displayed. A study of pathogenicity that used three QX-like strains--ck/CH/LSD/091003, ck/CH/LDL/091022 and ck/CH/LJL/090330--showed that the isolates caused the most severe lesions in the kidneys and were therefore nephropathogenic strains with various levels of virulence in specific pathogen free chickens. A vaccination-challenge test that was performed using the three QX-like strains showed that the commercially available H120 vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against challenge with the QX-like isolates, as demonstrated by comparison of the clinical signs, pathological lesions and virus recovery from the trachea and kidney of unvaccinated-challenged and vaccinated-challenged birds.","Sun, Chuyang; Han, Zongxi; Ma, Huijie; Zhang, Qinxia; Yan, Baolong; Shao, Yuhao; Xu, Jia; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2010.538037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21331947/,667

110306,Total laparoscopic partial pancreatoduodenectomy and reconstruction via laparoscopic pancreatogastrostomy.,2012,"BACKGROUND Drug costs are increasing in Europe, and there is a heightened need to reduce pressure on healthcare systems. In 2017, oncology, autoimmune disease, and diabetes featured as the three highest therapy areas for drug spend in the EU-28. However, the absolute 1-year drug spend growth for diabetes did not feature within the ten fastest growing therapy areas. OBJECTIVE This study explores the association between drug spend and disease burden in oncology, autoimmune disease, and diabetes in the EU-28. METHODS Oncology, autoimmune disease and diabetes therapeutic areas were investigated using four methodologies. Historical and forecasted drug spend was analysed using the IQVIA MIDAS® drug sales database. Clinical and economic burden was estimated from targeted literature reviews. Trend analyses compared changes in drug spend with clinical burden using the Global Burden of Disease tool as the epidemiological reference. Cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from UK health technology assessments were compared to interpret the health economic value. RESULTS Oncology had the highest historical drug spend and growth compared with autoimmune disease and diabetes. Total drug spend and growth in oncology is forecasted to exceed diabetes by twofold. Increasing oncology drug spend historically did not correspond with reductions in mortality and morbidity. Diabetes had the lowest drug spend and greatest QALY/€1000 spent benefit. CONCLUSION This study indicates that drug spend may not correlate to clinical burden across diseases. Future research could stimulate debate on whether more equitable drug funding may improve disease management.","Greiner, Wolfgang; Patel, Keyur; Crossman-Barnes, Christina-Jane; Rye-Andersen, Troels Vingtoft; Hvid, Christian; Vandebrouck, Tom",PharmacoEconomics - open,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41669-020-00253-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411314/,667

METHODS AND RESULTS Isolated WATs of Fatp4A-/- mice exposed to MCD medium showed an increase in lipolysis, and the strongest effect was noted on glycerol release from subcutaneous fat. Fatp4A-/- mice fed with MCDD for 4 weeks showed an increase in serum glycerol, TG, and leptin levels associated with the activation of hormone-sensitive lipase in subcutaneous fat. Chow-fed Fatp4A-/- mice also showed an increase in serum leptin and very-low-density lipoproteins as well as liver phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels. Both chow- and MCDD-fed Fatp4A-/- mice showed a decrease in serum ketone and WAT sphingomyelin levels which supported a metabolic shift to TG for subsequent WAT lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS Adipose Fatp4 deficiency led to TG lipolysis and leptin release, which were exaggerated by MCDD. Our data imply hyperlipidemia risk by a low dietary choline intake and gene mutations that increase adipose TG levels. This article is protected by copyright.

111079,The single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique has questionable advantages in colorectal surgery.,2018,"Background We report the feasibility and safety of chest surgery through the subxiphoid single port approach based on our preliminary experience. Methods From December 2013 till January 2016, 39 patients underwent 40 thoracoscopic surgeries via a 3- to 4-cm subxiphoid single incision. A sternal lifter was applied for better entrance and working angle. A zero-degree deflectable scope was preferred. The technique for anatomic resection was similar to that in the traditional single-port approach. Patient characteristics and demographic data were analyzed. Results There were 29 females and 10 males, with a median age of 56 years. Indication for surgery included 24 patients with primary lung cancer, eight with lung metastases, two with benign lung lesions, one with bilateral pneumothorax, and five with mediastinal tumors. Surgeries included lobectomy in 21, segmentectomy in five, wedge resection in nine, and mediastinal surgery in five patients. There was no surgical mortality. Complications (10%, 4 in 40) included postoperative bleeding in one patient, chylothorax in one patient, and transient arrhythmia in the early learning curve in two patients. Conclusions Our results indicated that subxiphoid single-incision thoracoscopic pulmonary resection could be performed safely but under careful patient selection with modification of instruments. Moreover, having a previous single-port incision experience was crucial. Major limitations of this approach included more frequently encountered instrument fighting; interference of left-side procedure related to heartbeat and radical mediastinal lymph node (LN) dissection; and the ability to handle complex conditions, such as anthracotic LNs, diffuse adhesion, and major bleeding.","Liu, Chia-Chuan; Shih, Chih-Shiun; Liu, Yun-Hen; Cheng, Chih-Tao; Melis, Enrico; Liu, Zhen-Ying",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/jovs.2016.06.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29399498/,667

DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant papers on 11 June 2019 and rerun on 27 May 2020. Studies reporting complications, reoperations, length of stay and mortality within 90 days were included. Studies were reviewed according to criteria from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and the quality of evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS The search retrieved 1957 articles. Sixty-six articles were included. The quality of evidence was poor to good. Most studies were retrospective, and no randomised clinical trials were identified. Of included studies a median of 6 Martin criteria for reporting complications after surgery were fulfilled. The Clavien-Dindo classification for grading complications was most frequently used. The weighted overall complication rate after RC was 34.9% (range 28.8-68.8) for in-house complications, 39.0% (range 27.3-80.0) for 30-day complications and 58.5% (range 36.1-80.5) for 90-day complications. The most common types of complications reported were gastrointestinal (29.0%) and infectious (26.4%). The weighted mortality rate was 2.4% (range 0.9-4.7) for in-house mortality, 2.1% (0.0-3.7) for 30-day mortality and 4.7% (range 0.0-7.0) for 90-day mortality. Age and comorbidity were identified as the best predictors for complications following RC. CONCLUSION Short-term morbidity and mortality are high following RC. Reporting of complications is heterogeneous and the quality of evidence is generally low. There is a continuous need for randomised studies to address any intervention that can reduce morbidity and mortality following RC.

111797,A prospective study comparing three-port video-assisted thoracoscopy with the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port and instruments for the video thoracoscopic approach: a pilot study.,2013,"BACKGROUND Brain volumes in regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala have been associated with risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The objective of this study was to determine whether a set of regional brain volumes, measured by magnetic resonance imaging at 2 weeks following mild traumatic brain injury, were predictive of PTSD at 3 and 6 months after injury. METHODS Using data from TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI), we included patients (N = 421) with Glasgow Coma Scale scores 13-15 assessed after evaluation in the emergency department and at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after injury. Probable PTSD diagnosis (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score, ≥33) was the outcome. FreeSurfer 6.0 was used to perform volumetric analysis of three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance images at 3T obtained 2 weeks post injury. Brain regions selected a priori for volumetric analyses were insula, hippocampus, amygdala, superior frontal cortex, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, and lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices. RESULTS Overall, 77 (18.3%) and 70 (16.6%) patients had probable PTSD at 3 and 6 months. A composite volume derived as the first principal component incorporating 73.8% of the variance in insula, superior frontal cortex, and rostral and caudal cingulate contributed to the prediction of 3-month (but not 6-month) PTSD in multivariable models incorporating other established risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Results, while needing replication, provide support for a brain reserve hypothesis of PTSD and proof of principle for how prediction of at-risk individuals might be accomplished to enhance prognostic accuracy and enrich clinical prevention trials for individuals at the highest risk of PTSD following mild traumatic brain injury.","Stein, Murray B; Yuh, Esther; Jain, Sonia; Okonkwo, David O; Mac Donald, Christine L; Levin, Harvey; Giacino, Joseph T; Dikmen, Sureyya; Vassar, Mary J; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Robertson, Claudia S; Nelson, Lindsay D; McCrea, Michael; Sun, Xiaoying; Temkin, Nancy; Taylor, Sabrina R; Markowitz, Amy J; Manley, Geoffrey T; Mukherjee, Pratik",Biological psychiatry.

112022,"Intensive laparoscopic training course for surgical residents: program description, initial results, and requirements.",2011,"BACKGROUND Conflicting data exist with regard to recurrence rates of intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia after achieving complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) in Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients. AIM (i) To determine the incidence of recurrent IM and dysplasia achieving CE-IM and (ii) to compare recurrence rates between treatment modalities [radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with or without endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) vs stepwise complete EMR (SRER)]. METHODS A systematic search was performed for studies reporting on outcomes and estimates of recurrence rates after achieving CE-IM. Pooled incidence [per 100-patient-years (PY)] and risk ratios with 95 %CI were obtained. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses, decided a priori, were performed to explore heterogeneity in results. RESULTS A total of 39 studies were identified (25-RFA, 13-SRER, and 2 combined). The pooled incidence of any recurrence was 7.5 (95 %CI 6.1 - 9.0)/100 PY with a pooled incidence of IM recurrence rate of 4.8 (95 %CI 3.8 - 5.9)/100 PY, and dysplasia recurrence rate of 2.0 (95 %CI 1.5 - 2.5)/100 PY. Compared to the SRER group, the RFA group had significantly higher overall [8.6 (6.7 - 10.5)/100 PY vs. 5.1 (3.1 - 7)/100 PY, P = 0.01] and IM recurrence rates [5.8 (4.3 - 7.3)/100 PY vs. 3.1 (1.7 - 4)/100 PY, P < 0.01] with no difference in recurrence rates of dysplasia. Significant heterogeneity between studies was identified. The majority of recurrences were amenable to repeat endoscopic eradication therapy (EET). CONCLUSION The results of this study demonstrate that the incidence rates of overall, IM, and dysplasia recurrence rates post-EET are not inconsiderable and reinforce the importance of close surveillance after achieving CE-IM.","Fujii-Lau, Larissa L; Cinnor, Birtukan; Shaheen, Nicholas; Gaddam, Srinivas; Komanduri, Srinadh; Muthusamy, V Raman; Das, Ananya; Wilson, Robert; Simon, Violette C; Kushnir, Vladimir; Mullady, Daniel; Edmundowicz, Steven A; Early, Dayna S; Wani, Sachin",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0043-106578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573176/,667

112350,Two-port laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with simple retraction technique.,2012,"Reactive astrocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is one of the promising targets for the imaging of astrogliosis in the human brain. A novel selective and reversible MAO-B tracer, (S)-(2-methylpyrid-5-yl)-6-[(3-[18F]fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy]quinoline, (18F-SMBT-1), was successfully developed via lead optimization from first-generation tau positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-THK-5351. Methods: SMBT-1 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 using the corresponding precursor. The binding affinity of radiolabeled compounds to MAO-B was assessed using saturation and competitive binding assays. The binding selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 to MAO-B was evaluated by autoradiography of frozen human brain tissues. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism were assessed in normal mice after intravenous administration of 18F-SMBT-1. A 14-day toxicity study following the intravenous administration of SMBT-1 was performed using rats and mice. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated a high binding affinity of SMBT-1 to MAO-B (KD = 3.7 nM). In contrast, it showed low binding affinity to MAO-A and protein aggregates such as amyloid-β and tau fibrils. Autoradiographic analysis showed higher amounts of 18F-SMBT-1 binding in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain sections than in the control brain sections. 18F-SMBT-1 binding was completely displaced with reversible MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide, demonstrating the high selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 for MAO-B. Furthermore, 18F-SMBT-1 showed a high uptake by brain, rapid washout, and no radiolabeled metabolites in the brain of normal mice. SMBT-1 showed no significant binding to various receptors, ion channels, and transporters, and no toxic effects related to its administration were observed in mice and rats. Conclusion: 18F-SMBT-1 is a promising and selective MAO-B PET tracer candidate, which would be useful for quantitative monitoring of astrogliosis in the human brain.","Harada, Ryuichi; Hayakawa, Yoshimi; Ezura, Michinori; Lerdsirisuk, Pradith; Du, Yiqing; Ishikawa, Yoichi; Iwata, Ren; Shidahara, Miho; Ishiki, Aiko; Kikuchi, Akio; Arai, Hiroyuki; Kudo, Yukitsuka; Yanai, Kazuhiko; Furumoto, Shozo; Okamura, Nobuyuki","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.120.244400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646880/,667

While published literature specific to ablation of sarcomas is relatively lacking compared with non-sarcomatous malignancies, what is available is promising. In situations where a focal treatment option is desired, strong consideration should be given to percutaneous thermal ablation, in addition to surgery and radiation therapy. A significant advantage of percutaneous thermal ablation over surgery and radiation includes the repeatability of ablation, as there is no absolute limit on the number of times an ablation can be performed. Compared with surgery, ablation offers the potential of decreased recovery time, a less invasive procedure, and is often performed in patients deemed not medically fit for surgery.","Thompson, Scott M; Schmitz, John J; Schmit, Grant D; Callstrom, Matthew R; Kurup, Anil Nicholas",Current treatment options in oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11864-017-0465-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28391423/,667

All patients showed marked improvement of their lesions in a few days. After the introduction of the conventional penicillin regimen, the lesions further improved and VDRL titers declined at least 4-fold within 6 months in all patients. Tinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole derivative as well as metronidazole but with a longer plasma half-life. It is activated intracellularly by bacterial/parasitic enzymes to a redox cytotoxic intermediate that damages large protein molecules and inhibits repair and transcription of DNA affecting also the cell wall. With this action, tinidazole might also have a synergic action with penicillin and doxycycline, facilitating the entry of such drugs. It is possible that tinidazole has the same bactericidal action on spirochetes other than Borrelia, such as Treponema pallidum, explaining its rapid therapeutic action on the lesions of early syphilis. Whether this action could be confirmed by studies on larger series of patients, tinidazole might be considered in case of allergy to penicillin or other antibiotics usually prescribed in syphilis.","Drago, Francesco; Ciccarese, Giulia; Rebora, Alfredo; Parodi, Aurora",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408379/,667

These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities.

113161,Evaluation of fibrin sealant for biologic mesh fixation at the hiatus in a porcine model.,2012,"PD-L1 and PD-L2 are important targets for immune checkpoint blockade, but how tumor cells achieve their expression remains to be addressed. Here, we find that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are co-expressed in cancer cell lines and tissues across different cancer types. In breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 cells show high expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2. The expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 is greatly reduced upon treatment of inhibitors of super-enhancers. Bioinformatic analysis identifies a potential super-enhancer (PD-L1L2-SE) that is located between the CD274 and CD273 genes. Genetic deletion of PD-L1L2-SE profoundly reduces the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-L1L2-SE-deficient cancer cells fail to generate immune evasion and are sensitive to T cell-mediated killing. Notably, epigenetic activation of such a region (PD-L1L2-SE) is correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Taken together, we identify a super-enhancer (PD-L1L2-SE) that is responsible for the overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 as well as immune evasion in cancer.","Xu, Yuanpei; Wu, Yingcheng; Zhang, Siliang; Ma, Panpan; Jin, Xinxin; Wang, Zhou; Yao, Min; Zhang, Erhao; Tao, Baorui; Qin, Yongwei; Chen, Hao; Liu, Aifen; Chen, Miaomiao; Xiao, Mingbing; Lu, Cuihua; Mao, Renfang; Fan, Yihui",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31825827/,667
113210,Laparoscopic versus open colectomy for patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classifications 3 and 4: the minimally invasive approach is associated with significantly quicker recovery and reduced costs.,2010,"INTRODUCTION The atypical antipsychotic clozapine has shown superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics and is the gold standard for treating otherwise treatment resistant schizophrenia. However, multiple studies have found that clozapine is underutilised in most parts of the world. A few reviews of literature addressing barriers to clozapine prescribing have been conducted. While there is some variation in the literature included in these reviews, a common feature of the studies included is that they primarily focus on clinical staff's attitudes and perceived barriers for prescribing. Studies of patient perspectives are only sparsely included. A preliminary literature search revealed though, that additional literature on the subject exists, including literature on patient perspectives. It is therefore difficult to conclude if the formerly synthesised literature is representative of current evidence or if the topic has been adequately investigated to inform clinical practice. A scoping review is warranted in order to map and synthesise primary literature on patients' and psychiatrists' perspectives on clozapine treatment, and to identify gaps for future research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The electronic databases Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Psychinfo, MEDLINE and EMBASE will be searched for relevant publications, supplied with searches of Google scholar, The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations and OpenGrey. Citation tracking of selected studies will furthermore be undertaken. Two researchers will independently screen and extract data. Data will be collated to provide a descriptive summary of the literature, along with a qualitative content analysis of key findings. Identified gaps in research will be accompanied by recommendations for future investigations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and conference presentations.

113231,Single port sigmoidectomy in an experimental model with survival.,2008,"OBJECTIVE The authors examined changes in buprenorphine treatment following Medicaid expansion, including the contribution of Medicaid-financed prescriptions. METHODS Buprenorphine pharmacy claims for patients were identified in the 2012-2018 IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Data (LRx) data set, including 79.8% of U.S. retail prescriptions in 2012, increasing to 92.0% in 2018. A cohort analysis was used to assess the mean number of patients in a yearly quarter filling one or more buprenorphine prescriptions during preexpansion (2012-2013) and postexpansion (2014-2018) periods in expansion and nonexpansion states. Interrupted time-series analysis estimated associations of Medicaid expansion period with change in Medicaid-financed treatment. Separate analyses evaluated changes in duration and dose of new treatment episodes focused on mean quarterly number of patients treated with buprenorphine and proportions of new treatment episodes ≥180 days long and with ≥16 mg/day. RESULTS Between preexpansion and postexpansion, the mean quarterly number of patients taking buprenorphine increased by 93,300 in expansion states and by 84,960 in nonexpansion states. Corresponding changes for Medicaid-financed patients were 28,760 and 4,050, respectively. The fastest growth in Medicaid-financed treatment occurred among patients ages 25-44. Among new Medicaid-financed treatment episodes, little change was found in the proportion reaching the 180-day threshold, and declines were observed in the proportion receiving ≥16 mg/day. CONCLUSIONS The findings are consistent with previous research indicating that Medicaid expansion has increased Medicaid-financed buprenorphine treatment. However, because of offsetting changes in other payment groups, the overall increase in expansion states was similar to the increase in nonexpansion states.","Olfson, Mark; Zhang, Victoria Shu; King, Marissa; Mojtabai, Ramin",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730878/,667
113241,"Morbidity, mortality, and weight loss outcomes after reoperative bariatric surgery in the USA.",2015,"BACKGROUND The self-expandable COMPLETE™ stent (Medtronic) has greater elasticity, allowing it to regain its shape after the compression force reduces, and has higher trackability, thus is easier to maneuver through tortuous vessels, whereas the balloon-expandable SCUBA™ stent (Medtronic) has higher radial stiffness and can afford more accurate placement without geographic miss, which is important in aortoiliac bifurcation lesions. To date, there have been no randomized control trials comparing efficacy and safety between the self-expanding stent and balloon-expandable stent in advanced atherosclerotic iliac artery disease. METHODS/DESIGN The purpose of our study is to examine primary patency (efficacy) and incidence of stent fracture and geographic miss (safety) between two different major representative stents, the self-expanding nitinol stent (COMPLETE-SE™) and the balloon-expanding cobalt-chromium stent (SCUBA™), in stenotic or occlusive iliac arterial lesions. This trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to demonstrate a noninferiority of SCUBA™ stent to COMPLETE-SE™ stent following balloon angioplasty in iliac arterial lesions, and a total of 280 patients will be enrolled. The primary end point of this study is the rate of primary patency in the treated segment at 12 months after intervention as determined by catheter angiography, computed tomography angiography, or duplex ultrasound.

113336,Single port VATS mediastinal tumor resection: Taiwan experience.,2016,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic has proved that community pharmacies play a pivotal role in providing medicines, information and safety measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. PURPOSE The study aimed to get to know opinions of pharmacy staff and owners on the functioning of the community pharmacy during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS To collect opinions about functioning of the community pharmacy during the pandemic, we conducted cross-sectional study among pharmacy staff and owners of pharmacies. RESULTS The study group included 456 respondents mostly associated with independent pharmacies (55.7%), from cities less than 100,000 inhabitants (38.8%). The number of patients as well as filled prescriptions increased during the pandemic. Respondents provided patients with advice on cold (81.6%), sore throat (77.0%) and acherelated complaints (68.6%). Most of participants (64.5%) declared that they informed patients about COVID-19. The safety measures in community pharmacies included: a safety regulations poster during the pandemic (97.1%), handwashing in accordance with recommended guidelines (96.3%) and using protective gloves by the pharmacy staff (89.9%). According to 60.7% of participants, the community pharmacy was properly prepared for the pandemic by the owner, however, respondents from independent pharmacies indicate this more frequently (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Respondents are aware of the role of community pharmacies in the healthcare system during the pandemic, nevertheless, more attention needs to be paid by public authorities and governmental institutions to patient safety in the community pharmacy.","Merks, Piotr; Świeczkowski, Damian; Bilmin, Krzysztof; Jakubowska, Marta; Drelich, Ewelina; Lewicki, Jędrzej; Gołębiewska, Wioletta; Bogusz, Joanna; Jaguszewski, Miłosz",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.74.53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861029/,667
113575,Ultrasonic versus monopolar energy-based surgical devices in terms of surgical smoke and lateral thermal damage (ULMOST): a randomized controlled trial.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Traditional balloon assisted coil embolization techniques for intracranial aneurysms require a single lumen balloon to remodel the aneurysm neck and a separate microcatheter to place coils. Here we report utilization of a single coaxial dual balloon microcatheter to achieve both coil placement and neck remodeling in a series of intracranial and cervical arterial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A series of five patients, including two with subarachnoid hemorrhage, presented to our institution with wide necked oblong aneurysms (8-30 mm maximum diameter). Coil embolization in four of these aneurysms was performed by advancing the tip of either a 4×10 mm Scepter C or a 4×11 mm Scepter XC balloon microcatheter (Microvention, Tustin, USA) into the aneurysm, inflating the balloon at the aneurysm neck, and placing the coils through the same microcatheter. In the fifth patient, who had a giant aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery, two Scepter XC balloon microcatheters were placed side by side and inflated simultaneously at the neck of the aneurysm; coil embolization was then successfully performed through both Scepter XC microcatheters. RESULTS Coil embolization was successfully performed with this technique in all five aneurysms. There was no instance of aneurysm rupture, thromboembolic complications, occlusion of branch vessels near the aneurysm neck, or prolapse of coil loops into the parent vessel. CONCLUSIONS Aneurysmal neck remodeling and coil embolization can both be achieved using a single coaxial dual lumen balloon microcatheter in selected oblong intracranial and cervical arterial aneurysms.","Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Siddiq, Farhan; Grande, Andrew W; Tummala, Ramachandra P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24153339/,667

The dog had a history of craniofacial trauma at 2 months of age. CLINICAL FINDINGS Results of a neurologic examination were suggestive of a lesion localized to the medulla. Computed tomography revealed extensive pneumocephalus extending throughout the ventricular system and into the cranial cervical subarachnoid space. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Because of the deterioration in the dog's clinical condition, an emergency bilateral transfrontal craniectomy was performed. A large amount of pyogranulomatous material was found intraoperatively. Neurologic and computed tomographic abnormalities were no longer evident during a recheck examination 8 weeks after surgery.

Design Retrospective data analyses of New York State (NYS) Medicaid claims data for years 2006-2017 to determine reliable indicators of SDOH hypothesized to affect Medicaid churn, and for years 2016-2017 to examine frequency of Medicaid churn among patients with and without an indicator for homelessness. Main Outcome Measures Any interruption in the eligibility for Medicaid insurance (Medicaid churn), assessed via client identification numbers (CIN) for continuity. Methods Analyses were conducted to assess the frequency of use and pattern of New York State Medicaid claims submission for SDOH codes. Analyses were conducted for Medicaid claims submitted for years 2016-2017 for Medicaid patients with and without a homeless code (ie, ICD-10-CM Z59.0) in 2017. Results ICD-9-CM / ICD-10-CM codes for lack of housing / homelessness demonstrated linear reliability over time (ie, for years 2006-2017) with increased usage. In 2016-2017, 22.9% of New York Medicaid patients with a homelessness code in 2017 experienced at least one interruption of Medicaid eligibility, while 18.8% of Medicaid patients without a homelessness code experienced Medicaid churn. Conclusions Medicaid policies would do well to take into consideration the barriers to continued enrollment for the Medicaid population. Measures ought to be enacted to reduce Medicaid churn, especially for individuals experiencing homelessness.","Dapkins, Isaac; Blecker, Saul B",Ethnicity & disease,https://doi.org/10.18865/ed.31.1.89; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519159/,667
114038,Single-incision laparoscopic right colectomy for cancer: a single-centre preliminary experience.,2010,"Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian State of Amazonas, is the current epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in Amazonia. The sharp increase in deaths is a huge concern for health system administrators and society. The study aimed to analyze excess overall mortality according to Epidemiological Week (EW) in order to identify changes potentially associated with the epidemic in Manaus. Overall and cause-specific mortality data were obtained from the Central Database of the National Civil Registry and the Mortality Information System for 2018, 2019, and 2020. The study analyzed age bracket, sex, place of death, EW, calendar year, and causes of death. Ratios were calculated between deaths in 2019/2018 and 2020/2019 to estimate excess deaths, with 5% confidence intervals. No significant excess overall mortality was seen in the ratios for 2019/2018, independently of EW. Meanwhile, the ratios for 2020/2019 increased from 1.0 (95%CI: 0.9-1.3) in EW 11 to 4.6 (95%CI: 3.9-5.3) in EW 17. Excess overall mortality was observed with increasing age, especially in individuals 60 years or older, who accounted for 69.1% (95%CI: 66.8-71.4) of the deaths. The ratios for 2020/2019 for deaths at home or on public byways were 1.1 (95%CI: 0.7-1.8) in EW 12 and 7.8 (95%CI: 5.4-11.2) in EW 17. The explosion in overall mortality in Manaus and the high proportion of deaths at home or on public byways reveals the epidemic's severity in contexts of heavy social inequality and weak effectiveness of government policies, especially policies meant to deal with social inequalities and strengthen the Unified Health System.","Orellana, Jesem Douglas Yamall; Cunha, Geraldo Marcelo da; Marrero, Lihsieh; Horta, Bernardo Lessa; Leite, Iuri da Costa",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00120020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32638881/,667

Although intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) was approved nearly 2 decades ago for treatment of AIS, only a minority of patients receive it due to a narrow time window for administration and several contraindications to its use. Endovascular approaches to recanalization in AIS developed in the 1980s, and recently, 5 major randomized trials showed an overwhelming superior benefit of combining endovascular mechanical thrombectomy with IV-rtPA over IV-rtPA alone. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of catheter-based treatment from first-generation thrombectomy devices to the game-changing stent retrievers, results from recent trials, and the evolving stroke systems of care to provide timely access to acute stroke intervention to patients in the United States.","Khandelwal, Priyank; Yavagal, Dileep R; Sacco, Ralph L",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2016.03.555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27256835/,667

As the pathophysiology of asthma is becoming clearer, the identification of new valuable drug targets is emerging. IL-5 is one of these such targets because it is the major cytokine supporting eosinophilia and is responsible for terminal differentiation of human eosinophils, regulating eosinophil proliferation, differentiation, maturation, migration, and prevention of cellular apoptosis. Blockade of the IL-5 pathway has been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of eosinophilic asthma. However, several other inflammatory pathways have been shown to support eosinophilia, including IL-13, the alarmin cytokines TSLP and IL-33, and the IL-3/5/GM-CSF axis. These and other alternate pathways leading to airway eosinophilia will be described, and the efficacy of therapeutics that have been developed to block these pathways will be evaluated.","Cusack, Ruth P; Whetstone, Christiane E; Xie, Yanqing; Ranjbar, Maral; Gauvreau, Gail M",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10040817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917396/,667

As almost all higher organisms, Ips acuminatus harbours a microbiome, although the role of most members of its microbiome is not well understood. As part of a work in which we analysed the bacterial diversity associated to Ips acuminatus, we isolated the strain Arthrobacter sp. IA7. In order to study its potential role within the bark beetle holobiont, we sequenced and explored its genome and performed a pan-genome analysis of the genus Arthrobacter, showing specific genes of strain IA7 that might be related with its particular role in its niche. Based on these investigations, we suggest several potential roles of the bacterium within the beetle. Analysis of genes related to secondary metabolism indicated potential antifungal capability, confirmed by the inhibition of several entomopathogenic fungal strains (Metarhizium anisopliae CCF0966, Lecanicillium muscarium CCF6041, L. muscarium CCF3297, Isaria fumosorosea CCF4401, I. farinosa CCF4808, Beauveria bassiana CCF4422 and B. brongniartii CCF1547). Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, six concatenated housekeeping genes (tuf-secY-rpoB-recA-fusA-atpD) and genome sequences indicated that strain IA7 is closely related to A. globiformis NBRC 12137T but forms a new species within the genus Arthrobacter; this was confirmed by digital DNA-DNA hybridization (37.10%) and average nucleotide identity (ANIb) (88.9%). Based on phenotypic and genotypic features, we propose strain IA7T as the novel species Arthrobacter ipsi sp. nov. (type strain IA7T = CECT 30100T = LMG 31782T) and suggest its protective role for its host.","González-Dominici, Lihuén Iraí; Saati-Santamaría, Zaki; García-Fraile, Paula",Microbial ecology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01593-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901388/,667

The measurement of skin conductance (SC) is considered as a measure of stress and a surrogate indicator of pain. To identify the extent of research conducted and to synthesize the validity evidence of SC for assessing acute pain in infants. METHODS Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping reviews was followed and nine electronic databases were searched. Data were analyzed thematically and presented descriptively including the following main categories: study information/details, sampling information, characteristics of participants and settings, SC outcome measures and validity evidence. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies with 1061 infants were included, including 23 cross-sectional observation studies and five interventional studies. Most studied infants with mild severity of illness (n=13) or healthy infants (n=12). The validity evidence of SC was tested in relation to referent pain measures (13 variables), stimuli (13 variables), age (2 variables) and other contextual variables (11 variables). SC was not significantly correlated with vital signs, except heart rate in two of the eight studies. SC was significantly correlated with the unidimensional behavioral pain assessment scales and crying time rather than multidimensional measurements. Fourteen of 16 studies (87.5%) showed that SC increased significantly during painful procedures. CONCLUSION Inconsistent findings on validity of SC exist. Future research should aim to identify the diagnostic test accuracy of SC compared to well-accepted referent pain measures in infants, study the validity evidence of SC in critically ill infants and employ rigorous research design and transparent reporting.","Hu, Jiale; Modanloo, Shokoufeh; Squires, Janet; Harrold, JoAnn; Harrison, Denise",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0000000000000721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31094936/,667

115307,Role of intraoperative frozen section for assessing distal resection margin after anterior resection.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Recent studies have shown no benefits from remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. One possible explanation is that given previous exposure to angina and ischemia/reperfusion injury these patients, may be already 'naturally preconditioned'. The role of RIPC in a context of isolated valve intervention, both surgical and particularly transcatheter is less clear and remains under investigated, with few high-quality studies. METHODS A systematic literature review identified 8 candidate studies that met the meta-analysis criteria. We analyzed outcomes of 610 subjects (312 RIPC and 298 SHAM) with random effects modeling. Each study was assessed for heterogeneity. The primary outcome was the extent of periprocedural myocardial injury, as reflected by the area under the curve for serum troponin concentration. Secondary endpoints included relevant intra- and post-operative outcomes; sensitivity and high-quality subgroup analysis was also carried out. RESULTS Six and two studies reported the effect of RIPC in surgical and transcatheter valve intervention. There was a significant difference between-group in terms of periprocedural Troponin release (standardized mean difference (SMD: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.52; 0.95], p = 0.02) with no heterogeneity (χ2 2.40, I2 0%, p = 0.88). RIPC was not associated with any improvement in post-operative outcomes. No serious adverse RIPC related events were reported. CONCLUSIONS RIPC seems to elicit overall periprocedural cardioprotection in patients undergoing valvular intervention, yet with no benefit on early clinical outcomes.","Moscarelli, Marco; Angelini, Gianni D; Emanueli, Costanza; Suleiman, Saadeh; Pepe, Martino; Contegiacomo, Gaetano; Punjabi, Prakash P",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.10.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069785/,667

Novel targeted therapeutics are urgently needed to combat CDI. Bacteriophage-derived endolysins are required to disrupt the bacterial cell wall of their target bacteria and are possible alternatives to antibiotics. These lytic proteins could potentially replace or augment antibiotics in CDI treatment.

OBJECTIVE Our objective is to share methodological, ethical, and cross-language knowledge gained from conducting an ethnonursing research study. This study focused on providing a voice for ethnic minority children in childhood obesity literature. METHODS The purpose of the study was to discover cultural influences on healthy weight care in children of Burmese refugees of Karen ethnicity. Researchers may exclude children of ethnic minorities from studies because of the distinct challenges in conducting cross-language research and research with children. We critically examine these challenges. The challenge of being a stranger was addressed by a period of immersion in the children's activities prior to data collection in addition to volunteering as an English teacher with Karen adults. The immersion period was crucial for developing the trust needed in child-inclusive research and research in ethnic minority communities. The challenge of designing an inclusive study with families who experience language barriers was addressed with an interpreter who not only spoke Karen but was a part of the Karen community. The interpreter provided authentic sociocultural language equivalence needed for the study's rigor. Ensuring the child's voice was clearly heard was addressed with member checking. Methodological changes necessitated by a pandemic were a distinct challenge discussed in detail. RESULTS We described methods useful for nurse researchers seeking transformative knowledge to reduce health disparities in childhood obesity. Nurse researchers may use these methods related to cross-language research and child research for designing research inclusive of minorities with language barriers. DISCUSSION The perspectives of children from ethnic minorities are needed to inform culturally congruent healthy weight care for their communities. The goal in providing transparency of the difficulties, successes, and recommendations for methods in research with children of Burmese refugees is to encourage more nurse researchers to work with marginalized groups. Nurse researchers can inform evidence-based, culturally appropriate interventions to address health inequities of minority communities by including the voice of children from these communities.","Chatham, Rebecca E; Mixer, Sandra J",Nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1097/nnr.0000000000000537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225322/,667
116303,Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy: a prospective long-term evaluation of functional results and quality of life.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Clinical outcomes of patients who undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for single small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not consistent, and may differ based on certain imaging findings. This retrospective study was aimed at determining the efficacy of pre-TACE CT or MR imaging findings in predicting survival outcomes in patients with small HCC upon being treated with TACE. Besides, the study proposed to build a risk prediction model for these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Altogether, 750 patients with functionally good hepatic reserve who received TACE as the first-line treatment for single small HCC between 2004 and 2014 were included in the study. These patients were randomly assigned into training (n = 525) and validation (n = 225) sets. RESULTS According to the results of a multivariable Cox analysis, three pre-TACE imaging findings (tumor margin, tumor location, enhancement pattern) and two clinical factors (age, serum albumin level) were selected and scored to create predictive models for overall, local tumor progression (LTP)-free, and progression-free survival in the training set. The median overall survival time in the validation set were 137.5 months, 76.1 months, and 44.0 months for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves of the predictive models for overall, LTP-free, and progression-free survival applied to the validation cohort showed acceptable areas under the curve values (0.734, 0.802, and 0.775 for overall survival; 0.738, 0.789, and 0.791 for LTP-free survival; and 0.671, 0.733, and 0.694 for progression-free survival at 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively). CONCLUSION Pre-TACE CT or MR imaging findings could predict survival outcomes in patients with small HCC upon treatment with TACE. Our predictive models including three imaging predictors could be helpful in prognostication, identification, and selection of suitable candidates for TACE in patients with single small HCC.","Park, Chan; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Kim, Pyeong Hwa; Kim, So Yeon; Gwon, Dong Il; Chu, Hee Ho; Park, Minho; Hur, Joonho; Kim, Jin Young; Kim, Dong Joon",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901464/,667

Umbilical reconstruction or transposition for abdominoplasty and abdominally based flap operations is frequently complicated by umbilical death, infections, development of wounds needing prolonged wound care, and generally poor aesthetic outcomes. A multitude of techniques have been described to create the ""ideal"" neoumbilicus, but none has proven to be superior to the technique that comes before it. Our data demonstrate that, in a select set of patients, it may be beneficial to electively remove the umbilicus. Thus, umbilical reconstruction can be performed as an adjunct procedure to the primary operation with a superior aesthetic result and minimal risk for complications.

116706,Per-oral endoscopic myotomy white paper summary.,2014,"As the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children and young adults is increasing, a better understanding of genetics that underlie MetS will provide critical insights into the origin of the disease. We examined associations of common genetic variants and repeated MetS score from early childhood to adolescence in a pan-European, prospective IDEFICS/I.Family cohort study with baseline survey and follow-up examinations after two and six years. We tested associations in 3067 children using a linear mixed model and confirmed the results with meta-analysis of identified SNPs. With a stringent Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons we obtained significant associations(p < 1.4 × 10-4) for 5 SNPs, which were in high LD (r2 > 0.85) in the 16q12.2 non-coding intronic chromosomal region of FTO gene with strongest association observed for rs8050136 (effect size(β) = 0.31, pWald = 1.52 × 10-5). We also observed a strong association of rs708272 in CETP with increased HDL (p = 5.63 × 10-40) and decreased TRG (p = 9.60 × 10-5) levels. These findings along with meta-analysis advance etiologic understanding of childhood MetS, highlighting that genetic predisposition to MetS is largely driven by genes of obesity and lipid metabolism. Inclusion of the associated genetic variants in polygenic scores for MetS may prove to be fundamental for identifying children and subsequently adults of the high-risk group to allow earlier targeted interventions.","Nagrani, Rajini; Foraita, Ronja; Gianfagna, Francesco; Iacoviello, Licia; Marild, Staffan; Michels, Nathalie; Molnár, Dénes; Moreno, Luis; Russo, Paola; Veidebaum, Toomas; Ahrens, Wolfgang; Marron, Manuela",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64031-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346024/,667

METHODS Based on 654 clinical investigation questionnaires data of COVID-19 patients, a model based on syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation was set. Using SPSS Modeler 14.1 software, association rules and Bayesian network were applied to explore the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndrome. RESULTS There were 121 questionnaires referring to syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation in total 654 questionnaires. The symptoms with frequency > 40% were fever (53.72%), cough (47.93%), red tongue (45.45%), rapid pulse (43.80%), greasy fur (42.15%), yellow tongue (41.32%), fatigue (40.50%) and anorexia (40.50%). Association rule analysis showed that the symptom groups with strong binomial correlation included fever, thirst, chest tightness, shortness of breath, cough, yellow phlegm, etc. The symptom groups with strong trinomial correlation included cough, yellow phlegm, phlegm sticky, anorexia, vomiting, heavy head and body, fever, thirst, fatigue, etc. Based on SPSS Modeler 14.1 software, with syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation (yes = 1, no = 0) as target variable, and the selected symptoms with frequency > 15.0% as input variables, the Bayesian network model was established to obtain the probability distribution table of symptoms (groups), in which there was only one parent node (the upper node of each input variable) of fever, and the conditional probability was 0.54. The parent node of cough had yellow phlegm and syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation, indicating that there was a direct causal relationship between cough and yellow phlegm in syndrome of lung damp-heat accumulation, and the conditional probability of cough was 0.99 under the condition of yellow phlegm. The common symptom groups and their contribution to syndrome were as follows: fever and thirsty (0.47), cough and yellow phlegm (0.49), chest tightness and polypnea (0.46), anorexia and heavy cumbersome head and body (0.61), yellow greasy fur and slippery rapid pulse (0.95). CONCLUSIONS It is feasible and objective to analyze the correlation between symptoms and their contribution to syndromes by association rules combined with Bayesian network.

117466,Design and validation of an assessment tool for open surgical procedures.,2014,"Some neurological complications following surgery have been related to a mismatch in cerebral oxygen supply and demand that may either lead to more subtle changes of brain function or overt complications like stroke or coma. Discovery of a perioperative neurological complication may be outside the treatment window, thereby making prevention an important focus. Early commercial devices used differential spectroscopy to measure relative changes from baseline of 2 chromophores: oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. It was the introduction of spatially resolved spectroscopy techniques that allowed near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based cerebral oximetry as we know it today. Modern cerebral oximeters measure the hemoglobin saturation of blood in a specific ""optical field"" containing arterial, capillary, and venous blood, not tissue oxygenation itself. Multiple cerebral oximeters are commercially available, all of which have technical differences that make them noninterchangeable. The mechanism and meaning of these measurements are likely not widely understood by many practicing physicians. Additionally, as with many clinically used monitors, there is a lack of high-quality evidence on which clinicians can base decisions in their effort to use cerebral oximetry to reduce neurocognitive complications after surgery. Therefore, the Sixth Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI-6) consensus conference brought together an international team of multidisciplinary experts including anesthesiologists, surgeons, and critical care physicians to objectively survey the literature on cerebral oximetry and provide consensus, evidence-based recommendations for its use in accordance with the GRading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for evaluating biomedical literature. The group produced the following consensus recommendations: (1) interpreting perioperative cerebral oximetry measurements in the context of a preinduction baseline value; (2) interpreting perioperative cerebral oximetry measurements in the context of the physiologic variables that affect them; (3) using caution in comparing cerebral oximetry values between different manufacturers; (4) using preoperative cerebral oximetry to identify patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery; (5) using intraoperative cerebral oximetry indexed to preinduction baseline to identify patients at increased risk of adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery; (6) using cerebral oximetry to identify and guide management of acute cerebral malperfusion during cardiac surgery; (7) using an intraoperative cerebral oximetry-guided interventional algorithm to reduce intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay after cardiac surgery. Additionally, there was agreement that (8) there is insufficient evidence to recommend using intraoperative cerebral oximetry to reduce mortality or organ-specific morbidity after cardiac surgery; (9) there is insufficient evidence to recommend using intraoperative cerebral oximetry to improve outcomes after noncardiac surgery.","Thiele, Robert H; Shaw, Andrew D; Bartels, Karsten; Brown, Charles H; Grocott, Hilary; Heringlake, Matthias; Gan, Tong Joo; Miller, Timothy E; McEvoy, Matthew D",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079868/,667
117485,Advancing flexible endoscopy to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery.,2021-06-04,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is a novel virus responsible for the major pandemic in 2003, and it re-emerged in China in late 2003 and 2004 following resumption of wild animal trading activities. Over the past few years, research work has looked into factors that may lead to super-spreading events, clinical/laboratory parameters that may differentiate severe acute respiratory syndrome from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia, the origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome, reservoir host distribution and transmission routes. A better understanding of these issues may help prevent and control future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS Bats are natural reservoirs of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. The human and civet isolates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses. Severe acute respiratory syndrome has the potential of being converted from droplet to airborne transmission. When evaluating epidemiologically high-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia and no immediate alternative diagnosis, a low absolute neutrophil count on presentation, along with poor responses after 72 h of antibiotic treatment, may raise the index of suspicion for severe acute respiratory syndrome. SUMMARY The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats raises the possible role of bats in previous and potentially future severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in human. Healthcare workers should take adequate respiratory protection in addition to strict contact and droplet precautions when managing patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome.","Hui, David S; Chan, Paul K S",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e3282fb81b2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18427248/,667
117532,Natural history and metabolic consequences of morbid obesity for patients denied coverage for bariatric surgery.,2010,"Background Good sleep quality is associated with a diverse range of positive outcomes such as better health, less daytime sleepiness, well-being and proper psychological functioning. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality leads to many metabolic, endocrine, and immune changes. Many studies have shown changes in sleep schedule along with worsening of sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal from January 13, 2021 to February 15, 2021. A stratified random sampling technique was used. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Questionnaires that were completely filled were included and analyzed using STATA vs. 15. Results 168(n=190) medical students filled out the questionnaires with a response rate of 88.42%. Around 30% (n=51) of respondents had poor sleep quality (PSQI total score of > 5) with an average PSQI score of 4.24±2.19. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of poor sleep quality among females (OR, 2.25; CI, 1.14-4.43) compared with male and the relation persists even after adjusting with age and year in medical school (aOR, 2.81; CI, 1.35-5.86). Adjusting with age and gender, 4 th-year MBBS students had 82% lesser odds of having poor sleep quality compared to 2 nd-year MBBS students (aOR, 0.18; CI, 0.04-0.76). Our study is suggestive of poor sleep quality common among medical students. Conclusions More than a quarter of medical students have a poor sleep quality as per our study. So, education and awareness should be raised among medical students regarding the detrimental effects of poor quality sleep on daily activities, physical and mental well-being, and the overall quality of life.","Shrestha, Dhan; Adhikari, Suman Prasad; Rawal, Namrata; Budhathoki, Pravash; Pokharel, Subashchandra; Adhikari, Yuvraj; Rokaya, Pooja; Raut, Udit",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.53904.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249344/,667

Other indications of endoscopic RFA are under evaluation. RESULTS Four prospective studies (total 69 patients) have shown that RFA achieved complete remission of early esophageal squamous intra-epithelial neoplasia at a rate of 80%, but with a substantial risk of stricture. In the setting of gastric antral vascular ectasia, two prospective monocenter studies, and a retrospective multicenter study, (total 51 patients), suggest that RFA is efficacious in terms of reducing transfusion dependency. In the setting of chronic hemorrhagic radiation proctopathy, a prospective monocenter study and a retrospective multicenter study (total 56 patients) suggest that RFA is an efficient treatment. A retrospective comparative study (64 patients) suggests that RFA improves stents patency in malignant biliary strictures.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anal submucosal Permacol injection in the treatment of FI. METHODS All consecutive patients who underwent Permacol injection for FI over a 3-year period were included. Patients' data relating to obstetric history, anorectal/pelvic operations, type of FI, preoperative anorectal physiology results and follow-up details for outcome measures were collected. Preoperative and postoperative Cleveland Clinic Florida Incontinence Scores (CCFISs) were noted. Patients were surveyed by using a telephone questionnaire to assess the quality of life and other outcome measures. Data were analysed using SPSS ver.19.0. RESULTS Thirty patients (28 females and 2 males) with a median age of 67 years were included in the study. Of those patients, 37%, 50%, and 13% were noted to have passive, mixed and urge FI, respectively. Six of the patients (20%) had repeat Permacol injections, 5 of whom had sustained responses to the first Permacol injection for a mean of 11 months. There was a significant improvement in the CCFIS from a baseline median of 12.5, mean 12.8 interquartile range [IQR], 6-20), to a median of 3.5, mean 4.8 (IQR, 0-20), P < 0.001. Of the patients surveyed by telephone 89% were satisfied with their overall experience and the improvement in their symptoms following Permacol injections. CONCLUSION This study has demonstrated that Permacol injection for the treatment of FI is safe and effective and has no associated major complications. However, the results are not permanent; consequently, a significant proportion of the patients with an initial response may require repeat injections.","Al-Abed, Yahya A; Ayers, Jennifer; Ayantunde, Abraham; Praveen, Bandipalyam V",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2016.32.2.73; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27218098/,667

A new type of bioactive coil, the polyglycolic/polylactic acid-covered platinum microfilaments Nexus coil (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA), has been proposed. The objective is to evaluate the safety and short-term and mid-term efficacy of Nexus coils in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The ENDECOR (European Nexus Detachable Coil Registry) is the first prospective, consecutive, multicenter non-randomized registry. After providing informed consent, 390 patients (238 women and 152 men; mean age, 51.6 years) with 404 ruptured or unruptured aneurysms were enrolled at 34 centers. Treatment was performed with at least 75 % of coil length as Nexus coils. Clinical and technical complications were systematically reported. An independent core laboratory evaluated angiographic results by using the Raymond Grading Scale. RESULTS Complete occlusion was seen in 181 aneurysms (48 %); neck remnant in 86 aneurysms (22 %) and aneurysm remnant in 111 aneurysms (30 %). Technical and clinical complications related to the procedure occurred in 33 patients (8.5 %). At discharge, overall mortality and permanent-morbidity were 4.1 % (16/390) and 5.6 % (14/251), respectively. Angiographic mean follow-up of 13.3 months was obtained in 233 of 390 patients (64.4 %) harboring 247 aneurysms. Recanalization was observed in 44 aneurysms (17.7 %), and progressive thrombosis was observed in 53 aneurysms (21.6 %). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with Nexus coils was associated with low morbidity and mortality rates. Efficacy of Nexus coils was comparable to published series of intracranial aneurysms treated with bare platinum coils, but their efficacy to prevent aneurysm recanalization was not demonstrated.","Gory, Benjamin; Turjman, Francis",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-014-2047-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24652316/,667

118101,Can the Long-Term Complications of Adjustable Gastric Banding Be Overcome? Preliminary Results of Adding Gastric Plication in Patients with Impending Gastric Band Failure.,2015,"VIRIP has been identified as natural HIV-1 inhibitor targeting the gp41 fusion peptide. An optimized analogue (VIR-576) was effective in a phase I/II clinical trial and initial studies showed that HIV-1 resistance to VIRIP-based inhibitors has a high genetic barrier. Partially resistant CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 variants could be obtained, however, after more than 15 months of passaging in MT-4 cells in the presence of another derivative (VIR-353). Sequence analyses identified the accumulation of seven mutations across the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein but outside the gp41 fusion peptide. The authors suggested that the three initial alterations conferred resistance, while subsequent changes restored viral fitness. Here, we introduced these mutations individually and in combination into X4- and CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV-1 constructs and determined their impact on VIR-353 and VIR-576 susceptibility, viral infectivity, replication fitness, and fusogenicity. We found that essentially all seven mutations contribute to reduced susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors. HIV-1 constructs containing ≥4 changes were substantially more resistant to both VIRIP-based inhibitors and the VRC34.01 antibody targeting the fusion peptide. However, they were also much less infectious and fusogenic than those harboring only the three initial alterations. Furthermore, the additional changes attenuated rather than rescued HIV-1 replication in primary human cells. Thus, the genetic barrier to HIV-1 resistance against VIRIP-based inhibitors is higher than previously suggested, and mutations reducing viral susceptibility come at a severe fitness cost that was not rescued during long-term cell culture passage.IMPORTANCE Many viral pathogens are critically dependent on fusion peptides (FPs) that are inserted into the cellular membrane for infection. Initially, it was thought that FPs cannot be targeted for therapy because they are hardly accessible. However, an optimized derivative (VIR-576) of an endogenous fragment of α1-antitrypsin, named VIRIP, targeting the gp41 FP reduced viral loads in HIV-1-infected individuals. Characterization of HIV-1 variants selected during long-term cell-culture passage in the presence of a VIRIP derivative suggested that just three mutations in the HIV-1 Env protein might be sufficient for VIRIP resistance and that four subsequent changes restored viral fitness. Here, we show that all seven mutations contribute to reduced viral susceptibility to VIRIP-based inhibitors and demonstrate that the additional changes strongly impair rather than rescue HIV-1 infectivity, fusogenicity, and replication fitness. High genetic barrier to resistance and severe fitness cost support further clinical development of this class of antiviral agents.","Müller, Janis A; Glöckle, Anna; Gawanbacht, Ali; Geyer, Matthias; Münch, Jan; Kirchhoff, Frank",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00733-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29925662/,667

We examined correlates of smoking status, level, and importance and confidence regarding quitting among 608 MSM in the country of Georgia recruited in June-September, 2016 (493 without HIV via peer referral in 3 Georgian cities; 115 with HIV via the National AIDS Center). Median age was 26 years, 78.6% reported current (past 30-day) alcohol use, and 22.4% reported past-year illicit drug use. Overall, 73.8% reported current smoking; of these, 87.1% smoked daily, mean cigarettes per day (cpd) was 19.8, 64.6% smoked ≤30 min of waking, and mean quitting importance and confidence were 6.8 and 6.4 (0 = not at all to 10 = extremely), respectively. Multivariable analyses indicated that current smoking correlated with past-month alcohol and past-year illicit drug use (p's < .001). Among smokers, cpd correlated with being older and smoking within 30 min of waking; greater quitting importance (≥7) correlated with higher education and no illicit substance use; and greater quitting confidence (≥7) was associated with fewer cpd, smoking ≤30 min of waking, and regional versus capital city residence. Given these findings, addressing tobacco and other substance use among MSM in Georgia is critical.","Chkhartishvili, Nikoloz; Berg, Carla J; Abroms, Lorien C; Sturua, Lela; Chokoshvili, Otar; Khechiashvili, George; Tsertsvadze, Tengiz; Ma, Yan; Rodriguez-Diaz, Carlos E; Long, Michael W; Paichadze, Nino; Del Rio, Carlos",AIDS care,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2020.1810619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838543/,667

We performed this study to describe difficulties posed by the lockdown to caregivers of children with epilepsy in a low-middle income country and describe their responses and self-management strategies to overcome difficulties and prepare for a recurrence. METHOD A cross-sectional all-island survey was carried out at paediatric neurology centers in Sri Lanka. Data was gathered via a face-to-face interview after the lockdown period. Parental stress level was evaluated using a self-rating Stress Assessment Questionnaire. RESULTS Caregivers of 140 children with epilepsy from seven centers served by paediatric neurologists were interviewed. Mean duration of epilepsy was 7.9 years(SD 4). Majority were on one (52.1 %) or two (20 %) anti-seizure medications regularly. The pandemic did not affect epilepsy control in majority (87.3 %), however, signficant proportion faced difficulties over regular reviews and presecription refills. Despite difficluties, 87.1 % of parents maintained dispensing anti-seizure medications to their child regularly. Caregivers demonstrated healthy self-management strategies such as awareness on medications and access methods to healthcare during lockdown and remained confident of accessability to services. Stress was experienced in < 5%. CONCLUSION Lockdown status for COVID-19 did not significantly affect the control of epilepsy in children though it posed difficulties for regular reviews and obtaining medications. Self-management strategies will help caregivers to adopt to new-normal status and potential future outbreaks.","Wanigasinghe, Jithangi; Jayawickrama, Ashan; Hewawitharana, Gemunu; Munasinghe, Jagath; Weeraratne, Chathurika T; Ratnayake, Pyara; Wijesekara, Dimuthu S; Fernando, Sanjaya; Rupasinghe, Priyanka",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2020.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321430/,667

118867,Magnetic-assisted single-port sleeve gastrectomy.,2013,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive liver surgery is a growing field, and a small number of recent reports have suggested that laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) is feasible even in patients with cirrhosis. However, parenchymal transection of the cirrhotic liver is challenging due to fibrosis and portal hypertension. There is a paucity of data regarding the technical modifications necessary to safely transect the diseased parenchyma. METHODS Patients undergoing LLR by a single surgeon between 2008 and 2015 were reviewed. Patients with cirrhosis were compared to those without cirrhosis to examine differences in surgical technique, intraoperative characteristics, and outcomes (including liver-related morbidity and general postoperative complication rates). RESULTS A total of 167 patients underwent LLR during the study period. Forty-eight (29 %) had cirrhosis, of which 43 (90 %) had hepatitis C. Most had Child-Pugh class A disease (85 %). Compared to noncirrhotics, patients with cirrhosis were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to have hepatocellular carcinoma. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection was used more frequently in cirrhotics (65 vs. 15 %, P < 0.001), and mean portal triad clamping time was longer (32 vs. 22 min, P = 0.002). There were few conversions to open surgery, though hand-assisted laparoscopy was used as an alternative to converting to open in three patients with cirrhosis. Blood loss was relatively low for both groups. Although there were more postoperative complications among cirrhotics (38 vs. 13 %, P = 0.001), this was almost entirely due to a higher rate of minor (Clavien-Dindo I or II) complications. Liver-related morbidity, major complications, and mortality rates were similar. CONCLUSIONS LLR is safe for selected patients with cirrhosis. The added complexity associated with the division of diseased liver parenchyma may be overcome with some form of technique modification, including more liberal use of precoagulation, portal triad clamping, or a hand-assist port.","Worhunsky, David J; Dua, Monica M; Tran, Thuy B; Siu, Bernard; Poultsides, George A; Norton, Jeffrey A; Visser, Brendan C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4748-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895906/,667

Using newly sequenced DENV-1 and DENV-3 envelope (E) gene isolates from 11 Caribbean countries, along with sequences available on GenBank, we sought to document the population genetic and spatiotemporal transmission histories of the four main invading DENV genotypes within the Americas and investigate factors that influence the rate and intensity of DENV transmission. For all genotypes, there was an initial invasion phase characterized by rapid increases in genetic diversity, which coincided with the first confirmed cases of each genotype in the region. Rapid geographic dispersal occurred upon each genotype's introduction, after which individual lineages were locally maintained, and gene flow was primarily observed among neighboring and nearby countries. There were, however, centers of viral diversity (Barbados, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Suriname, Venezuela, and Brazil) that were repeatedly involved in gene flow with more distant locations. For DENV-1 and DENV-2, we found that a ""distance-informed"" model, which posits that the intensity of virus movement between locations is inversely proportional to the distance between them, provided a better fit than a model assuming equal rates of movement between all pairs of countries. However, for DENV-3 and DENV-4, the more stochastic ""equal rates"" model was preferred.","Allicock, Orchid M; Lemey, Philippe; Tatem, Andrew J; Pybus, Oliver G; Bennett, Shannon N; Mueller, Brandi A; Suchard, Marc A; Foster, Jerome E; Rambaut, Andrew; Carrington, Christine V F",Molecular biology and evolution,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msr320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22319149/,667

We aim to compare population attributable risk estimates obtained from different statistical approaches regarding their consistency. We use a real-life data set from the PROSCIS study to identify predictors for mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke and quantify their contribution to poor outcome using population attributable risks. METHODS The PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke (PROSCIS) is a prospective observational hospital-based cohort study of patients after first-ever stroke conducted independently in Berlin (PROSCIS-B) and Munich (PROSCIS-M). The association of baseline factors with poor outcome one year after stroke in PROSCIS-B was analysed using multiple logistic regression analysis and population attributable risks were calculated, which were estimated using sequential population attributable risk based on a multiple generalized additive regression model, doubly robust estimation, as well as using average sequential population attributable risk. Findings were reproduced in an independent validation sample from PROSCIS-M. RESULTS Out of 507 patients with available outcome information after 12 months in PROSCIS-B, 20.5% suffered from poor outcome. Factors associated with poor outcome were age, pre-stroke physical disability, stroke severity (NIHSS), education, and diabetes mellitus. The order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but population attributable risk estimates varied markedly between the methods. In PROSCIS-M, incidence of poor outcome and distribution of baseline parameters were comparable. The multiple logistic regression model could be reproduced for all predictors, except pre-stroke physical disability. Similar to PROSCIS-B, the order of risk factors ranked by magnitudes of population attributable risk was almost similar for all methods, but magnitudes of population attributable risk differed markedly between the methods. CONCLUSIONS Ranking of risk factors by population impact is not affected by the different statistical approaches. Thus, for a rational decision on which risk factor to target in disease interventions, population attributable risk is a supportive tool. However, population attributable risk estimates are difficult to interpret and are not comparable when they origin from studies applying different methodology. The predictors for poor outcome identified in PROSCIS-B have a relevant impact on mortality and functional impairment one year after first-ever ischemic stroke.","Malsch, Carolin; Liman, Thomas; Wiedmann, Silke; Siegerink, Bob; Georgakis, Marios K; Tiedt, Steffen; Endres, Matthias; Heuschmann, Peter U",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256828/,667

Net water uptake (NWU) per brain volume is a new quantitative imaging biomarker of space-occupying ischemic edema, which can be measured in computed tomography (CT). We sought to investigate the effects of vessel recanalization on the formation of ischemic brain edema using quantitative NWU. In this multicenter observational study, acute ischemic stroke patients with a large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation were consecutively screened. Patients with vessel recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) 2 b or 3) versus persistent vessel occlusion (no thrombectomy, TICI 0-1) were compared. Lesion-NWU was quantified in multimodal admission CT and follow-up CT (FCT), and ΔNWU was calculated as difference. Of 194 included patients, 150 had successful endovascular recanalization and 44 persistent LVO. In FCT after treatment, the mean (standard deviation) ΔNWU was 15.8% (5.7) in patients with persistent LVO and 9.8% (5.8) with vessel recanalization ( p < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, vessel recanalization was independently associated with a lowered ΔNWU by 6.3% compared to LVO (95% confidence interval: 3.7-9.0, p < 0.001). Successful vessel recanalization was associated with a significantly reduced formation of ischemic brain edema. Quantitative NWU may be used to compare the treatment effects in acute stroke.","Broocks, Gabriel; Flottmann, Fabian; Hanning, Uta; Schön, Gerhard; Sporns, Peter; Minnerup, Jens; Fiehler, Jens; Kemmling, Andre",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x18823601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30628850/,667

METHODS We analyzed data from the computed tomography substudies of the pilot and main phases of the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trials (INTERACT1 and 2, respectively). The study group was divided into a derivation cohort (INTERACT2, n=964) and a validation cohort (INTERACT1, n=346). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with clinically significant (≥6 mL) increase in hematoma volume at 24 hours after symptom onset. A parsimonious risk score was developed on the basis of regression coefficients derived from the logistic model. RESULTS A 24-point BRAIN score was derived from INTERACT2 (C-statistic, 0.73) based on baseline ICH volume (mL per score, ≤10=0, 10-20=5, >20=7), recurrent ICH (yes=4), anticoagulation with warfarin at symptom onset (yes=6), intraventricular extension (yes=2), and number of hours to baseline computed tomography from symptom onset (≤1=5, 1-2=4, 2-3=3, 3-4=2, 4-5=1, >5=0) predicted the probability of ICH growth (ranging from 3.4% for 0 point to 85.8% for 24 points) with good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.73) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.82) in INTERACT1. CONCLUSIONS The simple BRAIN score predicts the probability of hematoma growth in ICH. This could be used to improve risk stratification for research and clinical practice.

120055,Robotic Platform for an IPAA.,2018,"Photosystem II (PS II) captures solar energy and directs charge separation (CS) across the thylakoid membrane during photosynthesis. The highly oxidizing, charge-separated state generated within its reaction center (RC) drives water oxidation. Spectroscopic studies on PS II RCs are difficult to interpret due to large spectral congestion, necessitating modeling to elucidate key spectral features. Herein, we present results from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations on the largest PS II RC model reported to date. This model explicitly includes six RC chromophores and both the chlorin phytol chains and the amino acid residues <6 Å from the pigments' porphyrin ring centers. Comparing our wild-type model results with calculations on mutant D1-His-198-Ala and D2-His-197-Ala RCs, our simulated absorption-difference spectra reproduce experimentally observed shifts in known chlorophyll absorption bands, demonstrating the predictive capabilities of this model. We find that inclusion of both nearby residues and phytol chains is necessary to reproduce this behavior. Our calculations provide a unique opportunity to observe the molecular orbitals that contribute to the excited states that are precursors to CS. Strikingly, we observe two high oscillator strength, low-lying states, in which molecular orbitals are delocalized over ChlD1 and PheD1 as well as one weaker oscillator strength state with molecular orbitals delocalized over the P chlorophylls. Both these configurations are a match for previously identified exciton-charge transfer states (ChlD1 +PheD1 -)* and (PD2 +PD1 -)*. Our results demonstrate the power of TDDFT as a tool, for studies of natural photosynthesis, or indeed future studies of artificial photosynthetic complexes.","Kavanagh, Maeve A; Karlsson, Joshua K G; Colburn, Jonathan D; Barter, Laura M C; Gould, Ian R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922158117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747579/,667

The subjects' tolerance of the devices was also compared. METHODS Ten healthy subjects were recruited. The devices were fitted bilaterally, in a sequential manner, for 30 minutes. Ultrasound and laser Doppler fluxmetry assessments were performed. RESULTS The geko T-1 device was superior to both IPC devices in increasing both venous and arterial blood volume flow by ∼30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.7%-82.4%; P ≤ .001). The geko T-1 increased arterial blood velocity by 24% (95% CI, 9.7%-24.5%; P ≤ .001). A substantial increase in the total microcirculatory blood velocity by ∼370% (95% CI, 13.5%-39.7%) was reported after the use of the geko T-1 (P ≤ .001). With use of the visual analog scale, no significant differences in discomfort were found between the geko T-1 device and the IPC devices (P >.05). CONCLUSIONS The geko T-1 device is more effective than the IPC devices in increasing venous, arterial, and microcirculatory blood velocity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with ischemic anterior strokes admitted within a 4 h 30 min window in two different centers were included. The first center performed IV therapy (alteplase 0.6 mg/kg) during 30 min and, in absence of clinical improvement, mechanical thrombectomy with flow restoration using a Solitaire stent (StS); the second carried out IV thrombolysis (alteplase 0.9 mg/kg) alone. Only T, M1 or M2 occlusions present on CT angiography were considered. Endpoints were clinical outcome and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS There were 63 patients in the bridging and 163 in the IV group. No significant differences regarding baseline characteristics were observed. At 3 months, 46% (n = 29) of the patients treated in the combined and 23% (n = 38) of those treated in the IV group had a modified Rankin scale (mRS) of 0-1 (P < 0.001). A statistical significant difference was observed for all sites of occlusion. In a logistic regression model, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and bridging therapy were independent predictors of good outcome (respectively, P = 0.001 and P = 0.0018).

121409,The impact of visceral obesity on surgical outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer.,2014,"BACKGROUND Bitter tastants can activate bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) and thus initiate relaxation of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), which have great potential in the development of novel bronchodilator drugs for asthma therapy. However, the canonical bitter substance, denatonium is known to induce apoptosis of airway epithelial cells (AECs), indicating that other bitter tastants may also impair the epithelial integrity to prevent hazardous particulate matters such as coronaviruses. Therefore, any bitter tastants intended for treating airway disease should be carefully evaluated for potential toxicity to AECs. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE Considering the vast diversity of bitter tastants in nature and different types of TAS2Rs expressed in airway cells, we hypothesized that there must be some natural bitter tastants to be not only potent in inducing relaxation of ASMCs but also unharmful to AECs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Here we evaluated a group of bitter flavonoids that are derived from fruits and commonly used in traditional herbal medicine, including apigenin, hesperetin, kaempferol, naringenin, quercetin, and naringin, for their effects on the proliferation of human airway epithelial-like (16HBE14o-, BEAS-2B, and A549) cells cultured in vitro. Cell proliferation and associated signaling pathways were assessed by cell counting, ATP assay, cell cycling assay, quantitative RT-PCR, Fluo-4 labeling, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, respectively. RESULTS The results show that five of the six tested bitter tastants inhibited, but only naringin promoted the proliferation of the 16HBE14o-, BEAS-2B, and A549 cells at the dose of a few hundred micromoles. Furthermore, the naringin-promoted proliferation of the 16HBE14o- cells was associated with enhanced cell cycle progression, mRNA expression of cyclin E, and evoked calcium signaling/ERK signaling, which were all attenuated by inhibition of the TAS2R signaling pathways with specific blockers. CONCLUSION These findings indicate that although the majority of the bitter flavonoids may inhibit the proliferation of AECs, naringin emerged as one to promote the proliferation of AECs via cell cycle progression and TAS2R-activated intracellular signaling. It suggests that naringin and not a few other bitter tastants can be proven with nontoxicity to the airway epithelial structure and function, which provides further confidence in the development of safe and effective TAS2R-based bronchodilators for asthma therapy.","Ni, Kai; Guo, Jia; Bu, Bing; Pan, Yan; Li, Jingjing; Liu, Lei; Luo, Mingzhi; Deng, Linhong",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601237/,667

We derive a mathematical approximation for the radial distribution function at contact directly from the equation of state, and use it to obtain the shear viscosity. We also perform molecular-dynamics simulations of this system and extract the shear viscosity numerically.

121615,Biologic meshes are not superior to synthetic meshes in ventral hernia repair: an experimental study with long-term follow-up evaluation.,2013,"PURPOSE Accurate diagnosis of urinary tract infection in children is essential because children left untreated can experience permanent renal injury. We aimed to assess the diagnostic value of clinical features of pediatric urinary tract infection. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies in ambulatory care. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Health Technology Assessment, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects databases from inception to January 27, 2020 for studies reporting 2 × 2 diagnostic accuracy data for clinical features compared with urine culture in children aged <18 years. For each clinical feature, we calculated likelihood ratios and posttest probabilities of urinary tract infection. To estimate summary parameters, we conducted a bivariate random effects meta-analysis and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS A total of 35 studies (N = 78,427 patients) of moderate to high quality were included, providing information on 58 clinical features and 6 prediction rules. Only circumcision (negative likelihood ratio [LR-] 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08-0.72; n = 8), stridor (LR- 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.81; n = 1), and diaper rash (LR- 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.92; n = 1) were useful for ruling out urinary tract infection. Body temperature or fever duration showed limited diagnostic value (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.73; n = 16). The Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection in Young Children score, Gorelick Scale score, and UTIcalc (https://uticalc.pitt.edu) might be useful to identify children eligible for urine sampling. CONCLUSIONS Few clinical signs and symptoms are useful for diagnosing or ruling out urinary tract infection in children. Clinical prediction rules might be more accurate; however, they should be validated externally. Physicians should not restrict urine sampling to children with unexplained fever or other features suggestive of urinary tract infection.","Boon, Hanne A; Van den Bruel, Ann; Struyf, Thomas; Gillemot, Andreas; Bullens, Dominique; Verbakel, Jan Y",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546950/,667

121757,Risk factors associated with mortality after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.,2014,"Introduction: In addition to hand washing and wearing masks, social distancing and reducing exposure time to <15 minutes are the most effective measures against the spread of COVID-19. Unfortunately, three of these guidelines are very difficult, if not impossible, for nursing babies: they cannot wear masks, stay six feet away from the lactating breasts, nor consistently finish within 15 minutes while nursing. We report a case of a nursing mother with SARS-CoV-2 infection, documenting changes of immune cells and cytokines in breast milk with and without the infection. Case Description: With Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we obtained expressed breast milk samples from a lactating mother before and during SARS-CoV-2 infection as documented by reverse transcription-PCR. Using flow cytometry analysis, we measured the immune cell profiles and expression of cytokines such as interferon alpha (IFNα) in milk leukocytes before and during infection. Results: There was an eightfold increase in IFNα+ milk leukocytes, from 1% before SARS-CoV-2 infection to 8% when actively infected. The milk macrophages showed the highest increase in IFNα expression. Both T and B lymphocytes showed mild increase. Innate lymphoid cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells showed no increase in IFNα expression and the dendritic cells actually showed a reduction. Conclusion: We document the presence and high expression of IFNα in the breast milk macrophages of a lactating mother with confirmed COVID-19, compared with her milk before the infection.","Yu, Jack C; Khodadadi, Hesam; Salles, Évila Lopes; Pham, Quyen; Patel, Pinkal; Baban, Babak",Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/bfm.2020.0369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781080/,667

However, many diseases are not preventable through currently available vaccines, and the potential of modulating the immune response during vaccination has not been fully exploited. The first golden age of vaccines was based on the germ theory and the use of live, attenuated, inactivated pathogens or toxins. New strategies and formulations (e.g., adjuvants) with an immunomodulatory capacity to enhance the protective qualities and duration of vaccines have been incompletely exploited. These strategies can prevent disease and improve protection against infectious diseases, modulate the course of some noncommunicable diseases, and increase the immune responses of patients at a high risk of infection, such as the elderly or immunocompromised patients. In this minireview, we focus on how metabolic and epigenetic modulators can amplify and enhance the function of immunity in a given vaccine. We propose the term ""amplifier"" for such additives, and we pose that future vaccines will have three components: antigen, adjuvant, and amplifier.","Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; van Crevel, Reinout; Divangahi, Maziar; Netea, Mihai G",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02616-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443120/,667
121934,Prevalence and molecular characterisation of Giardia duodenalis in calves with diarrhoea.,2016,"INTRODUCTION It is widely assumed that sepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammation caused by a dysregulated host response to infection mediated by an increase in multiple proinflammatory cytokines. The levels of key proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-1β and interferon γ are poorly characterised during sepsis. We believe this project will produce a 'gold-standard' document to which other reports on cytokine levels will be compared. The objective of this systematic review will be to identify key cytokine circulating levels in patients with sepsis and assess the association between these levels and morbidity and mortality outcomes related to sepsis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We would include reports of any design except for case reports. Sepsis patients will comprise those with a diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. The primary exposure is levels of three proinflammatory cytokines. The primary outcome is mortality at 28 or 30 days. Study subjects can be of any age, sex or ethnicity. Studies will be restricted to the English language. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection will be searched for eligible studies. A database search will include studies from 1985 to May 2020. Two reviewers will independently screen and select studies, assess methodological quality and extract data. A meta-analysis will be performed, if possible, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation Summary of Findings presented.

122062,Bronchointerstitial pneumonia in Scottish cattle.,2015,"BACKGROUND The determinants and significance of early (30-day) heart failure symptoms after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remain unclear. We investigated the clinical and imaging correlates of early post-discharge heart failure in patients with STEMI, and evaluated its impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS Patients from the INFUSE-AMI trial were categorized according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification at their 30-day visit (NYHA class ≥2 versus 1). Independent correlates of NYHA class ≥2 were determined by multivariable logistic regression. A landmark analysis beyond 30 days was performed to assess the impact of 30-day NYHA class ≥2 on 1-year risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure. RESULTS Among 402 patients enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI trial with data on NYHA class at 30 days, 76 (18.9%) had NYHA class ≥2. Independent correlates of 30-day NYHA class ≥2 were age, Killip class ≥2 at presentation, heart rate at presentation, intraprocedural no-reflow, and 30-day infarct size (% total ventricular mass). After adjustment for infarct size, patients with NYHA class ≥2 remained at higher risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure at 1-year follow-up compared to those in NYHA class 1 (11.8% vs. 2.8%, adjusted hazard ratio 3.78, 95% confidence interval 1.16-12.22, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Clinical, procedural, and imaging variables predict the development of clinical heart failure after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with STEMI. Early post-discharge heart failure symptoms identify a high-risk patient cohort for subsequent heart failure hospitalization and death, independent of infarct size.

In this article, the authors try to identify the actual scope and meaning of public health as it is institutionalized in the EU political system. Using a mixture of historical policy and legal analysis, the authors show how the evolution of the institutional space called public health in the EU has been shaped by the EU's distinctive constitutional nature, its focus on regulation, and the legacy of its focus on market making as well as the preferences of its political leaders. The European Union does have an increasingly large space named ""public health,"" in which health ministers, the health directorate-general, and invocation of its public health treaty article 168 can be found, as well as a much broader and older area of activities justified by the need to manage adverse health consequences of market-making policies in other areas such as labor standards and agriculture. The COVID-19 crisis of 2020 not only led to a strengthening of EU public health but also showed that the EU is one of the many political systems in which the legal and bureaucratic domain of public health is far smaller than the actual issues affecting the public's health.","Greer, Scott L; Jarman, Holly","Journal of health politics, policy and law",https://doi.org/10.1215/03616878-8706591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085961/,667

In this study, our aim was to determine the incidence and temporal course of hyperthermia after TBI and its relation to intracranial pressure dynamics, cerebral metabolism, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 115 TBI patients. Data from systemic physiology (body temperature, blood pressure, and arterial glucose), intracranial pressure dynamics (intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, compliance, and pressure reactivity), and cerebral microdialysis (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glycerol, glutamate, and urea) were analyzed during the first 10 days after injury. RESULTS Overall, 6% of patients did not have hyperthermia (T>38°C) during the first 10 days after injury, whereas 20% had hyperthermia for >50% of the time. Hyperthermia increased from 21% (±27%) of monitoring time on day 1 to 36% (±29%) on days 6 to 10 after injury. In univariate analyses, higher body temperature was not associated with higher intracranial pressure nor lower cerebral perfusion pressure, but was associated with lower cerebral glucose concentration (P=0.001) and higher percentage of lactate-pyruvate ratio>25 (P=0.02) on days 6 to 10 after injury. Higher body temperature and lower arterial glucose concentration were associated with lower cerebral glucose in a multiple linear regression analysis (P=0.02 for both). There was no association between hyperthermia and worse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION Hyperthermia was most common between days 6 and 10 following TBI, and associated with disturbances in cerebral energy metabolism but not worse clinical outcome.","Svedung Wettervik, Teodor M; Engquist, Henrik; Lenell, Samuel; Howells, Timothy; Hillered, Lars; Rostami, Elham; Lewén, Anders; Enblad, Per",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433101/,667

We used a genome resequencing approach to resolve the evolutionary history of an important microbial pathogen, the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been implicated in amphibian declines worldwide. We sequenced the genomes of 29 isolates of Bd from around the world, with an emphasis on North, Central, and South America because of the devastating effect that Bd has had on amphibian populations in the New World. We found a substantial amount of evolutionary complexity in Bd with deep phylogenetic diversity that predates observed global amphibian declines. By investigating the entire genome, we found that even the most recently evolved Bd clade (termed the global panzootic lineage) contained more genetic variation than previously reported. We also found dramatic differences among isolates and among genomic regions in chromosomal copy number and patterns of heterozygosity, suggesting complex and heterogeneous genome dynamics. Finally, we report evidence for selection acting on the Bd genome, supporting the hypothesis that protease genes are important in evolutionary transitions in this group. Bd is considered an emerging pathogen because of its recent effects on amphibians, but our data indicate that it has a complex evolutionary history that predates recent disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is important to consider the contemporary effects of Bd in a broader evolutionary context and identify specific mechanisms that may have led to shifts in virulence in this system.","Rosenblum, Erica Bree; James, Timothy Y; Zamudio, Kelly R; Poorten, Thomas J; Ilut, Dan; Rodriguez, David; Eastman, Jonathan M; Richards-Hrdlicka, Katy; Joneson, Suzanne; Jenkinson, Thomas S; Longcore, Joyce E; Parra Olea, Gabriela; Toledo, Luís Felipe; Arellano, Maria Luz; Medina, Edgar M; Restrepo, Silvia; Flechas, Sandra Victoria; Berger, Lee; Briggs, Cheryl J; Stajich, Jason E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300130110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23650365/,667

123298,Financial Impact of the Robotic Approach in Liver Surgery: A Comparative Study of Clinical Outcomes and Costs Between the Robotic and Open Technique in a Single Institution.,2017,"Coronavirus subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis occurs via a process of discontinuous transcription involving transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) located in the 5' leader sequence (TRS-L) and upstream of each structural and group-specific gene (TRS-B). Several gammacoronaviruses including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contain a putative open reading frame (ORF), localized between the M gene and gene 5, which is controversial due to the perceived absence of a TRS. We have studied the transcription of a novel sgmRNA associated with this potential ORF and found it to be transcribed via a previously unidentified noncanonical TRS-B. Using an IBV reverse genetics system, we demonstrated that the template-switching event during intergenic region (IR) sgmRNA synthesis occurs at the 5' end of the noncanonical TRS-B and recombines between nucleotides 5 and 6 of the 8-nucleotide consensus TRS-L. Introduction of a complete TRS-B showed that higher transcription levels are achieved by increasing the number of nucleotide matches between TRS-L and TRS-B. Translation of a protein from the sgmRNA was demonstrated using enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting the translation of a fifth, novel, group-specific protein for IBV. This study has resolved an issue concerning the number of ORFs expressed by members of the Gammacoronavirus genus and proposes the existence of a fifth IBV accessory protein. We confirmed previous reports that coronaviruses can produce sgmRNAs from noncanonical TRS-Bs, which may expand their repertoire of proteins. We also demonstrated that noncanonical TRS-Bs may provide a mechanism by which coronaviruses can control protein expression levels by reducing sgmRNA synthesis.","Bentley, Kirsten; Keep, Sarah May; Armesto, Maria; Britton, Paul",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02967-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23221558/,667

Significant amounts of lectins have been found in Phaseolus vulgaris beans as far back as in the last century; however, many questions about their potential biological roles still remain obscure. Studies have shown that lectins are anti-nutritional factors that can cause intestinal disorders. Owing to their ability to act as toxic allergens and hemagglutinins, the Phaseolus vulgaris lectins are of grave concern for human health and safety. Nonetheless, their potential beneficial health effects, such as anti-cancer, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV), anti-microbial infection, preventing mucosal atrophy, reducing type 2 diabetes and obesity, promoting nutrients absorption and targeting drugs, are of immense interest. The significance of Phaseolus vulgaris lectins in biological researches and the potential biomedical applications have placed tremendous emphasis on the development of purification strategies to obtain the protein in pure and stable forms. These purification strategies entail considerations such as effects of proteolysis, heating, gamma radiation, and high-hydrostatic-pressure that can have crucial outcomes in either eliminating or improving bioactivities of the lectins.

This mini-review describes strategies to potentially enhance the expansion of therapeutic cells with biomaterials and bioreactors, as well as to characterize the cell products with microphysiological systems. These systems can provide distinct cues to maintain the quality attributes of the cells and evaluate their function in physiologically relevant conditions.","Kwee, Brian J; Sung, Kyung E",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/15353702211026922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34250847/,667
124434,Laparoendoscopic single-site radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy: initial multi-institutional experience for treatment of invasive cervical cancer.,2014,"AIM This study set forth a question: are there any differences in bone responses to insulin and/or vitamin D3 treatment in female and male type 1 diabetic (T1D) mice? MAIN METHODS To address this issue, a non-critical sized femur defect was created in streptozotocin (STZ)-T1D mice. Control non-diabetic and T1D female and male mice received: saline; vitamin D3; insulin; or vitamin D3 plus insulin, for 21 days. KEY FINDINGS Female and male T1D mice showed impaired bone healing, as indicated by histological and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. Vitamin D3 or insulin improved the bone regeneration in T1D mice, irrespective of sex. Vitamin D3 plus insulin did not exhibit any additional effects. There were no differences regarding the numbers of TRAP-stained osteoclasts in either evaluated groups. The osteoblast-related gene osterix was upregulated in vitamin D3-treated male T1D mice, as revealed by RT-qPCR. Female T1D mice treated with vitamin D3, insulin, or vitamin D3 plus insulin presented an increased expression of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) mRNA. Conversely, IGF-1 mRNA levels were reduced by the same treatments in male TD1 mice. SIGNIFICANCE Altogether, the results suggested that T1D similarly delayed the osseous healing in female and male mice, with beneficial effects for either vitamin D3 or insulin in T1D mice of both sexes. However, data indicated marked sex differences regarding the expression of genes implicated in bone formation, in T1D mice treated with vitamin D3 and/or insulin.","Cignachi, Natália P; Ribeiro, Alice; Machado, Gustavo D B; Cignachi, Amanda P; Kist, Luiza W; Bogo, Maurício R; Silva, Rodrigo B M; Campos, Maria M",Life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069738/,667

124713,"Prophylactic Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh Reinforcement Reduces the Risk of Incisional Hernia, Two-Year Results of a Randomized Clinical Trial.",2018,"INTRODUCTION About 14% of COVID-19 patients experience severe symptoms and require hospitalization. Managing these patients could be challenging for limited-resource countries, such as Palestine. This study aimed to evaluate hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients' treatment outcomes managed with supportive care and steroids. METHODOLOGY This was a single-center observational retrospective cohort study that enrolled COVID-19 patients admitted to the ""Martyrs medical military complex- COVID Hospital"" in Palestine. The managing physicians manually collected data through chart reviews, including patients' characteristics, complications, outcomes, and different management modalities. Continuous and categorical variables between those who were discharged alive and who died were compared using t-test and Chi-squares test, respectively. RESULTS Overall, 334 patients were included in this study. Median (IQR) age was 62(11) years, 49.1% were males, and 29.6% were ICU status patients. The median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 76 (67), and 67.6% of these patients had moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 4.8% of the patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (78.7%) had at least one comorbidity, and 18.3% developed at least one complication. The overall mortality was 12.3% (95% CI 8.9-16.2%), and the median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 11 (8) days. Age (aOR 1.05, p = 0.08), smoking (aOR 4.12, p = 0.019), IMV (aOR 27.4, p < 0.001) and PaO2/FiO2 ratio (aOR 1.03, p < 0.001) were found to predict higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS Supportive care for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in a Palestinian hospital with limited resources was associated with in-hospital mortality of 12.3%.","El-Hamshari, Yousef; Hamarshi, Majdi; Nazzal, Zaher; Akkawi, Amna; Saleh, Dana; Abdullah, Ibtesam; Najjar, Mohammed; Rabi, Razan; Ruzzeh, Saad",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516416/,667
124764,Editorial comment to Laparoendoscopic single-site urological surgery: initial experience in Japan.,2010,"PURPOSE To measure the feasibility of using FMECA applied to the surgery and then compare the vulnerabilities of laparoscopic versus open appendectomy by using FMECA. METHODS The FMECA study was performed on each single selected phase of appendectomy and on complication-related data during the period January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2010. The risk analysis phase was completed by evaluation of the criticality index (CI) of each appendectomy-related failure mode (FM). The CI is calculated by multiplying the estimated frequency of occurrence (O) of the FM, by the expected severity of the injury to the patient (S), and the detectability (D) of the FM. RESULTS In the first year of analysis (2009), 177 appendectomies were performed, 110 open and 67 laparoscopic. Eleven adverse events were related to the open appendectomy: 1 bleeding (CI: 8) and 10 postoperative infections (CI: 32). Three adverse events related to the laparoscopic approach were recorded: 1 postoperative infection (CI: 8) and 2 incorrect extractions of the appendix through the umbilical port (CI: 6). In the second year of analysis (2010), 158 appendectomies were performed, 69 open and 89 laparoscopic. Four adverse events were related to the open appendectomy: 1 incorrect management of the histological specimen (CI: 2), 1 dehiscence of the surgical wound (CI: 6), and 2 infections (CI: 6). No adverse events were recorded in laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSION FMECA helped the staff compare the 2 approaches through an accurate step-by-step analysis, highlighting that laparoscopic appendectomy is feasible and safe, associated with a lower incidence of infection and other complications, reduced length of hospital stay, and an apparent lower procedure-related risk.","Guida, Edoardo; Rosati, Ubaldo; Pini Prato, Alessio; Avanzini, Stefano; Pio, Luca; Ghezzi, Michele; Jasonni, Vincenzo; Mattioli, Girolamo",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0b013e318297febc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23860194/,667

SETTING George Washington University, Department of Ophthalmology DESIGN:: This study was a non-randomized control trial METHODS:: Participants over age 18 with no contraindications to eye drops or tonometry were recruited. Optical biometry measurements were obtained on a single eye using the Lenstar LS900. One drop each of phenylephrine, tropicamide, and fluorescein-proparacaine was applied to the same eye and measurements were repeated. GAT was performed, and measurements were repeated. For control subjects, the contralateral eye was also measured at each interval. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference in mean predicted post-operative refraction (PPOR) K1, K2, or axis post-drops and post-GAT (n = 62). After drops were applied, mean central corneal thickness increased from 540 to 542 (P = 0.0002), mean anterior chamber depth (ACD) increased from 3.68 mm to 3.70 mm (P < 0.0001), and lens thickness decreased from 3.66 to 3.65 (P = 0.001). After GAT, anterior chamber depth increased to 3.76 mm (P < 0.0001) and lens thickness increased to 3.60 mm (P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in PPOR or other parameters for the control eyes (n=5). CONCLUSIONS GAT and phenylephrine, tropicamide, and fluorescein-proparacaine drops did not affect the primary outcome of PPOR.

A novel anti-HIV peptide, termed sifuvirtide, was designed based on the three-dimensional structure of the HIV-1 gp41 fusogenic core conformation. Here we report its in vitro anti-HIV potency, its mechanism of action, as well as the results from Phase Ia clinical studies. We demonstrated that sifuvirtide inhibited HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited high potency against infections by a wide range of primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates from multiple genotypes with R5 or X4 phenotypes. Notably, sifuvirtide was also highly effective against T20-resistant strains. Unlike T20, sifuvirtide could efficiently block six-helix bundle formation in a dominant negative fashion. These results suggest that sifuvirtide has a different mechanism of action from that of T20. Phase Ia clinical studies of sifuvirtide (FS0101) in 60 healthy individuals demonstrated good safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles. A single dose regimen (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg) by subcutaneous injection once daily at abdominal sites was well tolerated without serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic studies of single and multiple administration of sifuvirtide showed that its decay half-lives were 20.0 +/- 8.6 h and 26.0 +/- 7.9 h, respectively. In summary, sifuvirtide has potential to become an ideal fusion inhibitor for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, including those with HIV-1 strains resistant to T20.","He, Yuxian; Xiao, Yonghong; Song, Haifeng; Liang, Qing; Ju, Dan; Chen, Xin; Lu, Hong; Jing, Weiguo; Jiang, Shibo; Zhang, Linqi",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m800200200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18303020/,667
126387,Is clipping the preferable technique to perform sympathicotomy? A retrospective study and review of the literature.,2015,"Purpose：Although chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy development for B cell malignancies has made significant progress in the last decade, broadening the success to treating T-ALL has been limited. We conducted two clinical trials to verify the safety and efficacy of GC027, an ""off-the-shelf"" allogeneic CAR-T product targeting T cell antigen CD7. Here we report two patients as case reports with relapsed/refractory T-ALL who were treated with GC027. Experimental Design：Both of the two trials reported are open-labeled and single-arm. A single infusion of GC027 was given to each patient after preconditioning therapy. Result：Robust expansion of CAR-T cells along with rapid eradication of CD7+ T-lymphoblasts were observed in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. Both patients achieved complete remission (CR) with no minimal residual disease (MRD) detectable. At data cut off Sep.30, 2020 one of the two patients remains in ongoing remission for over one year after CAR-T cell infusion. Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in both patients and was managed by a novel approach with a ruxolitinib-based CRS management. Ruxolitinib showed promising activity in a preclinical study conducted at our center. No Graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) was observed. Conclusion：The two case reports demonstrate that a stand alone therapy with this novel CD7 targeted ""off-the-shelf"" allogeneic CAR-T therapy may provide deep and durable responses in select r/r T-ALL patients. GC027- might have a potential to be a promising new approach for treating refractory/relapsed T - ALL.

In this study, we investigated the risk factors for the anxiety in the otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province under the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS The otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire in which anxiety was measured against the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. RESULTS A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (OR = 2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (OR = 4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (OR = 4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never. The subjects who had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19 were more vulnerable to anxiety (OR = 2.014, 95% CI 1.205-3.366). Respondents working in infectious isolation wards had a 3.522-fold increased risk of anxiety compared to those on leave (OR = 3.522, 95% CI 1.634-7.593). CONCLUSION Some otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province experienced anxiety during the epidemic, but most of them did not receive treatment.

126801,Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in Asia: Long term outcome and revisional surgery.,2016,"BACKGROUND Causing pneumothorax is one of the main concerns of lung recruitment maneuvers in pediatric patients, especially newborns. Therefore, these maneuvers are not performed routinely during anesthesia. Our objective was to determine the pressures that cause pneumothorax in healthy newborns by a prospective experimental study of 10 newborn piglets (<48 h old) with healthy lungs under general anesthesia. METHODS The primary outcome was peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) causing pneumothorax. Animals under anesthesia and bilateral chest tube catheterization were randomly allocated to 2 groups: one with PEEP and fixed inspiratory driving pressure of 15 cm H2O (PEEP group) and the second one with PEEP = 0 cm H2O and non-fixed inspiratory driving pressure (zero PEEP group). In both groups, the ventilation mode was pressure-controlled, and PIP was raised at 2-min intervals, with steps of 5 cm H2O until air leak was observed through the chest tubes. The PEEP group raised PIP through 5-cm H2O PEEP increments, and the zero PEEP group raised PIP through 5-cm H2O inspiratory driving pressure increments. RESULTS Pneumothorax was observed with a PIP of 90.5 ± 15.7 cm H2O with no statistically significant differences between the PEEP group (92 ± 14.8 cm H2O) and the zero PEEP group (89 ± 18.2 cm H2O). The zero PEEP group had hypotension, with a PIP of 35 cm H2O; the PEEP group had hypotension, with a PIP of 60 cm H2O (P = .01). The zero PEEP group presented bradycardia, with PIP of 40 cm H2O; the PEEP group presented bradycardia, with PIP of 70 cm H2O (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS Performing recruitment maneuvers in newborns without lung disease is a safe procedure in terms of pneumothorax. Pneumothorax does not seem to occur in the clinically relevant PIPs of <50 cm H2O. Hemodynamic impairment may occur with high driving pressures. More studies are needed to determine the exact hemodynamic impact of these procedures and pneumothorax PIP in poorly compliant lungs.","González-Pizarro, Patricio; García-Fernández, Javier; Canfrán, Susana; Gilsanz, Fernando",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26556900/,667

METHODS Hospitalized children <18 years of age with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (N = 53) were recruited into a prospective cohort study; 32 had confirmed COVID-19, with 16 meeting the US Centers for Disease Control criteria for MIS-C. Differences in nasopharyngeal viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, and cytokine/chemokine profiles were examined, including after adjustments for age and sex. RESULTS The median ages for those with and without MIS-C were 8.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5.5-13.9) and 2.2 years (IQR, 1.1-10.5), respectively (P = .18), and nasopharyngeal levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (median 63 848.25 copies/mL versus 307.1 copies/mL, P = .66); 75% of those with MIS-C were antibody positive compared with 44% without (P = .026).

Here we report a single-center preliminary experience of transumbilical single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) in the treatment of benign gallbladder diseases, defining a single surgeon's learning curve. METHODS A total of 80 patients underwent SILC successfully by a single experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The operation was performed following the routine LC procedure. Then the perioperative demographics were recorded and the operative time was used to define the learning curve. RESULTS The study group included 27 male and 53 female patients with gallstones (56 cases), cholesterol polyps (16 cases), an adenomatous polyp (3 cases), adenomyomatosis (1 case), or complex diseases (4 cases), and all consented to undergo SILC. No patient was converted to normal LC or open surgery. There were no perioperative port-related or surgical complications. The average operative time was 46.9 ± 14.6 min. The average postoperative hospital stay was 1.8 ± 1.3 days. The learning curve of the SILC procedures for this series of selected patients confirmed that SILC is a feasible, safe, and effective approach to the treatment of benign gallbladder diseases.

127123,Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Thin film nitinol can be processed to produce a thin microporous sheet with a low percentage of metal coverage (<20%) and high pore attenuation (∼70 pores/mm(2)) for flow diversion. We present in vivo results from the treatment of experimental rabbit aneurysms by using a thin film nitinol-based flow-diversion device. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen aneurysms in the rabbit elastase aneurysm model were treated with a single thin film nitinol flow diverter. Devices were also placed over 17 lumbar arteries to model perianeurysmal branch arteries of the intracranial circulation. Angiography was performed at 2 weeks (n = 7), 1 month (n = 8), and 3 months (n = 4) immediately before sacrifice. Aneurysm occlusion was graded on a 3-point scale (grade I, complete occlusion; grade II, near-complete occlusion; grade III, incomplete occlusion). Toluidine blue staining was used for histologic evaluation. En face CD31 immunofluorescent staining was performed to quantify neck endothelialization. RESULTS Markedly reduced intra-aneurysmal flow was observed on angiography immediately after device placement in all aneurysms. Grade I or II occlusion was noted in 4 (57%) aneurysms at 2-week, in 6 (75%) aneurysms at 4-week, and in 3 (75%) aneurysms at 12-week follow-up. All 17 lumbar arteries were patent. CD31 staining showed that 75% ± 16% of the aneurysm neck region was endothelialized. Histopathology demonstrated incorporation of the thin film nitinol flow diverter into the vessel wall and no evidence of excessive neointimal hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS In this rabbit model, the thin film nitinol flow diverter achieved high rates of aneurysm occlusion and promoted tissue in-growth and aneurysm neck healing, even early after implantation.","Ding, Y; Dai, D; Kallmes, D F; Schroeder, D; Kealey, C P; Gupta, V; Johnson, A D; Kadirvel, R",AJNR.

127158,"Reply to ""Crashing NASH in Patients Listed for Bariatric Surgery"".",2019,"BACKGROUND While molecular testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is highly sensitive than traditional approaches, the cost can be prohibitive. Those high costs are amplified when the recommended screening approach is used, which requires separate testing of specimens from three anatomic sites (rectal, pharyngeal and urogenital). While individual molecular testing is standard of care (SOC), pooled testing may offer a cost-saving alternative. METHODS Using the Xpert® CT/NG assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) we tested urine, rectal and pharyngeal swabs for CT and NG in a high-risk cohort of participants assigned male at birth who reported sex with other persons who were assigned male at birth. Remnant specimens (0.34 mL from each anatomic site) were combined to perform a single 'pooled' test. We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the pooled testing results with SOC Xpert CT/NG test results as the reference. RESULTS We conducted 644 pooled tests. Of those, 598 (92.3%) gave CT and NG results. The CT positive and negative percent agreement were 90.1% (95% CI: 80.7%, 95.9%) and 99.2% (98.1%, 99.8%), respectively. The NG positive and negative percent agreement were 96.2% (95% CI: 86.8%, 99.5%) and 99.8% (95% CI: 99.0%, 100%), respectively. Pooled testing identified 4 CT and 1 NG infections that were negative at all anatomic sites by individual testing. CONCLUSIONS Three-site pooled CT and NG testing performs similarly to single anatomic site testing among tests providing a valid result. Future cost analyses should evaluate the cost effectiveness of pooled three-site testing to determine if such a strategy improves the feasibility and accessibility of molecular STI testing.","Bristow, Claire C; Mehta, Sanjay R; Hoenigl, Martin; Little, Susan J",Sexually transmitted diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34110736/,667

Over the past decade, there have been significant advancements in radiation oncology practice, which have made modern treatments safer and more conformal. Despite this sophistication and evidence supporting a continued role for RT, numerous data suggest that utilization is on the decline. In this review, we discuss the rationale for RT in 4 commonly encountered scenarios: combined modality therapy for limited-stage aggressive NHL, consolidation therapy for advanced-stage aggressive NHL, and the changing roles of salvage RT for relapsed/refractory NHL in an era of new frontiers such as cellular therapies. We also evaluate current strategies to treat indolent histologies. We conclude with perspectives on how RT for the hematological malignancies may continue to evolve.","Imber, Brandon S; Yahalom, Joachim",Cancer journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0000000000000453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32496455/,667
127210,A Specifically Designed Stent for Anastomotic Leaks after Bariatric Surgery: Experiences in a Tertiary Referral Hospital.,2016,"BACKGROUND Caffeine is indicated for the management of apnoea of prematurity and extubation in preterm infants. Early initiation of caffeine administration has increased in the past decades with the purpose of reducing respiratory morbidity. However, there might be harms associated with this approach. This systematic review aims to assess whether early administration of caffeine reduces morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. METHODS The methods were published in a preregistered protocol. The literature search was performed in February 2019 with no restrictions for language or publication date. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing early versus late caffeine administration to infants born before week 34 were included. RESULTS Two RCTs and 14 cohort studies were included. All studies but one had a serious/critical overall risk of bias. Few studies reported on long-term or patient-relevant outcomes. No meta-analysis could be performed. CONCLUSION Based on the available evidence, no conclusions about the optimal timing of caffeine administration can be drawn. There are inherent methodological problems in the cohort studies. RCTs are needed to answer the question of optimal timing for caffeine administration in neonatal care. Future trials should focus on outcomes relevant to patients and their families and include long-term outcomes.","Vujovic, Sandra Nylander; Nava, Chiara; Johansson, Minna; Bruschettini, Matteo",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-0757-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931506/,667

127816,Robotic cylindrical abdominoperineal resection with transabdominal levator transection.,2011,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019. At the time of writing (October 2020), the number of cases of COVID-19 had been approaching 38 million and more than 1 million deaths were attributable to it. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible and could rapidly spread in hospital wards. OBJECTIVE The work undertaken aimed to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of viral detection point-of-care tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared with laboratory-based tests. A further objective was to assess occupancy levels in hospital areas, such as waiting bays, before allocation to an appropriate bay. PERSPECTIVE/SETTING The perspective was that of the UK NHS in 2020. The setting was a hypothetical hospital with an accident and emergency department. METHODS An individual patient model was constructed that simulated the spread of disease and mortality within the hospital and recorded occupancy levels. Thirty-two strategies involving different hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 tests were modelled. Recently published desirable and acceptable target product profiles for SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests were modelled. Incremental analyses were undertaken using both incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefits, and key patient outcomes, such as death and intensive care unit care, caused directly by COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS A SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile appears to have a relatively small number of infections, a low occupancy level within the waiting bays, and a high net monetary benefit. However, if hospital laboratory testing can produce results in 6 hours, then the benefits of point-of-care tests may be reduced. The acceptable target product profiles performed less well and had lower net monetary benefits than both a laboratory-based test with a 24-hour turnaround time and strategies using data from currently available SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. The desirable and acceptable point-of-care test target product profiles had lower requirement for patients to be in waiting bays before being allocated to an appropriate bay than laboratory-based tests, which may be of high importance in some hospitals. Tests that appeared more cost-effective also had better patient outcomes. LIMITATIONS There is considerable uncertainty in the values for key parameters within the model, although calibration was undertaken in an attempt to mitigate this. The example hospital simulated will also not match those of decision-makers deciding on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of introducing SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests. Given these limitations, the results should be taken as indicative rather than definitive, particularly cost-effectiveness results when the relative cost per SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS Should a SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test with a desirable target product profile become available, this appears promising, particularly when the reduction on the requirements for waiting bays before allocation to a SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, or a non-SARS-CoV-2-infected bay, is considered. The results produced should be informative to decision-makers who can identify the results most pertinent to their specific circumstances. FUTURE WORK More accurate results could be obtained when there is more certainty on the diagnostic accuracy of, and the reduction in time to test result associated with, SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care tests, and on the impact of these tests on occupancy of waiting bays and isolation bays. These parameters are currently uncertain. FUNDING This report was commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Evidence Synthesis programme as project number 132154.

128012,Image-Guided Surgery: A New Concept in Minimally Invasive Surgery.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND Neuroinflammation is the major pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Microglia are activated and polarized to either the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, which act as a critical mediator of neuroinflammation. Sestrin2 has pro-survival properties against ischemic brain injury. However, whether sestrin2 has an anti-inflammatory function by shifting microglia polarization and its underlying mechanism is unknown. METHODS Adult male C57BL/6 mice (N = 108) underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and were treated with exogenous sestrin2. Neurological deficit scores and infarct volume were determined. Cell apoptosis was examined by TUNEL staining and Western blotting. The expression of inflammatory mediators, M1/M2-specific markers, and signaling pathways were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunostaining, and Western blotting. To explore the underlying mechanism, primary neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and then treated with oxygenated condition medium of BV2 cells incubated with different doses of sestrin2. RESULTS Sestrin2 attenuated the neurological deficits, infarction volume, and cell apoptosis after tMCAO compared to those in the control (p < 0.05). Sestrin2 had an anti-inflammatory effect and could suppress M1 microglia polarization and promote M2 microglia polarization. Condition medium from BV2 cells cultured with sestrin2 reduced neuronal apoptosis after OGD in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sestrin2 drives microglia to the M2 phenotype by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and restoring autophagic flux. CONCLUSIONS Sestrin2 exhibited neuroprotection by shifting microglia polarization from the M1 to M2 phenotype in ischemic mouse brain, which may be due to suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway and the restoration of autophagic flux.","He, Tingting; Li, Wanlu; Song, Yaying; Li, Zongwei; Tang, Yaohui; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of neuroinflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-020-01987-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153476/,667
128293,Groin defects seen at extra-peritoneal laparoscopic dissection during surgical treatment of athletic pubalgia.,2015,"BACKGROUND Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Surgery is a mainstay therapy unfortunately burdened by complications as severe postoperative pain. Regional anesthesia may play a role in a multimodal strategy for prevention and treatment of postoperative pain. The main purpose of this survey was to investigate the rate of use of regional anesthesia techniques in patients undergoing breast surgery in the Italian public hospital system. METHODS We designed an online survey that consisted of 22 questions investigating the anesthesia management of breast surgery, particularly focused on regional anesthesia. The survey lasted from November 18, 2019 to February 28, 2020. Directors of anesthesia departments of 168 Italian public health system hospitals were contacted and invited to forward the survey to every anesthesiologist in their unit. RESULTS A total of 935 anesthesiologists received the survey; among them 460 entered the final analysis. Regional anesthesia was not used by 44.6% of the anesthesiologists and lack of experience/training was the main cause (75.6%). Logistic regression models revealed that anesthesiologists with more than 15 years of experience (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.93) or working most of their days in intensive care unit (ICU) compared to operating theater (OR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43) were less likely to perform regional anesthesia techniques. CONCLUSIONS Low implementation of regional anesthesia techniques in breast surgery emerges from our survey and the major reason cited is a lack of proper training. An improved training program in regional anesthesia, especially in residents' curricula, could be useful to increase its rate of use and to standardize its practice.","Bonvicini, Daniele; De Cassai, Alessandro; Andreatta, Giulio; Salvagno, Michele; Carbonari, Ilaria; Carere, Anna; Fornasier, Marcello; Iori, Davide; Negrello, Michele; Grutta, Giuseppe; Navalesi, Paolo",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232953/,667
128301,"Technical success, resection status, and procedural complication rate of colonoscopic full-wall resection: a pooled analysis from 7 hospitals of different care levels.",2020-07-09,"OBJECTIVE SARS-CoV-2 can reportedly exist on inanimate surfaces for a long duration, but there is limited data available from Italian COVID-19 hospital wards, especially for non-intensive care units hosting patients that do not require mechanical ventilation. Identification of the extent of environmental contamination can help in understanding possible virus transmission routes, limit hospital infections and protect healthcare workers. Thus, we investigated virus contamination on surfaces of the acute COVID-19 ward of an Italian hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ward surfaces, including four points inside and six points outside the patients' rooms were sampled by swabs, seven hours after routine sanitation. To minimize the risk of underestimation of virus detection, two different sensitive molecular methods were used comparatively, and specific internal controls were added to enhance the efficiency of all the analysis steps. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 contamination was detected in only three out of all the collected samples, i.e., on two floors and one-bathroom sink, likely reflecting aerosol and saliva contamination, respectively. The overall level of contamination was low, and the floors exhibited a very low level of SARS-CoV-2 presence, evidenced by only one of the two methods used. CONCLUSIONS The existence of SARS-CoV-2 on hospital surfaces may be limited, although it was reported to persist for a longer duration on surfaces under controlled laboratory conditions. Thus, effective transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by surfaces/fomites within the hospital ward may be a rare event. However, the results highlight the importance of assessing method sensitivity and including controls when investigating low-level virus contamination so as to avoid the risk of underestimation of virus presence.","D'accolti, M; Soffritti, I; Passaro, A; Zuliani, G; Antonioli, P; Mazzacane, S; Manfredini, R; Caselli, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_22872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965015/,667

128466,Endolumenal colon occlusion device for transanal and transrectal surgery--a porcine feasibility study.,2013,"OBJECTIVE The long-term effectiveness of endovascular treatment of large and giant wide-neck aneurysms using traditional endovascular techniques has been disappointing, with high recanalization and re-treatment rates. Flow diversion with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) has been recently used as a stand-alone therapy for complex aneurysms, showing significant improvement in effectiveness while demonstrating a similar safety profile to stent-supported coil treatment. However, relatively little is known about its long-term safety and effectiveness. Here the authors report on the 3-year safety and effectiveness of flow diversion with the PED in a prospective cohort of patients with large and giant internal carotid artery aneurysms enrolled in the Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms (PUFS) trial. METHODS The PUFS trial is a prospective study of 107 patients with 109 aneurysms treated with the PED. Primary effectiveness and safety end points were demonstrated based on independently monitored 180-day clinical and angiographic data. Patients were enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol including 1-, 3-, and 5-year clinical and imaging follow-up. In this paper, the authors report the midstudy (3-year) effectiveness and safety data. RESULTS At 3 years posttreatment, 74 subjects with 76 aneurysms underwent catheter angiography as required per protocol. Overall, complete angiographic aneurysm occlusion was observed in 71 of these 76 aneurysms (93.4% cure rate). Five aneurysms were re-treated, using either coils or additional PEDs, for failure to occlude, and 3 of these 5 were cured by the 3-year follow-up. Angiographic cure with one or two treatments of Pipeline embolization alone was therefore achieved in 92.1%. No recanalization of a previously completely occluded aneurysm was noted on the 3-year angiograms. There were 3 (2.6%) delayed device- or aneurysm-related serious adverse events, none of which led to permanent neurological sequelae. No major or minor late-onset hemorrhagic or ischemic cerebrovascular events or neurological deaths were observed in the 6-month through 3-year posttreatment period. Among 103 surviving patients, 85 underwent functional outcome assessment in which modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-1 were demonstrated in 80 subjects. CONCLUSIONS Pipeline embolization is safe and effective in the treatment of complex large and giant aneurysms of the intracranial internal carotid artery. Unlike more traditional endovascular treatments, flow diversion results in progressive vascular remodeling that leads to complete aneurysm obliteration over longer-term follow-up without delayed aneurysm recanalization and/or growth.

Theseconsultations took place over real-time video, audio, or photography between the on-call ophthalmologist and the patient and/or patient's primary physician. A four-item questionnaire was offered to patients who completed a virtual consultation.Main Outcome Measures: Virtual consultation diagnoses and management outcomes; patient assessment of virtual inpatient and emergent ophthalmic care.Results: Of all 423 included encounters, 258 (61%) occurred during the 4 weeks before offering virtual consultations and 165 (39%) encounters occurred during the subsequent 4-week period, indicating a 36% decrease in ophthalmology consultations over this pandemic period. A total of 120 (28%) encounters were conducted remotely during the 8-week period. In-person emergency department (ED) encounters (as percent of total encounters) decreased from 60% to 36% (p < .01) between the first and eighth weeks of the study period. In the 4 weeks since their implementation, virtual inpatient ophthalmology consultations were utilized in 34 of 165 (21%) consultations. Of those, 20 (59%) were high acuity and 1 (3%) was escalated to the ED for in-person evaluation. Most common management decisions made included medication prescription in 46 (55%) patients and scheduling follow-up for 44 (30%) patients. In a survey administered to all 120 patients who were managed over phone or video, 56 (47%) responded. Respondents were in general agreement (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and expressed satisfaction with phone and virtual encounters. Specifically, 42 (49%) of 86 patients who had phone encounters noted a mean weighted satisfaction score of 4.6 out of 5 and 14 (41%) responders of 34 virtual consultation encounters noted a mean weighted satisfaction score of 4.9 out of 5. The difference between the average weighted satisfaction scores favored virtual consultation over telephone encounters (p < .01).Conclusions: Virtual inpatient ophthalmology consultations are feasible and have reported high patient satisfaction. Implementing video-based technologies to deliver high-acuity ophthalmic triage and management may help to promote patient and provider safety. In our experience, patients favored virtual consultation over telephone encounters.","Kalra, Gagan; Commiskey, Patrick W; Schempf, Tadhg; Williams, Andrew M; Bowers, Eve M R; Waxman, Evan L; Fu, Roxana",Seminars in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820538.2021.1890144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33641597/,667

Emerging evidence confirms that respiratory viruses are associated with deterioration of pulmonary function and exacerbation and facilitation of bacterial colonization in CF patients. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory viruses in CF airways, to discuss the resulting inflammation and RVI response, to determine how to detect the viruses, and to assess their clinical consequences, prevalence, and interactions with bacteria. The most predominant are Rhinoviruses (RVs), significantly associated with CF exacerbation. Molecular techniques, and especially multiplex PCR, help to diagnose viral infections, and the coming rise of metagenomics will extend knowledge of viral populations in the complex ecosystem of CF airways. Prophylaxis and vaccination are currently available only for Respiratory syncytial and Influenza virus (IV), but antiviral molecules are being tested to improve CF patients' care. All the points raised in this review highlight the importance of taking account of RVIs and their potential impact on the CF airway ecosystem.","Billard, Lisa; Le Berre, Rozenn; Pilorgé, Léa; Payan, Christopher; Héry-Arnaud, Geneviève; Vallet, Sophie",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841x.2017.1297763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28340310/,667

However, FW composition and physico-chemical and biological characteristics affect the overall biological process in terms of product yield and degradation rate. To overcome this major bottle-neck, the pretreatment of FW is proposed. Therefore this review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the importance of pretreatment of FW with respect to FW management by anaerobic digestion (AD) and dark fermentation (DF). It also reviews the existing knowledge gaps and future research perspectives for better integration of FW pretreatments for AD and DF, which should include (i) the preservation of carbon mass through freeze and thaw, or drying; and (ii) improve the carbon accessibility through particle size reduction and thermal pretreatments for high-rate bioenergy recovery.","Parthiba Karthikeyan, Obulisamy; Trably, Eric; Mehariya, Sanjeet; Bernet, Nicolas; Wong, Jonathan W C; Carrere, Hélène",Bioresource technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29111164/,667

However, the mechanism of the co-infection is unclear. In this study, neonatal non-colostrum-fed piglets were exposed orally with a single infection of PDCoV or PEDV, or coinfection of PDCoV and PEDV. Clinically all viral infected piglets developed watery diarrhea and dehydration in 24 h post-exposure (hpe) and were succumbed to viral diarrhea disease and euthanized at 72 hpe. Histopathologically, acute gastroenteritis is evident in all viral infected piglet. Immunohistochemistry, RNAscope and RT-qPCR demonstrated that PEDV tropism changes from epithelial cells of small intestine to gastric epithelial cells and macrophages in Peyer's patches in the ileum. These findings suggest that coinfection of PDCoV and PEDV can alter PEDV tropism that may affect the outcome of viral disease in piglets. This animal model can be used for the pathogenesis and vaccination of viral coinfection in piglet in the future.","Jiao, Zhe; Liang, Jixiang; Yang, Yilin; Li, Yang; Yan, Zhishan; Hu, Guangli; Gu, Changqin; Hu, Xueying; Cheng, Guofu; Peng, Guiqing; Zhang, Wanpo",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2021.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33756424/,667
129051,How vets are helping.,2020-05-02,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, has become a global pandemic. Given that the highest viral load of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found in the airway, otolaryngologists are at high risk of infection. As a result, multiple recommendations have emerged regarding protective measures for surgical teams, including suspending non-urgent procedures and surgeries. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngology residency training programs nationwide. Methods A cross-sectional survey-based study was completed in April 2020. The participants were recruited through an online survey, sent by email to all Chilean otolaryngology residents. Demographics, clinical activities, on-call shifts, COVID-19 infection status, exposure to COVID-19 patients, deployment to other specialties, diagnostic/therapeutic procedures, and surgeries performed were analyzed. Self-reported surgical data logs from previous years were used to compare results. Results Forty-seven residents completed the survey (84% response rate); 64% of residents refer seeing patients ten days or less during April 2020. Commonly performed procedures such as flexible nasolaryngoscopy, rigid nasal endoscopy, and peritonsillar abscess drainage were not performed by over 40% of the residents in that month. Only 38% participated in surgeries, with an average of 0.6 surgeries as a first surgeon, a dramatic decrease in surgical exposure when comparing the data logs from previous years. Most residents refer the following measures taken by their residency program to improve residency training: bibliographic videoconferences (87%), online clinical case seminars (60%), weekly journal clubs (38%), among others. Conclusions Clinical and surgical opportunities decreased dramatically during April 2020. Adjustments to the regular academic curricula should be considered to decrease the negative impact of this pandemic on residency training.","Álvarez, Matías L; Waissbluth, Sofia; González, Claudia; Napolitano, Carla; Torrente, Mariela; Délano, Paul H; Alarcón, Ricardo; Fernández, Francisca; Bitrán, Roger",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.01.8097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617520/,667

While practical sessions are important for the acquisition of clinical skills, few studies have examined the role of home-based simulation learning (HBSL). This study aims to identify key aspects of simulation design and factors associated with students' satisfaction with HBSL. METHODS During a ""circuit-breaker"" period in Singapore, the Nanyang Polytechnic School of Health & Social Sciences (Oral Health Therapy) distributed portable manikins and instruments to students and staff for use at home. Synchronous teaching sessions with real-time feedback were carried out over the Zoom teleconferencing platform. A cross-sectional survey of students was conducted after 3 weeks of the HBSL program. Multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to assess the association between satisfaction with domains of simulation design and overall satisfaction with HBSL. RESULTS The top three factors of importance to students in HBSL were feedback and guided reflection, support, and objectives and information. Final-year students expressed higher levels of overall satisfaction and self-confidence following HBSL than first-year students. Satisfaction with the objectives (β = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.57), support (β = 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.42), and problem-solving (β = 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.46) domains in the Simulation Design Scale were positively associated with overall student satisfaction and self-confidence in learning. CONCLUSION The findings can aid educators in the design of future HBSL programs, with a focus on areas of simulation design that are of importance to students.","Tan, Sharon Hui Xuan; Ansari, Anshad; Ali, Noohu Mohamed Irfan; Yap, Adrian Ujin",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33660871/,667

It is not known if the same inhibitory process might influence covert orienting in the absence of saccades, and consequently alter visual perception. In Experiment 1 (n = 14), we measured orientation discrimination during a covert orienting task in which an uninformative exogenous visual cue preceded the onset of an oriented probe by 140-290 ms. In half of the trials, the onset of the probe was accompanied by a brief irrelevant flash, a visual transient that would normally induce SI. We report a time-dependent inhibition of covert orienting in which the irrelevant flash impaired orientation discrimination accuracy when the probe followed the cue by 190 and 240 ms. The interference was more pronounced when the cue was incongruent with the probe location, suggesting an impact on the reorienting component of the attentional shift. In Experiment 2 (n = 12), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the flash could occur within an earlier time range, or only within the later, reorienting range. We presented probes at congruent cue locations in a time window between 50 and 200 ms. Similar to Experiment 1, discrimination performance was altered at 200 ms after the cue. We suggest that covert attention may be susceptible to similar inhibitory mechanisms that generate SI, especially in later stages of attentional shifting (> 200 ms after a cue), typically associated with reorienting.","Buonocore, Antimo; Dietze, Niklas; McIntosh, Robert D",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-021-06164-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34216231/,667
129391,Dual-port laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection using the intended stoma site as the multichannel port.,2015,"PURPOSE Delivering the recommended care is an important quality measure that has been insufficiently studied in urology. Obstructive pyelonephritis is a suitable case study for this focus because many patients do not receive such care, although guidelines advocate decompression. We determined the influence of hospital factors, particularly familiarity with urolithiasis, on the likelihood of decompression in such patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS We used the NIS from 2002 to 2011 to retrospectively identify patients admitted to community hospitals with severe infection and ureteral calculi. Hospital familiarity with nephrolithiasis was estimated by calculating hospital stone volume (divided into quartiles) and hospital treatment intensity (the decompression rate in patients with ureteral calculi and no infection). After calculating national estimates we performed logistic regression to determine the association between the receipt of decompression and hospital stone volume, controlling for treatment intensity and other covariates thought to be associated with receiving recommended care. RESULTS Of an estimated 107,848 patients with obstructive pyelonephritis 27.4% failed to undergo decompression. Discrepancies were greatest between hospitals with the highest and lowest stone volumes (76% vs 25%, OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.94-3.96, p <0.01) as well as high and low treatment intensity (78% vs 37%, p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS High hospital stone volume and treatment intensity were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving decompression. Such findings might be useful to identify hospitals and regions where access to quality urological care should be augmented.","Borofsky, Michael S; Walter, Dawn; Li, Huilin; Shah, Ojas; Goldfarb, David S; Sosa, R Ernest; Makarov, Danil V",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2014.09.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25234299/,667

As a route to providing a framework for understanding public information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, this study examined the characteristics of communicative behaviors of social media audiences in response to Ebola outbreak news. Grounded in the social amplification of risks framework, this study adds to an understanding of information behaviors of online audiences by showing empirical differences in audience engagement with online health information. The data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Facebook channel. The final data set included 809 CDC posts and 35,916 audience comments. The analysis identified the differences in audience information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, Ebola, and health promotion posts. While the CDC had fewer posts on Ebola than health promotion topics, the former received more attention from active page users. Furthermore, audience members who actively engaged with Ebola news had a small overlap with those who engaged with non-Ebola information during the same period. Overall, this study demonstrated that information behavior and audience engagement is topic dependent. Furthermore, audiences who commented on news about an emerging pandemic were homogenous and varied in their degree of information amplification.","Strekalova, Yulia A",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198116660310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27413028/,667

All isoforms share a fundamentally conserved architecture that consists of an N-terminal, autoinhibitory, importin-β-binding (IBB) domain and a C-terminal Arm (Armadillo)-core that associates with nuclear localization signal (NLS) cargoes. Despite striking similarity in amino acid sequence and 3D structure, importin-α isoforms display remarkable substrate specificity in vivo. In the present review, we look at key differences among importin-α isoforms and provide a comprehensive inventory of known viral and cellular cargoes that have been shown to associate preferentially with specific isoforms. We illustrate how the diversification of the adaptor importin α into seven isoforms expands the dynamic range and regulatory control of nucleocytoplasmic transport, offering unexpected opportunities for pharmacological intervention. The emerging view of importin α is that of a key signalling molecule, with isoforms that confer preferential nuclear entry and spatiotemporal specificity on viral and cellular cargoes directly linked to human diseases.","Pumroy, Ruth A; Cingolani, Gino",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20141186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25656054/,667

Concentration-effect modelling was used to assess the effect of two dosages of nolasiban (900 mg and 1800 mg) on QTc following single-dose administration. We found no significant change in QTc at all tested dosages. Two-sided 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean Cmax for estimated QTc effects of nolasiban were below the threshold of regulatory concern. The sensitivity of the assay to detect small changes in QTc was confirmed by a significant shortening of QTc between 2 and 4 h after consumption of a meal, which served to validate the model. Independent of the nolasiban assessment, this study also explored the effects of sex hormones on ECG parameters, especially QT subintervals. We found a significant relationship between JTpc and oestradiol. Heart rate was negatively correlated with progesterone.

Initially in India, this disease was concentrated in major urban cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, and Chennai, which were the national hotspots for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in subsequent months, returning migrants (mainly day labour) brought the disease back to their home; this vector triggered significant spread to semi-urban and rural areas. This highlighted serious concerns in rural India, where access to sophisticated healthcare and mitigation strategies were lacking. There is little data on this new pattern of disease spread.

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS Seventy-two patients (72 eyes) with glaucoma. METHODS Before and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after anterior chamber BGI insertion, we evaluated the central corneal ECD (CCECD) and peripheral corneal ECD (PCECD) in the area of the tube; anterior chamber (AC) flare; tube insertion entry site position relative to Schwalbe's line (SL), defined as all of the entry site behind SL (tube insertion position 1), less than 50% of entry site anterior to SL (tube insertion position 2), more than 50% but less than 100% of entry site anterior to SL (tube insertion position 3 [TIP3]), and all of the entry site in front of SL (tube insertion position 4 [TIP4]); anterior segment (AS) OCT tube parameters, including posterior cornea-to-tube tip distance, tube angle-to-posterior corneal surface distance, tube tip-to-anterior iris distance, tube length (TL), and tube angle-to-anterior iris distance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were CCECD and PCECD loss at 5 years. Secondary outcomes included prognostic factors for ECD loss: tube insertion entry site position relative to SL, AS OCT tube parameters, AC flare, and clinical factors including IOP. RESULTS Sixty-four patients (64 eyes) completed the study. The mean percentage CCECD and PCECD losses at 5 years were 36.8% and 50.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis at 5 years, a lower CCECD was associated with TIP3. Tube angle-to-anterior iris distance, TL, and TIP3 were associated with lower PCECD at 5 years. Multiple regression analysis revealed TIP3 to be associated with both lower CCECD (standardized β coefficient, -0.27; P = 0.015) and PCECD (standardized β coefficient, -0.23; P = 0.028). A short TL (standardized β coefficient, 0.26; P = 0.016) also was associated with lower PCECD. The fastest rate of cell loss was associated with TIP3 for CCECD and TIP4 for PCECD. CONCLUSIONS Anterior chamber BGI insertion is associated with ECD loss greatest close to the tube. Tube insertion in the vicinity of, or anterior to SL, and short TL were associated with significant ECD loss with time.","Hau, Scott; Bunce, Catey; Barton, Keith",Ophthalmology.

130057,IJU This Issue.,2021-01-01,"The innate immune system guards against virus infection through a variety of mechanisms including mobilization of the host interferon system, which attacks viral products mainly at a posttranscriptional level. The influenza virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since NS1 is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress NS1 function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another RNA virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between NS1 and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon mRNA induction during infection, which is known to be caused by NS1. In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of NS1 protein to inhibit double-stranded RNA-dependent activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to NS1, because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of NS1 can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.","Basu, Dipanwita; Walkiewicz, Marcin P; Frieman, Matthew; Baric, Ralph S; Auble, David T; Engel, Daniel A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01805-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19052087/,667

Most children are falsely labelled and can safely tolerate a penicillin but delabelling strategies are underutilised and paediatric-specific resources are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate an allergy assessment tool for children in hospital. METHODS We evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool, using an online survey of clinicians in a tertiary paediatric hospital, with 10 hypothetical potential penicillin allergy or adverse reaction cases (including non-allergy reactions). For each case, respondents were asked to use the tool to assign a reaction phenotype and recommend management. We determined the tool's sensitivity, specificity and acceptability to end users. RESULTS We evaluated 30 complete survey responses from senior and junior medical staff, nurses and pharmacists. The tool's overall sensitivity was 80.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 74.2-87.1%) for assigning the correct reaction phenotype and 85.3% (95% CI 79.4-91.3%) for appropriate management. The tool had high sensitivity for identifying immediate hypersensitivity reactions at 95.6% (95% CI 90.2-100%). Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would use the tool in their practice (22/30, 73.3%). CONCLUSION This survey evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool in a tertiary paediatric hospital among multidisciplinary clinician groups.

The findings suggest the need for better risk stratification of diabetic groups prior to cardiac surgery and for improved cardiovascular risk management post-surgery in tablet-controlled diabetes patients.","Haqzad, Yama; Hobkirk, James; Ariyaratnam, Priyadharshanan; Chaudhry, Mubarak; Carroll, Sean; Loubani, And Mahmoud",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0218492321999551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730864/,667

Using anion photodissociation spectroscopy, we have measured the intrinsic absorption electronic spectroscopy (400-214 nm) and numerous accompanying ionic photofragmentation pathways of the benzophenone-4 anion ([BP4-H]-). Relative ion yield plots reveal the locations of the bright S1 and S3 excited states. For the first time for an ionic UV filter, ab initio potential energy surfaces are presented to provide new insight into how the photofragment identity maps the relaxation pathways. These calculations reveal that [BP4-H]- undergoes excited-state decay consistent with a statistical fragmentation process where the anion breaks down on the ground state after nonradiative relaxation. The broader relevance of the results in providing a basis for interpreting the relaxation dynamics of a wide range of gas-phase is discussed.","Wong, Natalie G K; Rankine, Conor D; Dessent, Caroline E H",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.1c00423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719458/,667

130610,Attaining high bending stiffness by full actuation in steerable minimally invasive surgical instruments.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Sonographic technologies can estimate extravascular lung water (EVLW) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This study investigated the suitability of a handheld scanner in contrast to a portable scanner for quantifying EVLW in hospitalized patients requiring HD. METHODS In this prospective study, 54 hospitalized HD patients were enrolled. Bedside lung ultrasound was performed within 30 min before and after dialysis using handheld (phased array transducer, 1.7-3.8 MHz) and portable (curved probe, 5-2 MHz) ultrasound devices. Eight lung zones were scanned for total B-lines number (TBLN). The maximum diameter of inferior vena cava (IVC) was measured. We performed Passing-Bablok regression, Deming regression, Bland-Altman, and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The 2 devices did not differ in measuring TBLN and IVC (p > 0.05), showing a high correlation (r = 0.92 and r = 0.51, respectively). Passing-Bablok regression had a slope of 1.11 and an intercept of 0 for TBLN, and the slope of Deming regression was 1.02 within the CI bands of 0.94 and 1.11 in the full cohort. TBLN was logarithmically transformed for Bland-Altman analysis, showing a bias of 0.06 (TBLN = 1.2) between devices. The slope and intercept of the Deming regression in IVC measurements were 0.77 and 0.46, respectively; Bland-Altman plot showed a bias of -0.07. Compared with predialysis, TBLN significantly (p < 0.001) decreased after dialysis, while IVC was unchanged (p = 0.16). Univariate analysis showed that cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR] 8.94 [2.13-61.96], p = 0.002), smoking history (OR 5.75 [1.8-20.46], p = 0.003), and right pleural effusion (OR 5.0 [1.2-25.99], p = 0.03) were strong predictors of EVLW indicated by TBLN ≥ 4. CONCLUSION The lung and IVC findings obtained from handheld and portable ultrasound scanners are comparable and concordant. Cardiovascular disease and smoking history were strong predictors of EVLW. The use of TBLN to assess EVLW in hospitalized HD patients is feasible. Further studies are needed to determine if TBLN can help guide volume removal in HD patients.","Miao, Jing; Sy-Go, Janina Paula T; Issa, Meltiady; Jenad, Hussam; Manohar, Sandhya; Zoghby, Ziad; Kashani, Kianoush B; Gregoire, James R",Cardiorenal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091459/,667

Pilot-scale tests have proven that they can operate at low temperatures with real wastewaters. However, volumetric treatment rates (VTRs) have been low, reducing the ability for this technology to compete with activated sludge (AS). This paper describes a pilot-scale microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) operated in continuous flow for 6 months. The reactor was fed return sludge liquor, the concentrated filtrate of anaerobic digestion sludge that has a high chemical oxygen demand (COD). The use of a wastewater with increased soluble organics, along with optimisation of the hydraulic retention time (HRT), resulted in the highest VTR achieved by a pilot-scale MEC treating real wastewater. Peak HRT was 0.5-days, resulting in an average VTR of 3.82 kgCOD/m3∙day and a 55% COD removal efficiency. Finally, using the data obtained, a direct analysis of the potential savings from the reduced loading on AS was then made. Theoretical calculation of the required tank size, with the estimated costs and savings, indicates that the use of an MEC as a return sludge liquor pre-treatment technique could result in an industrially viable system.","Leicester, Daniel D; Amezaga, Jaime M; Moore, Andrew; Heidrich, Elizabeth S",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25122945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604914/,667

OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that the effect of phenylephrine on cardiac output is affected by preload dependency. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Single-centre, University Hospital of Caen, France. PATIENTS Fifty ventilated patients undergoing surgery were studied during hypotension before and after administration of phenylephrine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), corrected flow time, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure variations (PPV) and systemic vascular resistance index were used to assess effects of changes in preload dependency. RESULTS Twenty seven (54%) patients were included in the preload-dependent group (PPV ≥ 13%) and 23 (46%) in the preload-independent group (PPV < 13%) before administration of phenylephrine. For the whole cohort, phenylephrine increased mean arterial pressure [58 (±8) mmHg vs. 79 (±13) mmHg; P < 0.0001] and calculated systemic vascular resistance index [2010 (1338; 2481) dyn s cm m vs. 2989 (2155; 3870) dyn s cm m; P < 0.0001]. However, CI and SV decreased in the preload-independent group [2.3 (1.9; 3.7) l min m vs. 1.8 (1.5; 2.7) l min m; P < 0.0001 and 65 (44; 81) ml vs. 56 (39; 66) ml; P < 0.0001 for both] but not in the preload-dependent group [respectively 2.1 (1.8; 3.5) l min m vs. 2.1 (1.8; 3.3) l min m; P = 0.168 and 49 (41; 67) ml vs. 53 (41; 69) ml; P = 0.191]. Corrected flow time increased [294 (47) ms vs. 306 (56) ms; P = 0.031], and PPV decreased [17 (15; 19) % vs.12 (14; 16) %; P < 0.0003] only in the PPV at least 13% group. CONCLUSION The effects of phenylephrine on CI and SV depend on preload. CI and SV decreased in preload-independent patients through increase in afterload, but were unchanged in those preload-dependent through increased venous return.","Rebet, Olivier; Andremont, Olivier; Gérard, Jean-Louis; Fellahi, Jean-Luc; Hanouz, Jean-Luc; Fischer, Marc-Olivier",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164015/,667

131047,Robot-assisted laparoscopic transperitoneal pelvic lymphadenectomy and metastasectomy for melanoma: initial report of two cases.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Pain is highly prevalent in the adult population diagnosed with liver disease. Those progressing to advanced liver disease often experience persistent pain and poor pain relief. There is presently limited guidance for the management of pain and associated symptoms in this population. The current literature lacks attention on how physical, psychological and social domains of liver disease modulate the pain experience. In this paper, we outline our scoping review protocol to systematically review the literature from academic bibliographic databases and grey sources to identify and map the biopsychosocial factors associated with pain in adults with advanced liver disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Arksey and O'Malley's methodology, and Tricco et al's Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews, will guide the process for this scoping review. The literature search will include electronic and hand-searching methods using scholarly and grey sources. Scholarly databases include Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. Grey databases will focus on research studies not captured in the scholarly databases including those by government agencies and professional organisations. Two members of the research team will independently screen the resulting publications following specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality appraisal of the included research studies will employ the use of the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2018. Data collection and extraction of study characteristics will use a data extraction tool developed iteratively by the research team. Analysis of the factors associated with pain outcomes will be mapped and described according to the domains of the biopsychosocial model of pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The scoping review involves analysis of the published literature on pain and advanced liver disease and does not require ethics approval. The results will be shared with expert stakeholders to help establish clinical significance. We will disseminate the findings through publication in a scholarly journal: local, provincial, national and international scientific and professional conferences.

In Uganda, teenage pregnancy is a public and community health issue. Objectives This study hypothesized that there would be regional variations in rates, risk factors and trends of teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Methods Data were analyzed from the Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys (UDHS) in 2006 and 2011. The outcome of interest was current pregnancy for females 15 to 19 years of age at the time of the survey. Bivariate analysis was performed for each year to examine the rate and trends of pregnancy by various demographic characteristics. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between teenage pregnancy and sociodemographic variables. Results Uganda's rate of teenage pregnancy increased from 7.3/1000 in 2006 to 8.1/1000 in 2011. The East Central region consistently had the highest rates than other regions. In 2006, teenage pregnancy was significantly associated with being married, living with a partner or separated, as compared to those who were single. Marital and wealth status were also significant predictors of teenage pregnancy based on the 2011 survey. Conclusion The rate of teenage pregnancy in Uganda is high and the trend demonstrated regional variation. Future interventions could focus on regions with high poverty and low education.","Byonanebye, Joseph; Brazauskas, Ruta; Tumwesigye, Nazarius; Young, Staci; May, Thomas; Cassidy, Laura",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.48; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394256/,667

To support pediatric clinical studies for investigational treatments of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pediatric-specific dosing is required. Objective To define pediatric-specific dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were used to extrapolate investigated adult dosages toward children (March 2020-April 2020). Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform pediatric dosing for hydroxychloroquine. For remdesivir, pediatric dosages were derived using allometric-scaling with age-dependent exponents. Dosing simulations were conducted using simulated pediatric and adult participants based on the demographics of a white US population. Interventions Simulated drug exposures following a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours × 2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours × 8 doses) and a single 200-mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants. A simulation-based dose-ranging study was conducted in simulated children exploring different absolute and weight-normalized dosing strategies. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome for hydroxychloroquine was average unbound plasma concentrations for 5 treatment days. Additionally, unbound interstitial lung concentrations were simulated. For remdesivir, the primary outcome was plasma exposure (area under the curve, 0 to infinity) following single-dose administration. Results For hydroxychloroquine, the physiologically based pharmacokinetic model analysis included 500 and 600 simulated white adult and pediatric participants, respectively, and supported weight-normalized dosing for children weighing less than 50 kg. Geometric mean-simulated average unbound plasma concentration values among children within different developmental age groups (32-35 ng/mL) were congruent to adults (32 ng/mL). Simulated unbound hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung interstitial fluid mirrored those in unbound plasma and were notably lower than in vitro concentrations needed to mediate antiviral activity. For remdesivir, the analysis included 1000 and 6000 simulated adult and pediatric participants, respectively. The proposed pediatric dosing strategy supported weight-normalized dosing for participants weighing less than 60 kg. Geometric mean-simulated plasma area under the time curve 0 to infinity values among children within different developmental age-groups (4315-5027 ng × h/mL) were similar to adults (4398 ng × h/mL). Conclusions and Relevance This analysis provides pediatric-specific dosing suggestions for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir and raises concerns regarding hydroxychloroquine use for COVID-19 treatment because concentrations were less than those needed to mediate an antiviral effect.","Maharaj, Anil R; Wu, Huali; Hornik, Christoph P; Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Chi D; Smith, P Brian; Gonzalez, Daniel; Zimmerman, Kanecia O; Benjamin, Daniel K; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.2422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501511/,667
131876,Multivariate analysis of risk factors for postoperative complications after laparoscopic liver resection.,2015,"Emerging data suggest an association between obesity and infectious diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying this link are not well established, a number of potential factors may be involved. Indeed, the obesity-related vulnerability to infectious diseases could be due to chronic low-grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, which lead to a weakening of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, obesity results in anatomical-functional changes by the mechanical obstacle of excessive adipose tissue that blunt the respiratory mechanisms and predisposing to respiratory infections. Subjects with obesity are also at risk of skin folds and sweat more profusely due to the thick layers of subcutaneous fat, favoring the proliferation of microorganisms and slowing the repair of wounds down. All these factors make subjects with obesity more prone to develop nosocomial infections, surgical site, skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and mycosis. Furthermore, infections in subjects with obesity have a worse prognosis, frequently prolonging hospitalization time as demonstrated for several flu viruses and recently for COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to provide an overview of the current clinical evidence on the associations between obesity and infectious diseases highlighting physio pathological insights involved in this link.","Muscogiuri, Giovanna; Pugliese, Gabriella; Laudisio, Daniela; Castellucci, Bianca; Barrea, Luigi; Savastano, Silvia; Colao, Annamaria",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719175/,667

Much research on PTSD and TBI has focused on military conflict settings. Less is known about PTSD in civilian TBI. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of PTSD after mild and moderate/severe TBI in civilian populations. We further aimed to explore the influence of methodological quality and assessment methods. A systematic literature search was performed on studies reporting on PTSD in civilian TBI, excluding studies on military populations. The risk of bias was assessed using the MORE-checklist. Meta-analysis was conducted for overall prevalence rates for PTSD with sensitivity analyses for the severity of TBI. Fifty-two studies were included, of which 31 were graded as low risk of bias. Prevalence rates of PTSD in low risk of bias studies varied widely (from 2.6% to 36%) with a pooled prevalence rate of 15.6%. Pooled prevalence rates of PTSD for mild TBI (13.5%, 95%CI:11.7-15.3; I²=2%) did not differ from moderate/severe TBI (11.8, 95%CI:7.5-16.1; I²=63%). Similar rates were reported in studies using different approaches and times of assessment. Although most studies that compared participants with TBI to trauma patients and healthy controls found no difference in prevalence rates of PTSD, a meta-analysis across studies revealed a higher prevalence of PTSD in patients with TBI (OR:1.73, 95%CI:1.21-2.47). This review highlights variability between studies and emphasizes the need for higher quality studies. Further research is warranted to determine risk factors for the development of PTSD after TBI.","Van Praag, Dominique L G; Cnossen, Maryse; Polinder, Suzanne; Wilson, Lindsay; Maas, Andrew",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2018.5759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238819/,667

In particular, push-pull copolymers, consisting of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties, offer broad optical absorption, tunable band gaps, and increased charge transfer between monomer units. However, the large number of possible monomer combinations to explore means screening OPV copolymers by first-principles quantum calculations is computationally intensive. If copolymer band structures could be rapidly computed from homopolymer data, potential materials could be screened more efficiently. In this work, we construct tight binding models of copolymer band structures with parameters determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on homopolymers. We use these models to predict copolymer valence and conduction bands, which compare well to direct DFT calculations of copolymer band structures.","Tipirneni, Prithvi; Jindal, Vishal; Janik, Michael J; Milner, Scott T",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp01833c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830207/,667

Later, it was shown that reactive nitrogen species could also modify proteins. Some protein oxidative modifications promote loss of protein function, cleavage or aggregation, and some result in proteotoxicity and cellular homeostasis disruption. However, not all oxidative modifications are necessarily associated with damage, as with Met and Cys protein residue oxidation. In these cases, redox state changes can alter protein structure, catalytic function, signaling processes in response to metabolic and/or environmental alterations. This review aims to integrate the present knowledge on redox modifications of proteins with their fate and role in redox signaling and human pathological conditions. CRITICAL ISSUES It is hypothesized that protein oxidation participates in the development and progression of many pathological conditions. However, no quantitative data has been correlated with specific oxidized proteins or the progression or severity of pathological conditions. Hence, the comprehension of the mechanisms underlying these modifications, their importance in human pathologies and, the fate of the modified proteins is of clinical relevance. FUTURE DIRECTIONS We discuss new tools to cope with protein oxidation and suggest new approaches for integrating knowledge about protein oxidation and redox processes with human pathophysiological conditions.","Demasi, Marilene; Augusto, Ohara; Bechara, Etelvino J H; Bicev, Renata N; Cerqueira, Fernanda M; da Cunha, Fernanda M; Denicola, Ana; Gomes, Fernando; Miyamoto, Sayuri; Netto, Luis E S; Randall, Lia M; Stevani, Cassius V; Thomson, Leonor",Antioxidants & redox signaling,https://doi.org/10.1089/ars.2020.8176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726509/,667

We use Langevin dynamics simulations of short polymers with two stickers placed symmetrically along their contour to study the effect of the primary sequence of these polymers on their organization inside condensed droplets. We observe that the shape, size, and number of sticker clusters inside the droplet change from a long cylindrical fiber to many compact clusters as one varies the location of stickers along the chain contour. Aging caused by the conversion of intramoleclular to intermolecular associations is observed in droplets of telechelic polymers but not for other sequences of associating polymers.

132924,Supine extraperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy without patient repositioning.,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND Many countries in the world are still struggling to control COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 28, 2020, South Africa reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Sub-Sahara Africa. The country took aggressive steps to control the spread of the virus including setting a national command team for COVID-19 and putting the country on a complete lockdown for more than 100 days. Evidence across most countries has shown that, it is vital to monitor the progression of pandemics and assess the effects of various public health measures, such as lockdowns. Countries need to have scientific tools to assist in monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. The objective of this study was thus to assess the extent to which a systems dynamics model can forecast COVID-19 infections in South Africa and be a useful tool in evaluating government interventions to manage the epidemic through 'what if' simulations. DESIGN AND METHODS This study presents a systems dynamics model (SD) of the COVID-19 infection in South Africa, as one of such tools. The development of the SD model in this study is grounded in design science research which fundamentally builds on prior research of modelling complex systems. RESULTS The SD model satisfactorily replicates the general trend of COVID-19 infections and recovery for South Africa within the first 100 days of the pandemic. The model further confirms that the decision to lockdown the country was a right one, otherwise the country's health capacity would have been overwhelmed. Going forward, the model predicts that the level of infection in the country will peak towards the last quarter of 2020, and thereafter start to decline. Conclusions: Ultimately, the model structure and simulations suggest that a systems dynamics model can be a useful tool in monitoring, predicting and testing interventions to manage COVID-19 with an acceptable margin of error.

133010,Usefulness of the flexible traction method in gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection: an in-vivo animal study.,2020-08-04,"Background The reemergence of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections in the United States was reported from August-October 2014 (691 cases). In Mexico, an outbreak at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases was reported (24 cases). The results of epidemiological surveillance of Enterovirus sp. (EV) and other respiratory viruses in a national pediatric tertiary care level hospital are presented. Methods Following the alert issued by the reemergence of EV-D68 in 2014, epidemiological surveillance -which only detected respiratory viruses by PCR in patients with influenza-like illness using nasopharyngeal swabs- expanded to include children with asthma exacerbation or acute respiratory distress. Positive samples to EV were confirmed and typed by sequencing. Subsequent sequencing was used to obtain the complete viral genome. Results Of 1705 samples, 13 were positive to EV. Patients with EV presented the following comorbidities: chronic lung disease (7.7%), neoplastic disease (15.4%), allergic asthma/rhinitis (23%), recurrent pneumonia (23%), and other (23%). Of the 13 samples positive for EV, three were positive for EV-D68. These cases required invasive mechanical ventilation, presented no neurological involvement and survived. Conclusions The impact of the population studied by EV-D68 was lower than that reported in Mexico during the same period. Cases of EV-D68 infection had multiple comorbidities, but few pulmonary comorbidities, which could explain the low attack rate. The epidemiological surveillance and infection prevention system may have contained the outbreak.","Gamiño-Arroyo, Ana Estela; Sánchez-Huerta, José Luis; Garza-López, Alicia Elhaín de la; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Escobar-Escamilla, Noé; Mendieta-Condado, Edgar; Garcés-Ayala, Fabiola; Barrera-Badillo, Gisela; Ramírez-González, José Ernesto; Díaz-Quiñonez, José Alberto; Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela de la",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/bmhim.m18000002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652870/,667
133189,A Prospective Randomized Study of Pfannenstiel Versus Expanded Port Site Incision for Intact Specimen Extraction in Laparoscopic Radical Nephrectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Dissecting aneurysms located along the distal segments of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are extremely rare, accounting for only 0.5-0.7% of all intracranial aneurysms. Treatment of these aneurysms is challenging, both surgically and endovascularly. We present our preliminary experience and clinical data utilizing Onyx as an embolization agent in the treatment of these lesions with proximal parent artery preservation. METHODS 7 consecutive ruptured peripheral PICA aneurysms, in 7 patients, were treated with superselective Onyx embolization at our institutions. According to the anatomical classification of Lister et al, these aneurysms were located in the lateral medullary segment (n=1), tonsillomedullary segment (n=1), and the telovelotonsillary segment (n=5) of the PICA. Technical feasibility, procedure related complications, angiographic results, follow-up diagnostic imaging, and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS In all cases, endovascular treatment was successful, with complete occlusion of the aneurysm with proximal parent artery preservation at the final postprocedural angiogram. Procedure related complications were not observed. One patient with a poor clinical condition at admission died during the initial hospital stay due to extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. No rebleeding or recanalization was noted during follow-up. Two patients had a residual moderate to severe disability at follow-up. Favorable outcomes, with no or mild disability, were observed in four of the surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS Angiographic, diagnostic imaging, and clinical results of our small series indicate that Onyx embolization of dissecting distal PICA aneurysms with parent artery preservation is an effective option with acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, in those cases in which surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of the aneurysmal sac is not suitable.","Puri, Ajit S; Massari, Francesco; Hou, Samuel Y; Lozano, Juan Diego; Howk, Mary; Perras, Mary; Brooks, Christopher; Gounis, Matthew J; Kan, Peter; Wakhloo, Ajay K",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838199/,667

This comparative case study reviews the organization of Brazil and Turkey's PHC systems to derive lessons that can apply to other countries that may consider reforming the organization of PHC systems as a way to address health inequities. The analysis uses the Flagship Framework to investigate how the organization of PHC delivery in Brazil and Turkey can lead to measurable improvements in access to care. It compares (1) the degree of decentralization in PHC service delivery responsibilities, (2) the use of multi-professional PHC teams, and (3) patient impanelment strategies. The comparative analysis offers three important lessons. First, changes in the organization of PHC systems can contribute to observable improvements in the level and distribution of health outcomes, but organizational strategies do not guarantee eliminating disparities in access. Second, PHC systems can operate in health systems with varying degrees of decentralization, but the level of decentralization may influence implementation. Third, relying on multi-professional PHC teams that serve geographically empaneled populations can improve equitable access to care, but course corrections may be needed to address evolving health demands.","Özçelik, Ece A; Massuda, Adriano; Castro, Marcia C; Barış, Enis",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2021.1939931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402403/,667

133586,The Balance Between Surgical Resident Education and Patient Safety in Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery: Surgical Resident's Performance has No Negative Impact.,2017,"Background Evidence of the burden of suboptimal stroke care should expedite quality improvement. We aimed to estimate the health and economic impact of improving acute stroke management to best practice standards using Australia as a case study. Methods Hospital performance in Australia was estimated using data from the National Stroke Audit of Acute Services 2013. The percentage of patients provided evidence-based therapies in all hospitals was compared to that achieved in the aggregate of top performing benchmark hospitals (that included between them, a minimum contribution of 15% of all cases audited). The number of additional patients who would receive therapies if this performance gap was rectified was applied to a standardized economic simulation model that comprised stroke rates and resource-use estimates from the North East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study applied to the 2013 Australian population. Results In 2013, 41,398 patients were estimated to have been hospitalized with stroke. If acute care was improved to that of Australian benchmarks, there would be an additional 15,317 patients accessing stroke units; 1960 receiving thrombolysis; and 4007 being treated with antihypertensive medication, 3082 with antiplatelet medication, 2179 with anticoagulant medication, and 3514 with lipid-lowering therapy. Approximately 9329 disability-adjusted life years could be avoided. This additional care provided would be cost effective at AUD 3304 per disability adjusted life year avoided. Conclusion The benefits of reducing evidence-practice gaps in Australia are considerable. Further investment in initiatives to optimize hospital care is justified.","Kim, Joosup; Andrew, Nadine E; Thrift, Amanda G; Bernhardt, Julie; Lindley, Richard I; Cadilhac, Dominique A",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493017700662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28946831/,667
133692,Metabolic acuity score: effect on major complications after bariatric surgery.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Despite carrying a disproportionately high burden of depression, patients in low-income countries lack access to effective care. The collaborative care model (CoCM) has robust evidence for clinical effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. However, evidence from real-world implementation of CoCM is necessary to inform its expansion in low-resource settings. METHODS We conducted a 2-year mixed-methods study to assess the implementation and clinical impact of CoCM using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme protocols in a primary care clinic in rural Nepal. We used the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) implementation research framework to adapt and study the intervention. To assess implementation factors, we qualitatively studied the impact on providers' behaviour to screen, diagnose and treat mental illness. To assess clinical impact, we followed a cohort of 201 patients with moderate to severe depression and determined the proportion of patients who had a substantial clinical response (defined as ≥50% decrease from baseline scores of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to measure depression) by the end of the study period. RESULTS Providers experienced improved capability (enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge), greater opportunity (via access to counsellors, psychiatrist, medications and diagnostic tests) and increased motivation (developing positive attitudes towards people with mental illness and seeing patients improve) to provide mental healthcare. We observed substantial clinical response in 99 (49%; 95% CI: 42% to 56%) of the 201 cohort patients, with a median seven point (Q1:-9, Q3:-2) decrease in PHQ-9 scores (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION Using the COM-B framework, we successfully adapted and implemented CoCM in rural Nepal, and found that it enhanced providers' positive perceptions of and engagement in delivering mental healthcare. We observed clinical improvement of depression comparable to controlled trials in high-resource settings. We recommend using implementation research to adapt and evaluate CoCM in other resource-constrained settings to help expand access to high-quality mental healthcare.","Rimal, Pragya; Choudhury, Nandini; Agrawal, Pawan; Basnet, Madhur; Bohara, Bhavendra; Citrin, David; Dhungana, Santosh Kumar; Gauchan, Bikash; Gupta, Priyanka; Gupta, Tula Krishna; Halliday, Scott; Kadayat, Bharat; Mahar, Ramesh; Maru, Duncan; Nguyen, Viet; Poudel, Sanjaya; Raut, Anant; Rawal, Janaki; Sapkota, Sabitri; Schwarz, Dan; Schwarz, Ryan; Shrestha, Srijana; Swar, Sikhar; Thapa, Aradhana; Thapa, Poshan; White, Rebecca; Acharya, Bibhav",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400456/,667

The primary objectives were helping families to identify the location of graves of their loved ones who died from any cause at the time of the Ebola epidemic and creating a data source for epidemiological research. The Family Reunification Program fulfils the first SLED objective. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Family Reunification Program (Program) development, functioning and results. The MoHS, CDC, SLED Team, and Concern Worldwide developed, tested, and implemented methodology and tools to conduct the Program. Family liaisons were trained in protection of the personally identifiable information. The SLED Family Reunification Program allows families in Sierra Leone, who did not know the final resting place of their loved ones, to be reunited with their graves and to bring them relief and closure. Continuing family requests in search of the burial place of loved ones five years after the end of the epidemic shows that the emotional burden of losing a family member and not knowing the place of burial does not diminish with time. As of February 2021, the Program continues and is described to allow its replication for other emergency events including COVID-19 and new Ebola outbreaks.","Bensyl, Diana; Bangura, Brima; Cundy, Sarah; Gegbai, Francis; Gorina, Yelena; Harding, Jadnah D; Hersey, Sara; Jambai, Amara; Kamara, Ansumana S; Kargbo, Alieya; Kamara, Mohamed A M; Lansana, Patrick; Otieno, Dan; Redd, John T; Samba, Thomas T; Singh, Tushar; Vandi, Mohamed A",Annals of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058352/,667

However, there has been no study examining the role of interpersonal relationships in dysmenorrhea and how they may interact with negative emotions. Aims To investigate the connection between negative affect and dysmenorrhea, and the role of interpersonal relationships plays in this relationship. Methods The Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS), short-form of Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Interpersonal Comprehensive Diagnostic Scale and UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale were applied to 855 adolescent nursing students to collect information on severity and frequency of dysmenorrheal symptoms, negative emotions (including depression, anxiety and stress), interpersonal problems and subjective experience of loneliness among them, and the relationship among these variables was examined. Results (1) Both the severity and frequency of dysmenorrhea were positively correlated with negative emotions, loneliness experience and interpersonal problems, while negatively correlated with age at menarche. (2) The negative emotions, romantic relationship and menarche age, but not loneliness and interpersonal problems, significantly contributed to both the severity and frequency of dysmenorrhea. (3) Mediation analysis revealed that the effects of loneliness and interpersonal problems on dysmenorrhea were totally mediated by negative emotions. Conclusions This investigation indicates that the relationship between interpersonal relationships and dysmenorrhea is mediated by negative emotions.","Mou, Lingli; Lei, Wei; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Rong; Liu, Kezhi; Liang, Xuemei",General psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2018-100008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31179420/,667

METHODS We used administrative claims data to identify residents in a single Japanese prefecture who were enrolled in National Health Insurance and Elderly Health Insurance from April 2012 to March 2017 and experienced Achilles tendon rupture after receiving an antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics were categorized into 3 groups: first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones, third-generation fluoroquinolones, and nonfluoroquinolones. We used a conditional Poisson regression model to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of Achilles tendon rupture during the antibiotic exposure period relative to the nonexposure period for each patient. An exposure period was defined as 30 days from start of the prescription. RESULTS Analyses were based on 504 patients with Achilles tendon rupture who had received antibiotic prescriptions. Risk of rupture was not significantly elevated during exposure to third-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.33-3.37) and nonfluoroquinolones (IRR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.80-1.47). In contrast, risk was significantly elevated during exposure to first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones (IRR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.90-4.54). Findings were similar across subgroups stratified by sex and by recent corticosteroid use. CONCLUSIONS Our analysis showed that third-generation fluoroquinolone use was not associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture. These antibiotics may be a safer option for patients in whom this risk is elevated, such as athletes.","Chinen, Takashi; Sasabuchi, Yusuke; Matsui, Hiroki; Yasunaga, Hideo",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180840/,667
134630,Laparoscopic anterior hemifundoplication and hiatoplasty for the treatment of upside-down stomach: mid- and long-term results after 40 patients.,2011,"Purpose Currently, the biomechanical properties of the corneo-scleral limbus when the eye-globe deforms are largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in elasticity of the cornea, sclera, and limbus when subjected to different intraocular pressures (IOP) using wave-based optical coherence elastography (OCE). Special attention was given to the elasticity changes of the limbal region with respect to the elasticity variations in the neighboring corneal and scleral regions. Methods Continuous harmonic elastic waves (800 Hz) were mechanically induced in the sclera near the corneo-sclera limbus of in situ porcine eye-globes (n = 8). Wave propagation was imaged using a phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography system (PhS-OCT). The eyes were subjected to five different IOP-levels (10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg), and spatially distributed propagation velocities were calculated along corneal, limbal, and scleral regions. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the same regions under the same excitation conditions were conducted for further validation of results. Results FEA demonstrated that the stiffness of the heterogeneous cornea-limbus-sclera transition can be characterized by phase velocity measurements of the elastic waves produced at 800 Hz in the anterior eye. Experimental results revealed that the wave speed in the limbus (cL = 6.5 m/s) is between the cornea (cc = 2.9 m/s) and sclera (cs = 10.0 m/s) at a physiological IOP level (15 mm Hg) and rapidly increases as the IOP level is increased, even surpassing the wave speed in the sclera. Finally, the change in elastic wave speed in the limbus (ΔcL∼18.5 m/s) was greater than in the cornea (Δcc ∼12.6 m/s) and sclera (Δcs∼8.1 m/s) for the same change in IOP. Conclusions We demonstrated that wave-based OCE can be utilized to assess limbus biomechanical properties. Moreover, experimental evidence showed that the corneo-scleral limbus is highly nonlinear compared to the cornea and sclera when the eye-globe is deformed by an increase of IOP. This may suggest that the limbus has enough structural flexibility to stabilize anterior eye shape during IOP changes.","Zvietcovich, Fernando; Nair, Achuth; Singh, Manmohan; Aglyamov, Salavat R; Twa, Michael D; Larin, Kirill V",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.13.7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141893/,667

135179,Tissue apposition system: new technology to minimize surgery for endoscopically unresectable colonic polyps.,2010,"Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus remains a substantial threat to public health. To understand the molecular basis and host mechanism for the high virulence of H5N1 viruses in mammals, we compared two H5N1 isolates which have similar genetic backgrounds but greatly differ in their virulence in mice. A/Chicken/Jiangsu/k0402/2010 (CK10) is highly pathogenic, whereas A/Goose/Jiangsu/k0403/2010 (GS10) is nonpathogenic. We first showed that CK10 elicited a more potent innate immune response than did GS10 in mouse lungs by increasing the number and expression levels of activated genes. We then generated a series of reassortants between the two viruses and evaluated their virulence in mice. Inclusion of the CK10 PA gene in the GS10 background resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence. Conversely, expression of the GS10 PA gene in the CK10 background significantly attenuated the virulence. These results demonstrated that the PA gene mainly determines the pathogenicity discrepancy between CK10 and GS10 in mice. We further determined that arginine (R) at position 353 of the PA gene contributes to the high virulence of CK10 in mice. The reciprocal substitution at position 353 in PA or the exchange of the entire PA gene largely caused the transfer of viral phenotypes, including virus replication, polymerase activity, and manipulation of the innate response, between CK10 and GS10. We therefore defined a novel molecular marker associated with the high virulence of H5N1 influenza viruses, providing further insights into the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses in mammals.","Hu, Jiao; Hu, Zenglei; Song, Qingqing; Gu, Min; Liu, Xiaowen; Wang, Xiaoquan; Hu, Shunlin; Chen, Chaoyang; Liu, Huimou; Liu, Wenbo; Chen, Sujuan; Peng, Daxin; Liu, Xiufan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02891-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23255810/,667

Serological tests are used commonly to diagnose MHV infection. Complete MHV virions have been used primarily as antigens for serological diagnosis to date. To develop an antigen that is more specific, more sensitive, and easier to prepare for serological diagnosis, the antigenic sites in the MHV-nucleocapsid (N) protein were screened in this study. Sixteen antigenic linear sequences in the N protein were found using antisera obtained from mice infected naturally with MHV and a peptide array containing overlapping 10-mer peptides covering the entire N protein. From these antigenic sequences, two synthesized peptides, ILKKTTWADQTERGL and RFDSTLPGFETIMKVL, which were consistent with positions 24-38 and 357-372 of the N protein respectively, were used as antigens in ELISA. Evaluation of ELISA with these peptides revealed that both peptides were specific to anti-MHV antisera. Furthermore, ELISA performed using these peptides was more sensitive than commercial ELISA used for a screening sera from mice infected accidentally to MHV maintained in cages, suggesting that these peptides are useful for serological diagnosis of MHV infection.","Asano, Atsushi; Torigoe, Daisuke; Sasaki, Nobuya; Agui, Takashi",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810445/,667

It is important to understand the characteristics of the ongoing or pending interventional clinical trials on COVID-19. Methods We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs (CDs), biological therapies (BTs), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments and other therapies. Results Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints (PEs) definition and sample size of these trials. Although most trials use parallel-arm design (88.3%) and randomization (77.2%), blinding is applied in only 25 trials (14.6%). More than half of the trials planned to recruit ≤100 patients, indicating a possibility of insufficient statistical power. About one third of trials will recruit severe and critically ill patients. More trials on traditional Chinese medical treatment use 2 or more PEs than those on CDs or biological treatments (57.6%, 39.4% and 40.5%, respectively). Conclusions We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate PE and small sample size. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.","Zhao, Yang; Wei, Yongyue; Shen, Sipeng; Zhang, Mingzhi; Chen, Feng",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-2429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566569/,667

135406,LigaSure for pancreatic sealing during distal pancreatectomy.,2010,"The rapid development of the CRISPR-Cas9, -Cas12a and -Cas12b genome editing systems has greatly fuelled basic and translational plant research1-6. DNA targeting by these Cas nucleases is restricted by their preferred protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). The PAM requirement for the most popular Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is NGG (N = A, T, C, G)7, limiting its targeting scope to GC-rich regions. Here, we demonstrate genome editing at relaxed PAM sites in rice (a monocot) and the Dahurian larch (a coniferous tree), using an engineered SpRY Cas9 variant8. Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis can be readily achieved by SpRY at relaxed PAM sites in the Dahurian larch protoplasts and in rice transgenic lines through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, an SpRY-based cytosine base editor was developed and demonstrated by directed evolution of new herbicide resistant OsALS alleles in rice. Similarly, a highly active SpRY adenine base editor was developed based on ABE8e (ref. 9) and SpRY-ABE8e was able to target relaxed PAM sites in rice plants, achieving up to 79% editing efficiency with high product purity. Thus, the SpRY toolbox breaks a PAM restriction barrier in plant genome engineering by enabling DNA editing in a PAM-less fashion. Evidence was also provided for secondary off-target effects by de novo generated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) due to SpRY-mediated transfer DNA self-editing, which calls for more sophisticated programmes for designing highly specific sgRNAs when implementing the SpRY genome editing toolbox.","Ren, Qiurong; Sretenovic, Simon; Liu, Shishi; Tang, Xu; Huang, Lan; He, Yao; Liu, Li; Guo, Yachong; Zhong, Zhaohui; Liu, Guanqing; Cheng, Yanhao; Zheng, Xuelian; Pan, Changtian; Yin, Desuo; Zhang, Yingxiao; Li, Wanfeng; Qi, Liwang; Li, Chenghao; Qi, Yiping; Zhang, Yong",Nature plants,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41477-020-00827-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398158/,667

This study aimed to predict mature miRNA sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, their effects on protein-protein interactions in the affected cells, gene-drug relationships to detect possible drug candidates. METHODS Viral hairpin structure prediction and classification of the hairpins, mutational examination of precursor miRNA candidate sequences, Minimum Free Energy (MFE) and regional entropy analysis, mature miRNA sequences, target gene prediction, gene ontology enrichment and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis, gene-drug interactions were performed. RESULTS A total of 62 candidate hairpins were detected by VMir analysis. Three hairpin structures classified as true precursor miRNAs by miRBoost. Five different mutations were detected in precursor miRNA sequences in 100 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. Mutations slightly elevated MFE values and entropy in precursor miRNAs. Gene ontology terms associated with fibrotic pathways and immune system were found to be enriched in PANTHER, KEGG and Wiki pathway analysis. PPI analysis showed a network between 60 genes. CytoHubba analysis showed SMAD1 as a hub gene in the network. The targets of the predicted miRNAs, FAM214A, PPM1E, NUFIP2 and FAT4 were downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 cells. CONCLUSION miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome may contribute to the emergence of the Covid-19 clinic by activating pathways associated with the fibrosis in the cells infected by the virus and modulating the innate immune system. The hub protein between these pathways may be the SMAD1, which has an effective role in TGF signal transduction.","Çetin, Zafer; Bayrak, Tuncay; Oğul, Hasan; Saygılı, Eyüp İlker; Akkol, Esra Küpeli",Current drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567201818666210301102320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645482/,667
135962,The laparoscopic hiatoplasty with antireflux surgery is a safe and effective procedure to repair giant hiatal hernia.,2014,"Immune responses at the boundary between the host and the world beyond are complex and mucosal tissue homeostasis relies on them. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome suffered by children with hypertrophied tonsils. We have previously demonstrated that these tonsils present a defective regulatory B cell (Breg) compartment. Here, we extend those findings by uncovering the crucial role of resident pro-inflammatory B and T cells in sustaining tonsillar hypertrophy and hyperplasia by producing TNFα and IL17, respectively, in ex vivo cultures. Additionally, we detected prominent levels of expression of CD1d by tonsillar stratified as well as reticular epithelium, which have not previously been reported. Furthermore, we evidenced the hypertrophy of germinal centers (GC) and the general hyperplasia of B lymphocytes within the tissue and the lumen of the crypts. Of note, such B cells resulted mainly (IgG/IgM)+ cells, with some IgA+ cells located marginally in the follicles. Finally, by combining bacterial culture from the tonsillar core and subsequent identification of the respective isolates, we determined the most prevalent species within the cohort of OSA patients. Although the isolated species are considered normal oropharyngeal commensals in children, we confirmed their capacity to breach the epithelial barrier. Our work sheds light on the pathological mechanism underlying OSA, highlighting the relevance taken by the host immune system when defining infection versus colonization, and opening alternatives of treatment.","Sarmiento Varón, Lindybeth; De Rosa, Javier; Rodriguez, Raquel; Fernández, Pablo M; Billordo, L Ariel; Baz, Plácida; Beccaglia, Gladys; Spada, Nicolás; Mendoza, F Tatiana; Barberis, Claudia M; Vay, Carlos; Arabolaza, M Elena; Paoli, Bibiana; Arana, Eloísa I",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.648064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995367/,667

Methods A retrospective operative logbook review was completed in department of thoracic in a designated COVID-19 hospital. We reviewed and analyzed the operative logbook and discussed our countermeasures during the outbreak. A prediction model was established to discuss the time consuming about delayed surgeries during the pandemic. Results One thousand two hundred and seventy-five operation records were collected. The thoracic surgeries of this year has decreased (43.4%) during the Wuhan lockdown. From Jan 23rd to Apr 8th in 2020, there were 461 surgeries performed in The Department of Thoracic in our hospital with 0 cases of nosocomial COVID-19 infection. Prediction model showed that it will take 6 weeks to solve the backlog if department can reach the 85% of maximum of operations per week. Conclusions An understanding of operative case volume and distribution is essential in facilitating targeted interventions to strengthen surgical capacity in the time of COVID-19. A proper guideline is imperative to ensure access to safe, timely surgical care. By developing a scientific and effective management of hospital, it is possible to ensure optimal surgical safety during this crisis.

Intrathecal chemotherapy replaced cranial radiation due to radiation-induced neurotoxicity and late-effects. Survivors treated with chemotherapy-only experience neurologic and cognitive problems following cessation of treatment. Very long-term cognitive outcomes remain unclear. Animal models are being generated to assess late-effects of chemotherapy on cognitive function. Although, few address juvenile models of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) and developing brain, results of this review outline neurocognitive effects of chemotherapy consistent with childhood ALL therapy. Studies demonstrate deficits across cognitive domains including spatial memory, executive function, short-term memory, anxiety and depression. Inflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxity, and other metabolic disruptions may lead to neurodegeneration associated with cognitive impairment observed in ALL survivors. Interventions directly targeting these mechanisms may prevent and/or promote recovery of cognitive function and improve long-term outcomes. Evidence suggests success of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant treatments in reducing cognitive decline. Animal models provide basis for assessing effects of chemotherapy on neurologic processes to guide future clinical investigations.","Alexander, Tyler C; Krull, Kevin R",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.07.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352229/,667

Surgical training recommendations and guidelines in this field are lacking. To survey high volume hip preservation surgeons regarding their perspectives on the current and future training of surgeons entering their field, a cross-sectional survey of 16 high-volume hip preservation surgeons was conducted to gather perspectives and opinions on the most appropriate education of future hip preservation surgeons. All participants completed the survey in person and anonymously. Of the surveyed surgeons, the mean career hip preservation volume was 1031.25 cases (250 to >3000) with an average annual volume of 162.08 cases (75-400). The average number of hip arthroscopy cases necessary to competently perform joint access is 19, labral repair is 34, acetabuloplasty/femoroplasty are 54, labral reconstruction is 101 and capsular closure/plication is 53. Fifty-six percent of the surgeons believe mid-career surgeons who have never performed hip preservation surgery should not adopt it as part of their practice. The mean optimal number of cases recommended was 128 hip arthroscopies during a dedicated hip preservation fellowship and 67 hip arthroscopies during a sports medicine fellowship. Surgeons with an interest in hip preservation careers, should strongly consider a 12-month dedicated hip preservation fellowship that provides exposure to at least 128 cases, including open and arthroscopic techniques, hip arthroplasty, and research opportunities. Mid-career surgeons should be cautious about adopting hip preservation into their practice if they have not had prior adequate training.","Chen, Austin W; Steffes, Matthew J; Laseter, Joseph R; Maldonado, David R; Ortiz-Declet, Victor; Perets, Itay; Domb, Benjamin G",Journal of hip preservation surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/jhps/hny032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30393559/,667
137741,Analysis of conversion factors in robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery.,2014,"Background. As governments across the world implement tobacco-control measures, the tobacco industry responds by coming up with new products such as hookah, which are more appealing and affordable for young people-especially women-their primary target group. We assessed the prevalence and determinants of tobacco use among undergraduate women students of the University of Delhi with special emphasis on hookah use. Methods. Using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, we conducted a survey among the undergraduate women students of four colleges of the University of Delhi during March 2016. The tool was adapted from standard global surveys and had specific sections on tobacco use and patterns-use of shisha (hookah), smokeless tobacco as well as cessation and exposure to media and awareness about the harmful health effects of tobacco use. Point estimates along with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Multivariate logistic regression was done to identify the determinants of current tobacco use and hookah use. Results. Of the 780 respondents (mean [SD] age 19.3 [1.08] years), 22.9% (20.1-26.0) used tobacco in any form, with hookah being the most prevalent form (20.3%). One-third of the respondents believed that hookah smoking was less harmful than cigarette smoking. The major determinants of hookah use were-attending a private school (1.84; 1.11-3.01) or all-women college (2.79; 1.80-4.33); tobacco use by friends (2.47; 1.61-3.77); belief that smoking is a sign of women empowerment (2.09; 1.05-4.1 7) and the belief that hookah smoking is less harmful than cigarette smoking (2.81; 1.92-4.13). Conclusions. High prevalence of hookah use among young girls and women calls for a comprehensive approach including legislative options as well as increasing awareness about tobacco-cessation programmes among them.","Anand, Kritika; Kanishka,; Marwah, Smridhi",The National medical journal of India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0970-258x.295963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985441/,667
137855,Quality of life after bariatric surgery--a comparative study of laparoscopic banding vs. bypass.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Quality improvement (QI) is mandatory in trauma centres but there is no prescription for doing successful QI. Considerable variation in implementation strategies and inconsistent use of evidence-based protocols therefore exist across centres. The quality of reporting on these strategies may limit the transferability of successful initiatives across centres. This systematic review will assess the quality of reporting on guideline, protocol or algorithm implementation within a trauma centre in terms of the Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE 2.0). METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search for English language articles published after 2010 in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL electronic databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The database search will be supplemented by searching trial registries and grey literature online. Included studies will evaluate the effectiveness of guideline implementation in terms of change in clinical practice or improvement in patient outcomes. The primary outcome will be a global score reporting the proportion of studies respecting at least 80% of the SQUIRE 2.0 criteria and will be obtained based on the 18-items identified in the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines. Secondary outcome will be the risk of bias assessed with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies- of Interventions tool for observational cohort studies and with the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses will be conducted in randomised controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of guideline implementation if studies are not heterogeneous. If meta-analyses are conducted, we will combine studies according to the risk of bias (low, moderate or high/unclear) in subgroup analyses. All study titles, abstracts and full-text screening will be completed independently and in duplicate by the review team members. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment will also be done independently and in duplicate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Results will be disseminated through scientific publication and conferences.

137926,Reevaluation of needlescopic surgery.,2012,"Human astroviruses (HAstV) are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis in young children and immunocompromised patients. To understand the early steps of HAstV infection in the highly permissive Caco-2 cell line, the binding and entry processes of the virus were characterized. The half-time of virus binding to the cell surface was about 10 min, while virus decapsidation took around 130 min. Drugs affecting clathrin-mediated endocytosis, endosome acidification, and actin filament polymerization, as well as those that reduce the presence of cholesterol in the cell membrane, decreased the infectivity of the virus. The infection was also reduced by silencing the expression of the clathrin heavy chain (CHC) by RNA interference or by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of dynamin 2 and Eps15. Furthermore, the entry of HAstV apparently depends on the maturation of endosomes, since the infection was reduced by silencing the expression of Rab7, a small GTPase involved in the early- to late-endosome maturation. Altogether, our results suggest that HAstV enters Caco-2 cells using a clathrin-dependent pathway and reaches late endosomes to enter cells. Here, we have characterized the mechanism used by human astroviruses, important agents of gastroenteritis in children, to gain entry into their host cells. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic tools, we found that these viruses enter Caco-2 cells using a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, where they most likely need to travel to late endosomes to reach the cytoplasm and begin their replication cycle.","Méndez, Ernesto; Muñoz-Yañez, Claudia; Sánchez-San Martín, Claudia; Aguirre-Crespo, Gabriela; Baños-Lara, M del Rocio; Gutierrez, Michelle; Espinosa, Rafaela; Acevedo, Yunuén; Arias, Carlos F; López, Susana",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02908-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24335315/,667

138313,Laparoscopic versus single-incision cholecystectomy.,2011,"BACKGROUND The NHS Mental Health Implementation Plan aims to reduce length of inpatient psychiatric stays to a maximum of 32 days, yet provides little guidance on how to achieve this. Previous studies have attempted to analyse factors influencing length of stay in mental health units, focussing mostly on patient factors. These models fail to sufficiently explain the variation in duration of inpatient stay. We assess how the type of service delivered by a trust, in addition to patient factors, influences length of stay. METHODS We conducted a retrospective case cohort study in a large inner-city NHS mental health trust for all admissions in a 1 month period. Data was gathered from electronic notes of 105 patients. Descriptive univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on the data, with multiple regression analysis conducted on statistically significant data. RESULTS Short-stay assessment ward admission significantly reduced length of stay. Patients under outpatients or under care co-ordination, admitted through Mental Health Act assessment and formally detained all had longer length of stay. Out of area admissions, locum Consultant care, changing Responsible Clinician and ward transfers all led to longer length of stay. Factors indicating more severe illness such as increased observation level and polypharmacy, as well as diagnoses of psychosis or bipolar disorder were associated with longer duration of stay. Discharges requiring referral to accommodation or rehabilitation led to longer stays. The most significant factors that influenced length of stay were higher observation levels, diagnosis of psychotic illness or bipolar, and discharge to rehabilitation placement. The final model, taking into account all these factors, was able to account for 59.6% of the variability in length of stay. CONCLUSIONS The study backs up existing literature which shows patient-factors have an influence on length of stay. The study also demonstrates that service-level factors have an impact on the duration of stay. This data may be used to inform further studies which may aid provision of inpatient and community services in the future.","Crossley, Neil; Sweeney, Brian",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02846-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894103/,667

METHODS AND RESULTS This was a non-industry-funded, prospective academic study in all-referrals-tracked symptomatic and asymptomatic CS. In asymptomatic lesions, intervention was mandated only in case of increased stroke risk CS features. There was independent neurologist evaluation before CAS, at 48 hours and 30 days. There was external source data verification, angiographic core lab, and statistical analysis. Over 11 months, 108 referrals were recommended by the NeuroVascular Team for revascularisation: 101 (51-86 years, 55 symptomatic, evolving stroke in nine) underwent 106 (100% MN-EPS use) neuroprotection device-assisted (46% proximal, 54% distal) CAS; CEA was performed in seven. MN-EPS device success was 99.1%. Angiographic diameter stenosis was reduced from 83±9% to 6.7±5% (p<0.001). No MN-EPS foreshortening/elongation occurred (30 mm long was 29.82±0.68 mm; 40 mm long was 39.89±0.59 mm). The periprocedural death/major stroke/MI rate was 0%. One event, with no change in NIHSS or modified Rankin Scale and no clinical sequel, was adjudicated by the clinical events committee as minor stroke (0.9%). By 30 days there were no new events (0%). CONCLUSIONS These increased risk consecutive patient data (1) indicate safety and efficacy of routine MN-EPS use in achieving endovascular reconstruction across all-comer CS lesion subsets, and (2) are consistent with MN-EPS protection against cerebral events extending throughout the stent healing period.","Musialek, Piotr; Mazurek, Adam; Trystula, Mariusz; Borratynska, Anna; Lesniak-Sobelga, Agata; Urbanczyk, Malgorzata; Banys, R Pawel; Brzychczy, Andrzej; Zajdel, Wojciech; Partyka, Lukasz; Zmudka, Krzysztof; Podolec, Piotr",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4244/eijy16m05_02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27180302/,667

So far, four cataract-causing mutants G18V, D26G, S39C and V42 M have been identified for human γS-crystallin. Mysteriously, lens maintains ATP concentrations of 3-7 mM despite being a metabolically-quiescent organ. Here by DSF and NMR, we characterized the binding of ATP to three cataract-causing mutants of human γS-crystallin as well as its effect on the solution conformations and thermal stability. The results together decode several novel findings: 1) ATP shows no detectable binding to WT and mutants, as well as no significant alternation of their conformations even at molar ratio of 1:200.2) Cataract-causing mutants show distinctive patterns of the crowding-induced destabilization. 3) ATP differentially antagonizes their crowding-induced destabilization. Our studies suggest that the crowding-induced destabilization of human γS-crystallin is also critically dependent of the hydration shell which could be differentially altered by four mutations. Most unexpectedly, ATP acts as an effective mediator for the protein hydration shell to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization.","He, Yuan; Kang, Jian; Song, Jianxing",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004175/,667

138826,Novel Totally Laparoscopic Endolumenal Rectal Resection With Transanal Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction (NOSE) Without Rectal Stump Opening: A Modification of Our Recently Published Clean Surgical Technique in a Porcine Model.,2015,"INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) outbreak has disrupted residency programs due to the university and hospital's priorities to face this emergency at all expenses. Most research projects and clinical trials were temporarily stopped or postponed. The Resident and Research Fellow Section (RRFS) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) has decided to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurology training. METHODS All EAN RRFS members were invited to fill out an online questionnaire of 40 items concerning their clinical involvement during the COVID-19 emergency, and the impact of the pandemic on their training. RESULTS Of the 227 RRFS members who completed the questionnaire, 222 were from Europe, and from those 111 were from Portugal, Italy or France. Responders highlighted that severe restrictions have been amended to face this pandemic, including reduction of inpatient beds, prohibition of in-person visits and limitation to hospitals access for patients' relatives. This was accompanied by an increase in email correspondence and phone calls with 50 % of countries allowing telemedicine to reach outpatients. Seventy-nine percent of the respondents felt that the pandemic will likely have a serious impact on their training and career. CONCLUSION The pandemic lead to a disruption of neurology activities, including medical training and research. The long-run impact of these changes remains unknown, but it will likely change the way neurology practice and training will be organized for future generations.","Cuffaro, Luca; Carvalho, Vanessa; Di Liberto, Giovanni; Klinglehoefer, Lisa; Sauerbier, Anna; Garcia-Azorin, David; Tábuas-Pereira, Miguel; Vashchenko, Nina; Moro, Elena; Bassetti, Claudio L A",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368826/,667
138927,Prior treatment does not influence the performance or early outcome of per-oral endoscopic myotomy for achalasia.,2016,"Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are active ingredients of many disinfectants used against SARS-CoV-2 to control the transmission of the virus through human-contact surfaces. As a result, QAC consumption has increased more than twice during the pandemic. Consequently, the concentration of QACs in wastewater and receiving environments may increase. Due to their antimicrobial activity, high levels of QACs in wastewater may cause malfunctioning of biological treatment systems resulting in inadequate treatment of wastewater. In this study, a biocatalyst was produced by entrapping Pseudomonas sp. BIOMIG1 capable of degrading QACs in calcium alginate. Bioactive 3-mm alginate beads degraded benzalkonium chlorides (BACs), a group of QACs, with a rate of 0.47 µM-BACs/h in shake flasks. A bench-scale continuous up-flow reactor packed with BIOMIG1-beads was operated over one and a half months with either synthetic wastewater or secondary effluent containing 2-20 µM BACs at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) ranging between 0.6 and 4.7 h. Almost complete BAC removal was achieved from synthetic and real wastewater at and above 1.2 h EBCT without aeration and effluent recirculation. The microbial community in beads dominantly composed of BIOMIG1 with trace number of Achromobacter spp. after the operation of the reactor with the real wastewater, suggesting that BIOMIG1 over-competed native wastewater bacteria during the operation. This reactor system offers a low cost and robust treatment of QACs in wastewater. It can be integrated to conventional treatment systems for efficient removal of QACs from the wastewater, especially during the pandemic period.","Sakarya, Fahri Koray; Haznedaroglu, Berat Zeki; Tezel, Ulas",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102365/,667
138935,Single-incision laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a report of 33 cases in Saudi Arabia.,2016,"PURPOSE We aimed to recognize radiographic and clinical prognostic factors of scoliotic curve behaviour after bracing. METHODS Our prognostic study was based on the 25 years outcomes of a Boston braced AIS cohort between 1978 and 1993 that were previously reported. All patients were followed-up during bracing, at short term and 25 years post-bracing. We evaluated the impact of socio-demographic, clinical and radiological parameters on the loss of curve correction after bracing. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were reevaluated at 25 years post-brace. The mean scoliotic curve was significantly increased after bracing until the 25 years follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean loss of curve correction between the end of bracing and long-term follow-up was independent on the curve type, apical vertebra, premenarcheal status at bracing, time and duration of bracing, Cobb angle before or after bracing. The mean apical vertebral rotation after bracing was significantly related to the loss of curve correction (Spearman ρ = 0.2, p = 0.049). Apical vertebral rotation (Perdriolle method) greater than 20° post-bracing had a three times higher chance of progression > 5° compared with lesser apical vertebral rotation (OR 3.071, CI 0.99-9.51). The rotation of the apical vertebra, type and magnitude of the scoliotic curve after bracing explained 27.4% of the variance in the loss of curve correction post-bracing (R square = 0.274, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A scoliotic curve is expected to lose some correction after bracing. The apical vertebral rotation post-bracing mainly affected the long-term curve behaviour. Adolescents with apical vertebral rotation greater than 20° after bracing may need further attention.

With the spread of the novel coronavirus, the outpatient lines of hospitals have mostly shut down, which means that routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases patients have been disturbed. Due to the serious condition of autoimmune bullous diseases patients, they are prone to immune suppression and circulatory failure, and are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. These patients should thus be a priority group for novel coronavirus disease prevention. In this context, the protection and control measures for autoimmune bullous diseases patients against the novel coronavirus are of serious concern. Clinicians should strengthen their communication with patients, pay attention to changes in patients' conditions, and carefully adjust the treatment strategy, while protecting against the novel coronavirus infection, to ensure the continuity, safety, and effectiveness of autoimmune bullous diseases treatment.","Chen, Pan; Zhang, Guiying; Zhan, Yi",The Journal of dermatological treatment,https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1771261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420788/,667

We investigated changes in humor and sarcasm use during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants with varying anxiety and depression symptom severity, and in those with versus without psychiatric disorders. METHODS Online data was collected from N = 661 Canadian adults during the height of COVID-19-related restrictions. Depression and anxiety symptom severity were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. Participants were queried on current presence/absence of a psychiatric disorder, and on changes in humor and sarcasm use during compared to before the pandemic. RESULTS Participants with any vs. no depression symptoms reported more sarcasm and humor use during the pandemic. Respondents with mild and severe vs. no anxiety symptoms reported using more sarcasm. However, those with any vs. no anxiety symptoms used less humor during the pandemic. Finally, less humor use was noted in those without vs. with a psychiatric disorder. LIMITATIONS The use of self-report measures and a sample that may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS Adults with depression symptoms used more humor and sarcasm as a potential coping strategy during COVID-19. While individuals with anxiety symptoms used more sarcasm, this was not true of humor, suggesting their decreased reliance on levity during a crisis. Humor use was greater in those with psychiatric disorders, perhaps due to self-preservation mechanisms during times of distress. Our findings have implications for using humor in therapy in individuals with mental health struggles and mood disorders.","Rothermich, Kathrin; Ogunlana, Ayotola; Jaworska, Natalia",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102518/,667

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter retrospective study of 155 patients (60 years mean age, 57 % male) with NET liver metastases from pancreas (n = 71), gut (n = 68), lung (n = 8), or other/unknown (n = 8) primary sites treated with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE, n = 50), transarterial radioembolization (TARE, n = 64), or transarterial embolization (TAE, n = 41) between 2004 and 2015. Patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors were evaluated for prognostic effect on hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS) and overall survival (OS) using unadjusted and propensity score-weighted univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Median HPFS and OS were 18.5 and 125.1 months for G1 (n = 75), 12.2 and 33.9 months for G2 (n = 60), and 4.9 and 9.3 months for G3 tumors (n = 20), respectively (p < 0.05). Tumor burden >50 % hepatic volume demonstrated 5.5- and 26.8-month shorter median HPFS and OS, respectively, versus burden ≤50 % (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in HPFS or OS between gut or pancreas primaries. In multivariate HPFS analysis, there were no significant differences among embolotherapy modalities. In multivariate OS analysis, TARE had a higher hazard ratio than TACE (unadjusted Cox model: HR 2.1, p = 0.02; propensity score adjusted model: HR 1.8, p = 0.11), while TAE did not differ significantly from TACE. CONCLUSION Higher tumor grade and tumor burden prognosticated shorter HPFS and OS. TARE had a higher hazard ratio for OS than TACE. There were no significant differences in HPFS among embolotherapy modalities.","Chen, James X; Rose, Steven; White, Sarah B; El-Haddad, Ghassan; Fidelman, Nicholas; Yarmohammadi, Hooman; Hwang, Winifred; Sze, Daniel Y; Kothary, Nishita; Stashek, Kristen; Wileyto, E Paul; Salem, Riad; Metz, David C; Soulen, Michael C",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-016-1478-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27738818/,667

He reported a 10-day history of fever, photophobia, headache and fatigue. His medical history included hypothyroidism and migraine. He was a non-smoker, did not consume alcohol and denied a history of drug use. He was transferred to the emergency department. Laboratory investigations confirmed hyponatraemia (sodium 128 mmol/L). A chest radiograph confirmed no focal consolidation. Further investigation with a CT brain was unremarkable. A lumbar puncture was suggestive of viral meningitis, with a raised white cell count, lymphocytosis, high protein and low glucose. His PCR was negative for enterovirus and herpes simplex virus. Further investigation with a CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis demonstrated bilateral upper-lobe infiltrations. A bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for acid alcohol fast bacilli (AAFB). A diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis was rendered following a repeat lumbar puncture. Gram stain revealed AAFB and PCR was also positive. He started antitubercular treatment and corticosteroids. A repeat CT brain demonstrated ventriculomegaly, suggestive of hydrocephalus and an MRI head revealed likely communicating hydrocephalus with basilar enhancement. He was repatriated to the UK.

139751,Evaluation of laparoscopic-assisted ovariohysterectomy for treatment of canine pyometra.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak Hong Kong hospitals have suspended visiting periods and made mask wearing mandatory. In obstetrics, companionship during childbirth has been suspended and prenatal exercises, antenatal talks, hospital tours, and postnatal classes have been cancelled. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of these restrictive measures on delivery plans and risks of postpartum depression. METHODS We compared pregnancy data and the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of women who delivered between the pre-alert period (1 Jan 2019 to 4 Jan 2020) and post-alert period (5 Jan 2020 to 30 Apr 2020) in a tertiary university public hospital in Hong Kong. Screening for postpartum depression was performed routinely using the EPDS questionnaire 1 day and within 1 week after delivery. RESULTS There was a 13.1% reduction in the number of deliveries between 1 January and 30 April from 1144 in 2019 to 994 in 2020. The EPDS scores were available for 4357 out of 4531 deliveries (96.2%). A significantly higher proportion of women had EPDS scores of ≥10 1 day after delivery in the post-alert group than the pre-alert group (14.4% vs 11.9%; P<0.05). More women used pethidine (6.2% vs 4.6%) and fewer used a birthing ball (8.5% vs 12.4%) for pain relief during labour in the post-alert group. CONCLUSIONS Pregnant women reported more depressive symptoms in the postpartum period following the alert announcement regarding coronavirus infection in Hong Kong. This was coupled with a drop in the delivery rate at our public hospital. Suspension of childbirth companionship might have altered the methods of intrapartum pain relief and the overall pregnancy experience.","Hui, P W; Ma, G; Seto, M T Y; Cheung, K W",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154187/,667

140202,Impact of incision length on the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal surgery.,2009,"BACKGROUND Variants in the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene (MYBPC3) are a common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in adults and have been associated with late-onset disease, but there are limited data on their role in paediatric-onset HCM. The objective of this study was to describe natural history and clinical outcomes in a large cohort of children with HCM and pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) MYBPC3 variants. METHODS AND RESULTS Longitudinal data from 62 consecutive patients diagnosed with HCM under 18 years of age and carrying at least one P/LP MYBPC3 variant were collected from a single specialist referral centre. The primary patient outcome was a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Median age at diagnosis was 10 (IQR: 2-14) years, with 12 patients (19.4%) diagnosed in infancy. Forty-seven (75%) were boy and 31 (50%) were probands. Median length of follow-up was 3.1 (IQR: 1.6-6.9) years. Nine patients (14.5%) experienced an MACE during follow-up and five (8%) died. Twenty patients (32.3%) had evidence of ventricular arrhythmia, including 6 patients (9.7%) presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Five-year freedom from MACE for those with a single or two MYBPC3 variants was 95.2% (95% CI: 78.6% to 98.5%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 40.6% to 88.9%), respectively (HR 4.65, 95% CI: 1.16 to 18.66, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS MYBPC3 variants can cause childhood-onset disease, which is frequently associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Clinical outcomes in this cohort vary substantially from aetiologically and genetically mixed paediatric HCM cohorts described previously, highlighting the importance of identifying specific genetic subtypes for clinical management of childhood HCM.","Field, Ella; Norrish, Gabrielle; Acquaah, Vanessa; Dady, Kathleen; Cicerchia, Marcos Nicolas; Ochoa, Juan Pablo; Syrris, Petros; McLeod, Karen; McGowan, Ruth; Fell, Hannah; Lopes, Luis R; Cervi, Elena; Kaski, Juan Pablo Pablo",Journal of medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-107774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400558/,667

140555,Vessel sealing comparison: old school is still hip.,2016,"BACKGROUND Anthocyanins determinate the flower color of many plants. Tobacco is a model plant for studying the molecular regulation of flower coloration. We investigated the mechanism underlying flower coloration in tobacco by profiling flavonoid metabolites,expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic structural genes and their regulator genes in the pink-flowered tobacco cultivar Yunyan 87 and white-flowered Yunyan 87 mutant. RESULT Significant down-accumulation of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanin, cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside, pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside, cyanidin O-syringic acid, pelargonin, and pelargonidin 3-O-malonylhexoside (log2 fold change < - 10), endowed the flower color mutation in Yunyan 87 mutant. Transcriptome analysis showed that the coordinately down-regulated anthocyanin biosynthetic genes including chalcone isomerase, naringenin 3-dioxygenase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase played critical roles in suppressing the formation of the aforesaid anthocyanins. Several genes encoding MYB and bHLH transcription factors were also found down-regulated, and probably the reason for the suppression of structural genes. CONCLUSION This is the first study of tobacco flower coloration combining metabolome and transcriptome analyses, and the results shed a light on the systematic regulation mechanisms of flower coloration in tobacco. The obtained information will aid in developing strategies to modify flower color through genetic transformation.","Jiao, Fangchan; Zhao, Lu; Wu, Xingfu; Song, Zhongbang; Li, Yongping",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07028-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894038/,667

METHODS We recruited community rugby players over the age of 18 with at least 1-year of contact rugby participation to complete an online survey. Participants completed the Brief-Symptoms Inventory 18 (BSI-18), Short Form Health Survey 12 (SF-12), and Satisfaction with Life Survey (SWLS) via Qualtrics. We used generalized linear models to examine the association between AFE (continuous) and patient-reported outcomes by sex, while controlling for cumulative years contact/collision sport history, age, and concussion history (yes/no). Additionally, we used Mann-Whitney U tests to compare patient-reported outcomes between AFE <12 and AFE >12. RESULTS 1,037 rugby players [31.6 + 11.3 years (range: 18-74), 59.1% men] participated in this study. Whether analyzed continuously or dichotomously at age 12, younger AFE was not associated with worse patient-reported outcomes for either men or women. Positive concussion history was a significant predictor of worse BSI-18 sub-scores, SF-12 sub-scores, and SWLS in women and worse BSI-18 sub-scores in men. Cumulative contact/collision sport history was a significant predictor of better BSI-18 Depression and SF-12 (Mental Component Summary, MCS) sub-scores in men only. In men and women, older age was a significant predictor of better BSI-18 Depression, Anxiety, and GSI sub-scores, better SWLS (in men only), and better SF-12 MCS, but worse SF-12 (Physical Component Summary). CONCLUSION Younger AFE to contact/collision sport is not associated with worse patient-reported outcomes in early adult rugby players. Concussion history was predictive of worse patient-reported outcomes.","Hunzinger, Katherine J; Caccese, Jaclyn B; Costantini, Katelyn M; Swanik, C Buz; Buckley, Thomas A",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000002657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731652/,667

One obvious question that is now engaging the minds of many scientists and healthcare professionals is whether and eventually how laboratory medicine could efficiently contribute to counteract this and other (future) viral outbreaks. Despite there being evidence that laboratory tests are vital throughout many clinical pathways, there are at least three major areas where in vitro diagnostics can also provide essential contributions to diagnostic reasoning and managed care of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include etiological diagnosis, patient monitoring, as well as epidemiologic surveillance. Nonetheless, some structural and practical aspects may generate substantial hurdles in providing timely and efficient response to this infectious emergency, which basically include inadequate (insufficient) environment and shortage of technical and human resources for facing enhanced volume of tests on many infected patients, some of whom are with severe disease. Some proactive and reactive strategies may hence be identified to confront this serious healthcare challenge, which entail major investments on conventional laboratory resources, reinforcement of regional networks of clinical laboratories, installation of mobile laboratories, as well as being proactive in establishing laboratory emergency plans.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191623/,667

Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients. We show that these T-UCRs are predominantly nuclear and that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is at least partly responsible for the induction of several members of this group. One specific HINCUT, uc.475 (or HINCUT-1) is part of a retained intron of the host protein-coding gene, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is overexpressed in epithelial cancer types. Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation, HINCUT-1 supports cell proliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for optimal O-GlcNAcylation of proteins when oxygen tension is limiting. Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising protein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category.","Ferdin, J; Nishida, N; Wu, X; Nicoloso, M S; Shah, M Y; Devlin, C; Ling, H; Shimizu, M; Kumar, K; Cortez, M A; Ferracin, M; Bi, Y; Yang, D; Czerniak, B; Zhang, W; Schmittgen, T D; Voorhoeve, M P; Reginato, M J; Negrini, M; Davuluri, R V; Kunej, T; Ivan, M; Calin, G A",Cell death and differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2013.119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037088/,667

140954,The use of a fibrin glue with a low concentration of thrombin decreases seroma formation in postbariatric patients undergoing circular abdominoplasty.,2015,"BACKGROUND The mechanisms of endocrine resistance are complex, and deregulation of several oncogenic signalling pathways has been proposed. We aimed to investigate the role of the EGFR and Src-mediated STAT3 signalling pathway in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. METHODS The ER-positive luminal breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D, were used. We have established an MCF-7-derived tamoxifen-resistant cell line (TamR) by long-term culture of MCF-7 cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay, and protein expression levels were determined using western blot. Cell cycle and annexin V staining were analysed using flow cytometry. RESULTS TamR cells showed decreased expression of estrogen receptor and increased expression of EGFR. TamR cells showed an acceleration of the G1 to S phase transition. The protein expression levels of phosphorylated Src, EGFR (Y845), and STAT3 was increased in TamR cells, while phosphorylated Akt was decreased. The expression of p-STAT3 was enhanced according to exposure time of tamoxifen in T47D cells, suggesting that activation of STAT3 can cause tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Both dasatinib (Src inhibitor) and stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in TamR cells. However, stattic showed a much stronger effect than dasatinib. Knockdown of STAT3 expression by siRNA had no effect on sensitivity to tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells, while that enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in TamR cells. There was not a significant synergistic effect of dasatinib and stattic on cell survival. TamR cells have low nuclear p21(Cip1) expression compared to MCF-7 cells and inhibition of STAT3 increased the expression of nuclear p21(Cip1) in TamR cells. CONCLUSIONS The EGFR and Src-mediated STAT3 signalling pathway is activated in TamR cells, and inhibition of STAT3 may be a potential target in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer. An increase in nuclear p21(Cip1) may be a key step in STAT3 inhibitor-induced cell death in TamR cells.","Moon, Seo Yun; Lee, Heejin; Kim, Seoree; Hong, Ji Hyung; Chun, Sang Hoon; Lee, Hee Yeon; Kang, Keunsoo; Kim, Ho Shik; Won, Hye Sung; Ko, Yoon Ho",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-021-08641-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407787/,667

Although clinical evidence is still lacking, intranasal nebulization appears to be an interesting therapeutic option for local drug delivery, targeting anatomic sites beyond the nasal valve. The sonic nebulizer NL11SN associates a 100Hertz (Hz) sound to the aerosolization to improve deposition in the nasal/paranasal sinuses. The aim of the present study was: to evaluate in vivo the influence of associating a 100Hz sound on sinus ventilation and nasal and pulmonary aerosol deposition in normal volunteers, and; to quantify in vitro aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses in a plastinated head model. MATERIAL AND METHODS Scintigraphic analysis of (81m)Kr gas ventilation and of sonic aerosol ((99m)Tc-DTPA) deposition using the NL11SN was performed in vivo in seven healthy volunteers. In parallel, NL11SN gentamicin nebulization was performed, with or without associated 100Hz sound, in a plastinated human head model; the gross amount of gentamicin delivered to the paranasal sinuses was determined by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. RESULTS Associating the 100Hz sound to (81m)Kr gas ensured paranasal sinus ventilation in healthy volunteers. (99m)Tc-DTPA particles nebulized with the NL11SN were deposited predominantly in the nasal cavities (2/3, vs 1/3 in the lungs). In vitro, the use of NL11SN in sonic mode increased gentamicin deposition threefold in the plastinated model sinuses (P<0.002); the resulting antibiotic deposit would be sufficient to induce a local therapeutic effect. CONCLUSION The NL11SN nebulizer ensured preferential nasal cavity aerosol deposition and successfully targeted the maxillary sinuses.","Durand, M; Le Guellec, S; Pourchez, J; Dubois, F; Aubert, G; Chantrel, G; Vecellio, L; Hupin, C; De Gersem, R; Reychler, G; Pitance, L; Diot, P; Jamar, F","European annals of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2011.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921302/,667
141571,Transanal endoscopic microsurgery.,2013,"BACKGROUND The pancreatic transection method during distal pancreatectomy is thought to influence postoperative fistula rates. Yet, the optimal technique for minimizing fistula occurrence is still unclear. The present randomized controlled trial compared stapled versus ultrasonic transection in elective distal pancreatectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy from July 2018 to July 2020 at two high-volume institutions were considered for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were contiguous organ resection and a parenchymal thickness > 17 mm on intraoperative ultrasound. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to stapled transection (Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology®) or ultrasonic transection (Harmonic Focus® + or Harmonic Ace® + shears). The primary endpoint was postoperative pancreatic fistula. Secondary endpoints included overall complications, abdominal collections, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS Overall, 72 patients were randomized in the stapled transection arm and 73 patients in the ultrasonic transection arm. Postoperative pancreatic fistula occurred in 23 patients (16%), with a comparable incidence between groups (12% in stapled transection versus 19% in ultrasonic dissection arm, p = 0.191). Overall complications did not differ substantially (35% in stapled transection versus 44% in ultrasonic transection arm, p = 0.170). There was an increased incidence of abdominal collections in the ultrasonic dissection group (32% versus 14%, p = 0.009), yet the need for percutaneous drain did not differ between randomization arms (p = 0.169). The median length of stay was 8 days in both groups (p = 0.880). Intraoperative blood transfusion was the only factor independently associated with postoperative pancreatic fistula on logistic regression analysis (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.2-20.0, p = 0.032). CONCLUSION The present randomized controlled trial of stapled versus ultrasonic transection in elective distal pancreatectomy demonstrated no significant difference in postoperative pancreatic fistula rates and no substantial clinical impact on other secondary endpoints.","Landoni, Luca; De Pastena, Matteo; Fontana, Martina; Malleo, Giuseppe; Esposito, Alessandro; Casetti, Luca; Marchegiani, Giovanni; Tuveri, Massimiliano; Paiella, Salvatore; Pea, Antonio; Ramera, Marco; Borin, Alex; Giardino, Alessandro; Frigerio, Isabella; Girelli, Roberto; Bassi, Claudio; Butturini, Giovanni; Salvia, Roberto",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08724-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518950/,667
141853,Randomized clinical trial of single-incision versus multiport laparoscopic colectomy.,2016,"Introduction Cathelicidin is a vitamin D-regulated antimicrobial peptide involved in the innate immune response of the airways. Reduced plasma cathelicidin concentrations are independently associated with worse pulmonary outcomes in current and former smokers. This study aimed to determine whether oral vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficient current smokers increases plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cathelicidin levels. Methods Vitamin D deficient (25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) <20 ng/ml) smokers (n=17) underwent collection of plasma and BAL for cathelicidin and 25OHD measurements before and after eight weeks of oral supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly. Differences between baseline and eight-week levels of cathelicidin and 25OHD in blood and BAL were assessed along with correlations between serum 25OHD, plasma cathelicidin and BAL cathelicidin. Results At baseline, there was no correlation between BAL and plasma cathelicidin. There was a significant increase in 25OHD (median 17.0 to 43.3 ng/mL, p<0.001) after eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation. There was no change in plasma cathelicidin (p=0.86), BAL cathelicidin (p=0.31), or BAL 25OHD (p=0.89). There was no correlation between serum 25OHD and either BAL or plasma cathelicidin post-supplementation. Conclusion Oral vitamin D supplementation, while increasing serum 25OHD levels, does not increase plasma or BAL cathelicidin levels in vitamin D deficient active smokers. The lack of increased BAL cathelicidin may be explained by multiple factors related to dosing, smoking effects or putative mechanisms of engagement. Future studies are needed to determine the effects of vitamin D supplementation on lung and blood functional activity.","Sanders, Emily C; Burkes, Robert M; Mock, Jason R; Brown, Todd T; Wise, Robert A; Hansel, Nadia N; Liu, Mark C; Drummond, M Bradley",Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,https://doi.org/10.15326/jcopdf.2021.0220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044475/,667

142180,"ERAS program adherence-institutionalization, major morbidity and anastomotic leakage after elective colorectal surgery: the iCral2 multicenter prospective study.",2021-09-14,"PURPOSE To assess associations between imaging biomarkers from standard of care pre-treatment CT and FDG-PET scans and loco-regional (LR) and distant metastatic (DM) recurrences in patients with p16+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS An institutional database from a single NCI-designated cancer center identified 266 patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with definitive CRT in our department from 2005-2016 with evaluable pre-treatment FDG-PET scans. Quantitative SUV metrics and qualitative imaging metrics were determined from FDG-PET and CT scans, while clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. Associations between clinical/imaging features and time to LR (TTLRF) or DM (TTDMF) failure and overall survival (OS) were assessed using univariable Cox regression and penalized stepwise regression for multivariable analyses (MVA). RESULTS There were 27 LR and 32 DM recurrences as incident failures. Imaging biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF, with metabolic tumor volume being the only significant feature selected on MVA: C-index=0.68 (p=0.01). Radiographic extranodal extension (rENE), positive retropharyngeal nodes (RPN+), and clinical stage were significant on MVA for TTDMF: C-index=0.84 (p<0.001). rENE, group stage, and RPN+ were significant on MVA for OS: C-index=0.77 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS In the largest study to date of uniformly treated patients with CRT to evaluate both pretreatment CT and FDG-PET, radiographic biomarkers were significantly associated with TTLRF, TTDMF and OS among patients with p16+ OPSCC treated with CRT. CT metrics performed best to predict TTDMF, while FDG-PET metrics showed improved prediction for LRRFS. These metrics may help identify candidates for treatment intensification or de-escalation of therapy. STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE Pre-treatment imaging features from standard-of-care PET/CT imaging show promise for predicting long-term outcomes following HPV-associated oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) therapy. This study comprehensively characterizes qualitative and quantitative pre-treatment imaging metrics associated with time to pattern-specific failure in a cohort of 266 patients treated uniformly with definitive chemoradiation. Multivariate analysis (MVA) for time to loco-regional failure (TTLRF), time to distant metastatic failure (TTDMF), and overall survival (OS) was performed. FDG-PET metrics outperformed CT and clinical metrics for TTLRF. CT radiographic extranodal extension, positive retropharyngeal nodes, and stage strongly predicted TTDMF (combined C-index=0.84, log rank p<0.001). Number of smoking pack-years complemented clinical and imaging features only in patients without radiographic extranodal extension or positive retropharyngeal nodes. Time to pattern-specific failure is important for guiding treatment de-escalation strategies, which intend to reduce treatment-related toxicity in patients with relatively long expected survival times. This study suggests that PET/CT features should play a crucial role in future de-escalation trials and management of HPV-OPC patients.","Rosen, Benjamin S; Wilkie, Joel R; Sun, Yilun; Ibrahim, Mohannad; Casper, Keith A; Miller, Jessa E; Chotchutipan, Thong; Stucken, Chaz L; Bradford, Carol; E P Prince, Mark; Rosko, Andrew J; Malloy, Kelly M; McLean, Scott A; Chinn, Steven B; Shuman, Andrew G; Spector, Matthew E; Swiecicki, Paul L; Worden, Francis P; Shah, Jennifer; Schonewolf, Caitlin A; Chapman, Christina H; Eisbruch, Avraham; Mierzwa, Michelle L",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069764/,667

Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Jeong, Kyeong Yun; Lin, Kenneth W; Kraemer, John; Stoto, Michael A",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622845/,667

METHODS A total of 47 consecutive patients with renal masses suspicious for malignancy undergoing RPN were given 5-7.5 mg of ICG before hilar clamping or tumor excision. This cohort of patients was compared with 47 immediate previous consecutive patients who had undergone RPN without NIRF real-time imaging using ICG. The intraoperative, perioperative, and postoperative parameters were collected in an institutional review board-approved prospective database. RESULTS The preoperative demographics and tumor complexity according to the nephrometry or preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomic (PADUA) scores were similar. The mean warm ischemia time was significantly decreased in the ICG group (15 vs 17 minutes, P = .01). The median hospital stay was 2 days in both groups. No significant difference was seen in the positive margin rate (ICG, 6% vs control, 8.5%; P = .69) or observed Clavien grade III-IV complications in these 2 cohorts (ICG, 4% vs control, 15%; P = .07). No adverse events were associated with ICG dye administration. Differential ICG uptake was observed with selective clamping or in patients with cystic tumors, hypofluorescent tumors with exophytic components, and angiomyelolipomas, but these benefits could not be quantified. NIRF-ICG was transiently helpful to identify the vascular anatomy and not helpful at all for endophytic tumors. CONCLUSION RPN using NIRF-ICG can be performed safely and effectively. A decreased warm ischemia time in the ICG cohort was observed without specific measured advantages. Differential ICG uptake by different tumors did not lead to significant differences in the positive margin rate.","Krane, L Spencer; Manny, Theodore B; Hemal, Ashok K",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2012.01.076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22607949/,667

It has been reported that COVID-19 has an effect on thyroid function. However, the association between thyroid function and prognosis of COVID-19 is still unclear.Methods: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Patients without history of thyroid disease who had a thyroid function test at admission were enrolled in the final analysis. Risk factors of in-hospital death were explored using univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Survival differences were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test.Results: A total of 127 patients were included in this study, with 116 survivors and 11 non-survivors. The serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [0.8 (0.5-1.7) vs. 1.9 (1.0-3.1) μIU/mL, P = .031] and free triiodothyronine (FT3) [2.9 (2.8-3.1) vs. 4.2 (3.5-4.7) pmol/L, P < .001] were lower in non-survivors than in survivors, and a low FT3 state (defined as FT3 < 3.1 pmol/L) at admission accounted for a higher proportion in non-survivors than in survivors (72.7% vs. 11.2%, P < .001). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that FT3 level (HR 0.213, 95% CI: 0.101-0.451, P < .001) and the low FT3 state (HR 14.607, 95% CI: 3.873-55.081, P < .001) were negatively and positively associated with the risk of in-hospital death, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a low FT3 state was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death after adjusting for confounding factors (HR 13.288, 95% CI: 1.089-162.110, P = .043). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a lower survival probability in COVID-19 patients with a low FT3 status.Conclusion: Serum FT3 level is lower in non-survivors among moderate-to-critical patients with COVID-19, and the low FT3 state is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19.","Lang, Shan; Liu, Ye; Qu, Xue; Lu, Ran; Fu, Wei; Zhang, Wenhui; Wang, Haining; Hong, Tianpei",Endocrine research,https://doi.org/10.1080/07435800.2021.1924770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34014139/,667

In this study, we found that the myeloid cell surface peptidase CD13 is highly and specifically expressed on the subset of DCs responsible for cross-presentation, the CD8(+) murine splenic DCs. In vivo studies indicated that lack of CD13 significantly enhanced T cell responses to soluble OVA Ag, although development, maturation, and Ag processing and presentation of DCs are normal in CD13KO mice. In vitro studies showed that CD13 regulates receptor-mediated, dynamin-dependent endocytosis of Ags such as OVA and transferrin but not fluid-phase or phagocytic Ag uptake. CD13 and Ag are cointernalized in DCs, but CD13 did not coimmunoprecipitate with Ag receptors, suggesting that CD13 does not control internalization of specific receptors but regulates endocytosis at a more universal level. Mechanistically, we found that phosphorylation of the endocytic regulators p38MAPK and Akt was dysregulated in CD13KO DCs, and blocking of these kinases perturbed CD13-dependent endocytic uptake. Therefore, CD13 is a novel endocytic regulator that may be exploited to enhance Ag uptake and T cell activation to improve the efficacy of tumor-targeted vaccines.","Ghosh, Mallika; McAuliffe, Beata; Subramani, Jaganathan; Basu, Sreyashi; Shapiro, Linda H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1103490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22544935/,667

OBJECTIVES To assess whether patients with ILVOs who received IAT have smaller FIVs than patients who received either intravenous tissue plasminogen activator therapy (IVT) or no reperfusion therapy (NRT) and to determine a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) threshold score that identifies patients most likely to benefit from IAT. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study of patients with ILVOs between 2009 and 2011. SETTING Two large-volume stroke centers. PARTICIPANTS Adults with anterior circulation ILVOs who presented within 360 minutes from the time last seen as normal. Patients with isolated extracranial occlusions were not included. EXPOSURE Intra-arterial therapy, IVT, or NRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Final infarct volumes, rates of acceptable outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 3 at hospital discharge, and NIHSS threshold scores. RESULTS A total of 203 consecutive patients with ILVOs were evaluated. Baseline characteristics were similar among the 3 groups. The median infarct volume was significantly smaller for the IAT group (42 cm3) than for the IVT group (109 cm3; P = .001) or the NRT group (110 cm3; P < .01). A higher magnitude of infarct volume reduction in more proximal occlusions was noted in the IAT group compared with the IVT and NRT groups combined: internal carotid artery terminus (75 vs 190 cm3; P < .001), M1 middle cerebral artery (39 vs 109 cm3; P = .004), and M2 middle cerebral artery (33 vs 59 cm3; P = .04) occlusions.

For patients with an NIHSS score of 14 or higher at presentation, IAT significantly reduced FIV (46 cm3 with IAT vs 149 cm3 with IVT or NRT; P < .001) compared with patients with an NIHSS score of 8 to 13 (22 cm3 with IAT vs 44 cm3 with IVT or NRT; P = .40). Patients with an NIHSS score of 14 or higher who received IAT appear to benefit most from IAT. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our data suggest a greater reduction of FIV with IAT compared with either IVT or NRT. Moreover, patients with an NIHSS score of 14 or higher may be the best candidates for endovascular reperfusion therapy.","Rangaraju, Srikant; Owada, Kumiko; Noorian, Ali Reza; Nogueira, Raul G; Nahab, Fadi; Glenn, Brenda A; Belagaje, Samir R; Anderson, Aaron M; Frankel, Michael R; Gupta, Rishi",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23699864/,667

In this retrospective study, 106 swine were treated with either manual (n=53) or mechanical chest compressions with the LUCAS device (n=53). All swine cadavers underwent necropsy. The animals with no autopsy findings were significantly fewer in the LUCAS group (P=0.004). Sternal fractures were identified in 18 animals in the manual and only two in the LUCAS group (P=0.003). Rib fractures were present in 16 animals in the manual and only four in the LUCAS group (P=0.001). Nine animals in the manual, and two in the LUCAS group had liver hematomas (P=0.026%). In the manual group, eight animals were detected with spleen hematomas whereas no such injury was identified in the LUCAS group (P=0.003).

143363,Transanal minimally invasive surgery approach for rectal GIST.,2016,"CONTEXT The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Neonatal Life Support Task Force reviewed evidence for the duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for newborns immediately after birth. OBJECTIVE To summarize evidence for ongoing CPR on the outcomes of survival, neurodevelopment, and the composite of survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI). DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Scientific Electronic Library Online were searched between inception and February 29, 2020. STUDY SELECTION Two independent reviewers selected studies of newborns with at least 10 minutes of asystole, bradycardia, or pulseless electrical activity for which CPR is indicated. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted data and appraised the risk of bias. RESULTS In 16 eligible studies, researchers reported outcomes of 579 newborns born between 1982 and 2017. Within individual studies, 2% to 100% of infants survived to last follow-up (hospital discharge through 12 years). Summarized across studies, 237 of 579 (40.9%) newborns survived to last follow-up. In 13 studies, researchers reported neurodevelopmental outcomes of 277 newborns. Of these, 30 of 277 (10.8%) survived without moderate or severe impairment, and 240 of 277 (87%) met the composite outcome of death or NDI (191 died and 49 survived with moderate or severe impairment). LIMITATIONS There was very low certainty of evidence because of risk of bias and inconsistency. CONCLUSIONS Infants with ongoing CPR at 10 minutes after birth are at high risk for mortality and neurodisability, but survival without moderate or severe NDI is possible. One specified duration of CPR is unlikely to uniformly predict survival or survival without neuroimpairment.","Foglia, Elizabeth E; Weiner, Gary; de Almeida, Maria Fernanda B; Wyllie, Jonathan; Wyckoff, Myra H; Rabi, Yacov; Guinsburg, Ruth",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-1449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788267/,667
143374,Pure transvesical NOTES uterine horn resection in swine as an appendectomy model.,2012,"BACKGROUND Xeroform remains the current standard for treating superficial partial-thickness burns but can be prohibitively expensive in developing countries with prevalent burn injuries. This study (1) describes the production of an alternative low-cost dressing and (2) compares the alternative dressing and Xeroform using the metrics of cost-effectiveness, antimicrobial activity, and biocompatibility in vitro, and wound healing in vivo. METHODS To produce the alternative dressing, 3% bismuth tribromophenate powder was combined with petroleum jelly by hand and applied to Kerlix gauze. To assess cost-effectiveness, the unit costs of Xeroform and components of the alternative dressing were compared. To assess antimicrobial properties, the dressings were placed on agar plated with Escherichia coli and the Kirby-Bauer assay performed. To assess biocompatibility, the dressings were incubated with human dermal fibroblasts and cells stained with methylene blue. To assess in vivo wound healing, dressings were applied to excisional wounds on rats and the rate of re-epithelialization calculated. RESULTS The alternative dressing costs 34% of the least expensive brand of Xeroform. Antimicrobial assays showed that both dressings had similar bacteriostatic effects. Biocompatibility assays showed that there was no statistical difference (P < 0.05) in the cytotoxicity of Xeroform, alternative dressing, and Kerlix gauze. Finally, the in vivo healing model showed no statistical difference (P < 0.05) in mean re-epithelialization time between Xeroform (13.0 ± 1.6 days) and alternative dressing (13.5 ± 1.0 days). CONCLUSIONS Xeroform is biocompatible, reduces infection, and enhances healing of burn wounds by preventing desiccation and mechanical trauma. Handmade petrolatum gauze may be a low-cost replacement for Xeroform. Future studies will focus on clinical trials in burn units.","Chattopadhyay, Arhana; Chang, Kathleen; Nguyen, Khoa; Galvez, Michael G; Legrand, Anais; Davis, Christopher; McGoldrick, Rory; Long, Chao; Pham, Hung; Chang, James",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Yet up to 30% of primary care visits might be attributable to persistent illness without a diagnosed disease, including functional somatic syndromes like fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. When clinicians are unable to diagnose disease or correlate symptoms with measurable changes in biomarkers, patients experiencing such an illness are at increased risk for suspicion, misplaced questioning, or having their motives misinterpreted through damaging social and cultural narratives about gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or disability. Adhering strictly to a biomedical model of thinking about disease and diagnosis can prevent clinicians from empathically engaging with patients and helping them navigate their illness experiences.","Kroll, Camille",AMA journal of ethics,https://doi.org/10.1001/amajethics.2021.537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351263/,667

143696,Long-term quality of life and risk factors for recurrence after laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hernia.,2015,"BACKGROUND In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing symptomatic illness (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Travel-associated cases were reported in many other countries leading to epidemic transmission. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS We collected samples from two groups of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. In one group, 63 serum samples were analyzed IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 35 healthy serum samples were served as controls. In the other group, 91 plasma samples were analyzed by colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA) for IgG and IgM antibodies and 35 healthy plasma samples were served as controls. Throat swab samples for nucleic acids retest were collected from 81/91 of these participant. RESULTS The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and IgG detection was 55/63 (87.3%). Sensitivity of the com-bined GICA IgM and IgG detection was 75/91 (82.4%). Both methods were negative for healthy controls and had a specificity of 100%. In 81 cases, the follow up throat swab samples were retested by RT-PCR, showing that 42 cases were positive. The sensitivity was 51.9% (42/81). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for IgG (AUC(IgG)) was 0.934. The area under the ROC curve for IgM (AUC(IgM)) was 0.812. The area under the ROC curve for IgG + IgM (AUC(IgG+IgM)) was 0.983. CONCLUSIONS The serological test of SARS-CoV-2 can be used as an important supplement to the existing RT-PCR test for the specific and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19. AUC(IgG) > AUC(IgM) indicates that IgG has better classification performance than IgM. AUC(IgG + IgM) > AUC(IgG) indicates that the combination of IgG and IgM has better classification performance than IgG alone.","Huang, Shuang; Lin, Chenyao; Yan, Mingzhe; Li, Hongze; Liu, Ting; Michael, White; Xiang, Jie; Shen, Changxin",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180423/,667

Two breathing thermal manikins were employed to simulate a standing infected person and a standing exposed person. Four influential factors were examined, including separation distance between manikins, air change per hour, positioning of the two manikinsand air distribution. Tracer gas technique was used to simulate the exhaled droplet nuclei from the infected person and fast tracer gas concentration meters (FCM41) were used to monitor the concentrations. Real-time and average exposure indices were proposed to evaluate the dynamics of airborne exposure. The time-averaged exposure index depends on the duration of exposure time and can be considerably different during short-term events and under steady-state conditions. The exposure risk during short-term events may not always decrease with increasing separation distance. It changes over time and may not always increase with time. These findings imply that the control measures formulated on the basis of steady-state conditions are not necessarily appropriate for short-term events.","Ai, Zhengtao; Hashimoto, Kaho; Melikov, Arsen K",Indoor air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980555/,667
144286,[Single-site laparoscopy: a pure surgical exercise or a genuine « revolution »?].,2012,"PURPOSE The unprecedented crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed an enormous challenge ever for health-care organisations to find strategies to deal with their survival. The health-care employees are the frontline soldiers to fight against COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, there is a lack of research regarding the conceptualisation of COVID-19 and its impact on health-care employees' well-being and their organisational sustainability. Extending the role of responsible leadership (RL), the purpose of this paper is to develop a multi-level conceptual model to overcome the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic and promote employee (e.g. workers, nurses and professionals) well-being and organisational sustainability. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH With a comprehensive literature review, this paper presents five testable propositions and highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on employee well-being and organisational sustainability. FINDINGS The proposed model counsels that organisations need to go beyond the simple application of strategic climate and should enable RL to protect and maintain employee well-being and organisational sustainability. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS The proposed conceptual model is a step forward to not only explore future empirical research but also it will help the health-care policymakers to take responsible initiatives to increase employee well-being and uphold organisational sustainability. ORIGINALITY/VALUE There is a lack of research regarding the conceptualisation of the COVID 19 pandemic and its impact on health-care employees' well-being and organisational sustainability. The proposed conceptual model opens and guides a novel research avenue for the alignment of strategic management (as a moderator) and RL on the relationships among the COVID-19 pandemic, employee well-being and organisational sustainability.","Haque, Amlan",Leadership in health services,https://doi.org/10.1108/lhs-09-2020-0071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818971/,667
144408,Current status of robotic laparoendoscopic single-site partial nephrectomy.,2014,"BACKGROUND Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a rare inherited disease causing sudden cardiac death (SCD). Copy number variants (CNVs) can contribute to disease susceptibility, but their role in Brugada syndrome (BrS) is unknown. We aimed to identify a CNV associated with BrS and elucidated its clinical implications. METHODS We enrolled 335 unrelated BrS patients from 2000 to 2018 in the Taiwanese population. Microarray and exome sequencing were used for discovery phase whereas Sanger sequencing was used for the validation phase. HEK cells and zebrafish were used to characterize the function of the CNV variant. FINDINGS A copy number deletion of GSTM3 (chr1:109737011-109737301, hg38) containing the eighth exon and the transcription stop codon was observed in 23.9% of BrS patients versus 0.8% of 15,829 controls in Taiwan Biobank (P < 0.001), and 0% in gnomAD. Co-segregation analysis showed that the co-segregation rate was 20%. Patch clamp experiments showed that in an oxidative stress environment, GSTM3 down-regulation leads to a significant decrease of cardiac sodium channel current amplitude. Ventricular arrhythmia incidence was significantly greater in gstm3 knockout zebrafish at baseline and after flecainide, but was reduced after quinidine, consistent with clinical observations. BrS patients carrying the GSTM3 deletion had higher rates of sudden cardiac arrest and syncope compared to those without (OR: 3.18 (1.77-5.74), P<0.001; OR: 1.76 (1.02-3.05), P = 0.04, respectively). INTERPRETATION This GSTM3 deletion is frequently observed in BrS patients and is associated with reduced INa, pointing to this as a novel potential genetic modifier/risk predictor for the development of the electrocardiographic and arrhythmic manifestations of BrS.

The aim of this study was to investigate the chest CT features associated with critical and non-critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A total of 1078 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT scans, including 169 critical cases and 909 non-critical cases, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The scans of all participants were reviewed and compared in two groups of study. In addition, the risk factors associated with disease in critical and non-critical patients were analyzed. Results Chest CT scans showed bilateral and multifocal involvement in most (86.4%) of the participants, with 97.6 and 84.3% reported in critical and non-critical patients, respectively. The incidences of pure consolidation (p = 0.019), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation (p < 0.001), pleural effusion (p < 0.001), and intralesional traction bronchiectasis (p = 0.007) were significantly higher in critical compared to non-critical patients. However, non-critical patients showed higher incidence of pure GGOs than the critical patients (p < 0.001). Finally, the total opacity scores of the critical patients were significantly higher than those of non-critical patients (13.71 ± 6.26 versus 4.86 ± 3.52, p < 0.001), with an area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.94) for COVID-19 detection. Conclusions Our results revealed that the chest CT examination was an effective means of detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the natural course of COVID-19. It can distinguish the critical patients from the non-critical patients (AUC = 0.91), which is helpful for the judgment of clinical condition and has important clinical value for the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Jafari, Ramezan; Ashtari, Sara; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Maghsoudi, Houshyar; Cheraghalipoor, Fatemeh; Jafari, Nematollah Jonaidi; Saadat, Hassan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656732/,667

144670,Usefulness of intraopertive ultrasonography during directional atherectomy using SilverHawk/TurboHawk system.,2017,"BACKGROUND The widespread use of laparoscopy has resulted in a variety of instruments being used routinely for vascular control. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of bipolar vessel sealer (BVS) compared with clips and vascular stapler (CVS) in straight laparoscopic colorectal resection. METHODS Patients scheduled for elective colorectal resection, including benign and malignant diseases, were randomized to either BVS or CVS for vascular control. Patients whose operation was converted to an open approach before pedicle ligation were excluded. The primary endpoints were duration of operation, including time taken to control vascular pedicles, and cost of disposable instruments for vascular control. RESULTS Of 114 patients randomized to BVS (60 patients) or CVS (54), 14 did not receive the allocated vascular control device, leaving 55 and 45 respectively for analysis. The BVS reduced the time spent for vascular control by a mean of 6·9 min (P = 0·031) and reduced the cost of disposable instruments for vascular control by US $ 80·7 per patient (P = 0·043). For total colectomy, the BVS reduced the operating time by 103·6 min (P = 0·023) and the time taken for vascular control by 16·8 min (P = 0·022). For left colectomy, it decreased the time to vascular control by 9·3 min (P = 0·021). In multivariable analysis, the cost of disposable instruments for vascular control was independently reduced by randomization to BVS, type of procedure, female sex and estimated blood loss. The mean cost reduction was $ 88·2 for left colectomy (P = 0·037), $ 377·7 (P = 0·005) for total colectomy and $ 366·9 (P = 0·012) for proctectomy. Conversely, use of the BVS increased the cost of instruments used for vascular control in right colectomy by $ 92·6 (P = 0·012). CONCLUSION BVS devices are expedient and cost-efficient in proctectomy, left and total colectomy procedures.","Adamina, M; Champagne, B J; Hoffman, L; Ermlich, M B; Delaney, C P",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21997317/,667

144835,Nephrectomy via ventral median celiotomy in equids.,2013,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this field study was to explore the occurrence of and factors associated with the detection of swine influenza virus (SIV) by RTqPCR in weaner pigs and sows from herds with a history of respiratory or reproductive disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample set was based on nasal swabs from 823 sows (123 submissions) and 562 weaner pigs (80 submissions). Nasal swab samples were taken and submitted by 51 veterinary practices from all over Germany. Corresponding to the pig density most of the submissions originated from the north-western part of Germany. The nasal swabs were used to detect SIV RNA by real-time RT-PCR (RTqPCR). Subtyping of SIV RNA by conventional RT-PCR and sequencing was attempted directly from clinical samples or from isolates when available. The herd characteristics, management and housing conditions of the pig herd as well as the course of the disease were collected by a telephone questionnaire with the herd attending veterinarian. RESULTS SIV was detected by RTqPCR in 53.8% of the submissions from weaner pigs with a history of respiratory disease. Moreover SIV was detected in 10.6% of the submissions from sows. The predominant endemic subtype found in nasal swabs from sows and weaner pigs was H1N1 (60.5%) whereas subtypes H1N2 (14.0%) and H3N2 (14.0%) were detected less frequently. In addition, human pandemic H1N1 virus or reassortants thereof were found in 11.5%. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The results underline the significance of a SIV infection in young pigs. A significant lower detection of SIV in wea- ner pigs was associated with the vaccination of piglets against por- cine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), possibly indicating an interaction of SIV and PCV2. Most of the positive samples from sows originated from gilts, whereas only two originated from sows. An association between reproductive disorders and the detection of SIV could not be confirmed.","Meiners, C; Loesken, S; Doehring, S; Starick, E; Pesch, S; Maas, A; Noe, T; Beer, M; Harder, T; Grosse Beilage, E","Tierarztliche Praxis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate results of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) versus laparoscopic RYGB. SETTING The study was conducted at Centre Hospitalier Emil Mayrisch Clinic for specialized care (n = 618 beds) in Luxembourg (South). MATERIALS AND METHODS Of 620 procedures, 204 patients had LAGB and 416 LRYGB. Short-term (t(1), 6 months to 2 years), middle-term (t(2), 2 to 5 years), and long-term follow-up (t(3), >5 years) were performed, including weight loss evolution, Bariatric Analysis, and Reporting Outcome System (BAROS). RESULTS Percent EBWL mean values for LAGB vs. LRYGB were at t(1) 64.3 vs. 79.5, p = 0.01; at t(2) 49.4 vs. 91, p < 0.0001; and at t(3) 52.6 vs. 79.9, p < 0.0001. The BAROS mean values were at t(1) 3.81 vs. 4.00, p = 0.183; at t(2) 3.57 vs. 4.12, p < 0.001; and at t(3) 3.71 vs. 4.04, p = 0.02. Major complication rate (<30 days) was similar (p = 0.601). Long-term (>30 days) complications were more common after LAGB (14.3 versus 3.6%, p < 0.001). Fifty patients (25%) required a second and 36 patients (18%) a third operation (LRYGB).

145034,The use of indocyanine green fluorescence to assess anastomotic perfusion during robotic assisted laparoscopic rectal surgery.,2013,"PURPOSE To study the potential of integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) to identify aneurysm wall inflammation. METHODS The level of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was studied in aneurysmal and normal-sized aortas of 34 male patients [17 with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 17 age-matched controls] identified in a database of 278 consecutive patients evaluated for staging of primary lung cancer. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated to quantify FDG uptake in the AAA wall. RESULTS AAAs showed significantly higher FDG uptake than the normal-sized aorta in age-matched controls (SUV 2.52+/-0.52 versus 1.78+/-0.45, respectively; p<0.001). The level of FDG uptake did not correlate with maximal aneurysm diameter (r=0.09; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.56; p=0.7). CONCLUSION FDG-PET/CT is a promising technique to identify inflammation of the aneurysm wall. Irrespective of aneurysm diameter, asymptomatic AAAs show more FDG uptake and more inflammatory activity in the wall than the non-dilated abdominal aorta of sex/age-matched controls. Future studies will be directed at the predictive value of increased FDG uptake for aneurysm wall strength, rupture risk, and the utility of FDG-PET/CT in assessing the effect of medical interventions.","Truijers, Maarten; Kurvers, Harrie A J M; Bredie, Sebastian J H; Oyen, Wim J G; Blankensteijn, Jan D",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/08-2447.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18729562/,667

The phylogeny of this agent, and its potential for human infection, are unknown. METHODS We used existing metagenomic data from I. scapularis to determine the phylogeny of this tick-associated nematode and employed quantitative PCR to determine if the presence of this agent had an effect on the burden of Borrelia burgdorferi. We also developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System assay using the Av33 antigen as a target to investigate the presence of antibodies against this nematode in 128 serum specimens from patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis. To demonstrate assay utility, we used 15 sera from patients with onchocerciasis as controls. RESULTS We show that this agent is a new species in the genus Monanema and its presence in vector ticks does not impact the burden of B. burgdorferi. We did not detect IgG antibodies to this agent in 127 of 128 sera from patients with Lyme disease or babesiosis. One sample had reactivity above the threshold, but at the low-level equivalent to the least reactive onchocerciasis sera. This low positive signal could be a result of cross-reacting antibodies, antibodies from a previous infection with a filarial nematode, or, less likely, a exposure to the Ixodes scapularis-associated nematode. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence that this nematode contributes to the spectrum of human tick-borne infections.","Tokarz, Rafal; Tagliafierro, Teresa; Ian Lipkin, W; Marques, Adriana R",Parasites & vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04228-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709241/,667

We present the first human study on the effects of e-cigarette exposure in the oral cavity. By interrogating both immunoinflammatory responses and microbial functional dynamics, we discovered pathogen overrepresentation, higher virulence signatures, and a brisk proinflammatory signal in clinically healthy e-cigarette users, equivalent to patients with severe periodontitis. Using RNA sequencing and confocal and electron microscopy to validate these findings, we demonstrate that the carbon-rich glycol/glycerol vehicle is an important catalyst in transforming biofilm architecture within 24 hours of exposure. Last, a machine-learning classifier trained on the metagenomic signatures of e-cigarettes identified as e-cigarette users both those individuals who used e-cigarettes to quit smoking, and those who use both e-cigarettes and cigarettes.

145374,Thank you from the government.,2020-05-05,"INTRODUCTION To describe an unusual case of binasal congruous hemianopia secondary to functional visual loss (FVL). PATIENT CONCERNS A 24 year-old male was referred originally by his optician at the Emergency Eye Department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary in October 2018 with visual field changes affecting the nasal field of vision in both eyes on routine eye examination. The patient reported ongoing headaches over the last 6 weeks to 8 weeks associated with simultaneous peripheral visual field changes. He also reported rapid loss of weight over the same period of time. DIAGNOSIS Binasal congruous hemianopia secondary to FVL. INTERVENTIONS Full past medical and ocular history was obtained. The patient underwent full ophthalmic examination including dilated fundoscopy. Visual acuity was recorded with Snellen Chart. Color vision was assessed with Ishihara plates. Peripheral vision was assessed with both Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields. Optical coherence tomography of the macula and discs was also performed. Neuroimaging investigations included Computerized Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain. Electrophysiology investigations included Electroretinogram and visual evoked potentials. Patient was also tested for syphilis. OUTCOMES Humphrey visual fields and Goldmann visual fields confirmed the presence of complete binasal field defects. Optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, CT, MRI were all unremarkable. Ocular examination was normal. Finally, syphilis serology was negative. After 1 year of follow-up, the visual field changes have remained the same. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth case described in the literature with complete congruous binasal hemianopia due to FVL. We advocate thorough investigations with multimodal imaging of the fundus, neuroimaging and syphilis serology to exclude serious organic causes for binasal field defects prior to labeling such a field defect functional. Such patients may benefit from neuropsychological input to understand the psychological factors that may be contributing to the symptoms.","Tsokolas, Georgios; Khan, Hina; Tyradellis, Straton; George, Jithin; Lawden, Mark",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629652/,667

As a major transnational enterprise, illegal wildlife trade is valued between eight and 26.5 billion US dollars annually [3,4]. Because law enforcement is often only reactive, information on trafficking routes is key to disrupting trade and curtailing wildlife crime. In our efforts to uncover trade routes of trafficked sea turtle eggs, we developed and field-tested the InvestEGGator, a 3D-printed decoy turtle egg embedded with a GPS-GSM transmitter (Supplemental Information). Illegally collected clutches of turtle eggs containing a decoy transmitter enabled us to track the movements of traffickers, and thus gain a better understanding of illegal trade routes. The decoys, set to emit a signal once an hour, provided five tracks, the most detailed of which identified an entire trade chain, covering 137 km. Using data provided by the decoys, we identified trafficking routes and on two occasions properties of potential interest to law enforcement. Decoys also yielded anecdotal information, furthering our understanding of trafficking routes.","Pheasey, Helen; Roberts, David L; Rojas-Cañizales, Daniela; Mejías-Balsalobre, Carmen; Griffiths, Richard A; Williams-Guillen, Kim",Current biology : CB,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022233/,667

Our understanding of its pathophysiology and potential management was initially extrapolated from previous epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. SARS-CoV-2 is asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic in more than 80% of patients and requires no additional management; however, the remaining patients progress to pneumonia and hypoxemia with ranging severity, including a smaller group that requires intensive care unit admission. To date, there are no approved treatments for SARS-CoV-2, and current management is focused on supplemental oxygen and supportive care. The antiviral medication remdesivir recently received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe disease. Multiple clinical trials evaluating different treatment modalities such as antivirals, immunomodulators, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies, among others, are still ongoing. We believe that patients present with clinical phenotypes that correlate with the spectrum of disease. Each phenotype may benefit from one or multiple interventions.

Introduction: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a system that combined telehealth applications with local psychosocial support teams. Materials and Methods: A mobile application-based approach supported by the conventional local units was used. A three-step approach including contacting live operators followed by video calls from psychiatrists or child and adolescent psychiatrists and if necessary local unit support was used to provide support. Results: In addition to system records covering sociodemographic variables and initial complaints, a telephone survey, questioning the effectiveness and satisfaction of the system, was used as the main outcome. The number of individuals who asked for a psychiatrist appointment from operators after downloading the application was 1,076 (n = 879 [81.6%] support for self) (n = 197 [18.4%] support for child). Four hundred forty-nine (n = 449) HCWs (41.7%) replied video calls and received psychiatric help from psychiatrists on the time of appointment (n = 351 [78.1%] support for self) (n = 98 [21.8%] support for child). The overall satisfaction level of HCWs for the service they received was 8.1/10 (8.1/10 for support for self, 8.4/10 for support for the child. 86.6% (n = 389). Discussion: The findings of this study suggest that although telepsychiatry may be useful in public health emergencies such as COVID-19 pandemics should not be consisted of only telephone lines or video calls. Conclusions: Systems combining telehealth applications and local intervention teams may be more effective and establishing such organizations is possible in short intervals.","Dursun, Onur Burak; Turan, Bahadır; Pakyürek, Murat; Tekin, Ahmet",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821025/,667

We designed an adhesive, gas-tight, and self-healing supramolecular polysiloxane-dimethylglyoxime-based polyurethane (PDPU) porous elastomer based on segmented oxime-carbamate-urea. It is an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with trapped air within closed voids, exhibiting ultrahigh static surface potential and excellent compressibility. This porous PDPU generates electricity from interactions between the trapped air and the elastomeric matrix under periodical compression. The positively charged trapped air (or other gas) dominates the tribo-electrification with PDPU, inducing electron transfer from gas to the solid polymer for electricity generation. The self-healable elastomer renders gas-solid interacted triboelectric nanogenerator, GS-TENG, with high stretchability (~1200%). The inherently adhesive surface enables adherance to other substrates, allowing mechanical energy harvesting from deformations such as bending, twisting, and stretching. GS-TENG promises a freestanding wearable functional tactile skin for self-powered sensing of touch pressure, human motions, and Parkinsonian gait.","Xiong, Jiaqing; Thangavel, Gurunathan; Wang, Jiangxin; Zhou, Xinran; Lee, Pooi See",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb4246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832644/,667

Since its genome was sequenced, several molecular tools have been developed to study the mechanisms behind this outstanding and extraordinary ability. The complexity of its genome due to its sheer size and the disproportionate expansion of a large number of repetitive elements, may be a key factor during tissue remodeling and regeneration mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis has provided information to identify candidate genes networks and pathways that might define successful or failed tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, the epigenetic machinery that may participate in this phenomenon has largely not been studied. In this review, we outline a broad overview of both genetic and epigenetic molecular processes related to regeneration in axolotl, from the macroscopic to the molecular level. We also explore the epigenetic mechanisms behind regenerative pathways, and its potential importance in future regeneration research. Altogether, understanding the genomics and global regulation in axolotl will be key for elucidating the special biology of this organism and the fantastic phenomenon that is regeneration.","Sámano, Cynthia; González-Barrios, Rodrigo; Castro-Azpíroz, Mariana; Torres-García, Daniela; Ocampo Cervantes, José A; Otero-Negrete, Jimena; Soto-Reyes, Ernesto",The International journal of developmental biology,https://doi.org/10.1387/ijdb.200276cs; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629732/,667

A 23-year-old man who was diagnosed with FMF 10 years ago presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Colonoscopy showed terminal ileitis and aphthous colitis; however, these findings, including the histopathology, did not confirm Crohn's disease. Therefore, we diagnosed FMF with enterocolitis and administered anti-interleukin-1β monoclonal antibody (canakinumab). The patient's symptoms improved with treatment, but after 1 year, lower abdominal pain recurred. Colonoscopy revealed a stricture of the terminal ileum. Endoscopic balloon dilation relieved his symptoms. At present, he has been followed up without surgical treatment by endoscopic balloon dilation every 6 month.

A significant association is found between water and food insecurity. However, it remains unclear what are the pathways through which water shortage impacts food insecurity. Hence, a qualitative study was conducted in rural areas in Cameroon to (1) examine water access, its management, and its daily use and (2) investigate common behavior changes and coping strategies adults used in managing limited water availability in their households. Three rounds of focus group discussions and six key informant interviews were conducted with men and women. The results demonstrated that water access was limited, involving long walking distances and making several trips to the water sources. The household size, number of adults vs. children, and presence of storage containers affected water availability and its daily use. To manage limited water, coping behaviors included skipping drinking, changing cooking plans, and recycling water. In conclusion, limited water access increases food insecurity through several pathways.

Biological control is a prime strategy to reduce the harmful effects of pesticides on environment especially plants and arthropods. Collection of lacewings (Field Populations) was made during 2014 and repeated in 2016 from five different districts composed mainly by row and vegetable crops under conventional cropping system. For these populations, resistance level to four insecticides representing different mode of action was measured using topical treatment of 1st-instar larvae with prepared dilutions of commercial formulation. The highest resistance levels were found for chlorfenapyr (100.86- to 423.78-fold) and indoxacarb (131.28- to 255.05-fold) in populations from all districts, while buprofezin and nitenpyram resistance was low to high and moderate to high, respectively. The levels of resistance to nitenpyram increased from 2014 to 2016 for populations of 3 out of 4 surveyed areas, while the susceptibility to buprofezin remained unchanged. Decrease in resistance levels for chlorfenapyr and indoxacarb in 2 years was marginal. These results suggest that field populations of C. carnea maintained resistance to buprofezin, chlorfenapyr, indoxacarb, and nitenpyram.

METHODS Stage 1: delegates (n=72) at the October 2019 Defence Medical Services Rehabilitation Conference participated in a series of focus group workshops. Stage 2: an online survey circulated through the military chain of command to all Defence Primary Health Care clinical rehabilitation staff. Stage 3: a thematic analysis of all survey submissions yielding a ranked order of priority by topic. RESULTS 165 clinical rehabilitation staff completed an online survey. 'Rehabilitation outcomes', 'Psychological factors in rehabilitation' and 'Residential/Inpatient treatment paradigm' emerged as three clear research priorities across all three tiers of UK Defence Rehabilitation. New research priorities emerging from the 2020 survey were 'lifestyle factors during rehabilitation', 'management of pain during rehabilitation' and 'anterior knee pain'.

Self-determination was positively associated with PA maintenance [r (95% CI) = 0.189 (0.127, 0.249); k = 11]. This association was stronger and more homogeneous for samples described as having a physical health condition (r = 0.212; k = 6) and studies judged to be at risk of bias due to missing data (r = 0.223; k = 8). Few studies (< 5) investigated satisfaction with outcomes, enjoyment of behavior, and identity, which precludes any summary judgment for these three motives.

PURPOSE Nonadherence is a leading cause of death-censored allograft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Strong associations have tied tacrolimus intrapatient variability (IPV) to degree of nonadherence and high tacrolimus IPV to clinical endpoints such as rejection and allograft loss. Nonadherence is a dynamic, complex problem best targeted by multidimensional interventions, including mobile health (mHealth) technologies. METHODS This was a secondary planned analysis of a 12-month, parallel, 2-arm, semiblind, 1:1 randomized controlled trial involving 136 adult kidney transplant recipients. The primary aims of the TRANSAFE Rx study were to assess the efficacy of a pharmacist-led, mHealth-based intervention in improving medication safety and health outcomes for kidney transplant recipients as compared to usual care. RESULTS Patients were randomized equally to 68 patients per arm. The intervention arm demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in tacrolimus IPV over time as compared to the control arm (P = 0.0133). When analyzing a clinical goal of tacrolimus IPV of less than 30%, the 2 groups were comparable at baseline (P = 0.765), but significantly more patients in the intervention group met this criterion at month 12 (P = 0.033). In multivariable modeling, variables that independently impacted tacrolimus IPV included time, treatment effect, age, and warm ischemic time. CONCLUSION This secondary planned analysis of an mHealth-based, pharmacist-led intervention demonstrated an association between the active intervention in the trial and improved tacrolimus IPV. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the mutability of tacrolimus IPV and impact of reducing tacrolimus IPV on long-term clinical outcomes.","Fleming, James N; Gebregziabher, M; Posadas, A; Su, Z; McGillicuddy, J W; Taber, D J",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821958/,667

We report our experience of a case in which thrombectomy was undertaken for a patient with hemodynamics that were specific to the AMCA. Case Presentation An 84-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation developed paralysis of the left upper and lower extremities. Imaging examinations suggested tandem occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and the origin (M2 segment) of the right MCA. An extremely narrow MCA was visualized. Because there was concern regarding development of frontal lobe infarction, thrombectomy was carried out to restore anterograde blood flow, but an AMCA was found. Recanalization of the main MCA in the infarction zone resulted in hemorrhagic infarction, and the patient died of cerebral herniation. Conclusion When a vascular variation like AMCA is suspected, a careful evaluation of hemodynamics is necessary before undertaking endovascular intervention.","Deguchi, Ichiro; Osada, Takashi; Kimura, Hiroaki; Saito, Naoko; Arai, Eiichi; Kohyama, Shinya; Takao, Masaki",Acute medicine & surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988771/,667
149472,Hand-Assisted Laparoscopic Approach in Colon Surgery.,2015,"Over the past decades, survival rates for patients with resectable esophageal cancer have improved significantly. Consequently, the sequelae of having a gastric conduit, such as development of micronutrient deficiencies, become increasingly apparent. This study investigated postoperative micronutrient trends in the follow-up of patients following a minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) for cancer. Patients were included if they had at least one postoperative evaluation of iron, ferritin, vitamins B1, B6, B12, D, folate or methylmalonic acid. Data were available in 83 of 95 patients. Of these, 78.3% (65/83) had at least one and 37.3% (31/83) had more than one micronutrient deficiency at a median of 6.1 months (interquartile range (IQR) 5.4-7.5) of follow-up. Similar to the results found in previous studies, most common deficiencies identified were: iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In addition, folate deficiency and anemia were detected in a substantial amount of patients in this cohort. At 24.8 months (IQR 19.4-33.1) of follow-up, micronutrient deficiencies were still common, however, most deficiencies normalized following supplementation on indication. In conclusion, patients undergoing a MIE are at risk of developing micronutrient deficiencies as early as 6 up to 24 months after surgery and should therefore be routinely checked and supplemented when needed.","Janssen, Henricus J B; Fransen, Laura F C; Ponten, Jeroen E H; Nieuwenhuijzen, Grard A P; Luyer, Misha D P",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12030778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32183492/,667

T cell epitope mapping strategies increasingly rely on algorithms that predict the binding of peptides to MHC molecules. There is, however, little information on the reliability of predictive algorithms in the context of human populations, in particular, for those expressing HLA class I molecules for which there are limited experimental data available. In this study, we evaluate the ability of NetMHCpan to predict antiviral CD8(+) T cell epitopes that we identified with a traditional approach in patients of Asian ethnicity infected with Dengue virus, hepatitis B virus, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We experimentally demonstrate that the predictive power of algorithms defining peptide-MHC interaction directly correlates with the amount of training data on which the predictive algorithm has been constructed. These results highlight the limited applicability of the NetMHCpan algorithm for populations expressing HLA molecules for which there are little or no experimental binding data, such as those of Asian ethnicity.","Rivino, Laura; Tan, Anthony T; Chia, Adeline; Kumaran, Emmanuelle A P; Grotenbreg, Gijsbert M; MacAry, Paul A; Bertoletti, Antonio",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1301507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058176/,667

149755,Early complications after laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery: results from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry.,2014,"AIM The impact of postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesions, which represent a considerable burden for patients and health services, is often underestimated. Various factors influence adhesion formation, including the surgical approach. This study aimed to further understand the condition by investigating surgeons' perceptions of adhesion formation, particularly differences after laparoscopic and open surgery, and by performing a selective literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS South Asian surgeons attending endoscopy symposia in India and in Germany completed Likert-scale-based questionnaires on awareness of adhesion formation and associated consequences in gynecology. MEDLINE and PubMed were searched for articles published in 2000-2010 comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy in relation to adhesion formation. The results of the questionnaire study were then considered in view of findings from this review. RESULTS In total, 43.1% (97/225) of questionnaires were completed. Respondents considered that laparoscopy caused fewer adhesions than laparotomy for all gynecological procedures. Although they believed their knowledge of adhesion formation was satisfactory, they widely underestimated the risk, giving estimated rates of 12.5% after laparoscopy and 36.3% after laparotomy. Twenty-eight studies were identified in the review. Most concluded that laparoscopy was less likely to cause adhesions than laparotomy but further statistical analysis was precluded because so many different definitions and classifications of adhesions had been used. CONCLUSIONS The risk of adhesion formation was widely underestimated in the study group. Both the questionnaire study and the review concluded that laparoscopy results in less adhesion than laparotomy but further statistical comparison necessitates the development of standard definitions and classifications of adhesions.","Hackethal, Andreas; Sick, Claudia; Szalay, Gabor; Puntambekar, Shailesh; Joseph, Kurian; Langde, Swapnil; Oehmke, Frank; Tinneberg, Hans-Rudolf; Muenstedt, Karsten",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1447-0756.2011.01543.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599803/,667
149780,Predictive Factors for Insufficient Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery: Does Obstructive Sleep Apnea Influence Weight Loss?,2016,"INTRODUCTION Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name given to the 2019 novel coronavirus. COVID-19 is the name given to the disease associated with the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus not been previously identified in humans. METHODS Two key factors, case incidence and case morbidity were analysed for England. When taken together they give an estimate of relative demand on healthcare utilisation. To analyse case incidence, the latest values for indicators that could be associated with infection transmission rates were collected from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and Quality Outcome Framework (QOF) sources. These included population density, %age>16, at fulltime work/education, %age over 60, %BME ethnicity, social deprivation as IMD2019, location as latitude/longitude, and patient engagement as %self-confident in their own long-term condition management. Average case morbidity was calculated. To provide a comparative measure of overall healthcare resource impact, individual GP practice impact scores were compared against the median practice. RESULTS The case incidence regression is a dynamic situation but it currently shows that Urban, %Working and age>60 were the strongest determinants of case incidence. The local population comorbidity remains unchanged. The range of relative healthcare impact was wide with 80% of practices falling at 20%-250% of the national median. Once practice population numbers were included we found that the top 33% of GP practices supporting 45% of the patient population would require 68% of COVID-19 healthcare resources. The model provides useful information about the relative impact of Covid-19 on healthcare workload at GP practice granularity in all parts of England. CONCLUSION Covid-19 is impacting on the utilisation of health/social care resources across the world. This model provides a way of predicting relative local levels of disease burden based on defined criteria, thereby providing a method for targeting limited care resources to optimise national/regional/local responses to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Stedman, Mike; Lunt, Mark; Davies, Mark; Gibson, Martin; Heald, Adrian",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392377/,667

150038,Experimental Procedure of Compression Anastomosis Using Fragmented Rings: A Porcine Model.,2017,"BACKGROUND Anastomotic stenosis, leak, and hemorrhage are common stapler-related complications of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In May 2007, we transitioned from a 25-mm diameter, 4.8-mm-height circular stapler to a 25-mm, 3.5-mm-height circular stapler. We hypothesized that the staple height would be associated with a decreased incidence of perioperative complications. METHODS The records of 360 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from May 1, 2006 to March 31, 2008 were retrospectively abstracted. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project and Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative databases were used to collect the patient demographics and track complications of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Data were collected on the rates of anastomotic stenosis requiring dilation of the gastrojejunostomy, anastomotic leak, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and wound infection. Patients with a 4.8-mm staple height gastrojejunostomy were compared with those with a 3.5-mm staple height gastrojejunostomy for differences in complications. RESULTS The groups were similar with respect to age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, sleep apnea, and surgery duration. In the 4.8- and 3.5-mm staple height groups, 15% and 6.1% required gastrojejunal dilation, respectively (P = .01). A trend was seen toward a decrease in postoperative hemorrhage (5% versus 2.8%) with the shorter staple height. No anastomotic leaks occurred, and the incidence of wound infection (1.7% versus 2.2%) was similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION In the present study, the use of a 25-mm, 3.5-mm staple height circular stapler was associated with a decreased rate of anastomotic stenosis.","Hanna, Kenny; Seder, Christopher W; Chengelis, David; McCullough, Peter A; Krause, Kevin",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2011.01.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798822/,667
150055,Standardized postoperative pathway: accelerating recovery after ileostomy closure.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Unsafe abortion is the cause of a substantial number of maternal mortalities and morbidities globally, but specifically in low- and middle-income countries. Medical abortion methods provided by non-physicians may be a way to reduce the burden of unsafe abortions. Currently, only one systematic review comparing non-physicians with physicians for medical abortion exists. However, the review does not have any setting restrictions and newer evidence has since been published. Therefore, this review aims to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, and safety of first-trimester abortion managed by non-physicians compared to physicians in low- and middle-income countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Global Health Library, and EMBASE were searched by use of a structured search strategy. Further, the trial registries clinicaltrials.gov and The International Clinical Trial Registry Platform were searched for published and unpublished trials. Randomized controlled trials comparing provision of medical abortion by non-physicians to physicians in low- or middle-income countries were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Trials that reported effect estimates on the effectiveness of medical methods on complete abortion were included in the meta-analysis. The protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database, ID: CRD42020176811. RESULTS Six papers from four different randomized controlled trials with a total of 4021 participants were included. Two of the four included trials were assessed to have overall low risk of bias. Four papers had outcome data on complete abortion and were included in the meta-analyses. Medical management of first-trimester abortion and medical treatment of incomplete abortion were found to be equally effective when provided by a non-physician as when provided by a physician (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.99-1.01). Further, the treatment was equally safe, and women were equally satisfied when a non-physician provided the treatment compared to a physician. CONCLUSIONS Provision of medical abortion or medical treatment for incomplete abortion in the first trimester is equally effective, safe, and acceptable when provided by non-physicians compared to physicians in low- and middle-income countries. We recommend that the task of providing medical abortion and medical treatment for incomplete abortion in low- and middle-income countries is shared with non-physicians.","Kristiansen, Marianne Bogen; Shayo, Benjamin C; Philemon, Rune; Khan, Khalid Saeed; Rasch, Vibeke; Linde, Ditte Søndergaard",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33724458/,667

Nevertheless, the direct selective functionalization on the benzenoid core must overcome the high activity of the C-3 position and still remains highly challenging. Herein, a palladium-catalyzed direct and specific C-7 acylation of indolines in the presence of an easily removed directing group was developed. This strategy usually is considered as a practical strategy for the preparation of acylated indoles because indoline can be easily converted to indole under oxidation conditions. In particular, our strategy greatly improved the alkacylation yield of indolines for which only an unsatisfactory yield could be achieved in the previous studies. Furthermore, the reaction can be scaled up to gram level in the standard reaction conditions with a much lower palladium loading (1 mol %).","Xie, Guilin; Zhao, Yuhan; Cai, Changqun; Deng, Guo-Jun; Gong, Hang",Organic letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c03922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400544/,667
150271,Novel device and technique for minimally invasive intracerebral hematoma evacuation in the same setting of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm: combined treatment in the neurointerventional angiography suite.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Impairments in sudomotor function during passive whole-body heating have been reported in multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the CNS that disrupts autonomic function. However, the capability of the thermoregulatory system to control body temperature during exercise has never been assessed in MS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that thermoregulatory function is impaired in MS patients compared with healthy controls (CON) exercising at similar rates of metabolic heat production. METHODS Sweating and skin blood flow responses were compared between 12 individuals diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (9 females, 3 males) and 12 sex-, age-, mass-, and BSA-matched CON during a single bout of cycling exercise (rate of metabolic heat production: ∼4.5 W·kg) for 60 min in a climate-controlled room (25°C, 30% RH). RESULTS Individuals with MS exhibited an attenuated increase in cumulative whole-body sweat loss after 30 min (MS, 72 ± 51 g; CON, 104 ± 37 g; P = 0.04) and 60 min (MS, 209 ± 94 g; CON, 285 ± 62 g; P = 0.02), as well as lower sweating thermosensitivity (MS, 0.49 ± 0.26 mg·cm·min·°C; CON, 0.86 ± 0.30 mg·cm·min·°C; P = 0.049). Despite evidence for thermoregulatory dysfunction, there were no differences between MS and CON in esophageal or rectal temperatures at 30- or 60-min time points (P > 0.05). Cutaneous vasculature responses were also not different in MS compared with CON (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Taken together, MS blunts sweating responses during exercise while cutaneous vasculature responses are preserved. Altered mechanisms of body temperature regulation in persons with MS may lead to temporary worsening of disease symptoms and limit exercise tolerance under more thermally challenging conditions.","Allen, Dustin R; Huang, M U; Morris, Nathan B; Chaseling, Georgia K; Frohman, Elliot M; Jay, Ollie; Davis, Scott L",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000001821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30779715/,667

150574,Laparoscopic transvesical removal of erosive mesh after transobturator tape procedure.,2011,"BACKGROUND Readily available testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary to mitigate COVID-19 disease outbreaks. At-home collection kits, in which samples are self-collected without requiring a laboratory or clinic visit and sent to an external laboratory for testing, can provide convenient testing to those with barriers to access. They can prevent unnecessary exposure between patient and clinical staff, increase access for patients with disabilities or remote workers, and decrease burdens on healthcare resources such as provider time and personal protective equipment. Exact Sciences developed an at-home collection kit for samples to be tested to detect SARS-CoV-2 that includes an Instructions for Use (IFU) document, which guides people without prior experience on collecting a nasal swab sample. Demonstrating successful sample collection and usability is critical to ensure that these samples meet the same high-quality sample collection standards as samples collected in clinics. OBJECTIVE To determine the usability of a SARS-CoV-2 at-home nasal swab sample collection kit. METHODS A human factors usability study was conducted with 30 subjects without prior medical, laboratory, or healthcare training and without COVID-19 sample self-collection experience. Subjects were observed while they followed the IFU for the at-home sample collection portion of the SARS-CoV-2 test in a setting that simulated a home environment. IFU usability was further evaluated by requiring the subjects to complete a survey, answer comprehension questions, provide written feedback, and respond to questions from the observer about problems during use. RESULTS All 30 subjects successfully completed the sample collection process, and all 30 samples were determined by RT-PCR testing to meet quality standards for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The subjects' written feedback and comments revealed several recommendations to improve the IFU. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated the overall usability of an at-home SARS-CoV-2 collection kit. Various feedback mechanisms provided opportunities to improve the wording and graphics for some critical tasks, including placing the label correctly on the tube. A modified IFU was prepared based on study outcomes.

150582,Simplified synchronous disconnection of pulmonary arteries and veins for right upper lobectomy.,2019,"Group testing, also known as pooled sample testing, was first proposed by Robert Dorfman in 1943. While sample pooling has been widely practiced in blood-banking, it is traditionally seen as anathema for clinical laboratories. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has re-ignited interest for group testing among clinical laboratories to mitigate supply shortages. We propose five criteria to assess the suitability of an analyte for pooled sample testing in general and outline a practical approach that a clinical laboratory may use to implement pooled testing for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The five criteria we propose are: (1) the analyte concentrations in the diseased persons should be at least one order of magnitude (10 times) higher than in healthy persons; (2) sample dilution should not overly reduce clinical sensitivity; (3) the current prevalence must be sufficiently low for the number of samples pooled for the specific protocol; (4) there is no requirement for a fast turnaround time; and (5) there is an imperative need for resource rationing to maximise public health outcomes. The five key steps we suggest for a successful implementation are: (1) determination of when pooling takes place (pre-pre analytical, pre-analytical, analytical); (2) validation of the pooling protocol; (3) ensuring an adequate infrastructure and archival system; (4) configuration of the laboratory information system; and (5) staff training. While pool testing is not a panacea to overcome reagent shortage, it may allow broader access to testing but at the cost of reduction in sensitivity and increased turnaround time.","Tan, Jun G; Omar, Aznan; Lee, Wendy By; Wong, Moh S",The Clinical biochemist.

Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Collin, Daniel F; Shields-Zeeman, Laura S; Batra, Akansha; White, Justin S; Tong, Michelle; Hamad, Rita",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740636/,667
150803,Transperitoneal versus retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy for large pheochromocytoma: Comparative outcomes.,2019,"BACKGROUND Microwave ablation has emerged as a promising treatment for liver malignancies, but there are scant long-term follow-up data. This study evaluated long-term outcomes, with a comparison of 915-MHz and 2.4-GHz ablation systems. METHODS This was a retrospective review of patients with malignant liver tumours undergoing operative microwave ablation with or without liver resection between 2008 and 2013. Regional or systemic (neo)adjuvant therapy was given selectively. Local recurrence was analysed using competing-risk methods with clustering, and overall survival was determined from Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS A total of 176 patients with 416 tumours were analysed. Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) comprised 81.0 per cent of tumours, hepatocellular carcinoma 8.4 per cent, primary biliary cancer 1.7 per cent and non-CRLM 8.9 per cent. Median follow-up was 20.5 months. Local recurrence developed after treatment of 33 tumours (7.9 per cent) in 31 patients (17.6 per cent). Recurrence rates increased with tumour size, and were 1.0, 9.3 and 33 per cent for lesions smaller than 1 cm, 1-3 cm and larger than 3 cm respectively. On univariable analysis, the local recurrence rate was higher after ablation of larger tumours (hazard ratio (HR) 2.05 per cm; P < 0.001), in those with a perivascular (HR 3.71; P = 0.001) or subcapsular (HR 2.71; P = 0.008) location, or biliary or non-CRLM histology (HR 2.47; P = 0.036), and with use of the 2.4-GHz ablation system (HR 3.79; P = 0.001). Tumour size (P < 0.001) and perivascular position (P = 0.045) remained significant independent predictors on multivariable analysis. Regional chemotherapy was associated with decreased local recurrence (HR 0.49; P = 0.049). Overall survival at 4 years was 58.3 per cent for CRLM and 79.4 per cent for other pathology (P = 0.360). CONCLUSION Microwave ablation of liver malignancies, either combined or not combined with liver resection, and selective regional and systemic therapy resulted in good long-term survival. Local recurrence rates were low after treatment of tumours smaller than 3 cm in diameter, and those remote from vessels.","Leung, U; Kuk, D; D'Angelica, M I; Kingham, T P; Allen, P J; DeMatteo, R P; Jarnagin, W R; Fong, Y",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296639/,667
150847,A laparoendoscopic single-site surgery approach to mesh sacrohysteropexy.,2013,"The mechanisms responsible for radioresistance in pancreatic cancer have yet to be elucidated and the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment must be considered. We investigated if the radiotherapy-augmented Warburg effect helped myeloid cells acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype, resulting in limited treatment efficacy of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Radiotherapy enhanced the tumor-promoting activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pancreatic cancer. Sustained increase in lactate secretion, resulting from the radiation-augmented Warburg effect, was responsible for the enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSCs after radiotherapy. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was essential for tumor cell metabolism and lactate-regulated activation of MDSCs via the G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81)/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/HIF-1α/STAT3 pathway. Blocking lactate production in tumor cells or deleting Hif-1α in MDSCs reverted antitumor T cell responses and effectively inhibited tumor progression after radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer. Our investigation highlighted the importance of radiation-induced lactate in regulating the inhibitory immune microenvironment of PDAC. Targeting lactate derived from tumor cells and the HIF-1α signaling in MDSCs may hold distinct promise for clinical therapies to alleviate radioresistance in PDAC.","Yang, Xuguang; Lu, Yun; Hang, Junjie; Zhang, Junfeng; Zhang, Tiening; Huo, Yanmiao; Liu, Jun; Lai, Songtao; Luo, Dawei; Wang, Liwei; Hua, Rong; Lin, Yuli",Cancer immunology research,https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.cir-20-0111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917658/,667
150896,Safety and feasibility of the robotic platform in the management of surgical sequelae of chronic pancreatitis.,2018,"BACKGROUND The treatment of concomitant gallbladder (GB) and common bile duct (CBD) stones is still variable, without a standard treatment protocol. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy is widely being used, but laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) is also being widely performed. We present our method of LCBDE, with anterograde insertion of an endobiliary stent and primary closure of the CBD using unidirectional barbed suture. METHODS From November 2013 to March 2015, LCBDE was performed on 15 consecutive patients. Chart review was performed to analyze demographic data and perioperative data. After dissection of the GB from the liver bed, the CBD is dissected and a choledochotomy is made. A choledochoscope is inserted in the CBD, and using various methods, CBD stones are extracted. An endobiliary stent is inserted, and the CBD is closed using unidirectional barbed sutures. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 64.7 ± 12.5 years. Of the 15 patients, six patients (40 %) were male and nine patients (60 %) were female. The average operation time and postoperative stay were 90.7 ± 32.5 min and 4.3 ± 1.2 days, respectively. There were no significant complications such as postoperative bleeding, bile leakage, or biliary stricture. CONCLUSIONS LCBDE using barbed V-Loc suture with insertion of endobiliary stent is a safe, feasible treatment modality that is easily reproducible. Our preliminary results show a zero complication rate, with an acceptable operation time.","Lee, Jun Suh; Yoon, Young Chul",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4518-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26310532/,667

151001,Totally robotic rectal resection: an experience of the first 100 consecutive cases.,2016,"Historically, treatment of patients with cancer using chemotherapeutic agents has been associated with debilitating and systemic toxicities, poor bioavailability, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics. Nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, on the other hand, can specifically target cancer cells while avoiding their healthy neighbors, avoid rapid clearance from the body, and be administered without toxic solvents. They hold immense potential in addressing all of these issues, which has hampered further development of chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, such drug delivery systems will lead to cancer therapeutic modalities that are not only less toxic to the patient but also significantly more efficacious. In addition to established therapeutic modes of action, nanomaterials are opening up entirely new modalities of cancer therapy, such as photodynamic and hyperthermia treatments. Furthermore, nanoparticle carriers are also capable of addressing several drug delivery problems that could not be effectively solved in the past and include overcoming formulation issues, multidrug-resistance phenomenon, and penetrating cellular barriers that may limit device accessibility to intended targets, such as the blood-brain barrier. The challenges in optimizing design of nanoparticles tailored to specific tumor indications still remain; however, it is clear that nanoscale devices carry a significant promise toward new ways of diagnosing and treating cancer. This review focuses on future prospects of using nanotechnology in cancer applications and discusses practices and methodologies used in the development and translation of nanotechnology-based therapeutics.","Zamboni, William C; Torchilin, Vladimir; Patri, Anil K; Hrkach, Jeff; Stern, Stephen; Lee, Robert; Nel, Andre; Panaro, Nicholas J; Grodzinski, Piotr",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-11-2938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22669131/,667
151205,Systematic review on reoperative bariatric surgery: American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Revision Task Force.,2014,"OBJECTIVES In the present study, our objective was to determine if hypercarbia would alter cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and reduce the ability of cerebrovascular reactivity monitoring to identify the lower limit of cerebrovascular autoregulation (LLA). METHODS Anaesthetised juvenile pigs were assigned between two groups: normocarbia (control group, n = 10) or hypercarbia [high carbon dioxide (CO2) group, n = 8]. Normocarbia subjects were maintained with an arterial CO2 of 40 Torr, while the hypercarbia subjects had an increase of inspired CO2 to achieve an arterial pCO2 of >80 Torr. Gradual hypotension was induced by continuous haemorrhage from a catheter in the femoral vein, and the LLA was determined by monitoring cortical laser Doppler flux (LDF). Vascular reactivity monitoring was performed using the pressure reactivity index (PRx) and haemoglobin volume index (HVx). RESULTS There were no sustained differences in ICP between groups. Autoregulation was present in both groups, despite elevation in pCO2.The control group had an average LLA of 45 mmHg (95% CI: 43-47 mmHg) and the high CO2 group had a LLA of 75 mmHg (95% CI: 73-77 mmHg). The detected LLA for each subject correlated with the level of pCO2 (spearman R = 0.8243, P < 0.0001). Both the PRx and HVx accurately detected the LLA despite the presence of hypercarbia. DISCUSSION Hypercarbia without acidosis increases the observed LLA independent of alterations in ICP. Elevations in CO2 can impair cerebrovascular autoregulation, but if there is a sufficient increase in blood pressure above the CO2 altered LLA, then autoregulation persists.","Nusbaum, Derek M; Brady, Kenneth M; Kibler, Kathleen K; Blaine Easley, Ronald",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1179/1743132815y.0000000094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311295/,667

Despite decades of targeted research on prediction in adults, methodological limitations still exist for investigating prediction in infancy. In this article, we argue that pupillometry, or the measurement of pupil size, is an effective method to examine predictive processing in infants and will expand on existing methods (namely looking time and anticipatory eye movements). In particular, we argue that there are three specific features of pupillometry that make it particularly useful for augmenting the investigation of prediction in infancy. First, pupillometry has excellent temporal resolution that will facilitate the differentiation of prediction subcomponents. Second, pupillometry is highly continuous across the life span, allowing researchers to directly compare responses between infants and adults using an identical paradigm. Third, pupillometry can be used in conjunction with other behavioral measures, allowing for different yet complementary results. In addition, we review relevant adult and infant pupillometry studies that will facilitate infancy researchers to adopt this technique. Overall, pupillometry is particularly useful in investigating prediction in infancy and opens up several avenues for developmental research.","Zhang, Felicia; Emberson, Lauren L",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735079/,667

The aim of this study was to compare the central and peripheral targeted modalities of administration. METHODS Lung and regional deposition of inhaled technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic was measured by scintigraphy after peripheral and central targeted modalities of administration with an Akita device in 6 healthy subjects. RESULTS Drug targeting nebulization delivered a large amount of drug into the peripheral part of the lung independent of the modality (outer-to-inner deposition ratio of 1.24 ± 0.21 vs. 1.22 ± 0.14 for central and peripheral modalities, respectively), but there was no difference in lung deposition (whole-body deposition, 83.3 ± 6.5% vs. 82.8 ± 7.3%, P = .86) or regional deposition (P = .77) between both modalities. The extrathoracic deposition was < 20% of the whole-body deposition, without a difference between modalities (P = .86). CONCLUSIONS This study shows for the first time that choosing 2 different specific drug targeting nebulization modes does not influence the amount of drug delivered into the lung in healthy male subjects. Moreover, the modes do not modify the site of deposition under the conditions of our study.","Reychler, Gregory; Aubriot, Anne-Sophie; Depoortere, Virginie; Jamar, François; Liistro, Giuseppe",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161302/,667

Little is known about real-world clinical decision-making related to hospice for members of this population. METHODS We used a text search tool to conduct a thematic analysis of documentation pertaining to hospice in the electronic medical record system of the Department of Veterans Affairs, for a national sample of 1000 patients with advanced kidney disease between 2004 and 2014 who were followed until October 8, 2019. RESULTS Three dominant themes emerged from our qualitative analysis of the electronic medical records of 340 cohort members with notes containing hospice mentions: (1) hospice and usual care as antithetical care models: clinicians appeared to perceive a sharp demarcation between services that could be provided under hospice versus usual care and were often uncertain about hospice eligibility criteria. This could shape decision-making about hospice and dialysis and made it hard to individualize care; (2) hospice as a last resort: patients often were referred to hospice late in the course of illness and did not so much choose hospice as accept these services after all treatment options had been exhausted; and (3) care complexity: patients' complex care needs at the time of hospice referral could complicate transitions to hospice, stretch the limits of home hospice, and promote continued reliance on the acute care system.

There is uncertainty regarding medical versus surgical therapy and different surgical techniques. This review assessed outcomes of antireflux surgery versus medical management of GERD in adults and children, robotic versus laparoscopic fundoplication, complete versus partial fundoplication, and minimal versus maximal dissection in pediatric patients. METHODS PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched (2004-2019) to identify randomized control and non-randomized comparative studies. Two independent reviewers screened for eligibility. Random effects meta-analysis was performed on comparative data. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS From 1473 records, 105 studies were included. Most had high or uncertain risk of bias. Analysis demonstrated that anti-reflux surgery was associated with superior short-term quality of life compared to PPI (Std mean difference = - 0.51, 95%CI - 0.63, - 0.40, I2 = 0%) however short-term symptom control was not significantly superior (RR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.47, 1.21, I2 = 82%). A proportion of patients undergoing operative treatment continue PPI treatment (28%). Robotic and laparoscopic fundoplication outcomes were similar. Compared to total fundoplication, partial fundoplication was associated with higher rates of prolonged PPI usage (RR = 2.06, 95%CI 1.08, 3.94, I2 = 45%). There was no statistically significant difference for long-term symptom control (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.85, 1.04, I2 = 53%) or long-term dysphagia (RR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.52, 1.02, I2 = 0%). Ien, minimal dissection during fundoplication was associated with lower reoperation rates than maximal dissection (RR = 0.21, 95%CI 0.06, 0.67). CONCLUSIONS The available evidence regarding the optimal treatment of GERD often suffers from high risk of bias. Additional high-quality randomized control trials may further inform surgical decision making in the treatment of GERD.","McKinley, Sophia K; Dirks, Rebecca C; Walsh, Danielle; Hollands, Celeste; Arthur, Lauren E; Rodriguez, Noe; Jhang, Joyce; Abou-Setta, Ahmed; Pryor, Aurora; Stefanidis, Dimitrios; Slater, Bethany J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08358-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651167/,667

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. A total of 33 (53.2%) of 62 cases with CVD, who had higher prevalence of severe COVID-19 compared with non-CVD patients (P=0.027). The median age of all patients was 66.0 (53.3, 73.0) years old. Coronary artery disease (11.3%) and hypertension (38.7%) were the common coexisting CVDs in COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), creatinine, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, and D-dimer levels in the severe COVID-19 with CVD group were higher than in the non-severe COVID-19 with CVD group (P<0.05).

Consequently, globally maternal-newborn dyad care and outcomes are highly variable, leading to approximately 800 maternal deaths daily with a 100-fold difference among high- and low-resource days. Irrespective of where care is received, maternal safety and wellbeing should be preserved. Despite ongoing efforts, however, this is not the case. Large gaps exist between spending and clinical outcomes. Segmented health care, coupled with poor planning and inadequate resource distribution, results in failure to provide essential life-saving treatment. The proposed solution is a regional integrated care model from midwife to advanced level III/IV care and the newborn unit, achieved through effective coordination by site, staff, and clinicians. This model has been successfully implemented in high- to low-resource countries in the past 20 years. In the large diverse population of the United States, constructive steps have been implemented to reduce high maternal mortality in black and rural communities. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates the feasibility of rapid resources coordination to provide effective advanced care.

METHODS Four hundred eleven participants (Mage = 68.95, S.D. = 5.60) completed questionnaires at two time points - before the pandemic and during the lockdown period. Cross-lagged analysis was carried out on two structural equation models - social isolation and anxiety symptoms, and QoL and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS Baseline social isolation was associated with more anxiety symptoms at follow-up. However, baseline anxiety symptoms were not associated with social isolation subsequently. For QoL and anxiety symptoms, the relationship was bidirectional. CONCLUSION Older adults who were previously socially isolated and had a lower QoL are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown.","Siew, Savannah Kiah Hui; Mahendran, Rathi; Yu, Junhong",The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2021.03.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992523/,667

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess work stress and associated factors among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and to evaluate whether prior experience of treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a positive or negative influence on healthcare workers' stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING Cross-sectional survey in a tertiary hospital in Kaohsiung City, in southern Taiwan. METHODS The survey was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire to measure the stress levels among healthcare workers from March 20 to April 20, 2020. The stress scales were divided into four subscales: worry of social isolation; discomfort caused by the protective equipment; difficulties and anxiety regarding infection control; and workload of caring for patients. RESULTS The total stress scores were significantly higher among healthcare workers who were aged 41 or above, female, married, parents and nurses. Those with experience of treating SARS reported having significantly higher stress scores on the subscale measuring the discomfort caused by protective equipment and the workload of caring for patients. During the COVID-19 outbreak, frontline healthcare workers with experience of treating SARS indicated having higher stress levels regarding the workload of caring for patients than did non-frontline healthcare workers with no experience of treating SARS.

Besides causing damage to blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor and killing the tumor by a direct cytotoxic effect, PDT has also been known to trigger an anti-tumor immune response. For instance, our previous study showed that PDT with BAM-SiPc, a silicon(IV) phthalocyanine based-photosensitizer, can not only eradicate the mouse CT26 tumor cells in a Balb/c mouse model, but also protect the mice against further re-challenge of the tumor cells through an immunomodulatory mechanism. To understand more about the immune effect, the biochemical actions of BAM-SiPc-PDT on CT26 cells were studied in the in vitro system. It was confirmed that the PDT treatment could induce immunogenic necroptosis in the tumor cells. Upon treatment, different damage-associated molecular patterns were exposed onto the cell surface or released from the cells. Among them, calreticulin was found to translocate to the cell membrane through a pathway similar to that in chemotherapy. The activation of immune response was also demonstrated by an increase in the expression of different chemokines.","Zhang, Ying; Cheung, Ying-Kit; Ng, Dennis K P; Fong, Wing-Ping","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-020-02700-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839829/,667

We have conducted a brief review of the geographic differences in the prevalence of COVID-19, the updated pathological findings, prognostic factors, and treatments for disease prevention and improvement of prognosis. Although hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have been recommended by some researchers, many clinical trials have failed to confirm any beneficial effect of these and other drugs on COVID-19, in terms of improved clinical status or reduced patient mortality. Currently, glucocorticoid is the only drug that reduces the mortality of COVID-19 in a randomized controlled trial; however, it is still necessary to establish the optimal timing of administration. It is also urgent to set up an international or national cohort to address the risk factors associated with infection, the natural history of COVID-19, including the disease type, surrogate markers for critically ill, long-term sequelae, and reinfection after exposure, identify responders to glucocorticoid, and establish optimal treatment strategies for disease control.

155456,Equine disease surveillance: quarterly summary.,2017,"Complex regulation of the immune response is necessary to support effective defense of an organism against hostile invaders and to maintain tolerance to harmless microorganisms and autoantigens. Recent studies revealed previously unappreciated roles of CD71+ erythroid cells (CECs) in regulation of the immune response. CECs physiologically reside in the bone marrow where erythropoiesis takes place. Under stress conditions, CECs are enriched in some organs outside of the bone marrow as a result of extramedullary erythropoiesis. However, the role of CECs goes well beyond the production of erythrocytes. In neonates, increased numbers of CECs contribute to their vulnerability to infectious diseases. On the other side, neonatal CECs suppress activation of immune cells in response to abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms after delivery. CECs are also enriched in the peripheral blood of pregnant women as well as in the placenta and are responsible for the regulation of feto-maternal tolerance. In patients with cancer, anemia leads to increased frequency of CECs in the peripheral blood contributing to diminished antiviral and antibacterial immunity, as well as to accelerated cancer progression. Moreover, recent studies revealed the role of CECs in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. CECs use a full arsenal of mechanisms to regulate immune response. These cells suppress proinflammatory responses of myeloid cells and T-cell proliferation by the depletion of ʟ-arginine by arginase. Moreover, CECs produce reactive oxygen species to decrease T-cell proliferation. CECs also secrete cytokines, including transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which promotes T-cell differentiation into regulatory T-cells. Here, we comprehensively describe the role of CECs in orchestrating immune response and indicate some therapeutic approaches that might be used to regulate their effector functions in the treatment of human conditions.","Grzywa, Tomasz M; Nowis, Dominika; Golab, Jakub",Pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.107927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171326/,667

The role of intraventricular antibiotics in treatment is controversial. We present five such cases which were refractory to conventional intravenous antibiotic therapy, had persistent features of ventriculitis and in whom raised intracranial pressure (ICP) necessitated insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD). Three of the five infants required intraventricular antibiotics but also developed EVD-related complications. Early diagnosis of ventriculitis and treatment is necessary to avoid a fatal outcome. Intravenous antibiotics are the treatment of choice, but intraventricular therapy may be considered in refractory cases. As the incidence of EVD-associated ventriculitis is high, proper care of EVDs and their early removal is mandatory.","Bhat, Ramitha R; Batra, Prerna; Sachan, Ravi; Singh, Gurbachan",Tropical doctor,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049475520927626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32476599/,667

Two synthetic strategies, (1) click, then chelate and (2) chelate, then click, were investigated to determine the impact of assembly order on the reactivity of the system. In the click, then chelate approach, fac-[M(I)(OH2)3(CO)3](+) was reacted with the PMAA ligand ""clicked"" to the benzyl azide, 5, to yield two unique coordination species, fac-[M(I)(CO)3(O,N(amine),N(py)-5)], M = Re (8), (99m)Tc (8A), and fac-[M(I)(CO)3(N(tri),N(amine),N(py)-5)], M = Re (9), (99m)Tc (9A), where coordination is through the triazole (N(tri)), central amine (N(amine)), pyridine (N(py)), or carboxylate (O). Depending on the reaction pH, different ratios of complexes 8(A) and 9(A) were observed, but single species were obtained of (O,N(amine),N(py)) coordination, 8(A), in basic pHs (>9) and (N(tri),N(amine),N(py)) coordination, 9(A), in slightly acidic pHs (<4). In the chelate, then click approach, the (O,N(amine),N(py)) coordination of [M(I)(CO)3](+) was preorganized in the alkyne-functionalized fac-[M(I)(CO)3(O,N(amine),N(py)-3)], M = Re (6), (99m)Tc (6A), followed by standard Cu(I)-catalyzed Huisgen ""click"" conditions at pH ≈ 7.4, where the (O,N(amine),N(py)) coordination mode remained unchanged upon formation of the triazole product in the clicked molecule. Despite the slow substitution kinetics of the low-spin d(6) metal, the coordination modes (O,N(amine),N(py)) and (N(tri),N(amine),N(py)) were found to reversibly intraconvert between 8(A) and 9(A) based upon changes in pH that mirrored the (O,N(amine),N(py)) coordination in basic pHs and (N(tri),N(amine),N(py)) coordination in acidic pHs.

In health care settings specifically, social work is the key workforce tasked with responding to patient and family psychosocial needs, both of which have increased substantially since the emergence of COVID-19. There is a need to understand ways in which hospital social workers' roles, responsibilities, and integration within interprofessional teams have evolved in response to these challenges. In this qualitative study, focus groups were conducted with 55 social workers employed across multiple settings in a large, urban, pediatric hospital in Spring 2020. Thematic analyses revealed salient superordinate themes related to the pandemic's impact on social work practice and social workers themselves, institutional facilitators and impediments to effective social work and interprofessional practice, and social work perspectives on future pandemic recovery efforts. Within each theme, a number of interrelated subthemes emerged elucidating nuances of telehealth adoption in the context of remote work, the salience of social determinants of health, and the critical role of social work in social justice oriented pandemic preparedness and response efforts.

156562,Use of intraoperative ablation as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of recurrent colorectal liver metastases.,2011,"Self-location-the sense of where I am in space-provides an experiential anchor for one's interaction with the environment. In the studies of full-body illusions, many researchers have defined self-location solely in terms of body-location-the subjective feeling of where my body is. Although this view is useful, there is an issue regarding whether it can fully accommodate the role of 1PP-location-the sense of where my first-person perspective is located in space. In this study, we investigate self-location by comparing body-location and 1PP-location: using a head-mounted display (HMD) and a stereo camera, the subjects watched their own body standing in front of them and received tactile stimulations. We manipulated their senses of body-location and 1PP-location in three different conditions: the participants standing still (Basic condition), asking them to move forward (Walking condition), and swiftly moving the stereo camera away from their body (Visual condition). In the Walking condition, the participants watched their body moving away from their 1PP. In the Visual condition, the scene seen via the HMD was systematically receding. Our data show that, under different manipulations of movement, the spatial unity between 1PP-location and body-location can be temporarily interrupted. Interestingly, we also observed a ""double-body effect."" We further suggest that it is better to consider body-location and 1PP-location as interrelated but distinct factors that jointly support the sense of self-location.","Huang, Hsu-Chia; Lee, Yen-Tung; Chen, Wen-Yeo; Liang, Caleb",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28352241/,667
156579,Morbidity associated with laparoscopic repair of suprapubic hernias.,2008,"AIM Perineal approaches are considered to be the 'gold standard' in treating elderly patients with external rectal prolapse (ERP) because morbidity and mortality with perineal approaches are lower compared with transabdominal approaches. Higher recurrence rates and poorer function are tolerated as a compromise. The aim of the present study was to assess the safety of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) in elderly patients, compared with perineal approaches. METHOD The prospectively collected databases from two tertiary referral pelvic floor units were interrogated to identify outcome in patients of 80 years of age and older with full-thickness ERP treated by LVR. The primary end-points were age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) grade, mortality, and major and minor morbidity. Secondary end-points were length of stay (LOS) and recurrence. RESULTS Between January 2002 and December 2008, 80 [median age 84 (80-97) years] patients underwent rectopexy. The mean ± standard deviation ASA grade was 2.44 (± 0.57) (two patients were ASA grade I, 42 patients were ASA grade II, 35 patients were ASA grade III and one patient was ASA grade IV). The median LOS was 3 (range 1-37) days. There was no mortality, and 10 (13%) patients had complications (one major and nine minor). At a median follow-up of 23 (2-82) months, two (3%) patients had developed a recurrent full-thickness prolapse. CONCLUSION LVR is a safe procedure for using to treat full-thickness ERP in elderly patients. Mortality, morbidity and hospital stay are comparable with published rates for perineal procedures, with a 10-fold lower recurrence.","Wijffels, N; Cunningham, C; Dixon, A; Greenslade, G; Lindsey, I",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02242.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20184638/,667

METHODS AND MATERIALS Fifty-two patients at 4 institutions were enrolled into a prospective pilot clinical trial. Patients underwent baseline scans and then were injected with perirectal spacing hydrogel and rescanned. Intensity modulated radiation therapy plans were created on both scans for comparison. The objectives were to establish rates of creation of ≥ 7.5 mm of prostate-rectal separation, and decrease in rectal V70 of ≥ 25%. Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between preinjection and postinjection changes in rectal V70 and changes in plan conformity, rectal volume, bladder volume, bladder V70, planning target volume (PTV), and postinjection midgland separation, gel volume, gel thickness, length of PTV/gel contact, and gel left-to-right symmetry. RESULTS Hydrogel resulted in ≥7.5-mm prostate-rectal separation in 95.8% of patients; 95.7% had decreased rectal V70 of ≥ 25%, with a mean reduction of 8.0 Gy. There were no significant differences in preinjection and postinjection prostate, PTV, rectal, and bladder volumes. Plan conformities were significantly different before versus after injection (P=.02); plans with worse conformity indexes after injection compared with before injection (n=13) still had improvements in rectal V70. In multiple regression analysis, greater postinjection reduction in V70 was associated with decreased relative postinjection plan conformity (P=.01). Reductions in V70 did not significantly vary by institution, despite significant interinstitutional variations in plan conformity. There were no significant relationships between reduction in V70 and the other characteristics analyzed. CONCLUSIONS Injection of hydrogel into the prostate-rectal interface resulted in dose reductions to rectum for >90% of patients treated. Rectal sparing was statistically significant across a range of 10 to 75 Gy and was demonstrated within the presence of significant interinstitutional variability in plan conformity, target definitions, and injection results.","Song, Danny Y; Herfarth, Klaus K; Uhl, Matthias; Eble, Michael J; Pinkawa, Michael; van Triest, Baukelien; Kalisvaart, Robin; Weber, Damien C; Miralbell, Raymond; Deweese, Theodore L; Ford, Eric C","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2012.12.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23414766/,667

157112,Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in gynecology: review of literature and available technology.,2011,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS™) is a potentially less invasive approach than standard laparoscopy (LAP). However, SILS™ may not allow the same level of manual dexterity and technical performance compared to LAP. We compared the performance of standardized tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program using either the LAP or the SILS™ technique. METHODS Medical students, surgical residents, and attending physicians were recruited and divided into inexperienced (IE), laparoscopy-experienced (LE), and SILS™-experienced (SE) groups. Each subject performed standardized tasks from FLS, including peg transfer, pattern cutting, placement of ligating loop, and intracorporeal suturing using a standard three-port FLS box-trainer with standard laparoscopic instruments. For SILS™, the subjects used an FLS box-trainer modified to accept a SILS Port™ with two working ports for instruments and one port for a 30° 5-mm laparoscope. SILS™ tasks were performed with instruments capable of unilateral articulation. SILS™ suturing was performed both with and without an articulating EndoStitch™ device. Task scores, including cumulative laparoscopic FLS score (LS) and cumulative SILS™ FLS score (SS), were calculated using standard time and accuracy metrics. RESULTS There were 27 participants in the study. SS was inferior to LS in all groups. LS increased with experience level, but was similar between LE and SE groups. SS increased with experience level and was different among all groups. SILS™ suturing using the articulating suturing device was superior to the use of a modified needle driver technique. CONCLUSIONS SILS™ is more technically challenging than standard laparoscopic surgery. Using currently available SILS™ platforms and instruments, even surgeons with SILS™ experience are unable to match their overall LAP performance.

Due to the low frequency of antigen-reactive B cells (<0.05% of lymphocytes) in the periphery, preliminary enrichment of cells is necessary to achieve sufficient numbers for statistically sound characterization, especially when downstream analytic platform use, e.g., CyTOF, is low throughput. We previously described a method to detect and enrich antigen-reactive B cells from peripheral blood and tissues using biotinylated antigens in conjunction with magnetic nanoparticles, preparative to a downstream analysis by ELISPOT and flow cytometry. While mass cytometry (CyTOF) enables high dimensional immunophenotyping of over 40 unique parameters on a single-cell level, its low throughput compared to flow cytometry and requirement for removal of metal contaminants, such as nanoparticles, made it particularly unsuitable for studies of rare cells in a mixed population. Here we describe a novel CyTOF-compatible approach for multiplexed enrichment of antigen-reactive B cells, e.g., insulin and tetanus toxoid, using cleavable magnetic nanoparticles. This method allows improved monitoring of the phenotype and function of antigen-reactive B cells during the development of disease or after immunization while minimizing the amount of sample and run times needed.","Stensland, Zachary C; Smith, Mia J",Magnetochemistry,https://doi.org/10.3390/magnetochemistry7070092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295938/,667

We synthesized electrospun scaffolds-composed of a blend of the degradable polymers poly(l-lactide) (PLA) or polycaprolactone (PCL)-that produce highly efficient non-viral in vivo gene delivery to cells in the wound bed, provide a protective barrier during early wound healing, and support cell migration and growth. This multi-functional material was tested for its influence on wound healing: scaffolds were loaded with plasmids encoding keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and applied to full-thickness wounds in mice. Compared to scaffolds with control plasmids, animals receiving the KGF plasmid-loaded scaffold produced significant enhancements in wound healing, which was quantified by improvements in the rate of wound re-epithelialization, keratinocyte proliferation, and granulation response. Further, we quantified the expression level of endogenous and plasmid-derived KGF in wound samples: qRT-PCR on wound sections revealed a correlation between the levels of plasmid-derived protein expression and histological analysis of wound healing, revealing an inverse relationship between the expression level of exogenous KGF and the size of the unhealed epithelial layer in wounds. Our findings suggest that engineered nanofiber PLA/PCL scaffolds are capable of highly efficient controlled DNA delivery and are promising materials for treatment of cutaneous wounds.","Kobsa, Serge; Kristofik, Nina J; Sawyer, Andrew J; Bothwell, Alfred L M; Kyriakides, Themis R; Saltzman, W Mark",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.02.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23453058/,667
157657,Passing the fundamentals of endoscopic surgery (FES) exam: linking specialty choice and attitudes about endoscopic surgery to success.,2018,"BACKGROUND Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is commonly used during immediate expander-based breast reconstruction, with potential advantages of greater intraoperative expansion, decreased time to complete expansion, and decreased rates of capsular contracture. However, ADM is associated with increased infection rate, seroma, and subsequent reconstructive failure. Poly-4-hydroxybutyric acid (P4HB) mesh is a large pore, biosynthetic scaffold shown to fully resorb and incorporate host tissues within 18 months. We sought to compare outcomes between the use of P4HB and ADM in immediate retropectoral expander-based reconstruction. METHODS One hundred ninety-two consecutive cases (107 patients) of breast reconstruction using ADM were compared with a subsequent cohort of 112 cases (62 patients) using P4HB mesh. In all patients, reconstruction was performed immediately after mastectomy by a single surgeon, and outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar between the P4HB and ADM groups. Overall infection rates were lower, but not significantly with P4HB (11% vs 17%, P = 0.18). Time to drain removal was significantly lower with P4HB (15 vs 18 days, P = 0.008), although there was no difference in rates of seroma (0.9% vs 3%, P = 0.43). Similar numbers of patients underwent external beam radiation (22% vs 24%) and received chemotherapy in each group (48% vs 45%). By univariate analysis, all odds ratios were decreased with use of P4HB, including risk of major complications (0.55), seroma (0.17), infection (0.59), need for reoperation (0.78), and skin necrosis (0.77). CONCLUSIONS Initial findings suggest P4HB mesh to be a safe alternative to ADM in expander-based breast reconstruction, with trends toward decreased rates of infection, seroma, and need for device removal using P4HB mesh. Although our results are limited to a small series of initial patients, P4HB mesh may be a promising novel technique to decrease complications inherent to use of ADM at a reduced material cost.","Levy, Adam S; Bernstein, Jaime L; Xia, Jimmy J; Otterburn, David M",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32243319/,667

The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of rhinovirus infections in children in Cyprus over three consecutive winter seasons. From a total of 116 rhinovirus-positive samples, 68 were sequenced in the 5'-UTR and VP4/VP2 regions. Thirty-six (52.9%) samples were identified as HRV-A and 27 (39.7%) as HRV-C, with only five (7.4%) samples belonging to the HRV-B species. Of these, a total of 46 different genotypes were identified. In the VP2/VP4 phylogenetic tree all strains clustered in three different well-defined clades, whereas the 5'-UTR tree exhibited clades with a mixed clustering of HRV-A and HRV-C strains reflecting the evolutionary history of recombination between HRV-A and HRV-C that has been observed previously. In summary, a high intra- and inter-season diversity of HRV types was observed. Despite its geographical isolation the frequency of HRV species in Cyprus is comparable to that reported in other regions of the world supporting the concept of an unrestricted global circulation. This study assesses, for the first time, the epidemiology of rhinovirus infections in Cypriot children and will be helpful to clinicians and researchers interested in the treatment and control of viral respiratory tract infections.","Richter, J; Nikolaou, E; Panayiotou, C; Tryfonos, C; Koliou, M; Christodoulou, C",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268814002933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25388928/,667

As we document, one changing circumstance that is resulting in the emergence and changing the expression of viral diseases in both plants and animals is climate change. Of note, the rapidly changing environment and weather conditions such as excessive flooding, droughts, and forest fires have raised concerns about the global ecosystem's security, sustainability, and balance. In this review, we discuss the main consequences of climate change and link these to how they impact the appearance of new viral pathogens, how they may facilitate transmission between usual and novel hosts, and how they may also affect the host's ability to manage the infection. We emphasize how changes in temperature and humidity and other events associated with climate change influence the reservoirs of viral infections, their transmission by insects and other intermediates, their survival outside the host as well the success of infection in plants and animals. We conclude that climate change has mainly detrimental consequences for the emergence, transmission, and outcome of viral infections and plead the case for halting and hopefully reversing this dangerous event.","Dash, Shiba Prasad; Dipankar, Pankaj; Burange, Prasad S; Rouse, Barry T; Sarangi, Pranita P",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841x.2021.1879006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570448/,667

158130,"Reduced cardiovascular risk after bariatric surgery is linked to plasma ceramides, apolipoprotein-B100, and ApoB100/A1 ratio.",2013,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Globally, a number of countries have developed guidelines that describe the design and conduct of economic evaluations as part of health technology assessment (HTA) or pharmacoeconomic analysis for decision making. The current scoping review was undertaken with an objective to summarize the recommendations made on methods of economic evaluation by the national healthcare economic evaluation (HEE) guidelines. METHODOLOGY A comprehensive search was undertaken in the website repositories of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomic and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and Guide to Economic Analysis and Research (GEAR), and websites of national HTA agencies and ministries of health of individual countries. All guidelines in the English language were included in this review. Data were extracted with respect to general and methodological characteristics, and a descriptive analysis of recommendations made across the countries was undertaken. RESULTS Overall, our review included 31 national HEE guidelines, published between 1997 and August 2020. Nearly half (45%) of the guidelines targeted the evaluation of pharmaceuticals. The nature of the guidelines was either mandatory (31%), recommendatory (42%), or voluntary (16%). There was a substantial consensus among the guidelines on several key principles, including type of economic evaluation (cost-utility analysis), time horizon of the analysis (long enough), health outcome measure (quality-adjusted life-years) and use of sensitivity analyses. The recommendations on study perspective, comparator, discount rate and type of costs to be included (particularly the inclusion of indirect costs) varied widely. CONCLUSION Despite similarity in the overall processes, variation in several recommendations given by various national HEE guidelines was observed. This is perhaps unsurprising given the differences in the health systems and financing mechanisms, capacity of local researchers, and data availability. This review offers important lessons and a starting point for countries that are planning to develop their own HEE guidelines.","Sharma, Deepshikha; Aggarwal, Arun Kumar; Downey, Laura E; Prinja, Shankar",PharmacoEconomics - open,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41669-020-00250-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423205/,667

Embolization is thought to play an important role in the management of spinal cord AVMs. Factors for recurrent hemorrhage and the impact of endovascular treatment on prevention of recurrent hemorrhage remain to be confirmed. We aimed to assess recurrent hemorrhagic incidence of spinal cord AVMs and its prevention by endovascular treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed 80 patients with spinal cord AVMs by spinal cord angiography who had hemorrhage before the first endovascular treatment at New York University Medical Center, Beth Israel Medical Center, or Roosevelt Hospital in New York. We compared the baseline and radiologic characteristics of patients with and without recurrent hemorrhage by the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS We observed recurrent hemorrhage in 35 (44%) patients (1/41 patients with endovascular treatment and 34/39 patients without endovascular treatment). The median length of total follow-up was 659 days (interquartile range, 129-2640 days), and the median length from first-to-recurrent hemorrhage was 369 days (interquartile range, 30-1596 days). The log-rank test revealed that endovascular treatment and venous thrombosis reduced recurrent hemorrhage, and associated aneurysm was related to recurrent hemorrhage. Even in multivariate analysis, the endovascular treatment reduced (hazard ratio, 0.027; P < .0001) and associated aneurysm increased (hazard ratio, 3.4; P = .044) the risk of recurrent hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular embolization is the first choice of treatment for spinal cord AVMs and is effective in preventing recurrent hemorrhage.","Niimi, Y; Matsukawa, H; Uchiyama, N; Berenstein, A",AJNR.

Our research examines this phenomenon, termed unanswered support. Drawing from Self-Determination Theory, we expected that lower need satisfaction would mediate the negative relationship between unanswered support and its predicted outcomes (well-being, performance, and relational outcomes). We also expected that attributions for the lack of support would moderate these indirect effects. In Study 1, 280 employees in the United Kingdom took part in a quasi-experimental field study, where we examined the nature of the relationships between the variables. In Study 2, we recruited 267 undergraduate students at an Australian university and experimentally manipulated unanswered support during a work simulation to investigate its causal effects. Across both studies, unanswered support indirectly affected the outcomes through lower need satisfaction. There was minimal evidence for the hypothesized moderating role of attributions. Unanswered supervisor support appears to reduce employees' psychological need satisfaction, negatively impacting how they feel, behave, and connect with others. Our research highlights the importance of leaders answering requests for support, and the findings have implications for employees, supervisors, and organizations.

METHODS NIR fluorescence imaging for the robotic platform was obtained at our institution in 12/2011. We identified all cases planned for SLN mapping using fluorescence imaging from 12/2011-4/2013. Intracervical ICG was the fluorophobe in all cases. Four cc (1.25mg/mL) of ICG was injected into the cervix alone divided into the 3- and 9-o'clock positions, with 1 cc deep into the stroma and 1 cc submucosally before initiating laparoscopic entry. Blue dye was concurrently injected in some cases. RESULTS Two hundred twenty-seven cases were performed. Median age was 60 years (range, 28-90 years). Median BMI was 30.2 kg/m(2) (range, 18-60 kg/m(2)). The median SLN count was 3 (range, 1-23). An SLN was identified in 216 cases (95%), with bilateral pelvic mapping in 179 (79%). An aortic SLN was identified in 21 (10%) of the 216 mapped cases. When ICG alone was used to map cases, 188/197 patients mapped, for a 95% detection rate compared to 93% (28/30) in cases in which both dyes were used (P=NS). Bilateral mapping was seen in 156/197 (79%) ICG-only cases and 23/30 (77%) ICG and blue dye cases (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS NIR fluorescence imaging with intracervical ICG injection using the robotic platform has a high bilateral SLN detection rate and appears favorable to using blue dye alone and/or other modalities. Combined use of ICG and blue dye appears unnecessary.","Jewell, Elizabeth L; Huang, Juan Juan; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Gardner, Ginger J; Brown, Carol L; Sonoda, Yukio; Barakat, Richard R; Levine, Douglas A; Leitao, Mario M",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2014.02.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582865/,667
159214,Alterations of global gastrointestinal motility after sleeve gastrectomy: a prospective study.,2013,"BACKGROUND The test-negative design is an increasingly popular approach for estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE) due to its efficiency. This review aims to examine published test-negative design studies of VE and to explore similarities and differences in methodological choices for different diseases and vaccines. METHODS We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, for studies reporting the effectiveness of any vaccines using a test-negative design. We screened titles and abstracts, and reviewed full texts to identify relevant articles. We created a standardized form for each included article to extract information on the pathogen of interest, vaccine(s) being evaluated, study setting, clinical case definition, choices of cases and controls, and statistical approaches used to estimate VE. RESULTS We identified a total of 348 articles, including studies on VE against influenza virus (n=253), rotavirus (n=48), pneumococcus (n=24), and nine other pathogens. Clinical case definitions used to enroll patients were similar by pathogens of interest but the sets of symptoms that defined them varied substantially. Controls could be those testing negative for the pathogen of interest, those testing positive for non-vaccine type of the pathogen of interest, or a subset of those testing positive for alternative pathogens. Most studies controlled for age, calendar time, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our review highlights similarities and differences in the application of the test-negative design that deserve further examination. If vaccination reduces disease severity in breakthrough infections, particular care must be taken in interpreting vaccine effectiveness estimates from test-negative design studies.","Chua, Huiying; Feng, Shuo; Lewnard, Joseph A; Sullivan, Sheena G; Blyth, Christopher C; Lipsitch, Marc; Cowling, Benjamin J",Epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000001116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609860/,667

Through minimally invasive procedures, it increasingly replaces surgical interventions that involve higher percentages of invasiveness and, consequently, of morbidity and mortality. For these advantageous reasons, interventional radiology in recent years has spread to the paediatric age as well. The aim of this study was to review the literature on the development, use and perspectives of these procedures in the paediatric musculoskeletal field. Several topics are covered: osteomuscle neoplastic malignant and benign pathologies treated with invasive diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures such as radiofrequency ablation in the osteoid osteoma; invasive and non-invasive procedures in vascular malformations; treatment of aneurysmal bone cysts; and role of interventional radiology in paediatric inflammatory and rheumatic inflammations. The positive results that have been generated with interventional radiology procedures in the paediatric field highly encourage both the development of new ad hoc materials, obviously adapted to young patients, as well as the improvement of such techniques, in consideration of the fact that childrens' pathologies do not always correspond to those of adults. In conclusion, as these interventional procedures have proven to be less invasive, with lower morbidity and mortality rates as well, they are becoming a viable and valid alternative to surgery in the paediatric population.","Natali, Gian L; Paolantonio, Guglielmo; Fruhwirth, Rodolfo; Alvaro, Giuseppe; Parapatt, George K; Toma', Paolo; Rollo, Massimo",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20150369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26235144/,667

We have collated data from multiple international trials of presurgical endocrine therapy in order to provide guidance on the identification of patients who may have insufficiently endocrine-sensitive tumors and should be prioritised for early surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy rather than NeoET during or in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic for safety or when surgical activity needs to be prioritized. For postmenopausal patients, our data provide strong support for the use of ER and PgR status at diagnosis for triaging of patients into three groups in which (taking into account clinical factors): (i) NeoET is likely to be inappropriate (Allred ER <6 or ER 6 and PgR <6) (ii) a biopsy for Ki67 analysis (on-treatment Ki67) could be considered after 2-4 weeks of NeoET (a: ER 7 or 8 and PgR <6 or b: ER 6 or 7 and PgR ≥6) or (iii) NeoET is an acceptable course of action (ER 8 and PgR ≥6). Cut-offs for percentage of cells positive are also given. For group (ii), a high early on-treatment level of Ki67 (>10%) indicates a higher priority for early surgery.

Twenty-six (79%) aneurysms were small, 6 (18%) were large, 1 was (3%) giant, and 39% were wide-neck. Coiling was done with balloon assistance in 36% of cases and stent-assistance in 6%. Technical complications occurred in 1 patient, contributing to death. Early clinical complications causing permanent disability occurred in 3% of cases. One patient (3%) had fatal rebleeding 18 days after treatment. Overall, procedure-related morbidity and mortality were, respectively, 3% and 6%. Complete occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved in 36% of patients after initial treatment and in 65% during follow-up (average, 29.3 months). Seven patients had recurrences requiring retreatment (30%). Clinical outcome (average, 32.9 months) was good in 75% of patients and poor in 25%. No delayed complications related to treatment and/or the aneurysm occurred. CONCLUSIONS Ruptured paraclinoid aneurysms are challenging lesions from an endovascular and surgical point of view. Despite the high rate of recurrences, good clinical results and protection against rebleeding can be achieved with current endovascular techniques.","Loumiotis, I; D'Urso, P I; Tawk, R; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F; Kairouz, V; Hanel, R; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

159617,Total laparoscopic hysterectomy: Analysis of the surgical learning curve in benign conditions.,2016,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication of mechanical ventilation that has been shown to be associated with increased mortality rates and medical costs in the pediatric intensive care unit. Currently, there is no cost-effective solution to the problems posed by VAP. Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) that are resistant to bacterial colonization and that inhibit biofilm formation could provide a novel solution to the problems posed by VAP. The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate differences in the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs and on ETTs etched with a fungal lipase, Rhizopus arrhizus, to create nanoscale surface features. These differences were evaluated using an in vitro model of the pediatric airway to simulate a ventilated patient in the pediatric intensive care unit. Each experiment was run for 24 hours and was supported by computational models of the ETT. Dynamic conditions within the ETT had an impact on the location of bacterial growth within the tube. These conditions also quantitatively affected bacterial growth especially within the areas of tube curvature. Most importantly, experiments in the in vitro model revealed a 2.7 log reduction in the number (colony forming units/mL) of P. aeruginosa on the nanoroughened ETTs compared to the untreated PVC ETTs after 24 hours. This reduction in total colony forming units/mL along the x-axis of the tube was similar to previous studies completed for Staphylococcus aureus. Thus, this dynamic study showed that lipase etching can create surface features of nanoscale roughness on PVC ETTs that decrease bacterial attachment of P. aeruginosa without the use of antibiotics and may provide clinicians with an effective and inexpensive tool to combat VAP.","Machado, Mary C; Webster, Thomas J",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s108253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27563242/,667

The main advantages of Bayesian methods include simple model comparison, presenting results as a summary of probability distributions, and the explicit inclusion of prior information into analyses. In the field of anthropological genetics, for example, implementing Bayesian skyline plots and approximate Bayesian computation is becoming ubiquitous as means to analyze genetic data for the purpose of demographic or historic inference. Correspondingly, there is a critical need for better understanding of the underlying assumptions, proper applications, and limitations of these two methods by the larger anthropological community. Here we review Bayesian skyline plots and approximate Bayesian computation as applied to human demography and provide examples of the application of these methods to anthropological research questions. We also review the two core components of Bayesian demographic analysis: the coalescent and Bayesian inference. Our goal is to describe their basic mechanics in an attempt to demystify them.","Villanea, Fernando A; Kitchen, Andrew; Kemp, Brian M",Human biology,https://doi.org/10.13110/humanbiology.91.4.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767897/,667

Genetic advances have played no small part in that. Initial studies in the 1970s and 1980s identified the strong major histocompatibility complex associations in autoimmune liver diseases. During the 1990 s, developments in genomic technologies drove the identification of genes responsible for Mendelian liver diseases. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies have allowed for the dissection of the genetic susceptibility to complex liver disorders, in which also environmental co-factors play important roles. Findings have allowed the identification and elaboration of pathophysiological processes, have indicated the need for reclassification of liver diseases and have already pointed to new disease treatments. In the immediate future genetics will allow further stratification of liver diseases and contribute to personalized medicine. Challenges exist with regard to clinical implementation of rapidly developing technologies and interpretation of the wealth of accumulating genetic data.

Nearly half of the population of Maine and New Hampshire derive their drinking water from private wells which often have arsenic levels above the EPA limit of 10 ppb. Arsenic exposure can cause cancer, adverse cardiovascular effects, and other health problems. Addressing this issue in schools provides context and motivation for students to engage in scientific inquiry and acquire data literacy skills. This project involves students collecting well water samples for arsenic analysis, entering their data into an online citizen science data portal, Anecdata, and using Tuva online software tools to visualize and interpret their data. Students present their data at public meetings to inform community members of their findings with the goal of moving ""data to action"".

A long-term prospective study.,2013,"Objective: This study aimed to examine the irrigant flow generated by laser-activated irrigation (LAI), in comparison with ultrasonic-activated irrigation (UAI) and syringe irrigation (SI), in the area beyond the ledge using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Background data: There was no reported study about cleaning efficacy of LAI beyond the ledge. Materials and methods: Forty-nine J-shaped root canal models (40° curvature) were instrumented to no. 35/0.06, and a ledge, 2.5 mm deep, was created with no. 60/0.08 instrument at 5 mm from the apical foramen in each canal. The samples were irrigated with LAI [30 mJ/5 pulse per second (pps), 30 mJ/10 pps, 30 mJ/20 pps, 50 mJ/10 pps, 70 mJ/10 pps], UAI, and SI with a tip/needle insertion depth of 5 mm from the apical foramen (n = 7). PIV was performed with glass beads and a high-speed camera. Velocities were compared in the coronal and apical areas to the ledge, respectively. Results: In the apical area, all LAI groups and UAI produced a higher velocity than that of SI, and LAI at 30 mJ/20 pps and 70 mJ/10 pps showed significantly higher velocity than that of UAI (p < 0.05). In the coronal area, LAI at 30 mJ/20 pps generated a significantly higher velocity than that of UAI and SI (p < 0.05). Velocity was significantly slower in the apical area than in the coronal area in UAI and SI (p < 0.05), but was similar between both areas in LAI except at 30 mJ/20 pps. Conclusions: Among tested laser settings, higher velocity was significantly achieved by LAI at 30 mJ/20 pps and 70 mJ/10 pps compared with UAI in the canal area beyond the ledge. SI generated lower fluid movement than LAI and UAI in both canal regions.","Aung, NyeinPyaeSone; Watanabe, Satoshi; Kouno, Akira; Hongo, Tomoyuki; Yao, Kanako; Satake, Kazuhisa; Okiji, Takashi","Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",https://doi.org/10.1089/photob.2019.4758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667863/,667

PATIENTS AND METHODS Five female patients underwent LESS nephrectomy; three procedures were carried out with the umbilicus as the port of entry (U-LESS). RESULTS All cases were completed uneventfully. The operative duration was 45-150 min and blood loss was negligible. There were no conversions to conventional multi-port laparoscopy or open surgery. Recovery was uneventful with only minor complications in two patients; convalescence was rapid. CONCLUSION LESS nephrectomy offers a safe, cosmetic alternative to conventional multi-port laparoscopy, with younger female patients being especially happier with the 'scarless' outcome of U-LESS.

Background annual GBS incidence rates (IRs) in Latin America (LA) varies from 0.40 to 2.12/100,000 persons per year. We performed a prospective population-based epidemiological study to determine the incidence and clinical profile of GBS in the most densely populated regions in Uruguay. METHODS The incidence of GBS in the population living in Montevideo and Canelones was studied in the period between June 1st 2018, and May 31st 2020. Patients older than 16 years of age diagnosed with GBS were prospectively enrolled. RESULTS The mean global annual IR in the Uruguayan population was 1.7/100,000 persons (95% CI 1.25-2.25). The highest rate was observed in the 65-74 age group among men (5.25/100,000 per year) and in the 55-64 age group among women (2/100.000 per year). The mean age was 53.9 ± 19.5, years, without difference by sex (53.5 women, 54.5 men). The in-hospital mortality rate was 5.8%. A total of 51 patients were diagnosed with GBS : 42 (82 %) had typical GBS, 5 (10%) Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), 3 ( 7%) a bilateral facial nerve palsy, 1 patient had a GBS-MFS overlap (2.3%). INTERPRETATION This is the first population-based GBS incidence study in LA using a prospective design. Our IR can be a useful tool in establishing the background rate to examine future disease trends caused by the introduction of new viruses or vaccines in Uruguay.","Chiesa, Mercedes; Decima, Rodrigo; Bertinat, Andrés; Poggi, Luciana; Hackembruch, Heber; Montenegro, Cecilia; Chiparelli, Hector; Vázquez, Cristina",Journal of the peripheral nervous system : JPNS,https://doi.org/10.1111/jns.12450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945181/,667
160129,Videoendoscopic single-port axillary dissection.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To assess the learning curve for total laparoscopic hysterectomy. METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of the learning curve for two surgeons during their first 257 consecutive cases of total laparoscopic hysterectomy at a teaching hospital. Patients were divided sequentially into groups comprising the first 75 patients, the next 75, and the final 107 patients. Age, body mass index, gestational parity, indications for laparoscopic hysterectomy, previous pelvic surgery, operating time, haemoglobin decline, complications, need for transfusion, and length of hospital stay were evaluated. RESULTS The mean operating time for total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduced significantly from 76.2 min to 68.9 min (p = 0.001) between the first and second 75-patient groups. Linear regression analysis showed a plateau was reached on the learning curve after 71-80 cases. The rate of all complications started at 8% in the first group of 75 patients, reduced to 6.7% in the next group, and decreased further in the final group to 4.7%. The decline was not statistically significant (p = 0.6). The difference in the need for transfusion was statistically significant between the first 75 patients and the second group of 75 (p = 0.04). Conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy was required in five patients, four in the early group and one in the final group. Age, body mass index, parity, previous pelvic surgery, decline in haemoglobin, and length of hospital stay were similar among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS A plateau in the learning curve for TLH was reached after the first 75 cases. We can infer that there is a learning curve for TLH as confirmed by the decrease in operating time (accompanied by no change in complications) correlated to gain in experience. On the other hand, one should not disregard the fact that laparoscopy is not a complication-free surgery and achievement of the learning curve does not exclude complications. Gynaecological surgeons can perform TLH securely during the learning curve.","Terzi, Hasan; Biler, Alper; Demirtas, Omer; Guler, Omer Tolga; Peker, Nuri; Kale, Ahmet",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633451/,667
160205,Early experience with laparoendoscopic single-site pyeloplasty in children.,2011,"Polymersomes, self-assembled from the block copolymer polybutadiene-block-poly(ethylene glycol), were prepared with well-defined diameters between 90 and 250 nm. The presence of ~1% of diethylene triamine penta acetic acid on the polymersome periphery allowed to chelate radioactive (111)In onto the surface and determine the biodistribution in mice as a function of both the polymersome size and poly(ethylene glycol) corona thickness (i.e., PEG molecular weight). Doubling the PEG molecular weight from 1 kg/mol to 2 kg/mol did not change the blood circulation half-life significantly. However, the size of the different polymersome samples did have a drastic effect on the blood circulation times. It was found that polymersomes of 120 nm and larger become mostly cleared from the blood within 4 h, presumably due to recognition by the reticuloendothelial system. In contrast, smaller polymersomes of around 90 nm circulated much longer. After 24 h more than 30% of the injected dose was still present in the blood pool. This sharp transition in blood circulation kinetics due to size is much more abrupt than observed for liposomes and was additionally visualized by SPECT/CT imaging. These findings should be considered in the formulation and design of polymersomes for biomedical applications. Size, much more than for liposomes, will influence the pharmacokinetics, and therefore, long circulating preparations should be well below 100 nm.","Brinkhuis, René P; Stojanov, Katica; Laverman, Peter; Eilander, Jos; Zuhorn, Inge S; Rutjes, Floris P J T; van Hest, Jan C M",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc200578s; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22463082/,667

Although new vaccines have been generated and being implicated, discovery and application of novel preventive and control measures are warranted. We aimed to identify compounds that may possess the potential to either block the entry of virus to host cells or attenuate its replication upon infection. Using host cell surface receptor expression (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)) analysis as an assay, we earlier screened several synthetic and natural compounds and identified candidates that showed ability to down-regulate their expression. Here, we report experimental and computational analyses of two small molecules, Mortaparib and MortaparibPlus that were initially identified as dual novel inhibitors of mortalin and PARP-1, for their activity against SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses showed that MortaparibPlus, but not Mortaparib, stably binds into the catalytic pocket of TMPRSS2. In vitro analysis of control and treated cells revealed that MortaparibPlus caused down-regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2; Mortaparib did not show any effect. Furthermore, computational analysis on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) that also predicted the inhibitory activity of MortaparibPlus. However, cell-based antiviral drug screening assay showed 30-60% viral inhibition in cells treated with non-toxic doses of either MortaparibPlus or Mortaparib. The data suggest that these two closely related compounds possess multimodal anti-COVID-19 activities. Whereas MortaparibPlus works through direct interactions/effects on the host cell surface receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) and the virus protein (Mpro), Mortaparib involves independent mechanisms, elucidation of which warrants further studies.","Kumar, Vipul; Sari, Anissa Nofita; Meidinna, Hazna Noor; Dhanjal, Jaspreet Kaur; Subramani, Chandru; Basu, Brohmomoy; Kaul, Sunil C; Vrati, Sudhanshu; Sundar, Durai; Wadhwa, Renu",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20212156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647577/,667

However, little evidence is available on sustained low-efficiency extended dialysis (SLED) performed with SBD in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS All SLED-SBD sessions conducted on AKI patients in nine ICUs between March and June 2010 were retrospectively analyzed regarding the achieved metabolic and fluid control. Logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with hypotension and clotting during the sessions. RESULTS Data from 106 patients and 421 sessions were analyzed. Patients were 54.2 ± 17.0 years old, 51 % males, and the main AKI cause was sepsis (68 %); 80 % of patients needed mechanical ventilation and 55 % vasoactive drugs. Hospital mortality was 62 %. The median session time was 360 min [interquartile range (IQR) 300-360] and prescribed ultrafiltration was 1500 ml (IQR 800-2000). In 272 sessions (65 %) no complications were recorded. No heparin was used in 269/421 procedures (64 %) and system clotting occurred in 63 sessions (15 %). Risk factors for clotting were sepsis [odds ratio (OR) 2.32 (1.31-4.11), p = 0.004], no anticoagulation [OR 2.94 (1.47-5.91), p = 0.002] and the prescribed time (hours) [OR 1.14 (1.05-1.24), p = 0.001]. Hypotension occurred in 25 % of procedures and no independent risk factors were identified by logistic regression. Adequate metabolic and fluid balance was achieved during SLED sessions. Median blood urea decreased from 107 to 63 mg/dl (p < 0.001), potassium from 4.1 to 3.9 mEq/l (p < 0.001), and increased bicarbonate (from 21.4 to 23.5 mEq/l, p < 0.001). Median fluid balance during session days ranged from +1300 to -20 ml/24 h (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS SLED-SBD was associated with a low incidence of clotting despite frequent use of saline flush, and achieved a satisfactory hemodynamic stability and reasonable metabolic and fluid control in critically-ill AKI patients.","Caires, Renato A; Abdulkader, Regina C R M; Costa E Silva, Verônica T; Ferreira, Gillene S; Burdmann, Emmanuel A; Yu, Luis; Macedo, Etienne",Journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-015-0224-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26298845/,667

To date its adoption for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) care is still in a preliminary stage. We evaluated the feasibility of multidisciplinary assessment of patients with ALS, using telememedicine during the emergency determined by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All patients included in this survey had received a diagnosis of ALS according to international criteria after a complete clinical and paraclinical assessment during 2019. A structured questionnaire was used by the neurologist with the patient or the caregiver. A video interaction was offered but refused by all patients because they did not feel comfortable or did not have smartphone. Results: Out of 31 clinical interviews 8 were completed directly with the patients and 23 with patients' caregivers. In a successive survey, most of patients were satisfied with the neurological interview (85%), the possibility to interact directly with the clinician being at home (85%) and reduction of economic and time costs because they avoided unnecessary travel to the clinic. Most of subjects expressed their willingness to continue to be included in remote evaluation programs (90%). Notably, none of the patients presented index symptoms of Covid-19 infection. Conclusion: Our study indicates that telemedicine is a valid tool to triage patients with ALS to increase practice outreach and efficiency. Delivery of care via telemedicine was effective and successful in people with ALS in the dramatic and sudden crisis determined by Covid-19 outbreak.","Capozzo, Rosa; Zoccolella, Stefano; Musio, Marco; Barone, Roberta; Accogli, Miriam; Logroscino, Giancarlo",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.1080/21678421.2020.1773502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530314/,667

Sirtuins utilize NAD(+) to deacetylate proteins, yielding O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) as a reaction product. The macrodomain is a ubiquitous protein module known to bind ADP-ribose derivatives, which diverged through evolution to support many different protein functions and pathways. The observation that some sirtuins and macrodomains are physically linked as fusion proteins or genetically coupled through the same operon, provided a clue that their functions might be connected. Indeed, here we demonstrate that the product of the sirtuin reaction OAADPr is a substrate for several related macrodomain proteins: human MacroD1, human MacroD2, Escherichia coli YmdB, and the sirtuin-linked MacroD-like protein from Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, we show that the cell extracts derived from MacroD-deficient Neurospora crassa strain exhibit a major reduction in the ability to hydrolyze OAADPr.

In this review, we summarise clinical assessment, surgical options, discuss potential new treatments, and outline the importance of investigating and addressing the multiple anatomical levels that can contribute to OSA. Research into effectiveness of these procedures is rapidly accumulating, and surgery can be an effective treatment.

In this study, we used 16-color flow cytometry analysis to investigate the frequency, differentiation, and activation status of peripheral B cells of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or acute Plasmodium falciparum malaria compared with the healthy individuals. As a main result, we observed an increase of the frequency of (CD27-, CD21-) atypical memory B cells and (CD19+, CD27+, CD38+) plasmablasts in malaria and COVID-19 patients. Additionally, CD86, PD-1, CXCR3, and CD39 expression was up-regulated, whereas CD73 was down-regulated on plasmablasts of COVID-19 and malaria patients compared with the bulk B cell population. In particular, there was a more pronounced loss of CD73+ B cells in malaria. The frequency of plasmablasts positively correlated with serum levels of CRP, IL-6, and LDH of COVID-19 patients. In the longitudinal course of COVID-19, a rapid normalization of the frequency of atypical memory B cells was observed. The role and function of plasmablasts and atypical memory B cells in COVID-19 and other acute infections remain to be further investigated. The role of B cells as either ""driver or passenger"" of hyperinflammation during COVID-19 needs to be clarified.","Wildner, Nils H; Ahmadi, Parimah; Schulte, Sophia; Brauneck, Franziska; Kohsar, Matin; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Beisel, Claudia; Addo, Marylyn M; Haag, Friedrich; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.5cova0620-370rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617048/,667

Although the course of exacerbations is disease specific, they are mostly triggered by a respiratory infection. Exacerbations often require hospitalization and are an important cause of mortality. Treatments of exacerbations aim to minimize the negative impact and to prevent subsequent events. Despite many existing therapy options, many patients do not benefit from therapy and suffer from recurrent events. Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem and is extremely prevalent in these patients. Vitamin D, known for its calcemic effects, also has immunomodulatory and anti-infectious actions and can therefore be a possible agent to treat or prevent exacerbations. This review will focus on vitamin D as a potential candidate to treat or prevent exacerbations in CF, COPD, and asthma.","Maes, Karen; Serré, Jef; Mathyssen, Carolien; Janssens, Wim; Gayan-Ramirez, Ghislaine",Calcified tissue international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00223-019-00591-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31350569/,667

161792,A comprehensive review of laparoscopic redo fundoplication.,2011,"BACKGROUND In accordance with the Cox-Maze paradigm, successful treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) requires (1) complete posterior left atrial isolation, (2) elimination of corridors for perimitral reentry, (3) elimination of cardiac venous (superior vena cava and coronary sinus) arrhythmogenic foci, (4) complete autonomic denervation, and (5) occlusion or removal of the left atrial appendage. Using a totally thoracoscopic approach, isolation of all left atrial arrhythmogenic substrate is achieved through the creation of 5 discrete but contiguous compartments, thereby enabling unambiguous verification with bidirectional block. Since no previous closed-chest procedure incorporates all these end points, an update on patient outcomes is reported. METHODS One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with antiarrhythmic drug-resistant AF (3 paroxysmal, 5 persistent, 171 longstanding persistent cases), known preoperatively for 5.7 (range 0.5 to 25) years, underwent the 5-box thoracoscopic Maze procedure. Only 1 patient suffered a serious procedural complication (sternotomy for pulmonary artery injury). Postoperative rhythm surveillance consisted of 1 week of continuous ambulatory monitoring at 3, 6, 13, and 24 months. Failure was defined as any tachyarrhythmia exceeding 30 seconds beyond the 3-month anniversary. RESULTS Freedom from AF was observed in 137 of 142 patients at 3 months, 115 of 119 patients at 6 months, 75 of 78 patients at 13 months, and 24 of 25 patients at 24 months. Two patients remain in sinus rhythm on low-dose antiarrhythmia therapy. Warfarin is discontinued only after the first monitoring session confirms rhythm stability. CONCLUSIONS Replication of the left atrial Cox-Maze lesion set through a totally thoracoscopic approach isolates virtually all arrhythmogenic substrate. Meticulous verification of compartment integrity allows for outcomes equivalent to the Cox-Maze benchmark.","Sirak, John H; Schwartzman, David",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22858273/,667

One of the most important signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which plays fundamental roles in growth, metabolism, and immunity. The class IB PI3K, PI3Kγ, is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic p110γ subunit bound to a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit. PI3Kγ is a critical component in multiple immune signaling processes and is dependent on activation by Ras and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate its cellular roles. Here we describe the rapid and efficient characterization of multiple PI3Kγ binding single-chain camelid nanobodies using hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) for structural and biochemical studies. We identify nanobodies that stimulated lipid kinase activity, block Ras activation, and specifically inhibited p101-mediated GPCR activation. Overall, our work reveals insight into PI3Kγ regulation and identifies sites that may be exploited for therapeutic development.","Rathinaswamy, Manoj K; Fleming, Kaelin D; Dalwadi, Udit; Pardon, Els; Harris, Noah J; Yip, Calvin K; Steyaert, Jan; Burke, John E",Structure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2021.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348129/,667

Early techniques involved simple manual traction that frequently proved ineffective for chronically implanted leads, and carried a significant risk of myocardial avulsion, tamponade, and death. The morbidity and mortality associated with these early extraction techniques limited their application to use only in life-threatening situations, such as infection and sepsis. The past four decades, however, have witnessed significant advances in lead extraction technology, resulting in more efficacious techniques and tools, providing the skilled extractor with a well-equipped armamentarium. With the development of the discipline, we have witnessed a growth in the community of TLE experts coincident with a marked decline in the incidence of procedure-related morbidity and mortality, with recent registries at high-volume centers reporting high success rates with exceedingly low complication rates.

Lung microbiota dysbiosis might play an important role in the pathogenic mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as elicit other opportunistic infections associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With its increasing prevalence and morbidity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant mothers is inevitable. Recent evidence shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) act as an entry receptor and viral spike priming protein, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These receptor proteins are highly expressed in the maternal-fetal interface, including the placental trophoblast, suggesting the possibility of maternal–fetal transmission. In this review, we discuss the role of lung microbiota dysbiosis in respiratory diseases, with an emphasis on COVID-19 and the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy outcome and neonatal health.","Ezechukwu, H.

Corticosteroids are one of the most promising therapeutic agents for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite emerging data, assessed populations and regimens vary, and there are patient subgroups whose response to steroids remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and treated with a short dexamethasone course to determine which patient categories derive the highest benefit. Methods. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a prospectively collected single-center ICU database (April 1–October 1, 2020). Adult COVID-19 patients were assigned to dexamethasone (12 mg × 3 days) and usual care groups. Patient, management, and outcome data were extracted. The primary outcome was the 28-day ICU mortality. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the impact of dexamethasone on mortality in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Results. Of 233 patients, 220 (median age: 65 years, 38% female) were included: 83 patients received dexamethasone and 137 received usual care. Overall, 28 (33.7%) and 54 (39.4%) patients in the dexamethasone and usual care groups, respectively, died within 28 days since ICU admission (rate ratio (RR) 0.86;95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.59–1.23;p = 0.405). In the IMV cohort, dexamethasone did not decrease the 28-day mortality compared with usual care (47.5% vs. 62.0%;RR 0.78;95% CI: 0.57–1.09;p = 0.107). A subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower 28-day mortality in IMV patients &lt;65 years receiving dexamethasone vs. usual care (22.6% vs. 48.5%;RR 0.47;95% CI: 0.22–0.98;p = 0.043), which was not seen in IMV patients ≥65 years (75.0% vs. 71.1%;RR 1.06;95% CI: 0.79–1.42;p = 0.719). Patients ≥65 years experienced hyperglycemia, bacterial infection, and septic shock significantly more often than younger patients who received dexamethasone (p = 0.002 , p = 0.025 , and p &lt; 0.001 , respectively). Conclusions. A 3-day dexamethasone course is not associated with lower 28-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients, either in the entire ICU cohort or in the IMV. Dexamethasone may significantly reduce the 28-day mortality in IMV patients &lt;65 years, but not in the older IMV subgroup. Dexamethasone administration in patients ≥65 years is associated with a significantly higher rate of adverse events than that in younger patients [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Critical Care Research & Practice is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

184747,Laparoscopic-assisted and laparoscopic prophylactic gastropexy: indications and techniques.,2009,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the factors affecting behavioural intention to use E-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study applies the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) to identify the factors that predict intention to use E-learning. Also, the study examines the effect of personal innovativeness in information technology and perceived financial cost on intention to use E-learning. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a cross-sectional quantitative study design involving 617 university students. The data was collected through an online survey due to the COVID-19 restrictions. The proposed hypotheses were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: The study found that personal innovativeness in information technology, perceived financial cost, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation and social influence have a significant effect on the intention to use E-learning. Contrary to expectation, habits, effort expectancy and facilitating conditions did not predict intention to use E-learning. Research limitations/implications: The study was conducted on university students and did not include other school-going students and working professionals. Also, the study sample was not drawn from many universities. The study used a quantitative approach. The use of a mixed-methods approach could provide deeper insights into the factors affecting the intention to use E-learning in developing countries. Practical implications: The practical implications inform policymakers and educational institutions on how E-learning adoption can be enhanced. In this context, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, personal innovativeness and perceived financial cost are identified as predictors of intention to use E-learning. This study has implications for the development of E-learning systems and the promotion of the use of E-learning in the context of developing countries. Originality/value: The study is amongst the few studies from a developing economy to use the UTAUT2 model to examine students’ intention to use E-learning. The study proposes the inclusion of personal innovativeness in information technology and perceived financial cost as factors predicting intention to use E-learning. Again, the study adopts importance-performance matrix analysis to provide decisional areas where management may improve for successful E-learning acceptance and use. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Twum, K.

Such an operation requires a wideranged system that comprises a variety of interfaces as channels between citizens and healthcare authority's information services. Amongst such interfaces, the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems can present benefits for informing citizens about the pandemic. Although the literature shows that IVR systems have been used for healthcare, the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic demands new examinations on the role of IVR systems on a multiplatform system for delivering information. This paper aimed to identify gaps and opportunities for the use of IVR systems to inform citizens about the COVID-19 pandemic. A case study was conducted by mapping the Brazilian Ministry of Healthcare's channels of information about the coronavirus and analyzing the Disque Saúde IVR system-a phonebased ombudsman channel-based on literature recommendations. The results showed that while IVR systems have great potential for accessibility, it is essential that all types of information are available and continuously updated for citizens. Furthermore, the vast and mutable availability of information in a pandemic scenario may be a challenge for the usability of such systems. © 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

The WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic or public health emergency because of its morbidity and mortality. Several inflammatory markers have been used in the initial diagnosis, as well as prognostic markers in disease progression. One of the inflammatory markers is C reactive protein. The other markers that help in prognosis are ferritin, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, CT scan of the lung, IL6 (interleukin 6), RT PCR is reliable diagnostic evidence. Aim of the study: 1. The aim is to determine the C-reactive protein, CT (Computerised Tomography) scan of the lung, RT PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction) in COVID -19 patients. 2. To compare CRP & CT scan values of the lung in various age groups. A cross-sectional study was done from September 2020 to January 2021 and the results were analysed. Out of 704 covid positive patients, the maximum number of patients were in the age group between 31 to 70. The RT PCR showed COVID positive results in 689 (97.8%) patients. The CRP values were found to be >25mg/l from 31-50 (34.7%) years and in 51-70 years of age (52%). In comparison of CT scan with CRP changes, CRP values were found to be raised when there is 25-50% (24.5%) and >50% (27.6%) involvement of lung by COVID. CT scan lung involvement was >50% in the age group between 31-50 (38.9%) and 51-70 (50%), respectively. High CRP values of >25mg/l were observed with the same age group 34.7% with the group of 31-50 and 52% with the group of 51-70, respectively.

This challenge lead to the development of ‘QI-Fridays’, a weekly drop in facilitated by a Chief Resident and consultant with training in QI science. Despite this there was limited engagement between trainee projects and hospital wide work, made more challenging by covid-19.AimTo support trainees to deliver effective QI projects with an understanding of QI methodologyTo facilitate shared work between permanent staff and rotational juniorsTo allow the celebration of QI work during covidMethodsThis project has been developed iteratively by chief residents responding to feedback. Beginning with ‘QI-Friday’ where trainees could discuss ideas and methodology, rewarded with chocolate fish. A QI showcase event was developed to share the work being generated with the wider hospital. Engagement there highlighted an interest from permanent staff in working with juniors. This resulted in ‘QI speed dating’ – an idea sharing event connecting permanent staff with trainees. The QI showcase was converted to a virtual event during covid with engagement across the health-board.ResultsSurveys showed 82% of trainees felt their knowledge of QI methodology improved. Verbal feedback that QI showcase was well tailored to speciality applications. Fifteen collaborative projects were generated by QI speed dating but not all sustained. Involvement with QI showcase increased yearly – the latest had 35 posters and five platforms.ConclusionTrainees can do innovative QI work if adequately supported. Ideas generated by collaboration between trainee and permanent staff are useful, but more work is required to ensure sustained improvement. This work requires skilled people to provide support, and we are developing a QI fellowship to train consultants. It is difficult to share ideas in a socially distanced way but virtual platforms allow for wide engagement.","Manners, Rachel Brunton Alan McCully Elisabeth Ren-Ping Lee McGurn Brian",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.50,667

187651,Phenylephrine eyedrops as a diagnostic test in equine grass sickness.,2000,"Milk flow was recorded in 21 cows for three days after they were admitted to a large animal hospital. When the spontaneous flow of milk had stopped, a physiological dose (1 iu) of oxytocin was administered intravenously. Five of the cows were, in addition, treated with 0.35 mg of a long-acting analogue of oxytocin (carbetocin) one hour before the first milking after they were admitted. In the 16 cows not treated with carbetocin, only about 30 per cent of the total milk yield was released spontaneously on the first day, and the injection of 1 iu of oxytocin released approximately another 60 per cent of the total milk yield. On the second day, the proportion of the total milk yield released spontaneously increased and the fraction released after the injection of 1 iu oxytocin decreased. In contrast, the five cows treated with carbetocin released on average 94 per cent of the total milk yield spontaneously during the first milking.","Riedl, J; Daffner, B L; Kiossis, E; Bruckmaier, R M; Stolla, R",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11400985/,667
187728,Evaluation of measurements of the conductivity of quarter milk samples for the early diagnosis of mastitis.,2002,"The transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infects the epithelial cells of the intestinal tract of pigs, resulting in a high mortality rate in piglets. This study shows the interaction of TGEV with a porcine epithelial cell line. To determine the site of viral entry, LLC-PK1 cells were grown on permeable filter supports and infected with TGEV from the apical or basolateral side. Initially after plating, the virus was found to enter the cells from both sides. During further development of cell polarity, however, the entry became restricted to the apical membrane. Viral entry could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the viral receptor aminopeptidase N. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that this receptor protein was present at both the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains just after plating of the cells but that it became restricted to the apical plasma membrane during culture. To establish the site of viral release, the viral content of the apical and basolateral media of apically infected LLC-PK1 cells was measured by determining the amount of radioactively labelled viral proteins and infectious viral particles. We found that TGEV was preferentially released from the apical plasma membrane. This conclusion was confirmed by electron microscopy, which demonstrated that newly synthesized viral particles attached to the apical membrane. The results support the idea that the rapid lateral spread of TGEV infection over the intestinal epithelia occurs by the preferential release of virus from infected epithelial cells into the gut lumen followed by efficient infection of nearby cells through the apical domain.","Rossen, J W; Bekker, C P; Voorhout, W F; Strous, G J; van der Ende, A; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7966587/,667

A specific therapeutic intervention is available for individuals testing positive for influenza viruses (oseltamivir), and it is potentially beneficial to identify non-influenza viruses to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. We evaluated antimicrobial prescriptions following respiratory pathogen testing among outpatients at a large Veterans Administration (VA) medical center. Results of the FilmArray respiratory panel (BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT) from 15 December 2014 to 15 April 2015 were evaluated among 408 outpatients, and patient medical records were reviewed. Differences in antibiotic and oseltamivir prescription rates were analyzed. Among 408 patients tested in outpatient centers (emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and outpatient clinics), 295 (72.3%) were managed as outpatients. Among these 295 outpatients, 105 (35.6%) tested positive for influenza virus, 109 (36.9%) tested positive for a non-influenza virus pathogen, and 81 (27.5%) had no respiratory pathogen detected. Rates of oseltamivir and antibiotic prescriptions were significantly different among the three test groups (chi-squared values of 167.6 [P < 0.0001] and 10.48 [P = 0.005], respectively), but there was no significant difference in antibiotic prescription rates between the non-influenza virus pathogen group and those who tested negative (chi-square value, 0; P = 1.0). Among adult outpatients, testing positive for influenza virus was associated with receiving fewer antibiotic prescriptions, but no such effect was seen for those who tested positive for a non-influenza virus. These data suggest that testing for influenza viruses alone may be sufficient and more cost-effective than multiplex pathogen testing for outpatients.","Green, Daniel A; Hitoaliaj, Letiana; Kotansky, Brian; Campbell, Sheldon M; Peaper, David R",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654334/,667

188977,Serological evidence of murine pathogens in wild grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in North Wales.,2002,"BACKGROUND A new human coronavirus (HCoV), HCoV-NL, was recently reported for Dutch patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). Little information is available on the incidence, clinical manifestations and epidemiologic features of HCoV-NL infections. METHODS We performed a prospective study of symptomatic (case subjects with ARTI) and asymptomatic (control subjects undergoing elective surgery) children, <or=3 years of age, hospitalized in Canada during 2 winter seasons (2001-2003), to look at the prevalence of respiratory viruses. Reverse transcription-PCR assays were used to retrospectively detect HCoV-NL and to correlate its presence with clinical symptoms. RESULTS HCoV-NL was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 3.0% of young children (12 of 396 children) hospitalized for treatment of ARTI (case subjects), compared with 1.7% of asymptomatic control subjects (3 of 177 children) (P = 0.6). Nine (75.0%) of the symptomatic children had mixed viral infections. The mean age and mean duration of hospitalization of case subjects were 10.1 months and 4.9 days, respectively. Final diagnoses consisted of bronchiolitis or bronchitis (9 of 12 cases), pneumonitis (1 of 12 cases) and upper respiratory tract infections (2 of 12 cases), although 2 of 3 subjects with single HCoV-NL infections had upper respiratory tract infections only. Sequence analysis of the 1a and spike genes revealed that multiple HCoV-NL strains circulated in the same geographical area in each of the 2 winter seasons. Variability was more pronounced for the spike gene, with 2 clusters of strains. CONCLUSIONS HCoV-NL was not a major respiratory pathogen in Canada during our study, as shown by its low detection rate in hospitalized children with ARTI, coupled with the high frequency of additional pathogens and its occasional detection in healthy children.","Boivin, Guy; Baz, Mariana; Côté, Stéphanie; Gilca, Rodica; Deffrasnes, Céline; Leblanc, Eric; Bergeron, Michel G; Déry, Pierre; De Serres, Gaston",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371863/,667

A third patient presented with an upper respiratory tract infection but coronavirus was not isolated. All three men had spent a day decorating the first patient's flat four days prior to presentation. This is the first description of respiratory tract infection with coronavirus in HIV patients. Both patients with coronavirus required prolonged admission to hospital and extensive investigations because they were HIV infected.

A typical slippery site and downstream pseudoknot are necessary for this frameshifting event, and previous work has demonstrated that ribosomes pause over the slippery site. The translational intermediate associated with a ribosome paused at this position is detected, and, using in vitro translation and quantitative heelprinting, the rates of synthesis, the ribosomal pause time, the proportion of ribosomes paused at the slippery site, and the fraction of paused ribosomes that frameshift are estimated. About 10% of ribosomes pause at the slippery site in vitro, and some 60% of these continue in the -1 frame. Ribosomes that continue in the -1 frame pause about 10 times longer than it takes to complete a peptide bond in vitro. Altering the rate of translational initiation alters the rate of frameshifting in vivo. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments can best be interpreted to mean that there are three methods by which ribosomes pass the frameshift site, only one of which results in frameshifting.","Lopinski, J D; Dinman, J D; Bruenn, J A",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10648594/,667

Although PEC is considered to be a polymicrobial disease, numerous viruses, including turkey coronavirus (TCV), turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2), and avian reoviruses (ARVs), have been associated with PEC-like disease. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), a highly sensitive and specific detection method for viral RNA, was developed in a multiplex format for the simultaneous detection of TAstV-2 and TCV and for the detection of two genetic types of ARV. Assay sensitivity was determined using in vitro transcribed RNA and varied by target between 150 gene copies for TAstV-2 alone and 2200 gene copies for TCV when multiplexed. Virus detection was evaluated with samples collected from poults inoculated at 1 day of age with each of the viruses. Cloacal swabs and intestinal samples were obtained at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 14, 17, and 21 days after inoculation, processed, and tested for virus detection by RRT-PCR Cloacal swabs from TAstV-2- and TCV-infected poults were shown to have sensitivity for virus detection similar to that of intestinal samples when compared directly.

We propose that optimal standards of care be upheld, and short-term safety concerns due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 be weighed against a long-term compromise in cancer prognosis when deciding on adjustments in cancer care. Proper mitigation strategies in the clinic and use of less resource-heavy but equivalent treatment alternatives often allow optimal cancer care.

For severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the figures are conflicting. Herein, we screened 12,000 people in a community stricken by SARS 10 months previously and found 53 individuals (0.44%) who had immunoglobulin G antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) produced in bacteria. However, only seven of these (group 1) had sera which also reacted with the native N antigen expressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, N-transfected 293T cells, and tissues of infected SARS patients. Of these, six individuals had had SARS previously. The remaining person, as well as the 46 other individuals (group 2), were healthy and had no history of SARS. Group 1 antibodies recognized epitopes located slightly differently in N from those of group 2 antibodies, and a mouse hybridoma antibody resembling the former type was generated. Unusually, group 2 antibodies appeared to recognize cross-reactive bacterial epitopes that presumably were posttranslationally modified in eukaryotes and hence were probably not induced by SARS-CoV or related coronaviruses but rather by bacteria. The N antigen is thus highly unique.

In the present study, the antitumor activity of a herbal product derived from the Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis) was examined, using in vitro assays in a human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. Results showed that S. baicalensis root extract at the concentration of 100 μg/ml inhibited monolayer- and anchorage-independent growth in human OSCC cell lines, while not affecting the adhering abilities of cells. This suggested that it did not alter the expression of any of the adhesion receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The S. baicalensis root extract demonstrated potent cytostatic and apoptotic effects due to the downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression and its partner cyclin D1, resulting in G1 arrest and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Additionally, the S. baicalensis root extract was found to have blocked vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration and tube formation in human endothelial cells.

Toward this objective, a replication-defective bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAV-3) was developed as an expression vector. Bovine cell lines designated VIDO R2 (HAV-5 E1A/B-transformed fetal bovine retina cell [FBRC] line) and 6.93.9 (Madin-Darby bovine kidney [MDBK] cell line expressing E1 proteins) were developed and found to complement the E1A deletion in BAV-3. Replication-defective BAV-3 with a 1.7-kb deletion removing most of the E1A and E3 regions was constructed. This virus could be grown in VIDO R2 or 6.93.9 cells but not in FBRC or MDBK cells. The results demonstrated that the E1 region of HAV-5 has the capacity to transform bovine retina cells and that the E1A region of HAV-5 can complement that of BAV-3. A replication-defective BAV-3 vector expressing bovine herpesvirus type 1 glycoprotein D from the E1A region was made. A similar replication-defective vector expressing the hemagglutinin-esterase gene of bovine coronavirus from the E3 region was isolated. Although these viruses grew less efficiently than the replication-competent recombinant BAV-3 (E3 deleted), they are suitable for detailed studies with animals to evaluate the safety, duration of foreign gene expression, and ability to induce immune responses. In addition, a replication-competent recombinant BAV-3 expressing green fluorescent protein was constructed and used to evaluate the host range of BAV-3 under cell culture conditions. The development of bovine E1A-complementing cell lines and the generation of replication-defective BAV-3 vectors is a major technical advancement for defining the use of BAV-3 as vector for vaccination against diseases of cattle and somatic gene therapy in humans.","Reddy, P S; Idamakanti, N; Chen, Y; Whale, T; Babiuk, L A; Mehtali, M; Tikoo, S K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10516020/,667

194148,Ultrasonographic findings in three cows with chronic ragwort (Senecio alpinus) poisoning.,1999,"Model peptides composed of alanine and leucine residues are often used to mimic single helical transmembrane domains. Many studies have been carried out to determine how they interact with membranes. However, few studies have investigated their lipid-destabilizing effect. We designed three peptides designated KALRs containing a hydrophobic stretch of 14, 18, or 22 alanines/leucines surrounded by charged amino acids. Molecular modeling simulations in an implicit membrane model as well as attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared analyses show that KALR is a good model of a transmembrane helix. However, tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the extent of binding and insertion into lipids increases with the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Although binding can be directly correlated to peptide hydrophobicity, we show that insertion of peptides into a membrane is determined by the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Functional studies were performed by measuring the ability of peptides to induce lipid mixing and leakage of liposomes. The data reveal that whereas KALR14 does not destabilize liposomal membranes, KALR18 and KALR22 induce 40 and 50% of lipid-mixing, and 65 and 80% of leakage, respectively. These results indicate that a transmembrane model peptide can induce liposome fusion in vitro if it is long enough. The reasons for the link between length and fusogenicity are discussed in relation to studies of transmembrane domains of viral fusion proteins. We propose that fusogenicity depends not only on peptide insertion but also on the ability of peptides to destabilize the two leaflets of the liposome membrane.","Lorin, Aurélien; Charloteaux, Benoit; Fridmann-Sirkis, Yael; Thomas, Annick; Shai, Yechiel; Brasseur, Robert",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459883/,667

In this report, we describe a case of acute heart failure with LVA and LVFA occurring in stage as a complication of myocardial infarction in a 55-year-old man. The patient was also at risk of brain ischemia due to abnormal vessel status and a previous cerebrovascular accident with left-sided weakness. Successful perioperative anesthetic management was achieved by focusing on maintaining marginal upper normal blood pressure to ensure cerebral perfusion and to reduce the risk of false aneurysm rupture.","Lee, Chung Hun; Lee, Dong Kyu; Lim, Sang Ho; Kim, Heezoo",Korean journal of anesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27703635/,667

Feasibility, safety and outcome of EVT in a-ICAD are not well described yet. METHODS From an institutional database, we retrospectively selected consecutive patients treated for a-ICAD between January 2007 and July 2015. We assessed recanalization results defining <50 % residual stenosis and mTICI ≥2b as successful. Procedural adverse events and symptomatic haemorrhages were reported as well as clinical outcome at 90 days defining a mRS ≤2 as favourable. Follow-up angiographies were reviewed and retreatments reported. RESULTS In the defined period, 73 patients (mean age 48 years (31-73), mean NIHSS 11 (0-27)) received EVT for a-ICAD. The majority (60 %) had tandem occlusions. Cervical artery reconstruction was successful in 100 % and intracranial thrombectomy in 85 %. Thrombus formation (18 %) and thromboembolism (20 %) were the most frequent adverse events but clinically relevant only in 8 %. Symptomatic haemorrhage occurred in 5 %. Clinical outcome was favourable in 64 %, with a lower chance after tandem occlusion (55 vs. 79 %, p = 0.047). Death rate was 10 %. None of the patients developed recurrent ischaemic symptoms, but control angiography revealed abnormal findings of the reconstructed ICA in 38 % leading to retreatment in 17 %. CONCLUSION EVT of a-ICAD is feasible with a predominantly favourable clinical outcome. Improvement of devices and techniques is warranted to reduce the risk of thrombus formation and thromboembolism during treatment and insufficient vessel wall healing thereafter.","Kurre, Wiebke; Bansemir, Kai; Aguilar Pérez, Marta; Martinez Moreno, Rosa; Schmid, Elisabeth; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Neuroradiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27796447/,667
195858,Stenosis of a colorectal anastomosis solved by transanal endoscopic microsurgery combined with laparoscopy.,2010,"Aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13; EC 3.4.11.2) is a transmembrane metalloprotease with several functions, depending on the cell type and tissue environment. In tumor vasculature, APN is overexpressed in the endothelium and promotes angiogenesis. However, there have been no reports of in vivo inactivation of the APN gene to validate these findings. Here we evaluated, by targeted disruption of the APN gene, whether APN participates in blood vessel formation and function under normal conditions. Surprisingly, APN-null mice developed with no gross or histological abnormalities. Standard neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, locomotor, and hematological studies revealed no alterations. Nonetheless, in oxygen-induced retinopathy experiments, APN-deficient mice had a marked and dose-dependent deficiency of the expected retinal neovascularization. Moreover, gelfoams embedded with growth factors failed to induce functional blood vessel formation in APN-null mice. These findings establish that APN-null mice develop normally without physiological alterations and can undergo physiological angiogenesis but show a severely impaired angiogenic response under pathological conditions. Finally, in addition to vascular biology research, APN-null mice may be useful reagents in other medical fields such as malignant, cardiovascular, immunological, or infectious diseases.","Rangel, Roberto; Sun, Yan; Guzman-Rojas, Liliana; Ozawa, Michael G; Sun, Jessica; Giordano, Ricardo J; Van Pelt, Carolyn S; Tinkey, Peggy T; Behringer, Richard R; Sidman, Richard L; Arap, Wadih; Pasqualini, Renata",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17360568/,667

This study investigated the change in HRV measures after anaerobic and aerobic intermittent exercises in university football and futsal players. METHOD 36 male university students with physically active lifestyle (n=14), football (n=12), and futsal (n=10) participated in this study. The participants completed the repeated sprint ability (RSA) test and Yo-Yo (YY) intermittent recovery test level 1 in randomised order. ECG signals of the participants were recorded in supine position 15 min before and 30 min after exercises. Before exercise, and 5 and 30 min after exercise, the blood pressures were also taken. RESULTS In the RSA protocol, the percentage changes in normalised high-frequency power (nHFP) were significantly decreased, while the percentage changes in the very low/high frequency power ratio (VLHR) and low/high frequency power ratio (LHR) were significantly increased in futsal players after exercise, as compared with the controls. No significant changes in all HRV indices were found in the YY protocol, except the respiratory frequency. CONCLUSIONS After exercise, the percent decrease in vagal modulation in futsal players was significantly reduced, while the percentage increase in sympathetic modulation in futsal players was significantly enhanced in the RSA test, but not in the YY test, as compared with the control group. The increase in sympathetic activity and the decrease in vagal activity in the futsal players were greater than the corresponding increase and decrease in the football players in the RSA test.","Chen, Yung-Sheng; Liao, Chih-Jung; Lu, Wan-An; Kuo, Cheng-Deng",BMJ open sport & exercise medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900135/,667

196532,Adaptation of dogs to the amputation of a limb and their owners' satisfaction with the procedure.,1999,"Bats classified in the order Chiroptera are the most abundant and widely distributed non-human mammalian species in the world. Several bat species are reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses and therefore can be a public health hazard. Lyssaviruses of different genotypes have emerged from bats in America (Genotype 1 rabies virus; RABV), Europe (European bat lyssavirus; EBLV), and Australia (Australian bat lyssavirus; ABLV), whereas Nipah virus is the most important recent zoonosis of bat origin in Asia. Furthermore, some insectivorous bat species may be important reservoirs of SARS coronavirus, whereas Ebola virus has been detected in some megachiropteran fruit bats. Thus far, European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) is the only zoonotic virus that has been detected in bats in Europe. New zoonotic viruses may emerge from bat reservoirs and known ones may spread to a wider geographical range. To assess future threats posed by zoonotic viruses of bats, there is a need for accurate knowledge of the factors underlying disease emergence, for an effective surveillance programme, and for a rapid response system. In Europe, primary efforts should be focussed on the implementation of effective passive and active surveillance systems for EBLVs in the Serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, and Myotis species (i.e., M. daubentonii and M. dasycneme). Apart from that, detection methods for zoonotic viruses that may emerge from bats should be implemented. Analyses of data from surveillance studies can shed more light on the dynamics of bat viruses, (i.e., population persistence of viruses in bats). Subsequently, studies will have to be performed to assess the public health hazards of such viruses (i.e., infectivity and risk of infection to people). With the knowledge generated from this kind of research, a rapid response system can be set up to enhance public health awareness of emerging zoonotic viruses of bats.","van der Poel, Wim H M; Lina, Peter H C; Kramps, Johannes A",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17187565/,667

These microarrays were used to screen approximately 400 Canadian sera from the SARS outbreak, including samples from confirmed SARS-CoV cases, respiratory illness patients, and healthcare professionals. A computer algorithm that uses multiple classifiers to predict samples from SARS patients was developed and used to predict 206 sera from Chinese fever patients. The test assigned patients into two distinct groups: those with antibodies to SARS-CoV and those without. The microarray also identified patients with sera reactive against other coronavirus proteins. Our results correlated well with an indirect immunofluorescence test and demonstrated that viral infection can be monitored for many months after infection. We show that protein microarrays can serve as a rapid, sensitive, and simple tool for large-scale identification of viral-specific antibodies in sera.","Zhu, Heng; Hu, Shaohui; Jona, Ghil; Zhu, Xiaowei; Kreiswirth, Nate; Willey, Barbara M; Mazzulli, Tony; Liu, Guozhen; Song, Qifeng; Chen, Peng; Cameron, Mark; Tyler, Andrea; Wang, Jian; Wen, Jie; Chen, Weijun; Compton, Susan; Snyder, Michael",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16537477/,667

With monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune antisera to feline coronavirus and CCV, respectively, varying degrees of antigenic diversities were found among the strains by neutralization and immunofluorescence assays, but it was felt that they belong to one serotype. Specific-pathogen-free puppies experimentally inoculated with some CCV strains manifested clinical symptoms, but there was a difference in their virulence. In order to elucidate the prevalence of CCV infections in dogs in Japan, we tested for neutralizing antibodies to CCV in 467 field dogs, and found a prevalence of 44.1%. Moreover, by using nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on rectal swabs of 100 diarrheic dogs recently presented in veterinary clinics, evidence of CCV in 16% of these specimens was found. The results suggested that CCV infection is more widespread than expected in dogs, and that CCV is a significant etiologic factor in canine diarrhea also in Japan.","Bandai, C; Ishiguro, S; Masuya, N; Hohdatsu, T; Mochizuki, M",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10458093/,667

Methods This is a cohort study on a retrospective series of 35 consecutive patients who underwent Mini-LLS for symptomatic POP between January 2014 and July 2016. All 35 patients were operated at the Gynaecological Unit in S. Chiara Hospital by two senior surgeons (S. Tateo and L. Mereu) and by a team with optimal skills in laparoscopic surgery. Patients were divided in two groups according to two different chronological phases: phase 1 identified the initial 12 cases, phase 2 the last 23 cases. We collected pre-, peri- and post-operative information to analyze the surgical outcomes and learning curve after Mini-LLS procedures. Results The mean LLS-Overall Time (OT) was 107.6 min (range, 185- 63 min). None of the patients had intra-operative complications. No conversion to laparotomy was necessary. The mean post-operative hospital stay was 58 hours in total (SD +/-22). Only in 3 cases (8.6 %) post-operative grade I complications were observed. Recurrence of POP was observed in 3 cases (8.6 %) during a mean follow up of 18 months. The mean OT decreased with experience, in particular after the first 12 cases (phase 1: 113.54 minutes versus phase 2: 104.43 minutes). In consequence, the reduction of time per procedure was statistically significant considering the Cusum Time (CT) (P < .05). Conclusions Mini-LLS with mesh is a safe and reproducible technique with good anatomical results, low complication rates and a short learning curve.","Mereu, L; Dalpra, F; Terreno, E; Pertile, R; Angioni, S; Tateo, S","Facts, views & vision in ObGyn",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191848/,667
198845,Esophageal leakage after surgical repair of spontaneous rupture: successful closure with endoscopic suture device.,2016,"The spike (S) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) plays a major role in the viral pathogenesis. It is often processed into the N-terminal S1 and the C-terminal S2 subunits that were evidently important for binding to cell receptor and inducing cell-cell fusion, respectively. As a consequence of cell-cell fusion, most of the naturally occurring infections of MHV are associated with syncytia formation. So far, only MHV-2 was identified to be fusion-negative. In this study, the S gene of MHV-2 was molecularly cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The MHV-2 S protein lacks a 12-amino acid stretch in the S1 hypervariable region from amino acid residue 446 to 457 when compared with the fusion-positive strain MHV-JHM. In addition, there are three amino acid substitutions in the S2 subunit, Tyr-1144 to Asp, Glu-1165 to Asp, and Arg-1209 to Lys. The cloned MHV-2 S protein exhibited the fusion-negative property in DBT cells as the intrinsic viral protein. Furthermore, similar to the fusion-positive MHV-JHM strain, proteolytic cleavage activity was detected both in DBT cells infected with the fusion-negative MHV-2 and in the transfected cells that expressed the cloned MHV-2 S protein. Domain swapping experiments demonstrated that the 12-amino acid stretch missing in the MHV-2 S1 subunit, but not the proteolytic cleavage site, was critical for the cell-fusion activity of MHV.","Tsai, C W; Chang, S C; Chang, M F",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10473557/,667

As the largest health system in the region, with 10 hospitals providing obstetrical services, and delivering over 30,000 babies annually, we needed to respond to this crisis in an organized, deliberate fashion. Our hospital footprint for Obstetrics was dramatically reduced to make room for the rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients, and established guidelines were quickly modified to reduce potential staff and patient exposures. New communication strategies were developed to facilitate maternity care across our hospitals, with significantly limited resources in personnel, equipment, and space.

During severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS influenza A, and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks, an increased severity of disease among pregnant women was observed. In some pregnant women, respiratory failure can occur and progress quickly to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a rescue therapy. Despite a lack of current guidelines on the use of ECMO in pregnant or postpartum women, this support therapy is an effective salvage therapy for patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure, and is associated with favorable maternal and fetal outcomes. Herein, the authors report a case of severe COVID-19 disease in a pregnant patient after urgent cesarean delivery, who was treated successfully with ECMO during the postpartum. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered early when conventional therapy is ineffective, and it is essential to refer to ECMO expert centers.","Fiore, Antonio; Piscitelli, Mariantonietta; Adodo, Didier K; Thomas, Charrier; Dessap, Armand Mekontso; Bagate, François; Folliguet, Thierry",J. cardiothoracic vasc. anest,,667

248601,Sunlight ultraviolet radiation dose is negatively correlated with the percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 and four others common human coronaviruses in the U.S,2020,"Aims: COVID-19 has currently emerged as the major global pandemic affecting the lives of people across the globe. It broke out from Wuhan Province of China, first reported to WHO on 31st December 2019 as ""Pneumonia of unknown cause"". Over time more people were infected with this virus, and the only tactic to ensure safety was to take precautionary measures due to the lack of any effective treatment or vaccines. As a result of unavailability of desired efficacy for previously repurposed drugs, exploring novel scaffolds against the virus has become the need of the hour. Main methods: In the present study, 23 new annomontine analogues were designed representing ß-Carboline based scaffolds. A hypothesis on its role as an effective ligand was laid for target-specific binding in SARS-CoV-2. These molecules were used for molecular docking analysis against the multiple possible drug targets using the Maestro Interface. To ensure the drug safety of these molecules ADME/Tox analysis was also performed. Key findings: The molecular docking analysis of the 23 novel molecules indicated the efficiency of these derivates against COVID-19. The efficiency of molecules was computed by the summation of the docking score against each target defined as LigE Score and compared against Hydroxycholoquine as a standard. Based on the docking score, the majority of the annomontine derivatives were found to have increased binding affinity with targets as compared to hydroxycholoquine. Significance: Due to the lack of efficiency, effectiveness, and failure of already repurposed drugs against the COVID-19, the exploration of the novel scaffold that can act as effective treatment is much needed. The current study hence emphasizes the potential of Annomontine based - ß- Carboline derivatives as a potential drug candidate against COVID-19.","Waidha, Kamran; Saxena, Anjali; Kumar, Prashant; Sharma, Sunil; Ray, Devalina; Saha, Biswajit",Heliyon,,667

The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic. Conclusions: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public mental health. In a pandemic or crisis situation, real-time data could be monitored and content-analysed for authorities to promptly address public concerns.","Leung, Janni; Chung, Jack Yiu Chak; Tisdale, Calvert; Chiu, Vivian; Lim, Carmen C W; Chan, Gary",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,667

Herein, we present four COVID-19 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in blood, accounting for 12.12% of 33 detected cases. Rapid deterioration of these cases with septic shock, accompanying with lung CT images enlarged rapidly, decrease of blood oxygen, heart rate drop (with asynchrony of hypoxemia) accompanied with SARS-CoV-2 viremia. It indicates that massive replication and releasing into blood of SARS-CoV-2 and secondary inflammation storm may lead to injury of multiple organs and poor prognosis. So, positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test in blood may be a good forecasting marker of rapid deterioration of COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, clearance of viremia may indicate tendency for recovery.","Tan, Cuiyan; Li, Songbiao; Liang, Yingjian; Chen, Meizhu; Liu, Jing",Braz. j. infect. dis,,667

This study aimed to assess dentists' knowledge, attitude, and perception of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia during the early outbreak period. In addition, infection control measures for dental setting were also assessed. Online questionnaire was distributed to dentists in different regions of Saudi Arabia when COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia was at its beginning. The questionnaire was assessing demographic variables, knowledge, attitude, risk perception, and preparedness towards COVID-19. Questions regarding infection control measures were also included. The correct incubation period of the virus was recognized by 43% of participants. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath were the mostly recognized symptoms for COVID-19 (98.9%, 95.5%, and 93.3% respectively). Participants in age groups &#8805;60, 50-59, and 20-29 years old were more likely to perceive COVID-19 as a very dangerous disease compared to 30-39 and 40-49 age groups. Dentists in Saudi Arabia showed satisfactory knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. Improving dentists' level of knowledge could be achieved through increasing their accessibility to materials provided by dental health care authorities, which specifies the best and safest approaches for dealing with patients during and after the outbreak.","Mustafa, Ruba M; Alshali, Ruwaida Z; Bukhary, Dalea M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,667

Our study aimed to describe the impact of the 3T strategies (preemptive testing, prompt tracing and proper treatment) on the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Seoul. METHODS: The descriptive and explanatory analysis was carried out on critical indicators such as epidemiological characteristics and key duration of patient status change from January 24 to May 2 in Seoul before and after preemptive testing for patients under investigation associated with COVID-19 clusters. RESULTS: Preemptive testing increased the positive test rate (3.9% to 4.2%), an asymptomatic case at diagnosis (16.9% to 30.6%), and reduced the time from symptom onset to quarantine (4.0 to 3.0 days). Prompt tracing decreased unknown sources of infection (6.9% to 2.8%), the mean number of contacts (32.2 to 23.6), and the time-varying reproduction number R(t) (1.3 to 0.6). With proper treatment, only 2 cases of mortality occurred, resulting in a fatality rate of just 0.3%. CONCLUSION: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic lasting 100 days, the effect of the 3T strategies flattened the curve and decreased the time during which infected individuals were contagious, thereby lowering the R(t) below 1 in Seoul.","Park, Yoojin; Huh, In Sil; Lee, Jaekyung; Kang, Cho Ryok; Cho, Sung Il; Ham, Hyon Jeen; Kim, Hea Sook; Kim, Jung Il; Na, Baeg Ju; Lee, Jin Yong",J Korean Med Sci,,667

We aimed to study plasma glucose at admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care referral hospital at Jodhpur, India and its relation with mortality. DESIGN: A hospital-based clinical study of plasma glucose of COVID-19 patients conducted from May 15th to June 30th, 2020 after ethical approval. MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent. Plasma glucose was analyzed by automated analyzer, IL-6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/66, 9%) than those without DM (10/319, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (p<0.0001). Plasma glucose levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors when compared to those who survived (297±117 vs. 131±73; p<0.0001). COVID-19 patients showed increasing mortality with incremental plasma glucose levels. Hazard ratio for mortality was 1.128 (95%CI 0.86-14.860),1.883 (95%CI 0.209-16.970), and 4.005 (95%CI 0.503-32.677) in random plasma glucose group of >100-200, >200-300 and >300mg/dl respectively compared to those with random plasma glucose of <100mg/dl at admission. Plasma glucose was strongly correlated with hsCRP (p<0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.0001).

471479,Not receiving BVA emails?,2020,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a major public health challenge of global concern since December 2019, when the virus was recognized in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China and epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given the novelty of COVID-19 and the lack of specific anti-virus therapies, the current management is essentially supportive. There is an absence of consensus on guidelines or treatment strategies for complex disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which the risk of infections is higher than in the general population. This is due to the overall impairment of the immune system typical of autoimmune diseases, in addition to accumulation of disabilities, and the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and the recommended disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). DMTs have different modes of action, but all modulate and interfere with the patient's immune response, thereby raising concerns about adverse effects, such as an increased susceptibility to infections. In this review, we analyze the evidence for use of DMTs during the current critical period and ratify an algorithmic approach for management to optimize care between keeping DMTs, with their infection hazards, or coming off them, with the risk of disease activation. We also provide an algorithmic approach to the management of breakthrough activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamdy, Sherif M; Abdel-Naseer, Maged; Shehata, Hatem S; Hassan, Amr; Elmazny, Alaa; Shalaby, Nevin M; Abokrysha, Noha T; Kishk, Nirmeen A; Nada, Mona A F; Ahmed, Sandra M; Hegazy, Mohamed I; Mekkawy, Doaa; Mourad, Husam S; Abdelalim, Ahmed; Berger, Thomas",Ther Clin Risk Manag,,667

AIM: To conduct an in-depth investigation into the risk factors for liver injury and into the effective measures to prevent subsequent mortality risk. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on 440 consecutive patients with relatively severe COVID-19 between January 28 and March 9, 2020 at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data on clinical features, laboratory parameters, medications, and prognosis were collected. RESULTS: COVID-19-associated liver injury more frequently occurred in patients aged &#8805; 65 years, female patients, or those with other comorbidities, decreased lymphocyte count, or elevated D-dimer or serum ferritin (P < 0.05). The disease severity of COVID-19 was an independent risk factor for liver injury (severe patients: Odds ratio [OR] = 2.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-4.59; critical patients: OR = 13.44, 95%CI: 7.21-25.97). The elevated levels of on-admission aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin indicated an increased mortality risk (P < 0.001). Using intravenous nutrition or antibiotics increased the risk of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Hepatoprotective drugs tended to be of assistance to treat the liver injury and improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19-associated liver injury. CONCLUSION: More intensive monitoring of aspartate aminotransferase or total bilirubin is recommended for COVID-19 patients, especially patients aged &#8805; 65 years, female patients, or those with other comorbidities.

However, it remains largely unknown whether infected children develop cellular immune memory. MethodsTo determine whether a memory T cell response is being developed as an indicator for long-term immune protection, we performed a longitudinal assessment of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response by IFN-{gamma} ELISPOT and activation marker expression analyses of peripheral blood samples from children and adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. ResultsUpon stimulation of PBMCs with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or overlapping peptides of spike (S-SARS-CoV-2) and nucleocapsid proteins, we found S-SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-{gamma} T cell responses in most infected children (83%) and all adults (100%) that were absent in unexposed controls. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in infected adults, especially in those with moderate symptoms, compared to infected children. The S-SARS-CoV-2 IFN-{gamma} T cell response correlated with S1-SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody concentrations. Predominantly, effector memory CD4+ T cells of a Th1 phenotype were activated upon exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which persisted for 4-8 weeks after symptom onset. We detected very low frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells in these individuals. ConclusionsOur data indicate that an antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cell response is induced in children and adults with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. T cell immunity induced after mild COVID-19 could contribute to protection against re-infection.","Kaaijk, Patricia; Pimentel, Veronica Olivo; Emmelot, Maarten E.; Poelen, Martien; Cevirgel, Alper; Schepp, Rutger M.; Hartog, Gerco den; Reukers, Daphne F.M.; Beckers, Lisa; Beek, Josine van; Els, Cecile A.C.M. van; Meijer, Adam; Rots, Nynke Y.; Wit, Jelle de",,,667
520566,A quick one-step synthesis of luminescent gold nanospheres,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of transverse fractures of the C2 axis body diagnosed on sagittal computed tomography (CT) and to propose new classification and appropriate treatment strategies. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed by enrolling 49 patients (26 men and 23 women) with transverse fractures of the C2 axis body who were treated at four national trauma centers of tertiary university hospitals from January 2000 to December 2017. The mean age of the patients was 60.8 years (ranging from 21 to 90 years). We classified 49 transverse fractures of the C2 body into three types based on fracture trajectories involving superior articular facet (SAF) and lateral cortex (LC) of the C2 body on coronal CT as follows: Type 1, involvement of C2 SAF on both sides; Type 2, unilateral involvement of C2 SAF on one side and LC on the other side; Type 3, involvement of LC on both sides. The characteristics, treatment methods, and results of 49 transverse fractures of the C2 body were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 12.6 months (ranging from 12 to 26 months). RESULTS: Twenty-six (53.1%) patients were Type 1, 21 (42.9%) were Type 2, and 2 (4.0%) were Type 3. Correlation coefficients for intra-observer and inter-observer reliabilities of classification were 0.723 and 0.598 (both, P < 0.001), respectively. About 40.8% (7 Type 1 and 13 Type 2) of the patients had fracture displacement >3 mm; Incidence of fracture displacement >3 mm was higher in Type 2 than Type 1 (61.9% vs 26.9%, P < 0.05). About 79.6% (20 Type 1, 17 Type 2 and 2 Type 3) of the patients were treated conservatively, and 20.4% (6 Type 1 and 4 Type 2) underwent surgery. At last follow-up, 47 out of 49 patients achieved fusion; overall fusion rate was 95.9%. All conservatively treated Type 1 and Type 3 patients achieved fusion. Out of 17 conservatively treated Type 2 patients, 15 achieved fusion but two developed nonunion; however, two nonunion patients opted not to undergo surgery. Subgroup analysis showed that Philadelphia brace caused nonunion significantly in fracture displacement >3 mm compared to Minerva brace/Halovest (100% vs 0%, P < 0.05). All surgically treated Type 1 and 2 patients achieved fusion. In terms of clinical outcomes, neck pain visual analog scale and neck disability index were significantly improved (both, P < 0.01). According to Odom's criteria, 93.9% (46/49) of the patients achieved satisfactory outcomes. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transverse fractures of C2 body can be treated conservatively. However, surgery or rigid Minerva brace/Halovest should be considered for Type 2 transverse fractures of the C2 body with fracture displacement >3 mm.","Kim, Sung-Kyu; Ko, Jong-Hyun; Park, Jong-Beom; Seo, Hyoung-Yeon; Chang, Dong-Gune; Chang, Kibong",Orthopaedic surgery (Online),,667

C-geranylated flavonoids were found to be the major special metabolites in Paulownia flowers and fruits, and 76 C-geranylated flavonoids had been isolated and characterized thus far. Structural variations in Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids are mainly due to the complicated structural modifications in their geranyl substituents. These natural compounds have attracted much attention because of their various biological activities, including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, cytotoxic activity and various enzymatic inhibitions, etc. Among them, diplacone, a major Paulownia component, was considered to have promise for applications in medicine. This paper summarizes the information from current publications on Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids, with a focus on their structural variety, key spectroscopic characteristics, biological activity with structure–activity relationships and application prospects.

Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 fulfills the criteria of the Berlin definition, in a considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19, there is a dissociation between their relatively well-preserved lung mechanics and the severity of hypoxaemia. The extent of pneumococcal related morbidity and mortality is largely unknown. Respiratory comorbidities that increase the risk of severe disease and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis and fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, regardless of aetiology. Pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccinations are useful in preventing a substantial burden of mortality in high-risk populations, while general quarantine and social distancing can reduce the infiltration of the virus within the community. To date, several therapeutic agents have been studied or are currently examined, such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, ritonavir/lopinavir, remdesivir, colchicines and interleukin-6 inhibitors. However, the usage of most of these into clinical practice was not based on randomised clinical trials and their results should be viewed with extreme caution; remdesivir seems to be the more promising option.

The model and associated digital maps were developed as part of Project Salus of the Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, for use by the National Guard and other military personnel in their support mission to hospitals and local jurisdictions impacted by the pandemic. Results: The model affirms ethnicity (Black: OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.61-1.68, American Indian: OR 2.21; 95% CI 2.01-2.42), age over 85 (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.69-1.81), the socio-economic factor of residing in a zip code in the lowest quartile of income (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.21-1.26), ESRD (OR 2.35; 95% CI 2.25-2.45) and chronic lung disease (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.90-2.00) as leading risk factors for Covid-19 hospitalizations, but reveals low risk for COPD (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.13 -1.17) and minimal or no risk for diabetes (OR 1.03; CI 1.01-1.05), CHF (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.12) or hypertension (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98), and demonstrates an association between prior herpes zoster immunization (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.71-0.77), and to a lesser degree prior influenza and pneumococcal vaccines with less severe Covid-19. Conclusions: This multi-factor risk model and derived digital maps can be applied for use by national and local health authorities to augment existing tools for pandemic response, including monitoring of post Covid-19 sequelae, prioritization of Covid-19 vaccine, and vaccine monitoring for both safety and efficacy.","Experton, B.; Tetteh, H.; Lurie, N.; Walker, P.; Carroll, C.; Elena, A.; Hein, C.; Schwendiman, B.; Burrow, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20219816; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20219816v1?rss=1,667

Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course. We examined the expression of colonic ACE2 in 67 adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR. We validated ACE2 protein expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan–Meier estimator. To provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients. Colonic ACE2 expression was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients which was defined as the ACE2-high CD subset. IHC in a sampling of ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of CD diagnosis, and a Cox regression analysis found that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor for surgery (OR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.10–4.26; p = 0.025). Increased intestinal expression of ACE2 is associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients. These data point to the need for molecular stratification that can impact CD disease-related outcomes.","Toyonaga, Takahiko; Araba, Kenza C.; Kennedy, Meaghan M.; Keith, Benjamin P.; Wolber, Elisabeth A.; Beasley, Caroline; Steinbach, Erin C.; Schaner, Matthew R.; Jain, Animesh; Long, Millie D.; Barnes, Edward L.; Herfarth, Hans H.; Isaacs, Kim L.; Hansen, Jonathan J.; Kapadia, Muneera R.; Guillem, José Gaston; Gulati, Ajay S.; Sethupathy, Praveen; Furey, Terrence S.; Ehre, Camille; Sheikh, Shehzad Z.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92979-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34188154/,667

We develop a broad set of hypotheses about cross-channel effects based on channel richness and influence roles (informative, persuasive). To test the hypotheses, we model the effects (own and cross) of channel marketing efforts on shopping outcomes in different channels through a simultaneous equation system. We estimate these models using data from the auto insurance industry that comprises the exclusive agent, the independent agent, the Web, and the call center channels. Our results offer novel insights. They show that cross-channel effects and elasticities are significant and asymmetric. While the effect of marketing efforts in a channel on shopping outcomes in a dissimilar (with a different primary influence role) channel is positive (e.g., exclusive agent, the Web, and the call center channels are complementary), the magnitudes of the cross-channel effects are asymmetric. Similarly, while the effect of marketing efforts in a channel on shopping outcomes in a similar (with the same primary influence role) channel is negative (e.g., independent agent and exclusive agent channels are substitutional), they are also asymmetric. Exclusive agent efforts have a greater negative effect on the outcomes of independent agent efforts than vice versa. Based on the results, we develop a channel influence vs. influenceability analysis tool for managers to better plan their channel efforts. We also illustrate a resource allocation model that shows substantial incremental profits from the reallocation of marketing efforts based on our model with cross-channel effects relative to a model without cross-channel effects.","Shankar, Venkatesh; Kushwaha, Tarun",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016781162030077X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016781162030077X,667
663208,Implications of COVID-19−associated Coagulopathy on Reconstructive Surgery: A Case of Ongoing Tissue Necrosis,2020-12-01,"RNA viruses are the fastest evolving known biological entities. Consequently, the sequence similarity between homologous viral proteins disappears quickly, limiting the usability of traditional sequence-based phylogenetic methods in the reconstruction of relationships and evolutionary history among RNA viruses. Protein structures, however, typically evolve more slowly than sequences, and structural similarity can still be evident, when no sequence similarity can be detected. Here, we used an automated structural comparison method, homologous structure finder, for comprehensive comparisons of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). We identified a common structural core of 231 residues for all the structurally characterized viral RdRps, covering segmented and non-segmented negative-sense, positive-sense, and double-stranded RNA viruses infecting both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. The grouping and branching of the viral RdRps in the structure-based phylogenetic tree follow their functional differentiation. The RdRps using protein primer, RNA primer, or self-priming mechanisms have evolved independently of each other, and the RdRps cluster into two large branches based on the used transcription mechanism. The structure-based distance tree presented here follows the recently established RdRp-based RNA virus classification at genus, subfamily, family, order, class and subphylum ranks. However, the topology of our phylogenetic tree suggests an alternative phylum level organization.","Mönttinen, Heli A.

This helps to limit not only the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections but also the morbidity and mortality associated with it. Different strategies for screening of COVID-19 in containment zones and non-containment areas include testing of symptomatic patients and their contacts in fever clinics, hospital-based testing, testing on demand and population-based screening. The choice of tests like reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen testing (RAT) or antibody test depends upon these strategies and also the turnaround time. Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection. This commentary provides the insights and experiences on COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR. The utility of this test is limited by several false positive, false negative and inconclusive results at early stages of infection, scarcity of reagents and lack of well-equipped labs including trained staff. Moreover, appropriate sample collection and transport, standard laboratory protocols, stringent quality control norms, good quality RNA extraction kits, PCR kits with suitable primers can help in improving accuracy of the test results. A careful assessment of clinical, radiological and molecular findings is required for identifying potential cases of COVID-19.","Munne, Kiran; Bhanothu, Venkanna; Bhor, Vikrant; Patel, Vainav; Mahale, Smita D.; Pande, Shailesh",Virusdisease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969149/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13337-021-00692-5,667

666817,Detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in tissue,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 in Spain has been highly controversial since it is problematic to tell apart deaths having COVID as the main cause from those provoked by the aggravation by the viral infection of other underlying health problems. In addition, overburdening of health system led to an increase in mortality due to the scarcity of adequate medical care, at the same time confinement measures could have contributed to the decrease in mortality from certain causes. Our aim is to compare the number of deaths observed in 2020 with the projection for the same period obtained from a sequence of previous years. Thus, this computed mortality excess could be considered as the real impact of the COVID-19 on the mortality rates. METHODS: The population was split into four age groups, namely: (< 50; 50–64; 65–74; 75 and over). For each one, a projection of the death numbers for the year 2020, based on the interval 2008–2020, was estimated using a Bayesian spatio-temporal model. In each one, spatial, sex, and year effects were included. In addition, a specific effect of the year 2020 was added (""outbreak""). Finally, the excess deaths in year 2020 were estimated as the count of observed deaths minus those projected. RESULTS: The projected death number for 2020 was 426,970 people, the actual count being 499,104; thus, the total excess of deaths was 72,134. However, this increase was very unequally distributed over the Spanish regions. CONCLUSION: Bayesian spatio-temporal models have proved to be a useful tool for estimating the impact of COVID-19 on mortality in Spain in 2020, making it possible to assess how the disease has affected different age groups accounting for effects of sex, spatial variation between regions and time trend over the last few years.","Saavedra, Pedro; Santana, Angelo; Bello, Luis; Pacheco, José-Miguel; Sanjuán, Esther",Popul Health Metr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12963-021-00259-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059063/,667

The personal protective equipment (PPE) undoubtedly provides a shield of protection for the healthcare workers (HCWs) fighting the disease as a valuable asset to the nation. However, there have been various problems associated with the PPE, ranging from its shortage to problems arising from heat, dehydration, etc while wearing them. There is a need to assess these problems faced by HCWs both qualitatively and quantitatively for their timely and effective redressal. Methods An electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among a cohort of HCWs who had performed COVID-19 duties and used PPE kits. The cohort consisted of different categories of doctors, nursing personnel, and other paramedical staff. Results The most common problems associated with using PPE kits was excessive sweating (100%), fogging of goggles, spectacles, or face shields (88%), suffocation (83%), breathlessness (61%), fatigue (75%), headache due to prolonged use (28%), and pressure marks on the skin at one or more areas on repeated use (19%). Occasional problems reported were skin allergy/dermatitis caused by the synthetic material of the PPE kit, face shield impinging onto the neck during intubation, and nasal pain, pain at the root of the pinna, and slipperiness of shoe covers. Various ways and means have been employed by the HCWs to actively address and solve these problems. Conclusion These plausible solutions will definitely help the HCWs to deal with and solve the problems arising out of the PPE use.","Agarwal, Ankur; Agarwal, Sheetal; Motiani, Poonam",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251079/,667

The aim of this study was to report the clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wenzhou city. In this single-centered, retrospective cohort study, we consecutively enrolled 37 RT-PCR confirmed positive severe or critical patients from January 28 to February 16, 2020 in a tertiary hospital. Outcomes were followed up until 28-day mortality. Fifteen severe and 22 critical adult patients with the COVID-19 infection were included. Twenty-six (68.4%) were men. Echocardiography data results suggest that normal or increased cardiac output and diastolic dysfunction are the most common manifestations. Compared with severe patients, critical patients were older, more likely to exhibit low platelet counts and high blood urea nitrogen, and were in hospital for longer. Most patients had organ dysfunction during hospitalization, including 11 (29.7%) with ARDS, 8 (21.6%) with acute kidney injury, 17 (45.9%) with acute cardiac injury, and 33 (89.2%) with acute liver dysfunction. Eighteen (48.6%) patients were treated with high-flow ventilation, 9 (13.8%) with non-invasive ventilation, 10 (15.4%) with invasive mechanical ventilation, 7 (18.9%) with prone position ventilation, 6 (16.2%) with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and 3 (8.1%) with renal replacement therapy. Only 1 (2.7%) patient had died in the 28-day follow up in our study. All patients had bilateral infiltrates on their chest CT scan. Twenty-one (32.3%) patients presented ground glass opacity (GGO) with critical patients more localized in the periphery and the center. The mortality of critical patients with the COVID-19 infection is low in our study. Cardiac function was enhanced in the early stage and less likely to develop into acute cardiac injury, but most patients suffered with acute liver injury. The CT imaging presentations of COVID-19 in critical patients were more likely with consolidation and bilateral lung involvement.","Qian, Song-Zan; Hong, Wan-dong; Lingjie-mao,; Chenfeng-lin,; Zhendong-fang,; Pan, Jing-Ye",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.552002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015108/,667

To study these responses, it is essential to identify protein-derived MHC-II peptide ligands that constitute epitopes for T cell recognition. However, generating cells expressing single MHC-II alleles and isolating these proteins for use in peptide elution or binding studies is time consuming. Here, we express human MHC alleles (HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQ6) as native, noncovalent αβ dimers on yeast cells for direct flow cytometry-based screening of peptide ligands from selected antigens. We demonstrate rapid, accurate identification of DQ6 ligands from pre-pro-hypocretin, a narcolepsy-related immunogenic target. We also identify 20 DR4-binding SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides homologous to SARS-CoV-1 epitopes, and one spike peptide overlapping with the reported SARS-CoV-2 epitope recognized by CD4(+) T cells from unexposed individuals carrying DR4 subtypes.
