360,Predicting Drug-Target Interaction Networks Based on Functional Groups and Biological Features,2010-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Study of drug-target interaction networks is an important topic for drug development. It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the network prediction system thus established is quite promising and encouraging.","He, Zhisong; Zhang, Jian; Shi, Xiao-He; Hu, Le-Le; Kong, Xiangyin; Cai, Yu-Dong; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836373/,163

536,"Peptide model helices in lipid membranes: insertion, positioning, and lipid response on aggregation studied by X-ray scattering",2010-12-23,"Studying membrane active peptides or protein fragments within the lipid bilayer environment is particularly challenging in the case of synthetically modified, labeled, artificial, or recently discovered native structures. For such samples the localization and orientation of the molecular species or probe within the lipid bilayer environment is the focus of research prior to an evaluation of their dynamic or mechanistic behavior. X-ray scattering is a powerful method to study peptide/lipid interactions in the fluid, fully hydrated state of a lipid bilayer. For one, the lipid response can be revealed by observing membrane thickening and thinning as well as packing in the membrane plane; at the same time, the distinct positions of peptide moieties within lipid membranes can be elucidated at resolutions of up to several angstroms by applying heavy-atom labeling techniques. In this study, we describe a generally applicable X-ray scattering approach that provides robust and quantitative information about peptide insertion and localization as well as peptide/lipid interaction within highly oriented, hydrated multilamellar membrane stacks. To this end, we have studied an artificial, designed β-helical peptide motif in its homodimeric and hairpin variants adopting different states of oligomerization. These peptide lipid complexes were analyzed by grazing incidence diffraction (GID) to monitor changes in the lateral lipid packing and ordering. In addition, we have applied anomalous reflectivity using synchrotron radiation as well as in-house X-ray reflectivity in combination with iodine-labeling in order to determine the electron density distribution ρ(z) along the membrane normal (z axis), and thereby reveal the hydrophobic mismatch situation as well as the position of certain amino acid side chains within the lipid bilayer. In the case of multiple labeling, the latter technique is not only applicable to demonstrate the peptide’s reconstitution but also to generate evidence about the relative peptide orientation with respect to the lipid bilayer.

1291,Vaccines for the future: learning from human immunology,2012-02-20,"Conventional vaccines have been extremely successful in preventing infections by pathogens expressing relatively conserved antigens through antibody‐mediated effector mechanisms. Thanks to vaccination some diseases have been eradicated and mortality due to infectious diseases has been significantly reduced. However, there are still many infections that are not preventable with vaccination, which represent a major cause of mortality worldwide. Some of these infections are caused by pathogens with a high degree of antigen variability that cannot be controlled only by antibodies, but require a mix of humoral and cellular immune responses. Novel technologies for antigen discovery, expression and formulation allow now for the development of vaccines that can better cope with pathogen diversity and trigger multifunctional immune responses. In addition, the application of new genomic assays and systems biology approaches in human immunology can help to better identify vaccine correlates of protection. The availability of novel vaccine technologies, together with the knowledge of the distinct human immune responses that are required to prevent different types of infection, should help to rationally design effective vaccines where conventional approaches have failed.","De Gregorio, Ennio; Rappuoli, Rino",Microb Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815775/,163
1540,Choindroitinase ABC I-Mediated Enhancement of Oncolytic Virus Spread and Anti Tumor Efficacy: A Mathematical Model,2014-07-21,"Oncolytic viruses are genetically engineered viruses that are designed to kill cancer cells while doing minimal damage to normal healthy tissue. After being injected into a tumor, they infect cancer cells, multiply inside them, and when a cancer cell is killed they move on to spread and infect other cancer cells. Chondroitinase ABC (Chase-ABC) is a bacterial enzyme that can remove a major glioma ECM component, chondroitin sulfate glycosoamino glycans from proteoglycans without any deleterious effects in vivo. It has been shown that Chase-ABC treatment is able to promote the spread of the viruses, increasing the efficacy of the viral treatment. In this paper we develop a mathematical model to investigate the effect of the Chase-ABC on the treatment of glioma by oncolytic viruses (OV). We show that the model's predictions agree with experimental results for a spherical glioma. We then use the model to test various treatment options in the heterogeneous microenvironment of the brain. The model predicts that separate injections of OV, one into the center of the tumor and another outside the tumor will result in better outcome than if the total injection is outside the tumor. In particular, the injection of the ECM-degrading enzyme (Chase-ABC) on the periphery of the main tumor core need to be administered in an optimal strategy in order to infect and eradicate the infiltrating glioma cells outside the tumor core in addition to proliferative cells in the bulk of tumor core. The model also predicts that the size of tumor satellites and distance between the primary tumor and multifocal/satellite lesions may be an important factor for the efficacy of the viral therapy with Chase treatment.","Kim, Yangjin; Lee, Hyun Geun; Dmitrieva, Nina; Kim, Junseok; Kaur, Balveen; Friedman, Avner",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105445/,163
1569,Rapid RNA Exchange in Aqueous Two-Phase System and Coacervate Droplets,2014-02-28,"Compartmentalization in a prebiotic setting is an important aspect of early cell formation and is crucial for the development of an artificial protocell system that effectively couples genotype and phenotype. Aqueous two-phase systems (ATPSs) and complex coacervates are phase separation phenomena that lead to the selective partitioning of biomolecules and have recently been proposed as membrane-free protocell models. We show in this study through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy that despite the ability of such systems to effectively concentrate RNA, there is a high rate of RNA exchange between phases in dextran/polyethylene glycol ATPS and ATP/poly-L-lysine coacervate droplets. In contrast to fatty acid vesicles, these systems would not allow effective segregation and consequent evolution of RNA, thus rendering these systems ineffective as model protocells.

2300,"Two Multiplex Real-Time PCR Assays to Detect and Differentiate Acinetobacter baumannii and Non- baumannii Acinetobacter spp. Carrying bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23-Like), bla(OXA-40-Like), bla(OXA-51-Like), and bla(OXA-58-Like) Genes",2016-07-08,"Nosocomial infections caused by Acinetobacter spp. resistant to carbapenems are increasingly reported worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter (CRA) is becoming a serious concern with increasing patient morbidity, mortality, and lengths of hospital stay. Therefore, the rapid detection of CRA is essential for epidemiological surveillance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been extensively used for the rapid identification of most pathogens. In this study, we have developed two multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect and differentiate A. baumannii and non-A. baumannii Acinetobacter spp, and common carbapenemase genes, including bla(NDM), bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like), and bla(OXA-58-like). We demonstrate the potential utility of these assays for the direct detection of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA in clinical specimens. Primers were specifically designed, and two multiplex real-time PCR assays were developed: multiplex real-time PCR assay1 for the detection of Acinetobacter baumannii 16S–23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer sequence, the Acinetobacter recA gene, and class-B-metalloenzyme-encoding gene bla(NDM); and multiplex real-time PCR assay2 to detect class-D-oxacillinase-encoding genes (bla(OXA-23-like), bla(OXA-40-like), bla(OXA-51-like),and bla(OXA-58-like)). The assays were performed on an ABI Prism 7500 FAST Real-Time PCR System. CRA isolates were used to compare the assays with conventional PCR and sequencing. Known amounts of CRA cells were added to sputum and fecal specimens and used to test the multiplex real-time PCR assays. The results for target and nontarget amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 μL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r(2) > 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra- and interassay reproducibility were less than 5%. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 400 CRA isolates and their sensitivity for the target DNA in sputum and fecal specimens was 10(2) CFU/mL. Therefore, these novel multiplex real-time PCR assays allow the sensitive and specific characterization and differentiation of bla(NDM)-, bla(OXA-23-like)-, bla(OXA-40-like)-, bla(OXA-51-like)-, and bla(OXA-58-like)-positive CRA, making them potential tools for the direct detection of CRA in clinical specimens and the surveillance of nosocomial infections.","Yang, Qiu; Rui, Yongyu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4938629/,163
2344,Common Genetic Polymorphisms within NFκB-Related Genes and the Risk of Developing Invasive Aspergillosis,2016-08-12,"Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is an opportunistic infection caused by Aspergillus, a ubiquitously present airborne pathogenic mold. A growing number of studies suggest a major host genetic component in disease susceptibility. Here, we evaluated whether 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within NFκB1, NFκB2, RelA, RelB, Rel, and IRF4 genes influence the risk of IA in a population of 834 high-risk patients (157 IA and 677 non-IA) recruited through a collaborative effort involving the aspBIOmics consortium and four European clinical institutions. No significant overall associations between selected SNPs and the risk of IA were found in this large cohort. Although a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)-stratified analysis revealed that carriers of the IRF4(rs12203592T/T) genotype had a six-fold increased risk of developing the infection when compared with those carrying the C allele (OR(REC) = 6.24, 95%CI 1.25–31.2, P = 0.026), the association of this variant with IA risk did not reach significance at experiment-wide significant threshold. In addition, we found an association of the IRF4(AATC) and IRF4(GGTC) haplotypes (not including the IRF4(rs12203592T) risk allele) with a decreased risk of IA but the magnitude of the association was similar to the one observed in the single-SNP analysis, which indicated that the haplotypic effect on IA risk was likely due to the IRF4(rs12203592) SNP. Finally, no evidence of significant interactions among the genetic markers tested and the risk of IA was found. These results suggest that the SNPs on the studied genes do not have a clinically relevant impact on the risk of developing IA.","Lupiañez, Carmen B.; Villaescusa, María T.; Carvalho, Agostinho; Springer, Jan; Lackner, Michaela; Sánchez-Maldonado, José M.; Canet, Luz M.; Cunha, Cristina; Segura-Catena, Juana; Alcazar-Fuoli, Laura; Solano, Carlos; Fianchi, Luana; Pagano, Livio; Potenza, Leonardo; Aguado, José M.; Luppi, Mario; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Einsele, Hermann; Vázquez, Lourdes; Ríos-Tamayo, Rafael; Loeffler, Jurgen; Jurado, Manuel; Sainz, Juan",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4982195/,163

Here I review recent studies on the microbiology of the built environment, organize their findings into 12 major thematic categories, and comment on how these studies have or have not advanced knowledge in each area beyond what we already knew from over 100 years of applying culture-based methods to building samples. I propose that while we have added tremendous complexity to the rich existing knowledge base, the practical implications of this added complexity remain somewhat elusive. It remains to be seen how this new knowledge base will change how we design, build, and operate buildings. Much more research is needed to better understand the complexity with which indoor microbiomes may affect human health in both positive and negative ways.","Stephens, Brent",mSystems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5069963/,163
3200,A road for a promising future for China’s primates: The potential for restoration,2018-05-12,"China is one of the most dynamic countries of the world and it shelters some amazing levels of biodiversity, including some very special primate species. However, primarily as a result of forest loss, most of which occurred in historical times, approximately 70% of China’s primate species have less than 3 000 individuals. Here I evaluate one road for future conservation/development that could produce very positive gains for China’s primates; namely forest restoration. I argue that for a large scale restoration project to be possible two conditions must be met; the right societal conditions must exist and the right knowledge must be in hand. This evaluation suggests that the restoration of native forest to support many of China’s primates holds great potential to advance conservation goals and to promote primate population recovery.","Chapman, Colin A.",Zool Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968852/,163

This reaction proceeds to completion with low catalyst loadings (1 mol %) under mild conditions (60 °C), exceeding previously reported s‐block systems in terms of selectivity, rate, and turnover number (TON). Mechanistic studies by in situ NMR analysis reveals the reaction to be first order in both catalyst and substrate. A reaction mechanism is proposed to account for these findings, with the high TON of the catalyst attributed to the bidentate nature of the ligand, which allows for reversible deprotonation of the substrate and regeneration of 1 as a stable resting state.","Ried, Alexander C.

5144,Genes for two homologous G-protein α subunits map to different human chromosomes,1987,"Many emerging infectious diseases in human populations are associated with zoonotic origins. Attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs, but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in, or are transferred to, human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption. Thus, the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems: the natural habitats and populations of wild animals, and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species. Intensive food animal production systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries. These systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover. Although not typically recognized as such, industrial food animal production generates unique ecosystems—environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations. It is often assumed that confined food animal production reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases. This article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model. Moreover, the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy. In order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial food animal production, private incentives for the implementation of biosecurity must align with public health interests.","Leibler, Jessica H.; Otte, Joachim; Roland-Holst, David; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Soares Magalhaes, Ricardo; Rushton, Jonathan; Graham, Jay P.; Silbergeld, Ellen K.",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087879/,163

Inception cohorts varied; some were mechanically ventilated patients for ≥ 5 days, others were based on a diagnosis of sepsis, organ failure, or severe asthma while others were selected on the basis of exposure to muscle relaxants, or because of participation in muscle biochemistry studies. Weakness was systematically assessed in two of the eight studies, concerning patients with severe asthma, with a reported frequency of 36 and 70 %, respectively. Electrophysiologic and histologic abnormalities consisted of both peripheral nerve and muscle involvement and were frequently reported, even in non-selected ICU patients. In a population of patients mechanically ventilated for more than 5 days, electrophysiologic abnormalities were reported in 76 % of cases. Two studies showed a clinically important increase (5 and 9 days, respectively) in duration of mechanical ventilation and a mortality twice as high in patients with critical illness neuromuscular abnormalities, compared to those without. Conclusions: Prospective studies of ICU-acquired neuromuscular abnormalities include a small number of patients with various electrophysiologic findings but insufficiently reported clinical correlations. Evaluation of risk factors for these disorders and studies examining their contribution to weaning difficulties and long-term disability are needed.","De Jonghe, B.; Cook, D.; Sharshar, T.; Lefaucheur, J.-P.; Carlet, J.; Outin, H.",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094970/,163

Individual differences in disease manifestation and course in intensive care medicine often cannot be explained by known phenotypic risk factors alone. Recent data suggest an association between specific genotypes and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. This includes inflammatory responses (i.e. TNF-α, Il-10), infectious diseases such as pneumonia or meningitis, sepsis, ARDS, as well as the mortality of critically injured patients (polytrauma, severe brain trauma). Continued identification of such allotypes and haplotypes may not only provide insight as to why the response to treatment varies amongst individuals in the intensive care unit, but also may potentially decrease morbidity and mortality through improved risk assessment and the administration of prophylactic therapy.","Ziegeler, S.; Kleinschmidt, S.; Collard, C.

6089,Menno de Jong,2006-12-28,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key regulator of blood pressure. It is known to cleave small peptides, such as angiotensin I and bradykinin and changes their biological activities, leading to upregulation of blood pressure. Here we describe a new activity for ACE: a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity). Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannose-mannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo. Moreover, peptidase-inactivated E414D mutant ACE and also PI-PLC rescued the egg-binding deficiency of Ace knockout sperms, implying that ACE plays a crucial role in fertilization through this activity.

6093,Course correction,2014-11-06,"A brain renin angiotensin system (RAS) and its role in cardiovascular control and fluid homeostasis was at first controversial. This was because a circulating kidney-derived renin angiotensin system was so similar and well established. But, the pursuit of brain RAS has proven to be correct. In the course of accepting brain RAS, high standards of proof attracted state of the art techniques in all the new developments of biolo1gy. Consequently, brain RAS is a robust concept that has enlightened neuroscience as well as cardiovascular physiology and is a model neuropeptide system. Molecular biology confirmed the components of brain RAS and their location in the brain. Transgenic mice and rats bearing renin and extra copies of angiotensinogen genes revealed the importance of brain RAS. Cre-lox delivery in vectors has enabled pinpoint gene deletion of brain RAS in discrete brain nuclei. The new concept of brain RAS includes ACE-2, Ang1–7, and prorenin and Mas receptors. Angiotensin II (ANG II) generated in the brain by brain renin has many neural effects. It activates behavioral effects by selective activation of ANG II receptor subtypes in different locations. It regulates sympathetic activity and baroreflexes and contributes to neurogenic hypertension. New findings implicate brain RAS in a much wider range of neural effects. We review brain RAS involvement in Alzheimer’s disease, stroke memory, and learning alcoholism stress depression. There is growing evidence to consider developing treatment strategies for a variety of neurological disease states based on brain RAS.","Phillips, M.

A recent direction in drug development is the utilization of nucleic acidbased therapeutic molecules, such as antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNA molecules. Some viruses encode their own miRNAs, which play pivotal roles in viral replication and immune evasion strategies. Conversely, viruses that do not encode miRNAs may manipulate host cell miRNAs for the benefits of their replication. miRNAs have therefore become attractive tools for the study of viral pathogenesis. Lately, novel therapeutic strategies based on miRNA technology for the treatment of viral diseases have been progressing rapidly. Although this new generation of molecular therapy is promising, there are still several challenges to face, such as targeting delivery to specific tissues, avoiding off-target effects of miRNAs, reducing the toxicity of the drugs, and overcoming mutations and drug resistance. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the role and therapeutic potential of miRNAs in viral diseases, and discuss the limitations of these therapies, as well as strategies to overcome them to provide safe and effective clinical applications of these new therapeutics.","Hemida, Maged Gomaa; Ye, Xin; Thair, Simone; Yang, Decheng",Mol Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099301/,163
6354,"Synthetic biology, security and governance",2012-11-26,"Public health is politically paradoxical because its core conceptual components — the exercise of public authority and the promotion of population health — stand in practical tension that belies their theoretical promise. Across Western nations, public policymakers stand accused of failing properly to honor and support the crucial contributions that public health makes to the improvement of health outcomes and of overinvesting in acute medical care services, the need for which timely interventions in prevention and health promotion might have averted. The dramatic budgetary discrepancies in Western nations between the massive funds devoted to medical care and the minuscule sums allotted to public health are often taken as evidence that in such matters, political leaders are irrational (or perhaps uninformed, or captured by big-moneyed medical interests) and that good public policy would have epidemiologists and other public health experts running, or at least orchestrating, the show. This paper explores the sources of this tension between population health and political power within the concept of public health and seeks to show why these strains prove to be so durable, indeed irresolvable. The argument and evidence draw largely on the United States, but the supposition — yway, the hope — is that the analysis will also throw light on the politics of public health in other nations.","Brown, Lawrence D.",Public Health Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100188/,163

Patients often suffer from life-threatening infections, suggesting an additional immunodeficiency. We describe for the first time the detailed infectious and immunological phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome. 17/27 analyzed patients suffered from pneumonia, 5/27 from at least one episode of sepsis. Encapsulated bacteria (S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae) were frequently isolated. T-cell immunity showed no gross abnormalities in 14/14 patients and IFNy-secretion upon ConA-stimulation was not decreased in 6/7 patients. In 6/21 patients IgG(2)-deficiency was detected – in 4/21 patients accompanied by IgA-deficiency, 10/21 patients showed low antibody titers against pneumococci. Supra-normal IgG(1)-levels were detected in 11/21 patients and supra-normal IgG(3)-levels were seen in 8/21 patients – in 6 of the patients as combined elevation of IgG(1) and IgG(3). Three of the four patients with IgA/IgG(2)-deficiency developed multiple severe infections. Upon infections pronounced acute-phase responses were common: 7/10 patients showed CRP values above 200 mg/l. Our data for the first time show systematically that increased susceptibility to infections in MECP2 duplication syndrome is associated with IgA/IgG(2)-deficiency, low antibody titers against pneumococci and elevated acute-phase responses. So patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome and low IgA/IgG(2) may benefit from prophylactic substitution of sIgA and IgG.

6706,2017 CIS Annual Meeting: Immune Deficiency & Dysregulation North American Conference,2017-02-10,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (RD). METHODS: Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed. Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD group, defined by a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and the non-RD group. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion (24 vs. 11%; P = 0.007) and major complications (Clavien–Dindo III–V; 31 vs. 15%; P = 0.003) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate (1.9%) and median survival time (6.11 years) were comparable to that of non-RD patients. In contrast, RD patients with Child-Pugh B had a very high 90-day mortality rate (22.2%), and a significant shorter median survival time compared to non-RD patients (1.19 vs. 4.84 years; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Liver resection for Child-Pugh A patients with RD is safe and has comparable oncological outcomes compared to non-RD patients. However, selection of liver resection candidates from Child-Pugh B patients with RD should be stricter.

This article provides an overview of legal topics frequently encountered by the psychiatric consultant. One such area, discussed first in this article, is confidentiality and the management of private patient information. A second common interface between law and psychiatry is in the area of medical decision making. The psychiatric consultant is often asked to evaluate a patient's ability to accept or refuse treatment, and then make a determination of capacity. When the patient cannot give informed consent, an alternate decision maker must be found. Finally, malpractice liability is often a concern for the psychiatric consultant. Overall, psychiatrists should approach the care of patients foremost from a clinical perspective, while understanding the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they practice. In addition, clinicians should be aware of the legal and risk management resources available to them should a complex situation arise.","Brendel, Rebecca W.; Schouten, Ronald",Psychiatr Clin North Am,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103291/,163

7082,Abstracts from USCAP 2020: Medical Renal Pathology (1662-1696),2020-03-05,"In 1929 Kurt von Neergaard performed experiments suggesting the presence of pulmonary surfactant and its relevance to the newborn's first breath. Almost 25 years later, Richard Pattle, John Clements and Chris Macklin, each working on the effects of nerve gases on the lungs, contributed to the understanding of the physiology of pulmonary surfactant. About 5 years later Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead published convincing evidence that preterm neonates dying of hyaline membrane disease (respiratory distress syndrome, RDS) had a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant. The first trials of nebulized synthetic (protein-free) surfactant to prevent RDS were published soon after Patrick Bouvier Kennedy (son of President John F Kennedy) died of this disorder after treatment in Boston. These trials were unsuccessful; however, Goran Enhorning and Bengt Robertson in the early 1970s demonstrated that natural surfactants (containing proteins) were effective in an immature rabbit model of RDS. Soon after this Forrest Adams showed that a natural surfactant was also effective in an immature lamb model. Working with him was Tetsuro Fujiwara who 2 years later, after returning to Japan, published the seminal article reporting the responses of 10 preterm infants with RDS to a bolus of modified bovine surfactant. During the 1980s there were numerous randomized controlled trials of many different natural and synthetic surfactants, demonstrating reductions in pulmonary air leaks and neonatal mortality. Subsequently natural surfactants were shown to be superior to the protein-free synthetic products. Recently there have been a number of randomized trials comparing different natural surfactant preparations. Commercially available bovine surfactants may have similar efficacy but there is some evidence that a porcine surfactant used to treat RDS with an initial dose of 200 mg per kg is more effective than a bovine surfactant used in an initial dose of 100 mg per kg. Bovine and porcine surfactants have not been compared in trials of prophylaxis. Very recently a new synthetic surfactant with a surfactant protein mimic has been compared with other commercially available natural and synthetic surfactants in two trials. The new surfactant may be superior to one of the older protein-free synthetic surfactants but there is no evidence of its superiority over established natural products and it is currently not approved for clinical use. A number of other new synthetic surfactants have been tested in animal models or in treatment of adults with ARDS, but so far there have been no reports of treatment of neonatal RDS. Natural surfactants work best if given by a rapid bolus into the lungs but less invasive methods such as a laryngeal mask, pharyngeal deposition or rapid extubation to CPAP have showed promise. Unfortunately, delivery of surfactant by nebulization has so far been ineffective. Surfactant treatment has been tried in a number of other neonatal respiratory disorders but only infants with meconium aspiration seem to benefit although larger and more frequent doses are probably needed to demonstrate improved lung function. A surfactant protocol based upon early treatment and CPAP is suggested for very preterm infants. Earlier treatment may improve survival rates for these infants; however, there is a risk of increasing the prevalence of milder forms of chronic lung disease. Nevertheless, surfactant therapy has been a major contribution to care of the preterm newborn during the past 25 years.","Halliday, H L",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104445/,163

7276,Microbial Considerations in Genetically Engineered Mouse Research,2006-01-01,"Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin, which is believed to play an important role in the innate immunity against a variety of pathogens. MBL can bind to sugar determinants of a wide variety of microorganisms, neutralize them and inhibit infection by complement activation through the lectin pathway and opsonization by collectin receptors. Given that small intestine is a predominant site of extrahepatic expression of MBL, here we addressed the question whether MBL is involved in mucosal innate immunity. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) genes of mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant mMBL-C-CRD binds to Shigella flexneri 2a in a calcium-dependent manner and that interaction could be blocked by the anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody. mMBL-C-CRD protein could inhibit the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal mucosa, while administration of anti-mMBL-C-CRD antibody caused an increased level of bacteria adhesion in vitro. Administration of recombinant mMBL-C-CRD protein reduced the secretion of IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 from primary intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with S. flexneri 2a. Furthermore, neutralization of MBL activity by anti-MBL-C-CRD resulted in a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a that colonized the intestines of BALB/c mice and attenuated the severity of inflammation seen in the areas of bacterial invasion. These findings suggest that mMBL-C may protect host intestinal mucosa by directly binding to the bacteria.","Zuo, Da-Ming; Zhang, Li-Yun; Lu, Xiao; Liu, Ying; Chen, Zheng-Liang",Int Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108602/,163
7284,Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases: more questions than answers,1997-02-11,"β1,4 Galactosyltransferase (GalT) is a membrane-bound enzyme localized predominantly to the trans-Golgi cisternae. Our previous studies have shown that the transmembrane domain of bovine GalT plays a critical role in Golgi localization (Teasdale,R.D., D'Agostaro,G. and Gleeson,P.A., J. Biol. Chem., 267, 4084–4096, 1992). Here we have compared the localization and post-translational modifications of fulllength bovine GalT with a GalT/hybrid molecule where the transmembrane domain of GalT was replaced with that of the transferrin receptor. GalT/hybrid molecules were expressed on the surface of transfected cells; however, differences were observed in the distribution of the hybrid molecules between transfected COS and murine L cells. In transfected COS cells, the GalT/hybrid protein was expressed efficiently at the cell surface, with little Golgilocalized material, whereas in stable murine L cells, which expressed lower levels of the construct, hybrid molecules were detected both at the cell surface and within the Golgi apparatus. Expression of the GalT constructs in either COS or L cells produced two glycoprotein products which differed in molecular mass by 7 kDa. The difference in size between the two products is due to post-translational modiications which are inhibited by brefeldin A and are therefore likely to occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Very little of the high-molecular-weight species was detected for full-length GalT, whereas it was a major product for the GalT/hybrid protein. Only the higher molecular weight species was expressed at the cell surface. Thus, this additional 7 kDa post-translational modification distinguishes molecules retained within the Golgi apparatus (lower M(r) species) from those transported through the TGN to the cell surface. These studies indicate that (i) the level of expression influences the intracellular distribution of GalT/hybrid molecules and (ii) the localization of full-length GalT involves active retention within the Golgi stack, and not retrieval from later compartments. After treatment of membrane preparations from stable L cell clones with a heterobifunctional cross-linking agent, full-length bovine GalT molecules were found almost exclusively as high-molecular-weight aggregates, suggesting that GalT exists as an oligomer or aggregate. This ability to oligomerize may be a requirement for Golgi retention.","Teasdale, Rohan D.; Matheson, Fiona; Gleeson, Paul A.",Glycobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108631/,163

7860,Predicting Synthetic Gene Networks,2011-07-25,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing lung disease limited to the lungs and associated with the histologic appearance of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on surgical lung biopsy. The estimated prevalence in the United States is between 35,000 and 55,000 cases, and evidence suggests that the prevalence is increasing for IPF. Risk factors associated with pulmonary fibrosis include smoking, environmental exposures, gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly prescribed drugs, diabetes mellitus, infectious agents, and genetic factors. The diagnosis requires a careful history and physical examination, characteristic physiological and radiological studies, and, in some cases, a surgical lung biopsy. The natural history of IPF is not known, but evidence supports the concept of a continuum of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias that may overlap in time. Most patients with IPF succumb to respiratory failure, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, pulmonary embolism, infection, and other health problems. The median survival time for patients with IPF is less than 3 yr. Factors that predict poor outcome include older age, male gender, severe dyspnea, history of cigarette smoking, severe loss of lung function, appearance and severity of fibrosis on radiological studies, lack of response to therapy, and prominent fibroblastic foci on histopathologic evaluation. Conventional therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide) provides only marginal benefit. Lung transplantation should be considered for patients with IPF refractory to medical therapy. In light of the poor prognosis and lack of response to available anti-inflammatory therapy, alternative approaches to therapy are being pursued. Emerging strategies to treat patients with IPF include agents that inhibit epithelial injury or enhance repair, anticytokine approaches, agents that inhibit fibroblast proliferation or induce fibroblast apoptosis, and other novel approaches.","Zisman, David A.; Keane, Michael P.; Belperio, John A.; Strieter, Robert M.; Lynch, Joseph P.",Fibrosis Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120641/,163

The psychometric characteristics of reliability and validity were supported by descriptive and inferential analyses. RESULTS: The final instrument consists of six dimensions with 47 items. The content validity index was 0.90. The overall scale reliability was 0.97 with dimensions range from 0.87 to 0.94. Six domains of core competencies were identified: professionalism; direct care; support and communication; application of professional knowledge; personal traits; and critical thinking and innovation. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide valuable evidence for a psychometrically sound measurement tool, as well as for competency-based nursing curriculum reform.","Yang, Fang Yu; Zhao, Rong Rong; Liu, Yi Si; Wu, Ying; Jin, Ning Ning; Li, Rui Ying; Shi, Shu Ping; Shao, Yue Ying; Guo, Ming; Arthur, David; Elliott, Malcolm",Nurse Educ Today,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130637/,163
8637,Viral vectors for malaria vaccine development,2007-03-30,"The isotype antibody responses to bovine IND P(5), G6 and simian SA11 P(2), G3 rotavirus and SA11 rotavirus proteins (VP4, VP6 and VP7) in serum, colostrum and milk were analysed by ELISA in three groups of vaccinated cows and nonvaccinated controls. Pregnant cows were vaccinated intramuscularly and intramammarily with recombinant baculovirus-expressed SA11 rotavirus VLP (triple-layered virus-like particles containing rotavirus VP2, VP4, VP6 and VP7); CLP (double-layered core-like particles containing rotavirus VP2 and VP6); or inactivated SA11 rotavirus, respectively. Rotavirus antigen titers were highest (30–200-fold) in ELISA in the VLP vaccine compared to the inactivated SA11 vaccine. The IgG1, IgG2 and IgM geometric mean antibody titers (GMT) to rotavirus (titers to bovine rotavirus vs SA11 rotavirus did not differ significantly for any isotype or group) and the IgG2 GMT to VP6 in serum at calving in the vaccinated groups were significantly (P <0.05) higher than in the control group. In colostrum, IgG1 and IgA rotavirus antibody titers were significantly elevated for VLP (IgG1 GMT 832225; IgA GMT 16384), CLP (IgG1 GMT 660561; IgA GMT 10321) and SA11 (IgG1 GMT 131072; IgA GMT 1448) vaccinated cows compared to control cows (IgG1 GMT 11585; IgA GMT 45). The IgG1 and IgA GMT to rotavirus were significantly elevated (6–100-fold) in milk of VLP and CLP vaccinated cows compared to SA11 vaccinated or control cows. The isotype antibody responses to VP6 in serum, colostrum and milk paralleled the responses to rotavirus, but titers were ∼2–10-fold lower. Only cows vaccinated with VLP had significantly enhanced serum, colostral and milk antibody titers to rotavirus VP4 and VP7. These results demonstrate that rotavirus antibody titers in serum, colostrum and milk are significantly enhanced by use of non-infectious VLP, CLP and inactivated SA11 rotavirus vaccines, but the VLP or CLP vaccines induced the highest antibody responses, corresponding to their higher rotavirus antigen titers measured by ELISA.","Fernandez, F.M.; Conner, M.E.; Parwani, A.V.; Todhunter, D.; Smith, K.L.; Crawford, S.E.; Estes, M.K.; Saif, L.J.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131174/,163

Twenty-eight weeks after vaccination, the birds were challenged intraocularly with the Arkansas strain of infectious bronchitis virus (aibv) to determine the effects of heterologous virus exposure on egg production, egg quality and serum antibody response of the birds. The challenged hens laid significantly (P<0·005) fewer eggs than the unchallenged layers. Eggs laid by the unchallenged groups weighed significantly more (P<0·005) than those laid by the challenged groups. Further, the internal quality (Haugh units) and shell quality of eggs laid by the aibv-challenged hens was significantly (P<0·005) inferior to those from the unchallenged hens. In addition, the aibv-challenged hens laid more soft-shell, misshapen and small eggs than the unchallenged hens. The Arkansas serum haemagglutination inhibition (aibv-hi) titres of aibv challenged birds increased up to four weeks after challenge. The corresponding mibv haemagglutination-inhibition (mibv-hi) titres decreased during the same period. The study indicates that killed mibv vaccine offered no protection to birds exposed to heterologous aibv.","MUNEER, M.A.; NEWMAN, J.A.; HALVORSON, D.A.; SIVANANDAN, V.; NAGARAJA, K.V.; COON, C.N.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131188/,163
8771,Chapter 18 Expression of nitric oxide synthase-2 in glia associated with CNS pathology,2008-04-10,"Sialic acids (Sias) are terminal components of many glycoproteins and glycolipids especially of higher animals. In this exposed position they contribute significantly to the structural properties of these molecules, both in solution and on cell surfaces. Therefore, it is not surprising that Sias are important regulators of cellular and molecular interactions, in which they play a dual role. They can either mask recognition sites or serve as recognition determinants. Whereas the role of Sias in masking and in binding of pathogens to host cells has been documented over many years, their role in nonpathological cellular interaction has only been shown recently. The aim of this chapter is to summarize our knowledge about Sias in masking, for example, galactose residues, and to review the progress made during the past few years with respect to Sias as recognition determinants in the adhesion of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, and particularly as binding sites for endogenous cellular interaction molecules. Finally, perspectives for future research on these topics are discussed.","Kelm, Sørge; Schauer, Roland",Int Rev Cytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133163/,163
8784,Cocaine: On-line analysis of an accumbens amine neural basis for psychomotor behavior,2003-01-22,"The effect of subcutaneous (SC) cocaine (20 mg/kg) on synaptic concentrations of the biogenic amines, dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) in Ventral Tegmental Area, (VTA-[A(10)]) was studied in freely moving and behaving rats (rattus norvegicus) with in vivo voltammetry (in vivo electrochemistry). The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT (p < 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p < 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p < 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.","Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacol Biochem Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133216/,163

Consequently, investigating its regulation and disease‐associated alterations can reveal novel therapeutic approaches to fight human diseases, such as cancer or viral infection. The characterization of the nuclear pore complex, the identification of transport signals and transport receptors, as well as the characterization of the Ran system (providing the energy source for efficient cargo transport) has greatly facilitated our understanding of the components, mechanisms and regulation of the nucleo‐cytoplasmic transport of proteins in our cells.

Also antibodies could be demonstrated in body fluids from 21 field cases where FIP had been diagnosed by clinical and post mortem examination and in most sera (91%) from catteries with a FIP history. In randomly selected open population samples 16% of seropositive animals were detected whereas none of 109 sera from a barrier‐contained closed breeding colony gave a positive reaction. No TGE neutralizing antibodies could be found in our sera and peritoneal fluids. The possibility of an antigenic relationship between FIP and TGE viruses is discussed.

Considering bacteria, fungi, and viruses, this study reviews the dynamic processes that govern indoor concentrations and fates of biological particulate material. Bioaerosol behavior is strongly coupled to particle size; this study emphasizes the range 0.1–10 μm in aerodynamic diameter. The principle of material balance allows concentrations to be determined from knowledge of important source and removal processes. Sources reviewed here include outdoor air introduced by air exchange plus indoor emission from occupants, occupant activities, and moldy materials. Important mechanisms that remove bioaerosols from indoor air include air exchange, deposition onto indoor surfaces, and active filtration. The review summarizes knowledge about size‐dependent particle deposition in different regions of the respiratory tract, techniques for measuring indoor bioaerosols, and evidence for diseases caused by airborne exposure to bioaerosols.

The invasion of human metastatic tumor cells (SN12M renal‐cell carcinoma, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and A375M melanoma) into Matrigel‐coated filters was inhibited by an anti‐CD 13 MAb, WM15, in a concentration‐dependent manner. However, this MAb did not have any effect on tumor‐cell adhesion and migration to the extracellular matrices, which may be involved in tumor‐cell invasion. MAb WM15 inhibited the degradation of type‐IV collagen by tumor cells in a concentration‐dependent manner. We also found that WM15 inhibited hydrolysing activities towards substrates of aminopeptidases in 3 different tumor cells. Since our previous study indicated that bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, was able to inhibit tumor‐cell invasion, as well as aminopeptidase activities of murine and human metastatic tumor cells, cell‐surface aminopeptidase N/CD13 may be partly involved in the activation mechanism for type‐IV collagenolysis to achieve tumor‐cell invasion, and anti‐CD13 MAb WM15 may inhibit tumor‐cell invasion through a mechanism involving its inhibitory action on the aminopeptidase N in tumor cells.","Saiki, Ikuo; Yoneda, Junya; Azuma, Ichiro; Fujii, Hideji; Abe, Fuminori; Nakajima, Motowo; Tsuruo, Takashi",Int J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165932/,163
10052,Nitrogen fixing bacteria in the family Acetobacteraceae and their role in agriculture,2015-03-03,"Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) is an infectious disease responsible for severe economic losses for various cyprinid species, particularly common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio). The causative agent is the SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, Rhabdoviridae family, and a List 1 pathogen notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health. This study describes the diagnosis of an SVCV pathogen isolated in October 2015 from wild common carp inhabiting a natural lagoon in central Mexico. While neither an epidemic nor fish mortalities were reported, the collected killed specimens exhibited clinical signs of disease (e.g., exopthalmia, moderate abdominal distension and haemorrhaging, as well as internal haemorrhages and adhesions). Histological results of injuries were consistent with the pathology caused by SVCV. This finding was supported by the isolation of a virus in EPC and BF‐2 cells and subsequent RT‐PCR confirmation of SVCV. The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon. The status of this virus is also unknown for other bodies of water within this region.","Ortega, Cesar; Cañas‐Lopez, Leticia; Irgang, Rute; Fajardo, Raúl; Poblete‐Morales, Matías; Valladares-Carranza, Benjamin; Tapia‐Cammas, Diana; Avendaño‐Herrera, Ruben",J Fish Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166541/,163

10089,Characterization of precipitates size distribution: validation of low‐voltage STEM,2008-09-25,"Two cats with intestinal malabsorption developed a hemorrhagic diathesis. Although unsubstantiated, the probable cause of bleeding was a chronic malabsorption of fat and the fat‐soluble vitamin K. When treated_with vitamin Ki per os, one cat's clotting times were only partially corrected. Since vitamin K, is actively absorbed in the proximal small intestine, the incomplete response of this case to orally administered vitamin K, was predictable. The infrequent occurrence of bleeding in animals with malabsorption is, in part, attributable to the ileal and colonic absorption of bacterially derived vitamin K(2). For this reason, nonspecific use of antibiotics in these animals is contraindicated. Since long‐chain, polyunsaturated fats impair vitamin K absorption, dietary fat given to animals with malasorption should be restricted to medium‐ and short‐chain, saturated fats. Vitamin K should be administered subcutaneously to these animals if prolonged clotting times or active bleeding is present, and routinely prior to surgery. Oral supplementation with vitamin K(3), which is absorbed in the colon and less lipid soluble than vitamin Ki, should be given to animals with malabsorption that are maintained as outpatients. Adequate dosage levels of vitamin K(3), however, are yet to be established for the cat, and dose‐dependent hemolytic anemia is a probable toxic manifestation.","Edwards, David F.; Russell, Robert G.",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166802/,163

Chronic stress and depression can result in general dysregulation of the immune system, of both cellular and humoral pathways, which may contribute to pathogenic infection and concomitant periodontal tissue destruction. In general, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that stress can modify the host defense and progression of periodontal infections in patients susceptible to periodontitis. However, substantial evidence also indicates that these conditions can mediate risk for disease, including periodontitis, through changes in health‐related behaviors, such as oral hygiene, smoking and diet. The unequivocal interpretation of studies has also been hampered, in part, by issues related to conceptualization of stress and depression, as well as commonly associated comorbidities, such as diabetes, that can modify the onset and progression of periodontal disease. In addition, stress and depression appear to fall into a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe, involving a complex interaction of genetic background, coping strategies and environment. Differences in the conceptualization of stress and depression are probably important in assessing associations with other biologic and clinical measures. Future studies are necessary to clarify the complex interactions of chronic stress and depression in periodontal diseases.","Warren, Kimberly R.; Postolache, Teodor T.; Groer, Maureen E.; Pinjari, Omar; Kelly, Deanna L.; Reynolds, Mark A.",Periodontol 2000,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167640/,163

Being a natural fusion of a methyltransferase (MTase) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), NS5 is the most conserved flavivirus protein and an important antiviral target. Previously reported NS5 structures represented by those from the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV3) exhibit two apparently different global conformations, defining two sets of intra-molecular MTase-RdRP interactions. However, whether these NS5 conformations are conserved in flaviviruses and their specific functions remain elusive. Here we report two forms of DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) NS5 crystal structures representing two conformational states with defined analogies to the JEV-mode and DENV3-mode conformations, respectively, demonstrating the conservation of both conformation modes and providing clues for how different conformational states may be interconnected. Data from in vitro polymerase assays further demonstrate that perturbing the JEV-mode but not the DENV3-mode intra-molecular interactions inhibits catalysis only at initiation, while the cell-based virological analysis suggests that both modes of interactions are important for virus proliferation. Our work highlights the role of MTase as a unique intra-molecular initiation factor specifically only through the JEV-mode conformation, providing an example of conformation-based crosstalk between naturally fused protein functional modules.","Wu, Jiqin; Ye, Han-Qing; Zhang, Qiu-Yan; Lu, Guoliang; Zhang, Bo; Gong, Peng",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219791/,163

Cinacalcet has been widely used in secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, but the use of cinacalcet in PHPT is less clear. METHODS: Searches were conducted in Medline and Embase for cinacalcet use in PHPT from induction to 10 April 2020. Articles and conferences abstracts describing the use of cinacalcet for PHPT in prospective or retrospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials restricted to English language only. We initially identified 1301 abstracts. Each article went extraction by two blinded authors on a structured proforma. Continuous outcomes were pooled with weight mean difference (WMD). Quality of included articles was assessed with Newcastle Ottwa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles were included. Normalization rate of serum Ca levels was reported at 90% (CI: 0.82 to 0.96). Serum levels of Ca and PTH levels were significantly reduced (Ca, WMD: 1.647, CI: −1.922 to −1.371; PTH, WMD: −31.218, CI: −41.671 to −20.765) and phosphate levels significantly increased (WMD: 0.498, CI: 0.400 to 0.596) after cinacalcet therapy. The higher the baseline Ca levels, the greater Ca reduction with cinacalcet treatment. Age and gender did not modify the effect of cinacalcet on serum Ca levels. CONCLUSION: The results from the meta-analysis support the use of cinacalcet as an alternative or bridging therapy to treat hypercalcemia in people with PHPT.","Ng, Cheng Han; Chin, Yip Han; Tan, Marcus Hon Qin; Ng, Jun Xuan; Yang, Samantha Peiling; Kiew, Jolene Jiayu; Khoo, Chin Meng",Endocr Connect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7424342/,163

However, the mechanism of leptin resistance remains obscure. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to produce ceramide, which plays an important role in the progression of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated whether ASM could regulate leptin resistance in vascular endothelial cells. We induced endothelial leptin resistance in rat aortic endothelial cells through treatment with palmitic acid (0.3 mM) or knockdown of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb), which resulted in the increase of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 expression, the decrease of Ob-Rb expression, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation at Tyr705. We found that these indicators of leptin resistance were reversed by knockdown of ASM or by the selective ASM inhibitors amitriptyline (AMI) and imipramine (IMI). Supplementation of ceramide inhibited Ob-Rb expression and STAT3 phosphorylation by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ASM enhanced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity and NO production, as well as the Akt phosphorylation at ser473, which was regulated by STAT3. High-fat diet (HFD) feeding-induced leptin resistance in rats in vivo; administration of AMI and IMI (10 mg· kg(−1) per day, intraperitoneally, for 2 weeks) increased the release of endothelial NO to relieve the vasodilatory response and improved the endothelial leptin resistance in the aorta of HFD-fed rats. These results suggest that ASM downregulation reverses endothelial leptin resistance, and consequently improves vascular endothelial dysfunction. This study highlighted ASM as a potential therapeutic target for endothelial leptin resistance.","Cai, Bei-bo; Lu, Yi-ni; Xu, Ming",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471453/,163

13948,Publisher Correction: Ecological and evolutionary approaches to managing honeybee disease,2017-12-04,"Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (LILRs), also known as CD85 and immunoglobulin-like transcripts (ILTs), play pivotal roles in regulating immune responses. These receptors define an immune checkpoint that immune therapy can target. Through cis or trans interactions with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, the two most abundantly expressed inhibitory LILRs, LILRB1, and LILRB2 (LILRB1/2, also known as CD85j/d and ILT2/4), are involved in immunotolerance in pregnancy and transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and immune evasion by tumors. Although the discrete domains of LILRB1/2 are clear, the assembly mode of the four extracellular Ig-like domains (D1, D2, D3, and D4) remains unknown. Previous data indicate that D1D2 is responsible for binding to HLA class I (HLA-I), but the roles of D3D4 are still unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the four Ig-like domain LILRB2 and four-domain LILRB1 in complex with HLA-G1. The angles between adjacent domains and the staggered assembly of the four domains suggest limited flexibility and limited plasticity of the receptors during ligand binding. The complex structure of four-domain LILRB1 and HLA-G1 supports the model that D1D2 is responsible for HLA-I binding, while D3D4 acts as a scaffold. Accordingly, cis and trans binding models for HLA-I binding to LILRB1/2 are proposed. The geometries of LILRB1/2 in complex with dimeric and monomeric HLA-G1 suggest the accessibility of the dimeric receptor, which in turn, transduces more inhibitory signals. The assembly of LILRB1/2 and its binding to HLA-G1 could aid in the design of immune regulators and benefit immune interference.","Wang, Qihui; Song, Hao; Cheng, Hao; Qi, Jianxun; Nam, Gol; Tan, Shuguang; Wang, Junzhi; Fang, Min; Shi, Yi; Tian, Zhigang; Cao, Xuetao; An, Zhiqiang; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609294/,163

A systematic search of two databases was performed for studies published up to 19 August 2020, reporting the OS of patients with DM2 or high blood sugar level and GBM and the clinical risk of diabetic patients for development of GBM. According to PRISMA guidelines, we included a total of 20 papers reporting clinical data of patients with GBM and diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. The aim of this review was to investigate the effect of DM2, hyperglycemia and metformin on OS of patients with GBM. In addition, we evaluated the effect of these factors on the risk of development of GBM. This review supports accumulating evidence that hyperglycemia, rather than DM2, and elevated BMI are independent risk factors for poor outcome and shorter OS in patients with GBM. GBM patients with normal weight compared to obese, and diabetic patients on metformin compared to other therapies, seems to have a longer OS. Further studies are needed to understand better these associations.","Montemurro, Nicola; Perrini, Paolo; Rapone, Biagio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698156/,163
14289,Zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line primordium migration requires interactions between a superficial sheath of motile cells and the skin,2020-11-25,"Tristeza is a highly destructive disease of citrus caused by the phloem-limited, flexuous filamentous Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) in the genus Closterovirus and the family Closteroviridae. It has been a major constraint for higher productivity and has destroyed millions of citrus trees globally. CTV is graft transmissible and spread through use of virus infected nursery plants. Therefore, virus detection by using specific and reliable diagnostic tools is very important to mitigate disease outbreaks. Currently, the standard molecular techniques for CTV detection include RT-PCR and RT-qPCR. These diagnostic methods are highly sensitive but time consuming, labor intensive and require sophisticated expensive instruments, thus not suitable for point-of-care use. In the present study, we report the development of a rapid, sensitive, robust, reliable, and highly specific reverse transcription-RPA technique coupled with a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (CTV-RT-RPA-LFICA). RT-RPA technique was standardized to amplify the coat protein gene of CTV (CTV-p25) and detect double labeled amplicons on a sandwich immunoassay by designing specific labeled primer pair and probe combinations. The optimally performing primer set (CTRPA-F1/CTRPA-R9-Btn) and the corresponding TwistAmp nfo probe (CTRPA-Probe) was optimized for temperature and reaction time using purified cDNA and viral RNA as template. The sensitivity of the developed assay was compared with other detection techniques using in vitro-transcribed RNA. The efficacy and specificity of the assay was evaluated using CTV positive controls, healthy samples, field grown citrus plants of unknown status, and other virus and bacterial pathogens that infect citrus plants. The RT-RPA-LFICA was able to detect ≤ 141 fg of RNA when cDNA used as a template. The assay detected ≤ 0.23 ng/µl of CTV RNA when directly used as template without cross-reactivity with other citrus pathogens. Best results were achieved at the isothermal temperature of 40 °C within 15–20 min. The study demonstrated that RT-RPA-LFICA has potential to become an improved detection technique for end users in bud-wood certification and quarantine programs and a promising platform for rapid point-of-care diagnostics for citrus farmers and small nurseries in low resource settings.","Ghosh, Dilip Kumar; Kokane, Sunil B.; Gowda, Siddarame",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693335/,163
14309,A physical mechanism of TANGO1-mediated bulky cargo export,2020-11-10,"Neurons in primate V4 exhibit various types of selectivity for contour shapes, including curves, angles, and simple shapes. How are these neurons organized in V4 remains unclear. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and two-photon calcium imaging, we observed submillimeter functional domains in V4 that contained neurons preferring curved contours over rectilinear ones. These curvature domains had similar sizes and response amplitudes as orientation domains but tended to separate from these regions. Within the curvature domains, neurons that preferred circles or curve orientations clustered further into finer scale subdomains. Nevertheless, individual neurons also had a wide range of contour selectivity, and neighboring neurons exhibited a substantial diversity in shape tuning besides their common shape preferences. In strong contrast to V4, V1 and V2 did not have such contour-shape-related domains. These findings highlight the importance and complexity of curvature processing in visual object recognition and the key functional role of V4 in this process.","Tang, Rendong; Song, Qianling; Li, Ying; Zhang, Rui; Cai, Xingya; Lu, Haidong D",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7707829/,163

The nucleic acids, DNA and RNA are arguably life’s most important, acting as the stores and translators of genetic information contained in their base sequences, which ultimately manifest themselves in the amino acid sequences of proteins. But just what is it about their structures; an aromatic heterocyclic base appended to a (five-atom ring) sugar-phosphate backbone that enables them to carry out these functions with such high fidelity? In the past three decades, leading chemists have created in their laboratories synthetic analogues of nucleic acids which differ from their natural counterparts in three key areas as follows: (a) replacement of the phosphate moiety with an uncharged analogue, (b) replacement of the pentose sugars ribose and deoxyribose with alternative acyclic, pentose and hexose derivatives and, finally, (c) replacement of the two heterocyclic base pairs adenine/thymine and guanine/cytosine with non-standard analogues that obey the Watson–Crick pairing rules. This manuscript will examine in detail the physical and chemical properties of these synthetic nucleic acid analogues, in particular on their abilities to serve as conveyors of genetic information.

Book clubs have been used outside of medicine as a professional development tool. We sought to create and evaluate a virtual professional development book club for emergency medicine interns. METHODS: We designed and implemented a virtual professional development book club during intern orientation. Afterward, participants completed an evaluative survey consisting of Likert and free-response items. Descriptive statistics were reported. We analyzed free-response data using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Of 15 interns who participated in the book club, 12 (80%) completed the evaluative survey. Most (10/12; 83.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that the book club showed them the importance of professional development as a component of residency training and helped them reflect on their own professional (11/12; 91.7%) and personal development (11/12; 91.7%). Participants felt the book club contributed to bonding with their peers (9/12; 75%) and engagement with the residency program (9/12; 75%). Our qualitative analysis revealed five major themes regarding how the book club contributed to professional and personal development: alignment with developmental stage; deliberate practice; self-reflection; strategies to address challenges; and communication skills. CONCLUSION: A virtual book club was feasible to implement. Participants identified multiple ways the book club positively contributed to their professional development. These results may inform the development of other book clubs in graduate medical education.","Jordan, Jaime; Bavolek, Rebecca A.; Dyne, Pamela L.; Richard, Chase E.; Villa, Stephen; Wheaton, Natasha",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806317/,163

Controlling plant pathogens has become an important strategy to ensure food security. Although chemical control is an effective disease control strategy, its application is limited by many problems, such as environmental impact and pathogen resistance. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to develop more chemical reagents with new functional mechanisms. Due to their special living environment, marine organisms have produced a variety of bioactive compounds with novel structures, which have the potential to develop new fungicides. In the past two decades, screening marine bioactive compounds to inhibit plant pathogens has been a hot topic. In this review, we summarize the screening methods of marine active substances from plant pathogens, the identification of marine active substances from different sources, and the structure and antibacterial mechanism of marine active natural products. Finally, the application prospect of marine bioactive substances in plant disease control was prospected.","Li, Xiaohui; Zhao, Hejing; Chen, Xiaolin",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912171/,163
15746,A Conversation with Molly Stevens,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND: In 2018, the World Health Assembly mandated Member States to take action on rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which persists in countries with weak health systems. We conducted an assessment of the current state of RHD-related healthcare in Uganda. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This was a mixed-methods, deductive simultaneous design study conducted in four districts of Uganda. Using census sampling, we surveyed health facilities in each district using an RHD survey instrument that was modeled after the WHO SARA tool. We interviewed health workers with experience managing RHD, purposively sampling to ensure a range of qualification and geographic variation. Our final sample included 402 facilities and 36 health workers. We found major gaps in knowledge of clinical guidelines and availability of diagnostic tests. Antibiotics used in RHD prevention were widely available, but cardiovascular medications were scarce. Higher levels of service readiness were found among facilities in the western region (Mbarara district) and private facilities. Level III health centers were the most prepared for delivering secondary prevention. Health worker interviews revealed that limited awareness of RHD at the district level, lack of diagnostic tests and case management registries, and absence of clearly articulated RHD policies and budget prioritization were the main barriers to providing RHD-related healthcare. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Uganda’s readiness to implement the World Health Assembly RHD Resolution is low. The forthcoming national RHD strategy must focus on decentralizing RHD diagnosis and prevention to the district level, emphasizing specialized training of the primary healthcare workforce and strengthening supply chains of diagnostics and essential medicines.","Ndagire, Emma; Kawakatsu, Yoshito; Nalubwama, Hadija; Atala, Jenifer; Sarnacki, Rachel; Pulle, Jafesi; Kyarimpa, Rakeli; Mwima, Rachel; Kansiime, Rosemary; Okello, Emmy; Lwabi, Peter; Beaton, Andrea; Sable, Craig; Watkins, David",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909659/,163

Delay or inadequate management will inevitably lead to hypoperfusion, tissue hypoxia or edema, and fluid overload, leading eventually to multiple organ failure, seriously affecting outcomes. According to a large international survey (FENICE study), physicians frequently use inadequate indices to guide fluid management in intensive care units. Goal-directed and “restrictive” infusion strategies have been recommended by guidelines over “liberal” approaches for several years. Unfortunately, these “fixed regimen” treatment protocols neglect the patient’s individual needs, and what is shown to be beneficial for a given population may not be so for the individual patient. However, applying multimodal, contextualized, and personalized management could potentially overcome this problem. The aim of this review was to give an insight into the pathophysiological rationale and clinical application of this relatively new approach in the hemodynamic management of septic patients.","Virág, Marcell; Leiner, Tamas; Rottler, Mate; Ocskay, Klementina; Molnar, Zsolt",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926902/,163

The current best phenomenological estimate has an uncertainty comparable to the experimental one and the error is completely dominated by hadronic effects: the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering contribution. Both are accessible via lattice simulations and a reduction of the error by a factor 4 is required in view of the forthcoming experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC whose results, expected in the next few years, should reduce the experimental precision down to the level of 0.14 ppm. In this article, I review the status of lattice calculations of those quantities, starting with the HVP. This contribution has now reached sub-percent precision and requires a careful understanding of all sources of systematic errors. The HLbL contribution, that is much smaller, still contributes significantly to the error. This contribution is more challenging to compute, but rapid progress has been made on the lattice in the last few years.","Gérardin, Antoine",Eur Phys J A Hadron Nucl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023536/,163

Currently used LFAs predominantly use antibodies. However, the high inter-batch variations, error margin and storage requirements of the conventional antibody-based LFAs significantly impede its applications. The recent progress in aptamer technology provides an opportunity to combine the potential of aptamer and LFA towards building a promising platform for highly efficient point-of-care device development. Over the past decades, different forms of aptamer-based LFAs have been introduced for broad applications ranging from disease diagnosis, agricultural industry to environmental sciences, especially for the detection of antibody-inaccessible small molecules such as toxins and heavy metals. But commercial aptamer-based LFAs are still not used widely compared with antibodies.

The prevalence of psychiatric disorders might be underestimated. Emerging evidence highlights the role of immune response as a key factor in MDs. Immunological biomarkers seem to be related to illness progression and to treatment effectiveness; several studies suggest strong associations among IL-6, TNFa, S100b, IL 1b, and PCR with affective or schizophrenic disorders. The purpose of this review is to examine and to understand the possible link between mental disorders and interleukin 33 to clarify the role of this axis in the immune system. We found 13 research papers that evaluated interleukin 33 or interleukin 31 levels in subjects affected by mental disorders. Eight studies investigated cytokines in affective disorders. Three studies measured levels of IL-33 in schizophrenia and two studies focused on patients affected by autism spectrum disorders. Alterations in brain structure and neurodevelopmental outcome are affected by multiple levels of organization. Disorders of the autoimmune response, and of the IL-33/31 axis, may therefore be one of the factors involved in this process. These results support the evidence that alarmins, particularly the IL-33/31 axis, need more consideration among researchers and practitioners.","Pandolfo, Gianluca; Genovese, Giovanni; Casciaro, Marco; Muscatello, Maria Rosaria Anna; Bruno, Antonio; Pioggia, Giovanni; Gangemi, Sebastiano",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8066291/,163

Food scientists and researchers are currently developing innovative approaches to improve their physical and sensory characteristics in plant-based analogs. In terms of plant-based cheese substitutes (PBCS), soy is the most commonly used plant-based protein but is associated with undesirable sensory attributes (i.e., beany and gritty). In order to determine if the approaches result in a significant improvement in sensory quality and liking, sensory evaluation is employed. The aim of this review is to summarize the original literature (n = 12) relating to 100% PBCS which utilizes sensory evaluation methods. Overall, a major theme identified in this review is the innovative strategies used to increase acceptance of PBCS, whether products are aimed at improving existing non-dairy-based cheese formulations or to more closely mimic a conventional dairy-based cheese product. Studies demonstrate processing and fermentation of soybeans and blending of non-dairy milks are potential ways to improve consumer liking of PBCS. A secondary focus is to discuss the current sensory methodology carried out in the reviewed literature. Future studies should consider using more specific measures of flavor and mouthfeel, integrate evaluation of consumer liking with instrumental textural methods, and use a larger more diverse group of consumers. The outcome of this review is to highlight the importance of integrating sensory science in order to help facilitate the improvement of the sensory and quality attributes of PBCS and streamline product development.","Short, Erin C.; Kinchla, Amanda J.; Nolden, Alissa A.",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8066998/,163

18217,Application of Advanced Nanomaterials for Kidney Failure Treatment and Regeneration,2021-05-29,"With the aggravation of rural aging, the well-being and self-rated health level of older people in rural communities are significantly lower than those in urban communities. Past studies hold that mobility is essential to the quality of life of the elderly, and well-being depends on their own adaptation strategies in the built environment. Therefore, this study combines three key factors related to active aging: environment, health and mobility, and assumes that the elderly with good health status will have environmental proactivity and a wider range of daily mobility in a poor rural built environment. This study attempts to track daily mobility by using a space–time path method in time geography and then to explore the relationship between outdoor mobility and older people’s self-rated health. A 1-week mobility path survey for 20 senior citizens of Xishi Village, a typical rural village in Taiwan, was conducted by wearing a GPS sports watch. A questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews were done to provide more information about the seniors’ personal backgrounds and lifestyles. The results show that when the built environment is unfit to the needs of daily activities, half of the participants can make adjustment strategies to go beyond the neighborhoods defined by administrative units. Correlation analysis demonstrated that mental health is associated with daily moving time and distance. In addition, men have higher self-rated health scores than women, and there are significant statistical differences between married and widowed seniors in daily outing time and distance. This exploratory study suggests that in future research on rural health and active aging in rural areas, understanding the daily outdoor mobility of the elderly can help to assess their health status and living demands and quickly find out whether there is a lack of rural living services or environmental planning.","Chao, Tzuyuan Stessa; Jiang, Xiaoqin; Sun, Yi; Yu, Jheng-Ze",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8198793/,163

While deprescribing may reduce inappropriate medicine use, its effect on clinical end points remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical implications of discontinuing the use of statins while maintaining other drugs in a cohort of older patients receiving polypharmacy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective, population-based cohort study included the 29 047 residents in the Italian Lombardy region aged 65 years or older who were receiving uninterrupted treatment with statins, blood pressure–lowering, antidiabetic, and antiplatelet agents from October 1, 2013, until January 31, 2015, with follow-up through June 30, 2018. Data were collected using the health care utilization database of Lombardy region in Italy. Data analysis was conducted from March to November 2020. EXPOSURES: Cohort members were followed up to identify those who discontinued statins. Among this group, those who maintained other therapies during the first 6 months after statin discontinuation were 1:1 propensity score matched with patients who discontinued neither statins nor other drugs. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The pairs of patients discontinuing and maintaining statins were followed up from the initial discontinuation until June 30, 2018, to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for fatal and nonfatal outcomes associated with statin discontinuation. RESULTS: The full cohort inclued 29 047 patients exposed to polypharmacy (mean [SD] age, 76.5 [6.5] years; 18 257 [62.9%] men). Of them, 5819 (20.0%) discontinued statins while maintaining other medications, and 4010 (68.9%) of them were matched with a comparator. In the discontinuing group, the mean (SD) age was 76.5 (6.4) years, 2405 (60.0%) were men, and 506 (12.6%) had Multisource Comorbidity Scores of 4 or 5. In the maintaining group, the mean (SD) age was 76.1 (6.3) years, 2474 (61.7%) were men, and 482 (12.0%) had multisource comorbidity scores of 4 or 5. Compared with the maintaining group, patients in the discontinuing group had increased risk of hospital admissions for heart failure (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43) and any cardiovascular outcome (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26), deaths from any cause (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30), and emergency admissions for any cause (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study of patients receiving polypharmacy, discontinuing statins while maintaining other drug therapies was associated with an increase in the long-term risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes.","Rea, Federico; Biffi, Annalisa; Ronco, Raffaella; Franchi, Matteo; Cammarota, Simona; Citarella, Anna; Conti, Valeria; Filippelli, Amelia; Sellitto, Carmine; Corrao, Giovanni",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204202/,163

Therefore, it is necessary to explore the development of vaccines that avoid the use of ""living"" viruses and furthermore, vaccines that have viral antigens capable of generating powerful heterotypic responses. Our strategy is based on the expression of the fusion of the anti-DEC205 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) coupled by an OLLAS tag to a viral protein (VP6) of Rotavirus in Nicotiana plants. It was possible to express transiently in N. benthamiana and N. sylvestris a recombinant protein consisting of the single chain variable fragment linked by an OLLAS tag to the VP6 protein. The presence of the recombinant protein, which had a molecular weight of approximately 75 kDa, was confirmed by immunodetection, in both plant species and in both cellular compartments (cytoplasm and apoplast) where it was expressed. In addition, the recombinant protein was modeled, and it was observed that some epitopes of interest are exposed on the surface, which could favor their immunogenic response.","Castillo-Esparza, J.

Despite sparse evidence, multiple investigations revealed responsiveness of the markers to acute and chronic exercise, thereby opening promising avenues in the field of exercise physiology. In performance settings, they might help to infer information for exercise programming by reflecting exercise strain and recovery status or periods of overtraining and increased infection risk. In health settings, application involves the depiction of anti-inflammatory effects of chronic exercise in patients exhibiting chronic inflammation. Further research should, therefore, focus on establishing reference values for these integrative markers in athletes at rest, assess the kinetics and reliability in response to different exercise modalities and implement the markers into clinical exercise trials to depict anti-inflammatory effects of chronic exercise in different patient collectives.","Walzik, David; Joisten, Niklas; Zacher, Jonas; Zimmer, Philipp",Eur J Appl Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192383/,163
18619,Accuracy and Efficiency of Fusion Robotics™ Versus Mazor-X™ in Single-Level Lumbar Pedicle Screw Placement,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Neuroprotection strategies after cardiac arrest (CA)/cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) remain key areas of basic and clinical research. This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine following resuscitation and potential mechanisms. METHODS: Anesthetized rats underwent 6-min asphyxia-based cardiac arrest and resuscitation, after which the experimental group received a single intravenous dose of dexmedetomidine (25 μg/kg). Neurological outcomes and ataxia were assessed after the return of spontaneous circulation. The serum levels and brain expression of inflammation markers was examined, and apoptotic cells were quantified by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Neuroprotection was enhanced by dexmedetomidine post-conditioning after the return of spontaneous circulation. This enhancement was characterized by the promotion of neurological function scores and coordination. In addition, dexmedetomidine post-conditioning attenuated the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α at 2 h, as well as interleukin IL-1β at 2, 24, and 48 h. TUNEL staining showed that the number of apoptotic cells in the dexmedetomidine post-conditioning group was significantly reduced compared with the control group. Further western blot analysis indicated that dexmedetomidine markedly reduced the levels of caspase-3 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Dexmedetomidine post-conditioning had a neuroprotective effect against cerebral injury following asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest. The mechanism was associated with the downregulation of apoptosis and neuroinflammation.","Li, Guangqian; LeiQian; Gu, Pan; Fan, Dan",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236741/,163
18778,Electrochemical Strategy for Low-Cost Viral Detection,2021-05-12,"Our knowledge of viral host ranges remains limited. Completing this picture by identifying unknown hosts of known viruses is an important research aim that can help identify and mitigate zoonotic and animal-disease risks, such as spill-over from animal reservoirs into human populations. To address this knowledge-gap we apply a divide-and-conquer approach which separates viral, mammalian and network features into three unique perspectives, each predicting associations independently to enhance predictive power. Our approach predicts over 20,000 unknown associations between known viruses and susceptible mammalian species, suggesting that current knowledge underestimates the number of associations in wild and semi-domesticated mammals by a factor of 4.3, and the average potential mammalian host-range of viruses by a factor of 3.2. In particular, our results highlight a significant knowledge gap in the wild reservoirs of important zoonotic and domesticated mammals’ viruses: specifically, lyssaviruses, bornaviruses and rotaviruses.","Wardeh, Maya; Blagrove, Marcus S.

In this study, we focus on identifying the current status and challenges of neurosurgical research in Iraq. METHODS: An online PubMed Medline database search was conducted to identify all articles published by Iraq-based neurosurgeons between 2003 and 2020. Information was extracted in relation to the following parameters: authors, year of publication, author’s affiliation, author’s specialty, article type, article citation, journal name, journal impact factor, and topic. This data were then tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2021, a total of 52 PubMed indexed papers were published from Iraq. All publications have been clustered in the period of 2012–2020. From 2012 to 2016, only four papers were published, one per year. The number of publications increased from 2017 to 2021, with an average of 12 publications per year. The most common article type was “case reports” (n = 14). Neurotrauma (n = 10) and vascular neurosurgery (n = 10) were the two most common topics. Most of the studies came from the city of Bagdad (n = 46), with just nine studies coming from peripheral governorates. The Neurosurgery Teaching Hospital in Bagdad was the neurosurgery center with the highest research output (n = 38). CONCLUSION: The number of publications per year has been showing a, relatively, promising trend since 2012. However, to promote sustained growth in academic productivity, a strategic plan that acknowledges the political, financial, and health-system-related challenges are urgently needed.","Hoz, Samer S.; Al-Sharshahi, Zahraa F.; Esene, Ignatius N.; Dolachee, Ali A.; Neamah, Ali M.; Al-Khafaji, Aktham O.; Al-Dhahir, Mohammed A.; Sadik, Hatem",Surg Neurol Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248137/,163
19296,PEGylated Graphene Oxide Carried OH-CATH30 to Accelerate the Healing of Infected Skin Wounds,2021-07-13,"The accumulated evidence from animal and human studies supports that exercise is beneficial to physical health. Exercise can upregulate various neurotrophic factors, activate neuroplasticity, and play a positive role in improving and enhancing cerebrovascular function. Due to its economy, convenience, and ability to prevent or ameliorate various aging-related diseases, exercise, a healthy lifestyle, is increasingly popularized by people. However, the mechanism by which exercise performs this function and how it is transmitted from muscles to the brain remains incompletely understood. Here, we review the beneficial effects of exercise with different intensities on the brain with a focus on the positive effects of lactate on neuroplasticity and cerebrovascular plasticity. Based on these recent studies, we propose that lactate, a waste previously misunderstood as a by-product of glycolysis in the past, may be a key signal molecule that regulates the beneficial adaptation of the brain caused by exercise. Importantly, we speculate that a central protective mechanism may underlie the cognitive benefits induced by exercise.","Huang, Zhihai; Zhang, Yulan; Zhou, Ruixue; Yang, Luodan; Pan, Hongying",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287254/,163
19802,Walsogynes H–O from Walsura chrysogyne,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in the use of home mechanical ventilation (HMV) for people with chronic respiratory failure poses extreme challenges for the healthcare system. People on HMV have complex care needs and require support from an interprofessional team. In Germany, HMV is criticised for inadequate quality standards, particularly in outpatient intensive care practice. The objective of this study was to describe the quality of care for people on outpatient HMV in Germany, Bavaria and provide recommendations for improvement from the perspective of healthcare professionals (HCPs). METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with HCPs (i.e., nurses, equipment providers, therapists, and physicians) were analysed using the framework method. The quality framework of Health Improvement Scotland (HIS), which aims to improve the quality of person-centred care, was used to build a deductive analysis matrix. The framework includes the three key areas: (1) Outcomes and impact, (2) Service delivery, and (3) Vision and leadership. The domains (meta-codes) and quality indicators (sub-codes) of the quality framework were used for deductive coding. RESULTS: Overall, 87 HCPs (51 female, mean age of 44.3 years, mean professional experience in HMV of 9.4 years) were interviewed (mean duration of 31 min). There was a complex interaction between the existing health care system (Outcomes and impact, 955 meaning units), the delivery of outpatient intensive care (Service delivery, 939 meaning units), and improvement-focused leadership (Vision and leadership, 70 meaning units) that influenced the quality of care for people on HMV. The main barriers were an acceleration in transition management, a neglect of weaning potential, a shortage of qualified professionals and missing quality criteria. The central recommendations for promoting person-centred care were training and supervision of staff and an inspiring leadership. An integrated care structure supporting medical home visits and outpatient rehabilitation should be developed. CONCLUSION: This study describes a heterogeneous and partly deficient care situation for people on HMV, but demonstrates that high quality care is possible if person-centred care is successfully implemented in all areas of service provision. The recommendations of this study could inform the development of a person-centred integrated care structure for people on HMV.

20401,Cell Ferroptosis: New Mechanism and New Hope for Retinitis Pigmentosa,2021-08-21,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: It is today widely accepted that a healthy diet can be one of the fundamental approaches to prevent the risk of cancer. To this aim, nutrigenomics studies are indeed providing a precious source of information, favoring the search for compounds that could affect gene expression in a favorable way. Here we present a computational study to select candidate compounds that could play a role in cancer prevention and care. Starting from analyses of gene expression, we identified 7 genes that have opposite expression trends in apoptotic treatments when compared with 8 different cancer types. In addition, based on structure similarity with 6 compounds that affect the expression patterns of these genes in a favorable way against 8 cancer types, we selected 23 natural compounds as suitable candidates for further tests as possible novel drugs or for the design of functional food for cancer treatment and prevention. ABSTRACT: It is today widely accepted that a healthy diet is very useful to prevent the risk for cancer or its deleterious effects. Nutrigenomics studies are therefore taking place with the aim to test the effects of nutrients at molecular level and contribute to the search for anti-cancer treatments. These efforts are expanding the precious source of information necessary for the selection of natural compounds useful for the design of novel drugs or functional foods. Here we present a computational study to select new candidate compounds that could play a role in cancer prevention and care. Starting from a dataset of genes that are co-expressed in programmed cell death experiments, we investigated on nutrigenomics treatments inducing apoptosis, and searched for compounds that determine the same expression pattern. Subsequently, we selected cancer types where the genes showed an opposite expression pattern and we confirmed that the apoptotic/nutrigenomics expression trend had a significant positive survival in cancer-affected patients. Furthermore, we considered the functional interactors of the genes as defined by public protein-protein interaction data, and inferred on their involvement in cancers and/or in programmed cell death. We identified 7 genes and, from available nutrigenomics experiments, 6 compounds effective on their expression. These 6 compounds were exploited to identify, by ligand-based virtual screening, additional molecules with similar structure. We checked for ADME criteria and selected 23 natural compounds representing suitable candidates for further testing their efficacy in apoptosis induction. Due to their presence in natural resources, novel drugs and/or the design of functional foods are conceivable from the presented results.","Monticolo, Francesco; Chiusano, Maria Luisa",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393935/,163
20404,Determination of Oxidized Lipids in Commonly Consumed Foods and a Preliminary Analysis of Their Binding Affinity to PPARγ,2021-07-22,"Background: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), household air pollution as a result of using solid biomass for cooking, lighting and heating (HAP) is associated with respiratory infections, accounting for approximately 4 million early deaths each year worldwide. The majority of deaths are among children under five years. This population-based cross-sectional study investigates the association between solid biomass usage and risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in 37 LMICs within Africa, Americas, Southeast Asia, European, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions. Materials and methods: Using population-based data obtained from Demographic and Health surveys (2010–2018), domestic cooking energy sources were classified solid biomass (wood, charcoal/dung, agricultural crop) and cleaner energy sources (e.g., Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), electricity, biogas and natural gas). Composite measures of ARI (shortness of breath, cough) and ALRI (shortness of breath, cough and fever) were composed using maternally reported respiratory symptoms over the two-week period prior to the interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the association between biomass fuel usage with ARI and ALRI, accounting for relevant individual, household and situational confounders, including stratification by context (urban/rural). Results: After adjustment, in the pooled analysis, children residing in solid biomass cooking households had an observed increased adjusted odds ratio of ARI (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.09–1.25) and ALRI (AOR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.07–1.25) compared to cleaner energy sources. In stratified analyses, a comparable association was observed in urban areas (ARI: 1.16 [1.06–1.28]; ALRI: 1.14 [1.02–1.27]), but only significant for ARI among those living in rural areas (ARI: 1.14 [1.03–1.26]). Conclusion: Switching domestic cooking energy sources from solid biomass to cleaner alternatives would achieve a respiratory health benefit in children under five years worldwide. High quality mixed-methods research is required to improve acceptability and sustained uptake of clean cooking energy source interventions in LMIC settings.","Al-Janabi, Zubaidah; Woolley, Katherine E.; Thomas, G.

20508,"A Comprehensive Review of Microneedles: Types, Materials, Processes, Characterizations and Applications",2021-08-22,"Impaired physical functioning is one of the most critical consequences associated with fibromyalgia, especially when there is comorbid obesity. Psychological factors are known to contribute to perceived (i.e., subjective) physical functioning. However, physical function is a multidimensional concept encompassing both subjective and objective functioning. The contribution of psychological factors to performance-based (i.e., objective) functioning is unclear. This study aims to investigate the contribution of pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance to both self-reported and performance-based physical functioning. In this cross-sectional study, 160 participants completed self-report measures of pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and pain severity. A self-report measure and a performance-based test were used to assess physical functioning. Higher pain catastrophizing and lower pain acceptance were associated with poorer physical functioning at both self-reported and performance-based levels. Our results are consistent with previous evidence on the association between pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance with self-reported physical functioning. This study contributes to the current literature by providing novel insights into the role of psychological factors in performance-based physical functioning. Multidisciplinary interventions that address pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance are recommended and might be effective to improve both perceived and performance-based functioning in women with FM and obesity.","Varallo, Giorgia; Scarpina, Federica; Giusti, Emanuele Maria; Suso-Ribera, Carlos; Cattivelli, Roberto; Guerrini Usubini, Anna; Capodaglio, Paolo; Castelnuovo, Gianluca",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401554/,163

21008,Characterization and Cytotoxicity Comparison of Silver- and Silica-Based Nanostructures,2021-08-31,"Caspase-6 participates in a series of neurodegenerative pathways, and has aroused widespread attentions as a promising molecular target for the treatment of neurodegeneration. Caspase-6 is a homodimer with 6 central-stranded β-sheets and 5 α-helices in each monomer. Previous crystallographic studies suggested that the 60′s, 90′s and 130′s helices of caspase-6 undergo a distinctive conformational transition upon substrate binding. Although the caspase-6 structures in apo and active states have been determined, the conformational transition process between the two states remains poorly understood. In this work, perturbation-response scanning (PRS) combined with targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) simulations was employed to unravel the atomistic mechanism of the dynamic conformational transitions underlying the substrate-induced activation process of caspase-6. The results showed that the conformational transition of caspase-6 from apo to active states is mainly characterized by structural rearrangements of the substrate-binding site as well as the conformational changes of 60′s and 130′s extended helices. The H-bond interactions between L1, 130′s helix and 90′s helix are proved to be key determinant factors for substrate-induced conformational transition. These findings provide valuable insights into the activation mechanism of caspase-6 as well as the molecular design of caspase-6 inhibitors.","Huang, Shuheng; Mei, Hu; Lu, Laichun; Kuang, Zuyin; Heng, Yu; Xu, Lei; Liang, Xiaoqi; Qiu, Minyao; Pan, Xianchao",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8342898/,163

In the present work, we carried out a case study evaluating the performance of two nanofiltration membranes in the removal of Atenolol (ATN)—a pharmaceutical compound widely used for the treatment of arterial hypertension—under different conditions such as operating pressure, ATN concentration, and solution pH. By determining the B parameter, which quantifies the solute/membrane affinity, we verified that the solution pH influenced the performance of the membranes, promoting attraction or repulsion between the ATN and the membranes. At pH 2.5, both membranes and ATN were positively charged, causing electrostatic repulsion, showing lower values of the B parameter and, consequently, higher ATN rejections. At such a pH, the mean ATN rejection for the loose membrane (NF270) was 82%, while for the tight membrane (NF90) it was 88%. On the other hand, at 12 bar pressure, the NF70 membrane (5.1 × 10 (−5) m s(−1)) presented mean permeate fluxes about 2.8 times greater than the NF90 membrane (1.8 × 10(−5) m s(−1)), indicating that NF270 is the most suitable membrane for this application.","Soares, Elisa Veridiani; Giacobbo, Alexandre; Rodrigues, Marco Antônio Siqueira; de Pinho, Maria Norberta; Bernardes, Andréa Moura",Membranes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8467835/,163

Most AMPs achieve these goals through mechanisms that disrupt the normal permeability of the cell membrane, which ultimately leads to the death of the pathogenic cell. Here, we developed a unique combination of a membrane penetrating peptide and peptides prone to amyloidogenesis to create hybrid peptide: “cell penetrating peptide + linker + amyloidogenic peptide”. We evaluated the antimicrobial effects of two peptides that were developed from sequences with different propensities for amyloid formation. Among the two hybrid peptides, one was found with antibacterial activity comparable to antibiotic gentamicin sulfate. Our peptides showed no toxicity to eukaryotic cells. In addition, we evaluated the effect on the antimicrobial properties of amino acid substitutions in the non-amyloidogenic region of peptides. We compared the results with data on the predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and antimicrobial properties of the original and modified peptides.

China had taken many effective measures to reduce maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and has achieved encouraging progress. These measures were worth sharing for other countries to reduce the MMR, but the introduction of these measures from the national perspective was too grand, and the measures implemented in a city and the results achieved were more valuable. However, there were few studies on the prevalence and trends of prolonged maternal mortality in a city. In this study, we mainly introduced the prevalence of the MMR in Jinan,China from 1991 to 2020, analyzed the causes of trends and put forward some solutions to the difficulty existing in the process of reducing the MMR,hoping to serve as a model for some developing cities to reduce MMR. METHODS: We collected maternal mortality data from paper records, electronic files and network platforms. The time trend of MMR was tested by Cochran-Armitage Test (CAT). We divided the study period into three stages with 10 years as a stage and the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used to test the difference in MMR of different periods. RESULTS: From 1991 to 2020, We counted 1,804,162 live births and 323 maternal deaths, and the MMR was 17.93 per 100,000 live births. The MMR declined from 44.06 per 100,000 live births in 1991 to 5.94 per 100,000 live births in 2020, with a total decline of 86.52% and an annual decline of 2.89%. The MMR declined by 88.54% in rural areas, with an average annual decline 2.95%, faster than that in urban areas (82.06, 2.73%). From 1991 to 2020, the top five causes of maternal deaths were obstetric haemorrhage (4.55 per 100,000 live births), amniotic fluid embolism (3.27 per 100,000 live births), pregnancy-induced hypertension (2.61 per 100,000 live births), heart disease (2.33 per 100,000 live births) and other medical complications (2.05 per 100,000 live births). Postpartum hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism, pregnancy-induced hypertension showed a downward trend (P < 0.05) and other medical complications showed an upward trend (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Subsidy for hospitalized delivery of rural women, free prenatal check-ups for pregnant women and rapid referral system between hospitals have contributed to reducing MMR in Jinan. However, it was still necessary to strengthen the treatment of obstetric hemorrhage by ensuring blood supply, reduce the MMR due to medical complications by improving the skills of obstetricians to deal with medical diseases, and reduce the MMR by strengthening the allocation of emergency equipment in county hospitals and the skills training of doctors.","Yu, Dafang; Zhang, Lihua; Yang, Shimin; Chen, Qing; Li, Zhongliang",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493743/,163

The synthesized conjugates were evaluated for their preliminary in vitro analysis against Trichomonas vaginalis at 50 μM. The efficacy of synthesized hybrids was observed to depend on the substituent at N-1 position of β-lactam ring, as well as the presence of single/double 1H-1,2,3-triazole linker. Among the synthesized conjugates, the presence of a p-tolyl substituent at N-1 of β-lactam ring was preferred for good activity profiles while the increase in spacer length did not influence the efficacy of the compounds. Compounds with high levels of potency were further analysed to determine their IC(50) values, as well as cytotoxicity profiles against mammalian cells. The most active compound in the synthesized conjugates displayed an IC(50) value of 10.49 μM against cultured G3 strain of T. vaginalis and was non-toxic to cultured mammalian HeLa cells at the same concentration.

Elderly individuals suffer the effects of immunosenescence as they age, which is the diminishing of the overall immune response. Immunosenescence occurs by specifically affecting the adaptive immune response which controls the establishment of immunity after vaccination or infection. There are many studies under way that are trying to find a resolution to the problem of the influenza vaccine not providing enough protection in the elderly population. One of the possible strategies is to seek the use of an optimal adjuvant, an immunological agent that can enhance immune responses, with the current vaccine formulation. Here, we used the murine model to review the effects of adjuvants on the antibody response to influenza vaccines in aged mice. Since adjuvants can enhance the production of important inflammatory cytokines and activation of dendritic cells, the stimulation of these cells are boosted to increase the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in aged mice which would hopefully translate to the elderly.","Concannon, Mark A.; Jiang, Jiu",Front Biol (Beijing),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089211/,163

22961,News In Brief,2003,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, almost all of these studies have identified multiple risk factors but did not offer practical instruments for routine use in predicting individualized survival in human H7N9 infection cases. The objective of this study is to create a practical instrument for use in predicting an individualized survival probability of H7N9 patients. METHODS: A matched case–control study (1:2 ratios) was performed in Zhejiang Province between 2013 and 2019. We reviewed specific factors and outcomes regarding patients with H7N9 virus infection (VI) to determine relationships and developed a nomogram to calculate individualized survival probability. This tool was used to predict each individual patient’s probability of survival based on results obtained from the multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. RESULTS: We examined 227 patients with H7N9 VI enrolled in our study. Stepwise selection was applied to the data, which resulted in a final model with 8 independent predictors [including initial PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio ≤300 mmHg, age ≥60 years, chronic diseases, poor hand hygiene, time from illness onset to the first medical visit, incubation period ≤5 days, peak C-reactive protein ≥120 mg/L], and initial bilateral lung infection. The concordance index of this nomogram was 0.802 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.694–0.901] and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.611–0.952) for the training and validation sets, respectively, which indicates adequate discriminatory power. The calibration curves for the survival showed optimal agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation in the training and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSION: We established and validated a novel nomogram that can accurately predict the survival probability of patients with H7N9 VI. This nomogram can serve an important role in counseling patients with H7N9 VI and guide treatment decisions.","Cheng, Qinglin; Sun, Zhou; Zhao, Gang; Xie, Li",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094003/,163

23675,An Introduction to Biotechnology,2016-10-23,"In many cases, at the beginning of a high throughput screening experiment some information about active molecules is already available. Active compounds (such as substrate analogues, natural products and inhibitors of related proteins) are often identified in low throughput validation studies on a biochemical target. Sometimes the additional structural information is also available from crystallographic studies on protein and ligand complexes. In addition, the structural or sequence similarity of various protein targets yields a novel possibility for drug discovery. Co-crystallized compounds from homologous proteins can be used to design leads for a new target without co-crystallized ligands. In this paper we evaluate how far such an approach can be used in a real drug campaign, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus providing an example. Our method is able to construct small molecules as plausible inhibitors solely on the basis of the set of ligands from crystallized complexes of a protein target, and other proteins from its structurally homologous family. The accuracy and sensitivity of the method are estimated here by the subsequent use of an electronic high throughput screening flexible docking algorithm. The best performing ligands are then used for a very restrictive similarity search for potential inhibitors of the SARS protease within the million compounds from the Ligand.Info small molecule meta-database. The selected molecules can be passed on for further experimental validation.","Plewczynski, Dariusz; Hoffmann, Marcin; von Grotthuss, Marcin; Knizewski, Lukasz; Rychewski, Leszek; Eitner, Krystian; Ginalski, Krzysztof",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115750/,163

Earlier, killed or attenuated pathogens were employed for vaccine development. But in present era, the peptide vaccines are in much trend and are favoured over whole vaccines because of their superiority over conventional vaccines. These vaccines are either based on single proteins or on synthetic peptides including several B-cell and T-cell epitopes. However, the overall mechanism of action remains the same and works by prompting the immune system to activate the specific B-cell- and T-cell-mediated responses against the pathogen. Rino Rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology. This is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools.

24197,Implications of Human Microbiome Research for the Developing World,2011-10-11,"The first half decade of the 21(st) century has brought with it infectious outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], bioterrorism attacks with anthrax [2], and the spread of H5N1 influenza A in birds across Asia and Europe [3, 4] sparking concerns reminiscent of the days of the Black Plague. These events, in the context of an instantaneous global-media world, have placed an unprecedented emphasis on preparing for a human influenza pandemic [5, 6]. Although some argue that the media have exaggerated the threat, the warnings of an impending pandemic are not without foundation given the history of past influenza pandemics [7], incidence of H5N1 infections among humans [8], and the potential impact of a pandemic. Reports of the 1918 pandemic vary, but most suggested that approximately one third of the world’s population was infected with 50 to 100 million deaths [9]. Computer modeling of a moderate pandemic, less severe then in 1918, in the province of Ontario, Canada predicts 73,252 admissions of influenza patients to hospitals over a 6-week period utilizing 72% of the hospital capacity, 171% of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity, and 118% of current ventilator capacity. Pandemic modeling by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society also showed that critical care resources would be overwhelmed by even a moderate pandemic [10]. This chapter will provide intensivists with a review of the basic scientific and clinical aspects of influenza as well as an introduction to pandemic preparedness.","Christian, M. D.; Lapinsky, S.

At the same time, there is always a contact transmission from contaminated environment, equipment, textiles and waste. Droplet nuclei are small evaporated droplet residues (<5 μm) produced by coughing, sneezing, shouting, singing and speaking very distinct—especially the consonants. Droplet nuclei remain for many hours in the air and may be carried by normal air currents in long distances outside the room. Therefore, “droplet isolation and droplet precaution” is included in the airborne isolation regime. The source of infection is usually a patient but may also be a healthy carrier.

We recount in some detail a few of the representative GRANCH techniques to provide a glimpse of how these methods are used in formulating quantitative sequence descriptors to analyse DNA, RNA and protein sequences to derive meaningful results. Finally, we survey the surveillance techniques with a special reference to how the GRANCH techniques can be used for the purpose and recount the forecasts made of possible metamorphosis of pandemic bird flu to pandemic human infecting agents.","Nandy, Ashesh; De, Antara; Roy, Proyasha; Dutta, Munna; Roy, Moumita; Sen, Dwaipayan; Basak, Subhash C.",Synthetic Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121243/,163

25212,Saponin Synthesis and Function,2012-08-22,"In its widest sense disease can be regarded as any impairment of normal functions. However, for the purposes of this book we will mostly restrict our discussion to infectious diseases, the agents of which are often described as parasites or pathogens. For convenience, these organisms are often split into two categories that reflect their broad characteristics, and their relative size. The macroparasites are multi-cellular organisms that live in or on the host, such as helminths and arthropods, while microparasites include viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The main functional differences between the two relate to their generation times, with microparasites exhibiting relatively higher within-host reproductive rates and shorter generation times than macroparasites. As a result microparasites are frequently associated with acute disease, although they can induce long-lived immunity to re-infection in recovered hosts. Macroparasites by contrast are more likely to produce chronic infections often characterised by short-lived immunity in heavily infected hosts, and re-infection. Macroparasites may also have distinct life stages that can survive outside the host (e.g. eggs or larvae) and sometimes require other host species to complete their life cycle. Two important groups of pathogens fall outside this classification: rogue proteins (prions) implicated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and infectious cancers, of which Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease is a well known example. However, in broad respects these are most usefully considered as microparasites, often producing acute clinical signs without host immunity. Disease can affect individual hosts by reducing growth rates or fecundity, increasing metabolic requirements, changing patterns of behaviour and ultimately may cause death. Sub-lethal effects of pathogens may also enhance mortality rates by for example, increasing the susceptibility of the infected host to predation. However, the intimate relationships between hosts and parasites have in many instances evolved over time into subtle and potentially complex interactions, such that infection does not in itself necessarily lead to disease. Many parasites have little detrimental effect on their hosts for most of the time, only causing pathological damage if this delicate balance is upset, for example when the parasites become too numerous or when the immunological capability of the host is impaired. This balance could be influenced by many factors including nutrition, concomitant infections and a variety of physiological stressors.","Delahay, Richard J.; Smith, Graham C.; Hutchings, Michael R.",Management of Disease in Wild Mammals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121746/,163

Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the twentieth century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large-scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980). However, new infectious diseases have emerged [e.g., Legionella, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), Helicobacter, SARS, etc.], and new vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS in immunocompromised patients.

26500,Natural Virucidal Compounds in Foods,2016-08-26,"The Republic of Korea has not only monumentally progressed socially, economically, and politically since 1948, but has taken the arduous undertaking of reforming the way it reduces disaster risk, mitigates the impact, and prepares for and responds to disasters for a resilient future. The administrative and organizational reforms have not been without its setbacks or obstacles; however, they were not so insurmountable that they could not be overcome by one of Korea’s greatest assets: persisting endeavors to build back better and to enhance resilience. Starting with an independent national agency in 2004 to manage natural and human-caused disasters and preparedness, the government quickly realized, through focusing events, it was insufficient to handle the increasing complexity and intensifying of disasters striking the nation. Therefore, through political will and hindsight, it continuously coalesced pertinent disaster management responsibilities into newer and newer agencies until 2016, when it enacted a progressively more ubiquitous and self-propelling agency. However, although the agency is apt for current disasters, it will not be for future disaster, which needs the integration of resilience into Disaster Risk Management (DRM). Therefore, we suggest five tenets on how to make Korea’s resilient future as well as for other nations that are and will follow in Korea’s footsteps, especially for those nations in Asia and Africa. A future that is resilient against all types of disaster risks, especially being prepared well for “low probability and high impact” focusing events that are located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution.","Kim, Yong-kyun; Sohn, Hong-Gyoo",Disaster Risk Management in the Republic of Korea,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123419/,163

Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases. Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing. Moreover, advances in deciphering the molecular pathways regulating poxvirus-host interactions will provide additional means to potently activate innate immune stimulation upon vaccination and to derive vectors with specifically targeted replicative capacity for experimental tumor therapy.","Schnierle, Barbara S.; Suezer, Yasemin; Sutter, Gerd",Poxviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123444/,163

Bushmeat is an important source of protein and income for many African people, but bushmeat-related activities have been linked to numerous EID outbreaks, such as Ebola, HIV, and SARS. Importantly, increasing demand and commercialization of bushmeat is exposing more people to pathogens and facilitating the geographic spread of diseases. To date, these linkages have not been systematically assessed. Here we review the literature on bushmeat and EIDs for sub-Saharan Africa, summarizing pathogens (viruses, fungi, bacteria, helminths, protozoan, and prions) by bushmeat taxonomic group to provide for the first time a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge concerning zoonotic disease transmission from bushmeat into humans.

Patient to patient spread has been reported, however mechanisms of acquisition of Bcc are not well understood. Method: Data from the Belgian CF Registry (year 2000–2010) were collected. Inclusions: Bcc infected patients with entries on lung function in at least 1 y before and 3 y after Bcc acquisition. For each case, we included 2 controls, matched for age at the index year (year of first Bcc infection), pancreatic status, sex. Cumulative data up to 2 years before index year were compared to values obtained after infection using Rank sum test. Rate of decline in lung function was adjusted for baseline lung function, age, sex. RESULTS: Bcc prevalence in CF is low in Belgium (<3%). 183 patients were included: 61 cases, 122 controls. 59% were F508del homozygous. Mean age in cases was 20.9 y (SD 10.5) vs 20.3 y (SD 10.3) in controls. Among the Bcc, 54% were unspecified, 31% were B. multivorans. Mean FEV(1) at index year was 65.2% (SD 24.9) in cases vs 73.1 (SD 26.9) in controls (p = 0.07). FEV(1) decline before index year was significantly higher in cases (–1.7%, SD 0.5) compared to controls (–1.0%, SD 0.3) (p = 0.002). FEV(1) slopes were comparable in the period after index year (–1.1%, SD 0.5, in cases vs –0.99%, SD 0.4, p = 0.24). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a declining FEV(1) precedes acquisition of Bcc and may be a risk factor. After acquisition, lung function decline was comparable in Bcc infected and uninfected patients. These results should be interpreted with caution, since registry data are collected retrospectively and bear a risk of incompleteness or inaccuracy.","Willekens, J.; Wanyama, S.; Thomas, M.; De Wachter, E.; De Schutter, I.; Malfroot, A.",J Cyst Fibros,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129951/,163

Although ensemble techniques are widely known to improve the performance of models, there is little types of research on ensemble neural-ranking models. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the performance on the comment-ranking task by using unsupervised ensemble methods. We propose a new hybrid method composed of an output selection method and a typical averaging method. Our method uses a pseudo answer represented by the average of multiple model outputs. The pseudo answer is used to evaluate multiple model outputs via ranking evaluation metrics, and the results are used to select and weight the models. Experimental results on the comment-ranking task show that our proposed method outperforms several ensemble baselines, including supervised one.","Fujita, Soichiro; Kobayashi, Hayato; Okumura, Manabu",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148027/,163

Emerging fields like synthetic biology and exobiology have rekindled attempts at establishing a definition of life for practical purposes. The question presents many challenges with each attempt thus far leading to unintended implications and strong counterexamples. It is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge with each approach giving wildly varying and often irreconcilable definitions. The given definitions of life are numerous with over 300 definitions published in books and journals. The unique characteristics of the mimivirus, discovered in 2003, and later giant viruses, rekindled the discussion in defining life, indicating other complications in a definition.","Love, Luca Gregory",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149470/,163

29587,Ferrets,2017-11-17,"Proteases are ubiquitous in biosystems where they have diverse roles in the biochemical, physiological, and regulatory aspects of cells and organisms. Proteases represent the largest segment of the industrial enzyme market where they are used in detergents, in food processing, in leather and fabric upgrading, as catalysts in organic synthesis, and as therapeutics. Microbial protease overproducing strains have been developed by conventional screening, mutation/selection strategies and genetic engineering, and wholly new enzymes, with altered specificity or stability, have been designed through techniques such as site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution. Complete sequencing of the genomes of key Bacillus and Aspergillus workhorse extracellular enzyme producers and other species of interest has contributed to enhanced production yields of indigenous proteases as well as to production of heterologous proteases. With annual protease sales of about $1.5–1.8 billion, proteases account for 60% of the total enzyme market. Detergent proteases, with an annual market of about $1 billion account for the largest protease application segment. Subtilisin Carlsberg and related subtilisin serine proteases represent the first generation of detergent proteases with pH optima of 9–10. The second generation, having higher pH optima (10–11) and greater temperature stability, is produced from alkalophilic strains including Bacillusclausii and B. halodurans. The third generation consists of detergent proteases whose active sites and/or stability have been modified by protein engineering. The principal applications of proteases in food processing are in brewing, cereal mashing, and beer haze clarification, in the coagulation step in cheese making, in altering the viscoelastic properties of dough in baking and in production of protein hydrolysates. In organic synthesis, proteases have application in synthesis and/or hydrolysis of peptide, ester, and amide bonds involving carboxylic acids and are effective tools for resolution of pairs of enantiomers. Proteases have applications in nutrition as digestive aids and in therapy in thrombosis and cancer treatment. Hyperproteolytic endogenous activity may play significant roles in abnormal physiological functioning as well as in microbial and viral pathophysiological conditions and this has created substantial momentum for development of protease inhibitors as therapeutic agents against disease-causing proteases.","Ward, O.P.",Comprehensive Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7151786/,163

They are typically associated with a sore and swollen throat that makes it difficult for the patient to swallow. They may also be accompanied by fevers, swollen lymph nodes, cough, voice hoarseness, and classic symptoms of an upper respiratory infection such as rhinorrhea. The majority of these infections are benign and run a self-limited course, although they often cause patients significant discomfort. A small but still significant number of cases will be due to a more serious process, such as a deep neck space infection. It is important to recognize the clinical and radiographic differences between these patients and patients with simple pharyngitis and triage them appropriately. Failure to recognize and treat patients with more serious infections can have dire consequences and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. It is also important to recognize that certain populations of patients will be more susceptible to atypical infections. Specific conditions, particularly those that lead to immunocompromise, should prompt the clinician to expand their differential and consider atypical causes of pharyngeal infections.","Orzell, Susannah; Suryadevara, Amar",Introduction to Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153042/,163

Taxonomy is a form of organized vocabulary. Classically the organization is hierarchic, based on some attributes of the things being classified. Ontology is a specification of a conceptualization.

Diminazene aceturate (7 mg/kg intramuscularly), DFMO (300 mg/kg/day orally in three divided doses for six days) and the combination of diminazene aceturate (7 mg/kg intramuscularly) and DFMO (300 mg/kg/day orally for six days) produced an intermittent aparasitemia in the dogs. Relapse infection occurred in all the three groups, but the period of aparasitemia produced by the combination of the agents was longest.

Indeed, critical HCI requires to be designed and built such that safety and security requirements are thoroughly fulfilled. This paper presents a novel development framework featuring formal verification and validation of critical interactive systems at modelling level.

33027,Dysimmune neuropathies,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND: Given the growing number of people worldwide living with huma immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a larger subset of these patients are now susceptible to sustaining a traumatic injury. However, the impact of HIV on outcomes in trauma with modern antiretroviral treatment remains unclear. We hypothesized mortality and rates of infectious and inflammatory complications would be higher in HIV positive (HIV+) trauma patients. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried to identify trauma patients ≥ 18 years of age with HIV. Due to the imbalance between HIV+ and HIV negative (HIV−) trauma patients, a 1:2 propensity-matched model was utilized. Matched variables included age, injury severity score, mechanism of injury, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and patient comorbidities. RESULTS: 84 HIV+ patients were matched to 168 HIV− patients. Compared to HIV− patients, HIV+ patients had no significant differences in mortality rate (9.5% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.144) or infectious complications, including pneumonia (6.0% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.530), urinary tract infection (1.2% vs. 1.2%, p = 1.000), or severe sepsis (1.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.156). However, higher rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9.5% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (4.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.004) were observed. CONCLUSION: HIV+ trauma patients are not at higher risk of mortality or infectious complications, likely due to the advent and prevalence of combination antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV positivity appears to increase the risk of AKI and ARDS in trauma patients. Further research is needed to confirm this finding to elucidate the etiology underlying this association.","Covarrubias, Jose; Grigorian, Areg; Kuza, Catherine M.; Dolich, Matthew; Dosch, Austin; Kojayan, Greg G.; Delaplain, Patrick; Lekawa, Michael; Nahmias, Jeffry",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246034/,163

Realizing DTs is challenging and requires significant efforts for their conception and integration with the represented CPPS. To mitigate this, we present an approach to systematically engineering DTs for injection molding that supports domain-specific customizations and automation of essential development activities based on a model-driven reference architecture. In this approach, reactive CPPS behavior is defined in terms of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for specifying events that occur in the physical system. The reference architecture connects to the CPPS through a novel DSL for representing OPC-UA bindings. We have evaluated this approach with a DT of an injection molding machine that controls the machine to optimize the Design of Experiment (DoE) parameters between experiment cycles before the products are molded. Through this, our reference implementation of the DT facilitates the time-consuming setup of a DT and the subsequent injection molding activities. Overall, this facilitates to systematically engineer digital twins with reactive behavior that help to optimize machine use.","Bibow, Pascal; Dalibor, Manuela; Hopmann, Christian; Mainz, Ben; Rumpe, Bernhard; Schmalzing, David; Schmitz, Mauritius; Wortmann, Andreas",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266454/,163
33677,Large Intestine (Colon),2009-10-30,"Various technologies have been developed to automate the deployment of applications. Although most of them are not limited to a specific infrastructure and able to manage multi-cloud applications, they all require a central orchestrator that processes the deployment model and executes all necessary tasks to deploy and orchestrate the application components on the respective infrastructure. However, there are applications in which several organizations, such as different departments or even different companies, participate. Due to security concerns, organizations typically do not expose their internal APIs to the outside or leave control over application deployments to others. As a result, centralized deployment technologies are not suitable to deploy cross-organizational applications. In this paper, we present a concept for the decentralized cross-organizational application deployment automation. We introduce a global declarative deployment model that describes a composite cross-organizational application, which is split to local parts for each participant. Based on the split declarative deployment models, workflows are generated which form the deployment choreography and coordinate the local deployment and cross-organizational data exchange. To validate the practical feasibility, we prototypical implemented a standard-based end-to-end toolchain for the proposed method using TOSCA and BPEL.","Wild, Karoline; Breitenbücher, Uwe; Képes, Kálmán; Leymann, Frank; Weder, Benjamin",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266461/,163

Some conversational agents target small talk, while others are more task-oriented. However, from the earliest rule-based systems to the recent data-driven approaches, although many paths were explored with more or less success, we are not there yet. Rule-based systems require much manual work; data-driven systems require a lot of data. Domain adaptation is (again) a current hot-topic. The possibility to add emotions to the conversational agents’ responses, or to make their answers capture their “persona”, are some popular research topics. This paper explains why the task of Natural Language Understanding is so complicated, detailing the linguistic phenomena that lead to the main challenges.

35167,New Product Developments,2020-06-22,"Following the trend towards Exascale, today’s supercomputers consist of increasingly complex and heterogeneous compute nodes. To exploit the performance of these systems, research software in HPC needs to keep up with the rapid development of hardware architectures. Since manual tuning of software to each and every architecture is neither sustainable nor viable, we aim to tackle this challenge through appropriate software design. In this article, we aim to improve the performance and sustainability of FMSolvr, a parallel Fast Multipole Method for Molecular Dynamics, by adapting it to Non-Uniform Memory Access architectures in a portable and maintainable way. The parallelization of FMSolvr is based on Eventify, an event-based tasking framework we co-developed with FMSolvr. We describe a layered software architecture that enables the separation of the Fast Multipole Method from its parallelization. The focus of this article is on the development and analysis of a reusable NUMA module that improves performance while keeping both layers separated to preserve maintainability and extensibility. By means of the NUMA module we introduce diverse NUMA-aware data distribution, thread pinning and work stealing policies for FMSolvr. During the performance analysis the modular design of the NUMA module was advantageous since it facilitates combination, interchange and redesign of the developed policies. The performance analysis reveals that the runtime of FMSolvr is reduced by [Formula: see text] from 1.48 ms to 1.16 ms through these policies.","Morgenstern, Laura; Haensel, David; Beckmann, Andreas; Kabadshow, Ivo",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304697/,163

However, the existing BSO variants can suffer from three problems: (1) large-scale optimization problem; (2) hyperparameter optimization problem; (3) high computational cost of the clustering operations. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective BSO variant named Brain Storm Optimization Algorithm with Cooperative Learning Strategy (BSO-CLS). It is inspired by the new ideas generating process of brain storm in which the participators propose their own ideas by cooperatively learning other participators’ ideas. Thus, BSO-CLS iteratively updates the candidate solutions by linearly combining other solutions with the weights deriving from the fitness values of other solutions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we test it on 6 benchmark functions with the 1000 dimensions. The experimental results show that BSO-CLS can outperform the vanilla BSO and the other BSO variant with the learning strategy.","Qu, Liang; Duan, Qiqi; Yang, Jian; Cheng, Shi; Zheng, Ruiqi; Shi, Yuhui",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354805/,163

The pace of restructuring is affected by the interplay between financial crisis and Covid-19, through which the public value of the University is continually questioned. In this conjuncture of crises that affect the body of the institution and the bodies of its labourers, the desires of Capital trump human needs. The structural adjustment of sectoral and institutional structures as forms, cultures as pathologies, and activities as methodologies enacts scarring. However, the visibility of scars has led to a reawakening of politics inside and beyond the University. The idea that History had ended because there is no alternative to capitalism or its political horizon, is in question. Instead, the political content of the University has reasserted itself at the end of The End of History. In this article, the idea that the University at The End of History has become a hopeless space, unable both to fulfil the desires of those who labour within it for a good life and to contribute solutions to socio-economic and socio-environmental ruptures, is developed dialectically.

We describe a case of iliopsoas hematoma in a tetanus patient who had not been treated with any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old female patient was transferred to our hospital 7 days after the onset of tetanus. An iliopsoas hematoma was identified in her right iliopsoas muscle on computed tomography. There was no extravasation; thus, the hematoma improved with conservative therapy. There were no episodes that suggested a bleeding tendency, or no factors associated with hemorrhagic conditions. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of iliopsoas hematoma as a complication in a tetanus patient who did not received anticoagulation therapy.

It encourages clinicians globally to share novel uses of existing drugs for patients with difficult-to-treat infections. It is designed to serve as a rapid communication platform for healthcare providers during an outbreak, providing for systematic case-sharing, discussion, and the latest literature. Besides case reports, CURE ID offers a discussion platform for clinicians, disease-specific clinical trials curated from clincialtrials.gov, and a newsfeed that shows relevant journal articles and news related to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. METHODS: The CURE ID team extracted individual case reports on patient-level treatments and outcomes of COVID-19 infection from the published literature and gathered clinician-submitted cases through the electronic case report form. Additionally, CURE ID partnered with the University of Pennsylvania’s CORONA database to further populate the CURE ID database with published cases. RESULTS: As of submission, lopinavir-Ritonavir (n=51) was the most commonly reported drug used. The following were also reported: hydroxychloroquine (n=31), azithromycin (n=28), arbidol (n=22), interferon alfa-2B (n=18), moxifloxacin (n=18), methylprednisolone (n=17), ivermectin (n=14), lopinavir (n=12), oseltamivir (n=12). The other drugs reported were danoprevir-ritonavir, intravenous immunoglobulins, interferon, interferon alfa, and tocilizumab. CURE ID currently includes more than 150 detailed COVID case reports of 65 repurposed drugs. We expect case reporting for specific drugs to be dynamic and additional data to accrue. Updated results will be presented. CONCLUSION: Several drugs are being repurposed to treat COVID-19. CURE ID gives clinicians an opportunity to share their treatment experiences and discuss their questions with a global community of healthcare providers. By utilizing the CURE ID platform, in conjunction with data gathered from other registries, observational studies and clinical trials, hypotheses can be generated that may inform future clinical trials and ultimately, potentially find safe and effective treatments for this deadly disease.

More than a million people have been killed by Covid-19. Because of this, quick and precise diagnosis test is necessary. The current gold standard is the RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification, but its results take too long to be available. Tests base on IgM/IgG antibodies have been used, but their sensitivity and specificity may be very low. Many studies have been demonstrating the Covid-19 impact on hematological parameters. METHOD: This work proposes an intelligent system to support Covid-19 diagnosis based on blood testing. Laboratory parameters obtained from the hemogram and biochemical tests defined as standards to support clinical diagnosis were used as input features. Afterward, we used particle swarm optimization, evolutionary algorithms, and manual selection based on cost minimization to select the most significant features. RESULTS: We tested several machine learning methods, and we achieved high classification performance: overall accuracy of 95.159% ± 0.693, kappa index of 0.903 ± 0.014, sensitivity of 0.968 ± 0.007, precision of 0.938 ± 0.010, and specificity of 0.936 ± 0.011. These results were achieved using classical and low computational cost classifiers, with Bayes Network being the best of them. In addition, only 24 blood tests were needed. CONCLUSION: This points to the possibility of a new rapid test with low cost.

In prior research, high death anxiety and a lack of provider-initiated communication about advance care planning (ACP) have been shown to decrease a patient’s likelihood of having advance directives. Providers often have gaps in knowledge and are uncomfortable with these conversations. We used a mixed methods approach (quantitative survey with a follow-up telephone interview) to assess knowledge, preferences, and attitudes regarding ACP in individuals with LS (n = 20). This study also assessed which ACP documents individuals already had in place and which persons (providers, family, or friends) an individual made aware of the documentation and/or preferences. These data were analyzed to determine patient preferences for who is responsible for initiating these conversations, identify motivating factors and barriers to these conversations, and determine whether the current conversations are adequate to meet the needs of this patient population. Participants recognized the importance of ACP and expressed interest in creating these documents. However, knowledge and confidence about these topics were lacking, with many participants attributing this to their young age and lack of experience. Although uncomfortable, many patients want to have ACP discussions with their providers, but frequently patients were only asked if these documents are completed with no further discussion. These findings can inform educational efforts to improve knowledge of ACP and interventional research to increase use of ACP by individuals with LS.","Fenton, Victoria; Fletcher, Lauren; Bowles, Jennifer; Hennig, Kelsey; Burton-Chase, Allison M.",SN Compr Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808734/,163

However, the interplay between this disease, changes in pollution, climate, and aversion to activation of emergency medical services represents a challenging conundrum. We aimed at appraising the impact of COVID-19, weather, and environment features on the occurrence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in a large Italian region and metropolitan area. METHODS AND RESULTS: Italy was hit early on by COVID-19, such that state of emergency was declared on January 31, 2020, and national lockdown implemented on March 9, 2020, mainly because the accrual of cases in Northern Italy. In order to appraise the independent contribution on changes in STEMI and NSTEMI daily rates of COVID-19, climate and pollution, we collected data on these clinical events from tertiary care cardiovascular centers in the Lazio region and Rome metropolitan area. Multilevel Poisson modeling was used to appraise unadjusted and adjusted effect estimates for the daily incidence of STEMI and NSTEMI. The sample included 1448 STEMI and 2040 NSTEMI, with a total of 2882 PCI spanning 6 months. Significant reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI were evident already in early February 2020 (all P < 0.05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures. Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (P < 0.05). In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (P < 0.05). Multi-stage and multiply adjusted models highlighted that reductions in STEMI were significantly associated with COVID-19 data (P < 0.001), whereas changes in NSTEMI were significantly associated with both NO2 and COVID-19 data (both P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms. In particular, recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase.","Griffo, Simone; Gaspardone, Achille; Danesi, Alessandro; Ferranti, Fabio; Mariano, Enrica; Rotolo, Francesco; Musto, Carmine; Di Giosa, Alessandro; Marchegiani, Giada; Zoccai, Giuseppe Biondi; Versaci, Francesco",Eur Heart J Suppl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799115/,163

The linkage of databases makes it possible to integrate a person’s data that may be scattered across different subsectors such as health, education, justice, immigration, and social programs. It also facilitates research that can inform more efficient management of social and health programs and policies. The main advantages of using linked databases are: diversity of data, population coverage, stability over time, and lower cost in comparison to primary data collection. Despite the availability of tools to process, link, and analyze large data sets, there has been minimal use of this approach in Latin American countries. Ecuador is well positioned to implement this approach, due to compulsory use of a unique ID in health services delivery, which permits linkages with other national information systems. However, the country faces several cultural, technical, ethical, legal, and political challenges. To take advantage of its potential, Ecuador needs to develop a data governance strategy that includes standards for data access and data use, as well as mechanisms for data control and quality, greater investment in professional training in data use both within and beyond the health sector, and collaborations between government entities, universities, and civil society organizations.","Orozco, Fadya; Guaygua, Santiago; López Villacis, Danilo Hernán; Muñoz, Fabián; Urquía, Marcelo L.",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7905735/,163

49168,Diagnostic of Calf’s Body Temperature by Using Thermal Imaging Camera and Correction of Camera Errors,2020-09-17,"Although tuberculosis (TB) figures among the top 10 causes of mortality globally, it is rather infrequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting even in countries where TB is widely prevalent. Patients with TB constitute less than 2% of total ICU admissions (Muthu et al. 2018; Frame et al. 1987). Notwithstanding, these patients pose considerable challenges in terms of timely diagnosis, treatment, and infection control. Patients with clinically severe forms of TB may require admission to the ICU. Studies from various settings indicate that a broad range of 1–25% of patients with active TB require ICU admission (Patel et al. 2017; Tsai et al. 2008; Levy et al. 1987; Lui et al. 2014; Eveloff et al. 1994; Rao et al. 1998; Silva et al. 2010). The most common reason for transferring a patient with active TB to the ICU is acute respiratory failure (ARF) (Muthu et al. 2018; Frame et al. 1987; Zahar et al. 2001; Valade et al. 2012). Other common indications include mycobacterial septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, in some settings, TB meningitis is the most common reason for ICU admission among TB patients. About 40% of patients with TB meningitis would have concomitant pulmonary disease. Less common indications could be massive hemoptysis, pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade, Addisonian crisis, airway obstruction in laryngeal TB, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and seizures caused by tuberculomas in the brain. Importantly, TB patients may also experience acute liver failure due to hepatotoxic drugs and rarely acute renal failure, mainly rifampicin-induced (Hagan and Nathani 2013) (Table 16.1).","Deepanjali, Surendran; Kadhiravan, Tamilarasu",Infectious Diseases in the Intensive Care Unit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979070/,163

The focus is no longer solely on the salary and extrinsic factors. New Work focus mainly on intrinsic factors. Intrinsic motivation refers to an individual’s personal interests, satisfaction and enjoyment. The factors affecting it are internal. Therefore, a person learns the learning’s sake without expecting anything such as grades or praise in return. Instead, they are guided by something deeper (Helmold, 2020). A good work–life balance and personal development on a professional and personal level are now playing an increasingly important role. In the case of work processes that run virtually, flexible work models are particularly suitable to respond to the new needs of the new worker and to better combine professional and private life. For future work, it will become more and more important to change old structures and create space for new working models. The Internet makes it possible to work in virtual teams from anywhere in the world. The introduction and use of flexible working models are therefore only a logical consequence. In the following we present you the advantages of flexible working models. Many companies already understand today how we want to work in the future. Giving employees more freedom to choose their working hours and location is a good step in the right direction. Because in the future it will become more and more important that companies respond to the individual needs of their employees and offer flexible working models. In this way, everyone can find out for themselves which way of working is most effective and satisfactory. Above all, employee satisfaction, trust and appreciation should be increased in order to remain interesting as an employer in the long term. This will enable the highest productivity and the greatest success for the company in the future (Bergmann, 2019).","Helmold, Marc","New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980985/,163

52098,Markov Processes and Related Topics (III),2021-04-28,"INTRODUCTION: The effort to prevent healthcare systems becoming overrun during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has come at the cost of delaying operations and with that bringing difficult risk analysis to help decide which operations should go ahead. With COVID-19 being a novel disease there is limited evidence for guidance on this issue. We have previously presented work highlighting the high risk of mortality associated with a perioperative cardiothoracic patient becoming COVID-19 positive and thus decided to implement a series of changes to departmental perioperative practice. This work presents these interventions and compares the infection and the mortality rate with those before the intervention was put in place. METHOD: Two retrospective loops were performed. Pre intervention, 5/3/20 – 20/4/20, and post intervention, 21/4/20- 23/6/20. Inclusion criteria: patients who had received cardiothoracic surgery at University Hospital of Wales within 4 weeks of the positive COVID-19 PCR (1st loop n = 53, 2nd loop n = 40). Exclusion criteria included re-admissions from greater than 4 weeks (n = 2). Interventions included 14 day pre op isolation, a strict multifaceted screening regime, reverse barrier nursing and delaying operations if diagnostic uncertainty. RESULTS: 9/51 patients from the pre intervention loop and 2/40 from post intervention loop tested +ve for COVID-19. The pre intervention mortality was 5/9 and post intervention mortality was 0/2. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that simple changes to perioperative practice can decrease the transmission of COVID-19 during this period.

Main funding source(s): Hospital Universitario La Paz INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has overloaded health care systems at several fields. Spanish COVID-19 first wave led to the interruption of most cardiac rehabilitation (CRH) programs in our country. Resume activity without compromising patient""s safety has been a challenge. At our centre (a third-level hospital), we modified our routine clinical practice from face-to-face interviews to a complete online CRH program since July 1st 2020. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of an online CRH program after hospital discharge for an acute coronary syndrome in health goals and adherence to secondary prevention measures at the end of the program. METHODS: This is a retrospective study made up of patients who, after suffering an acute myocardial infarction, followed an online CRH program from June to November 2020. A first online assessment is made by a cardiology consultant. Then, it is followed by ten online group interviews of up to three patients and a health care proffesional: either a nurse or a physiotherapist. These interviews last around ninety minutes. Four weeks after, an online follow-up interview is made by a cardiology consultant. These interviews focus either on physical exercise instructions (aerobical exercise and endurance exercise) or educational interviews (ischemic cardiomyopathy, Mediterranean diet, pharmacological treatment, sexual dysfunction, stress management techniques and solution of questions). RESULTS: Up to eighty-four patients were included in our CRH program (this means 83% of patients discharged from our hospital after an acute coronary event). Median of time from discharge to first online interview was 8""79 days and from this last one to program beginning, 3""67 days. Four weeks after the beginning of the program, 82% of the patients presented with a LDL-cholesterol level below aim level (< 55 mg/dL). Workout, Mediterranean diet and tobacco abstinence observance rates were over 90%. There were just three patients who gave up or did not complete the program. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has arisen a huge challenge for ongoing CRH programs in Spain, the benefit that has been showed by them on cardiovascular health, makes it necessary to develop new tools to allow them going on. New technologies are an opportunity for us to keep on following these patients, moreover showing good results as for adherence, availability and patient and operator assesssment.","Severo Sanchez, A; Rivero Santana, B; Arbas Redondo, E; Juarez Olmos, VM; Poveda Pinedo, D; Tebar Marquez, D; Dalmau Gonzalez-Galarza, R; Castro Conde, A",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8136057/,163

Quantifying student academic performance is challenging because academic performance of students hinges on several factors. The in hand research work focuses on students’ grade and marks prediction utilizing supervised ML approaches. The data-set utilized in this research work has been obtained from the Board of Intermediate & Secondary Education (B.I.S.E) Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There are 7 areas in BISEP i.e., Peshawar, FR-Peshawar, Charsadda, Khyber, Mohmand and Upper and Lower Chitral. This paper aims to examine the quality of education that is closely related to the aims of sustainability. The system has created an abundance of data which needs to be properly analyzed so that most useful information should be obtained for planning and future development. Grade and marks forecasting of students with their historical educational record is a renowned and valuable application in the EDM. It becomes an incredible information source that could be utilized in various ways to enhance the standard of education nationwide. Relevant research study reveals that numerous methods for academic performance forecasting are built to carryout improvements in administrative and teaching staff of academic organizations. In the put forwarded approach, the acquired data-set is pre-processed to purify the data quality, the labeled academic historical data of student (30 optimum attributes) is utilized to train regression model and DT-classifier. The regression will forecast marks, while grade will be forecasted by classification system, eventually analyzed the results obtained by the models. The results obtained show that machine learning technology is efficient and relevant for predicting students performance.","Hussain, Shah; Khan, Muhammad Qasim",Ann,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8173503/,163

METHODS: Sixty residents from three orthopaedic residencies were included in this study during May 2020. Trauma, pediatrics, and hip/knee reconstruction (joints) were chosen as testing topics. Residents took a standardized pretest of 30 questions per topic, followed by the completion of 50 questions per day for 5 days using one of the three web-based programs, followed by a standardized subject-specific posttest. This cycle was repeated for all the three topics. Bivariate statistics and a mixed-effects linear regression model were used to compare improvements in the scores. RESULTS: Across all learning platforms, topics, and postgraduate year classes, posttest scores were 4.4% higher than the pretest score (73.3% vs. 68.9%, P < 0.001): 6.8% higher with OB, 5.4% with RS, and 1.0% with CC. The score improvement with OB was significantly greater than the score improvement with CC (P < 0.001).

The proposed hedge fund mechanism facilitates crowdsourcing, addressing the challenge of determining problems with broad societal interest; the ever-growing prize allows for an emergent rather than predetermined reward; the patent repository turns private intellectual property into a public good for target problems while circumventing the inventors’ threat of patent expiration.

The efficacy of ranolazine, a late sodium channel blocker, in patients with symptomatic obstructive coronary artery disease is well established. To evaluate the efficacy of ranolazine in CMD, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and conference abstracts were searched from January 1975 to March 2020. Randomized trials evaluating ranolazine in patients with CMD were screened. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. End points of interest included a change in angina measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), coronary flow reserve (CFR), and clinical outcomes. Data were combined using random-effects models. Results Of 836 citations, 6 randomized studies (318 patients) were included. Median follow-up was 4 weeks. When pooling the 6 trials analyzing ranolazine, we found that patients treated with ranolazine had a higher SAQ value regarding physical functioning (mean difference, 6.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.41; 10.42) quality of life (10.07; 95% CI, 3.4; 16.74), and angina stability (20.14; 95% CI, 10.12; 30.17), as well as improved CFR (0.27; 95% CI, 0.09; 0.45) compared with placebo/control therapy. A high heterogeneity was observed (range I 2, 30%-84%). Conclusions In CMD, ranolazine may be associated with improvements in CFR and some of the SAQ domains, including angina stability, physical functioning, and quality of life. However, it does not seem to beneficially impact angina frequency and treatment satisfaction. It is also unknown if it improves prognosis of afflicted patients.","Kofler, Thomas; Hess, Stefanie; Moccetti, Federico; Pepine, Carl J; Attinger, Adrian; Wolfrum, Mathias; Toggweiler, Stefan; Kobza, Richard; Cuculi, Florim; Bossard, Matthias",CJC open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjco.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458636/,163
60854,Robotic Sacrocolpopexy for Treatment of Apical Compartment Prolapse.,2020-06-01,"Enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses or influenza virus require proteolytic cleavage of their fusion protein to be able to infect the host cell. Often viruses exhibit cell and tissue tropism and are adapted to specific cell or tissue proteases. Moreover, these viruses can introduce mutations or insertions into their genome during replication that may affect the cleavage, and thus can contribute to adaptations to a new host. Here, we present a fluorogenic peptide cleavage assay that allows a rapid screening of peptides mimicking the cleavage site of viral fusion proteins. The technique is very flexible and can be used to investigate the proteolytic activity of a single protease on many different substrates, and in addition, it also allows exploration of the activity of multiple proteases on one or more peptide substrates. In this study, we used peptides mimicking the cleavage site motifs of the coronavirus spike protein. We tested human and camel derived Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (MERS-CoV) to demonstrate that single and double substitutions in the cleavage site can alter the activity of furin and dramatically change cleavage efficiency. We also used this method in combination with bioinformatics to test furin cleavage activity of feline coronavirus spike proteins from different serotypes and strains. This peptide-based method is less labor- and time intensive than conventional methods used for the analysis of proteolytic activity for viruses, and results can be obtained within a single day.","Jaimes, Javier A; Millet, Jean K; Goldstein, Monty E; Whittaker, Gary R; Straus, Marco R",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/58892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30688313/,163

This study aimed to describe surgical outcomes and learning curve of intracorporeal ileal conduit (ICIC) following laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC) at a single institution. METHODS From June 2012 to February 2018, 38 patients with bladder cancer underwent LRC with ileal conduit at our institution. Surgical outcomes were compared between ICIC (n = 30) and extracorporeal ileal conduit (ECIC) (n = 8). The learning curve during ICIC with regard to the operative time and complication rate was compared. RESULTS No significant differences in patient characteristics between the ICIC and ECIC groups were found. Comparison of outcomes between the ICIC and ECIC groups were as follows: median total operative time, 688 vs 713 minutes; urinary diversion time, 213 vs 192 minutes; and estimated blood loss, 450 vs 420 mL, respectively. The median time to walking and oral intake were similar in both groups. Rates of high-grade complications associated with urinary diversion (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ III) were 3% in ICIC and 25% in ECIC. Although 25% of ECIC patients developed wound dehiscence (Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb), no patient in the ICIC group had postoperative wound infection. For the learning curve of ICIC (n = 30), urinary diversion time decreased significantly (27 minutes decrease per 10 cases, P = .02). Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II complication did not occur after 20 cases. CONCLUSIONS LRC with ICIC could be performed safely with low incidence of severe wound infection compared with ECIC. The incidence and severity of complications also decreased with time.","Kubota, Masashi; Kokubun, Hidetoshi; Yamaguchi, Ritsuki; Murata, Shiori; Makita, Noriyuki; Suzuki, Issei; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Abe, Yohei; Tohi, Yoichiro; Tsutsumi, Naofumi; Sugino, Yoshio; Inoue, Koji; Kawakita, Mutsushi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32110836/,163

61884,Correction.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND The starch retrogradation and moisture migration of boiled wheat noodles (BWNs) result in quality deterioration and short shelf life. The objective of this research was to investigate whether konjac glucomannan (KGM) could improve the quality of BWNs and further establish the shelf-life prediction model. RESULTS The moisture distribution, recrystallization and thermal properties of BWNs during refrigerated or ambient temperature storage were determined. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that KGM addition induced left-shifts of T21 and T22 values, indicating that KGM limited the mobility of bound and immobile water among noodle matrices. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that KGM did not change the crystal patterns of BWNs but could inhibit the starch recrystallization after refrigerated storage. The Tp and ΔH values of retrograded samples notably (p<0.05) decreased with the increase of KGM addition, suggesting the hinderance of starch retrogradation behavior by KGM. The shelf life of BWNs was predicted by accelerated storage test combined with Arrhenius Equation. Present data displayed that the predicted shelf life of vacuum-packed and sterilized BWNs with 10 g∙Kg-1 KGM at 25°C was 733 days, 2.4 folds of the control group. CONCLUSION The BWNs with KGM addition could inhibit starch retrogradation and improve the storage stability, consequently promoting the noodle quality. This article is protected by copyright.

62264,Formulation and characterization of poloxamine-based hydrogels as tissue sealants.,2012,"BACKGROUND CSL112 is a new formulation of human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) being developed to reduce cardiovascular events following acute coronary syndrome. This phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, dose-ranging trial represents the first clinical investigation to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of a CSL112 infusion among patients with stable atherosclerotic disease. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients were randomized to single ascending doses of CSL112 (1.7, 3.4, or 6.8 g) or placebo, administered over a 2-hour period. Primary safety assessments consisted of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations >3× upper limits of normal and study drug-related adverse events. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments included apoA-I plasma concentration and measures of the ability of serum to promote cholesterol efflux from cells ex vivo. Of 45 patients randomized, 7, 12, and 14 received 1.7-, 3.4-, and 6.8-g CSL112, respectively, and 11 received placebo. There were no clinically significant elevations (>3× upper limit of normal) in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase. Adverse events were nonserious and mild and occurred in 5 (71%), 5 (41%), and 6 (43%) patients in the CSL112 1.7-, 3.4-, and 6.8-g groups, respectively, compared with 3 (27%) placebo patients. The imbalance in adverse events was attributable to vessel puncture/infusion-site bruising. CSL112 resulted in rapid (T(max)≈2 hours) and dose-dependent increases in apoA-I (145% increase in the 6.8-g group) and total cholesterol efflux (up to 3.1-fold higher than placebo) (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS CSL112 infusion was well tolerated in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease. CSL112 immediately raised apoA-I levels and caused a rapid and marked increase in the capacity of serum to efflux cholesterol. This potential novel approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis warrants further investigation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.

63503,Functionally assessing coronavirus entry.,2020-04-09,"BACKGROUND Surgical procedures have undergone considerable advancement during the last few decades. More recently, the availability of some imaging methods intraoperatively has added a new dimension to minimally invasive techniques. Augmented reality in surgery has been a topic of intense interest and research. METHODS Augmented reality involves usage of computer vision algorithms on video from endoscopic cameras or cameras mounted in the operating room to provide the surgeon additional information that he or she otherwise would have to recognize intuitively. One of the techniques combines a virtual preoperative model of the patient with the endoscope camera using natural or artificial landmarks to provide an augmented reality view in the operating room. The authors' approach is to provide this with the least number of changes to the operating room. Software architecture is presented to provide interactive adjustment in the registration of a three-dimensional (3D) model and endoscope video. RESULTS Augmented reality including adrenalectomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and retrocaval ureter and pancreas was used to perform 12 surgeries. The general feedback from the surgeons has been very positive not only in terms of deciding the positions for inserting points but also in knowing the least change in anatomy. CONCLUSIONS The approach involves providing a deformable 3D model architecture and its application to the operating room. A 3D model with a deformable structure is needed to show the shape change of soft tissue during the surgery. The software architecture to provide interactive adjustment in registration of the 3D model and endoscope video with adjustability of every 3D model is presented.","Vemuri, Anant S; Wu, Jungle Chi-Hsiang; Liu, Kai-Che; Wu, Hurng-Sheng",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2395-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736284/,163

Lack of research on these ethical decisions in the face of disasters regarding the 3Rs-rationing (triage and allocating scarce resources), restrictions (quarantine and the denial of care based on some criteria or the magnitude of the disaster), and responsibility (duty to treat and duty to report for work)-will leave nurses to make decisions in the throws of disaster rather than before the crisis occurs. This chapter focuses on conducting ethically sound nursing research in disasters. A survey of the literature on the topic to include current research on the 3Rs, frameworks, and methodological problems will be examined. This chapter concludes with a call to action for the nursing profession to accept their role as patient advocates and drive the research necessary to avoid the ethical pitfalls seen in recent disaster decisions and scenarios.","Shafer, Michaela R; Stocks, Laurel",Annual review of nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1891/0739-6686.30.47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894052/,163

Long-term data on the efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) for the treatment of gastric VE are lacking. METHODS We retrospectively identified consecutive patients, between January 2005 and December 2010, treated with APC for an index diagnosis of gastric VE. Clinical and endoscopic features and APC treatment success were recorded. Treatment success was determined by resolution of symptoms and stabilization of the hemoglobin level at 30% above baseline. RESULTS A total of 62 patients [28 (45.2%) male] with a mean age of 72.6 ± 12.8 years, who had undergone 159 upper endoscopies (mean 2.6, range 1-10), including 140 APC sessions (mean 2.3, range 1-10), were identified. The duration of follow-up was 46.9 ± 26.5 months. Treatment success was achieved in 16 (25.8%) patients. Predictors of success included older age, focal pattern, lack of comorbid liver failure or collagen vascular disease, use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, and lower baseline hemoglobin level. Of the patients, 26 (41.9%) died during follow-up. CONCLUSION APC is safe and effective for the initial management of gastric VE; however, most patients do not experience long-term resolution of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.","Boltin, Doron; Gingold-Belfer, Rachel; Lichtenstein, Lev; Levi, Zohar; Niv, Yaron",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000000047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743501/,163

For the first time at great scale, Chinese college students had their educational activities moved online in spring 2020. Due to this unexpected isolation and unconventional learning method, their mental health following returning to school is worth investigating. METHODS Between June 1 and June 15, 2020, a total of 8,921 returning college students' mental health status were assessed using instruments designed for psychiatric disorders, namely the 9-Item Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 6-Item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), Youth Self Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS), and self-developed questionnaire. RESULTS Our results showed that 8.7%, 4.2%, 10.5%, and 6.1% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia, respectively, with a total of 19.8% reporting having at least one psychiatric symptom following their return to school. Sophomore and Senior year, and presence of previous psychiatric conditions contribute to the increased occurrence of psychiatric issues. The level of impact by COVID-19 on one's daily functioning is also positively associated with poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggested no significant increase in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, following the first batch of students' return to school. These findings aim to complement the current understanding of the psychiatric impact of COVID-19 on students and assist school principals to plan their return-to-school approaches in a mental-health sensitive way.","Wang, Dongfang; Chen, Huilin; Zhai, Shuyi; Zhu, Zhiyi; Huang, Shuiqing; Zhou, Xiuzhu; Pan, Ye; Meng, Dongjing; Yang, Zheng; Zhao, Jingbo; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799046/,163

We hypothesized that unlike global functional residual capacity (FRC), component sector gas volumes and their corresponding regional tidal expansions would vary markedly in the setting of unilateral pleural effusion (PLEF), owing to shifting distributions of aeration and collapse as posture changed. METHODS Six deeply anesthetized swine underwent tracheostomy, thoracostomy, and experimental PLEF with 10 mL/kg of radiopaque isotonic fluid randomly instilled into either pleural space. Animals were ventilated at VT = 10 mL/kg, frequency = 15 bpm, I/E = 1:2, PEEP = 1 cmH2O, and FiO2 = 0.5. Quantitative lung computed tomographic (CT) analysis of regional aeration and global FRC measurements by nitrogen wash-in/wash-out technique was performed in each of these randomly applied positions: semi-Fowler's (inclined 30° from horizontal in the sagittal plane); prone, supine, and lateral positions with dependent PLEF and non-dependent PLEF. RESULTS No significant differences in total FRC were observed among the horizontal positions, either at baseline (p = 0.9037) or with PLEF (p = 0.58). However, component sector total gas volumes in each phase of the tidal cycle were different within all studied positions with and without PLEF (p = < .01). Compared to other positions, prone and lateral positions with non-dependent PLEF had more homogenous VT distributions among quadrants (p = .051). Supine position was associated with most dependent collapse and greatest tendency for tidal recruitment (48 vs ~ 22%, p = 0.0073). CONCLUSIONS Changes in body position in the setting of effusion-caused chest asymmetry markedly affected the internal distributions of gas volume, collapse, ventilation, and tidal recruitment, even though global FRC measurements provided little indication of these potentially important positional changes.","Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Gard, Kenneth E; Adams, Alexander B; Dries, David J; Quintel, Michael; Oeckler, Richard A; Gattinoni, Luciano; Marini, John J",Intensive care medicine experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-018-0175-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29633056/,163

Social isolation alone can lead to various psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, low mood, fear, frustration, and boredom. School nurses serve a vital role in addressing stress among adolescents by initiating early interventions, ensuring positive school experiences for students, and providing support surrounding the development of mental health disorders. Through implementation of NASN's Framework for 21st Century School Nursing Practice, school nurses address stress among high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovative interventions can include recognizing signs and symptoms of stress on physical and emotional health, advocating for mental health literacy curriculums, social prescribing, incorporating anticipatory guidance related to health promotion lifestyle practices into each school health encounter, and creating a virtual school health office to reach students while COVID-19 safety isolation continues.","Williams, Marissa L; Morse, Brenna L; DeGraffenried, Wendy; McAuliffe, Diana L",NASN school nurse,https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602x21993053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729054/,163

Here, we present a case of a 49-year-old Caucasian man who presented with an enlarged left flank mass after iliac bone harvest for pseudarthrosis. He had undergone open onlay mesh repair for inferior lumbar hernia, but the hernia recurred 3 months postoperatively. Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair using a composite mesh was performed 7 months after recurrence. The patient was discharged 6 days postoperatively without complications. No signs of recurrence were detected during 1-year follow-up period. The laparoscopic approach for lumbar hernia conferred excellent visualization of the hernia defect and enabled a safe mesh repair using intra-abdominal pressure to hold it in position.

In this study, proteomic profiles of plasma sEVs from normal subjects and diabetic patients with or without diabetic retinopathy (DR) were systematically compared using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. Among a total of 901 identified proteins in plasma sEVs (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%), 90 proteins were found to have significantly changed levels in DR. Based on the findings from the proteomic analysis, the role of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) in promoting human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) proliferation was investigated. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that TNFAIP8 levels in plasma sEVs and vitreous are elevated in DR, whereas not statistically different in large EVs (lEVs) and plasma. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) increased the expression of TNFAIP8 in HRMECs. TNFAIP8 significantly increased HRMECs cell viability and promote cell migration and tube formation, and the depletion of TNFAIP8 impaired HRMEC proliferation. We demonstrated that TNFAIP8 in plasma sEVs could be used as a potential biomarker of DR. Functional studies suggested that TNFAIP8 might be an important mediator of angiogenesis in DR.","Xiao, Jing; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Fuhua; Xiao, Mengran; Zhou, Lei; Yu, Rongguo; Shao, Xianfeng; Ea, Vicki; Su, Lin; Zhang, Xiaomin; Li, Xiaorong",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c01048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594895/,163

The study included 34 patients (23 males; mean age 60.2±16.6 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia. Besides standard medical examination the AHA blood levels were observed, including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA), anti-cardiomyocyte antibodies (AbC), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) and cardiac conducting tissue antibodies (CCTA). Median hospital length of stay was 14 [13; 18] days. AHA levels were increased in 25 (73.5%) patients. Significant correlation (p<0.05) of AHA levels with cardiovascular manifestations (r = 0.459) was found. AbC levels correlated with pneumonia severity (r = 0.472), respiratory failure (r = 0.387), need for invasive ventilation (r = 0.469), chest pain (r = 0.374), low QRS voltage (r = 0.415) and levels of CRP (r = 0.360) and LDH (r = 0.360). ASMA levels were found to correlate with atrial fibrillation (r = 0.414, p<0.05). ANA and AbC levels correlated with pericardial effusion (r = 0.721 and r = 0.745 respectively, p<0.05). The lethality rate was 8.8%. AbC and ASMA levels correlated significantly with lethality (r = 0.363, and r = 0.426 respectively, p<0.05) and were prognostically important.

Prior morphometric studies have frequently reported volumetric reductions in patients with MDD--especially in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus--but few studies have investigated whether these changes are exacerbated by prior episodes. METHODS In a sample of 103 medication-free patients with depression and control subjects with no history of depression, structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed to examine relationships between number of prior episodes, current stress, hippocampal subfield volume and cortical thickness. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus were performed using a recently validated subfield segmentation approach, and cortical thickness estimates were obtained using vertex-based methods. Participants were grouped on the basis of the number of prior depressive episodes and current depressive diagnosis. RESULTS Number of prior episodes was associated with both lower reported stress levels and reduced volume in the dentate gyrus. Cortical thinning of the left mPFC was associated with a greater number of prior depressive episodes but not current depressive diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, these findings are consistent with preclinical models suggesting that the dentate gyrus and mPFC are especially vulnerable to stress exposure and provide evidence for morphometric changes that are consistent with stress-sensitization models of recurrence in MDD.","Treadway, Michael T; Waskom, Michael L; Dillon, Daniel G; Holmes, Avram J; Park, Min Tae M; Chakravarty, M Mallar; Dutra, Sunny J; Polli, Frida E; Iosifescu, Dan V; Fava, Maurizio; Gabrieli, John D E; Pizzagalli, Diego A",Biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109665/,163

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING General and cardiothoracic ICU, tertiary hospital. PATIENTS Twenty-six postoperative patients. INTERVENTION Two hundred and fifty-milliliter fluid challenge performed over 5 minutes. Data were recorded over 10 minutes after the end of fluid infusion MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Cardiac output was measured with a calibrated LiDCOplus (LiDCO, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and Navigator (Applied Physiology, Sydney, Australia) to obtain the Pmsf analogue (Pmsa). Pharmacodynamics outcomes were modeled using a Bayesian inferential approach and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. Parameter estimates were summarized as the means of their posterior distributions, and their uncertainty was assessed by the 95% credible intervals. Bayesian probabilities for groups' effect were also derived. The predicted maximal effect on cardiac output was observed at 1.2 minutes (95% credible interval, -0.6 to 2.8 min) in responders. The probability that the estimated area under the curve of central venous pressure was smaller in nonresponders was 0.12. (estimated difference, -4.91 mm Hg·min [95% credible interval, -13.45 to 3.3 mm Hg min]). After 10 minutes, there is no evidence of a difference between groups for any hemodynamic variable. CONCLUSIONS The maximal change in cardiac output should be assessed 1 minute after the end of the fluid infusion. The global effect of the fluid challenge on central venous pressure is greater in nonresponders, but not the change observed 10 minutes after the fluid infusion. The effect of a fluid challenge on hemodynamics is dissipated in 10 minutes similarly in both groups.","Aya, Hollmann D; Ster, Irina Chis; Fletcher, Nick; Grounds, R Michael; Rhodes, Andrew; Cecconi, Maurizio",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26683506/,163

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Horses (n = 26) having nephrosplenic space obliteration using prosthetic mesh. METHODS Horses undergoing mesh obliteration between January 2006 and May 2013 were included. A Proxplast™ mesh was secured to the nephrosplenic space with titanium helical coils in standing horses using laparoscopic technique. Perioperative data were obtained from the medical record and by telephone followup. Tests of proportion were used to compare the study population to the hospital colic population. Occurrence of colic within 1 year of obliteration was compared between horses where the diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy and those diagnosed by abdominal palpation per rectum using a Fisher's exact test. RESULTS All 26 horses undergoing mesh obliteration during the study period survived to discharge. Long term followup was available for 25 horses, with 23 returning to their previous level of function, and 21 alive at the time of followup. Cause of death was not associated with the surgical procedure in any case. Geldings and Warmbloods were overrepresented compared to the hospital colic population. Ten horses (38%) demonstrated colic after mesh obliteration. All 10 horses were examined by a veterinarian and none were diagnosed with recurrence of nephrosplenic entrapment. CONCLUSION Mesh obliteration of the nephrosplenic space is an effective alternative to suture closure for preventing nephrosplenic entrapment of the large colon in horses. No complications related to mesh obliteration were reported in our study population.","Burke, Megan J; Parente, Eric J",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26767324/,163

Although oncologists respond quickly to this change, anxiety caused by pandemics in some patients prevented cancer treatment. Although patients know that delaying cancer treatment can be life-threatening, they are concerned about contacting the hospital because they are afraid of becoming infected with COVID-19. Here, we would like to present three patients with delayed admission to the hospital to draw attention to the harmful consequences of COVID-19 fear in the community. These patients with cancer-related anxiety may exaggerate protective attitudes during the pandemic process, leading to delayed oncological treatment and poor prognosis of the patient.","Sutcuoglu, Osman; Yazici, Ozan; Ozet, Ahmet; Ozdemir, Nuriye",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355162/,163

Methods We obtained the texts of countries' annual statements in United Nations (UN) general debates from 2000 to 2019 and their nationally determined contributions at the Paris Agreement in 2016. To measure countries' engagement, we used a keyword-in-context text search with relevant search terms to count the total number of references to the relationship of health to climate change. We used a machine learning model (random forest predictions) to identify the most important country-level predictors of engagement. The predictors included political and economic factors, health outcomes, climate change-related variables and membership of political negotiating groups in the UN. Findings For both UN general debate statements and nationally determined contributions, low- and middle-income countries discussed the health impacts of climate change much more than did high-income countries. The most important predictors of engagement were health outcomes (infant mortality, maternal deaths, life expectancy), countries' income levels (gross domestic product per capita), and fossil fuel consumption. Membership of political negotiating groups (such as the Group of 77 and Small Island Developing States) was a less important predictor. Conclusion Our analysis indicated a higher engagement in countries that carry the heaviest climate-related health burdens, but lack necessary resources to address the impacts of climate change. These countries are shouldering responsibility for reminding the global community of the implications of climate change for people's health.","Dasandi, Niheer; Graham, Hilary; Lampard, Pete; Jankin Mikhaylov, Slava",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.270033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551504/,163

The disease has enormous potential for transmissibility and requires drastic governmental measures, guided by social distancing and the use of protective devices (gloves, masks, and facial shields). Once the need for admission to the ICU is characterized, a set of essentially supportive therapies are adopted in order to offer multi-organic support and allow time for healing. Typically, patients who require ventilatory support have bilateral infiltrates in the chest X-ray and chest computed tomography showing ground-glass pulmonary opacities and subsegmental consolidations.

70775,Ordering with a twist.,2020-07-01,"The feasibility of simultaneous treatment of multiple wastes via co-digestion was studied in semi-continuous mode at mesophilic conditions. The obtained results indicated that sewage sludge, organic fraction of municipal waste (OFMSW) and grease trap sludge (GTS) possess complementary properties that can be combined for successful anaerobic digestion. During the co-digestion period, methane yield and VS removal were significantly higher in comparison to digestion of sewage sludge alone. Addition of GTS to digesters treating sewage sludge resulted in increased VS removal and methane yield up to 13% (from 50 to 56.4) and 52% (from 300 to 456,547m3/Mg VSadd), respectively. While the use of OFMSW as the next co-substrate in the feedstock, can boost methane yield and VS removal up to 82% (300-547m3/Mg VSadd) and approximately 29% (from 50% to 64.7%), respectively. Moreover, the results of the present laboratory study revealed that the addition of co-substrates to the feedstock had a significant influence on biogas composition. During the experiment methane content in biogas ranged from 67% to 69%. While, the concentration of LCFAs was increasing with the gradual increase in the share of co-substrates in the mixtures, wherein only the oleic acid was higher than some inhibition concentrations which have been reported in the literature. However, it did not significantly affect the efficiency of the co-digestion process.","Grosser, A; Neczaj, E; Singh, B R; Almås, Å R; Brattebø, H; Kacprzak, M",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28237904/,163

The clinical impact of these findings has, however, not been fully evaluated. We aimed to compare patients with a pure bacterial etiology with those with findings of both bacteria and virus regarding severity of illness and length of hospital stay. METHODS Adults with CAP admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively (N = 184). Microbiological methods included cultures from blood, sputum and nasopharyngeal secretions; sputum samples analyzed with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed with polymerase chain reaction and serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detecting pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to assess the severity of illness. RESULTS The likelihood of getting a score corresponding to PSI classes IV or V was higher in patients with findings of both bacteria and virus than in those with a bacterial pathogen alone (odds ratio 4.98, 95% confidence interval 2.09-11.89; p < 0.001). The median length of hospital stay was 7 days among patients with mixed infections and 4 days among those with a bacterial etiology alone (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS Patients infected with a virus and a bacterial pathogen more often develop severe CAP and have a longer hospitalization than those with a bacterial etiology alone.","Johansson, Niclas; Kalin, Mats; Hedlund, Jonas",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3109/00365548.2011.570785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21466255/,163

71535,Advances in promoter engineering: novel applications and predefined transcriptional control.,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND While many Aotearoa/New Zealanders are receiving excellent palliative care the Pacific populations have limited access to available hospice and palliative care services. Little research has been conducted to identify barriers unique to Pacific populations accessing these services. The purpose of this study was to explore key stakeholders' perspectives on the determinants of low access among Pacific populations to these services. METHODS Forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with hospice patients and their families, hospice/health providers and key informants from the Auckland and Wellington region of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was carried out by identifying, coding and categorising patterns in the data. Identified themes were then discussed further to determine the relevance of the data grouped by theme. RESULTS Five interrelated themes affecting access emerged: perception of hospice (often negative) through lack of accurate information, but changing; families' role to look after their own and sick elderly; hospice experiences; continuity of care in the community and the need for information and communication. CONCLUSION Hospice and associated palliative care services are under-utilised and commonly misunderstood among Pacific populations in Aotearoa/New Zealand. There is active support following appropriate information received, hence the need for community education and culturally appropriate hospice and palliative services. Inadequate inter-professional communication contributes to polypharmacy and inefficiency in continuity of care across all levels. The Pacific individual is one component of a collective that is critical in major decisions in end-of-life and life changing situations.

We performed retrospective analysis of consecutive 468 patients undergoing LS from 1998 to 2017 (295 women; median age 47 years). The patients were divided into difficult LS and control groups. The inclusion criteria for difficult LS were operative time ≥mean + 2SD; intraoperative blood loss ≥500 mL, intraoperative adverse events (IAE), conversion. Primary outcomes were risk factors for difficult splenectomy and secondary outcomes for perioperative morbidity. Fifty-six patients were included in the difficult LS group (12%). Spleens ≥19 cm and higher participation of younger surgeons in consecutive years were predictive for difficult splenectomy. Age ≥53 years and diagnosis other than idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) were independent risk factors of spleen ≥19 cm. The perioperative morbidity was 8.33%; its OR was increased only by blood loss and IAEs. Only blood loss significantly increased serious morbidity. Male sex, spleens ≥19 cm, and IAEs were independent risk factors for intraoperative hemorrhage. Spleen length ≥19 cm was a risk factor for difficult LS and intraoperative hemorrhage. Diagnoses other than ITP in patients aged ≥53 years with ≥19 cm spleens are predictive for intraoperative difficulties and perioperative complications.","Wysocki, Michał; Radkowiak, Dorota; Zychowicz, Anna; Rubinkiewicz, Mateusz; Kulawik, Jan; Major, Piotr; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Budzyński, Andrzej",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm7120547; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30558132/,163

The primary endpoint of the study is standardized mortality rate (SMR; calculated as observed/Expected (O/E) ratio for death from influenza and pneumonia among cancer patients). Competing risk analysis was additionally conducted to evaluate the impact of age on influenza/pneumonia-attributed deaths among selected tumor types. RESULTS The current study evaluates a total of 3,579,199 cancer patients (diagnosed 1975-2016) within the SEER-9 registries; and influenza and pneumonia-attributed deaths represent 1.5% of the recorded deaths for this cohort. SMR for influenza/pneumonia-attributed death within the first year following cancer diagnosis was 1.88 (1.83-1.94); while SMR for influenza/pneumonia-attributed death following the first year was 1.11 (1.10-1.12). Within the first year following cancer diagnosis, SMR from influenza/pneumonia was higher among individuals with black race (SMR for white race: 1.75 (95% CI: 1.69-1.81) while SMR for black race: 2.90 (95% CI: 2.65-3.16), lung cancer (SMR for lung cancer: 4.39 (95% CI: 4.11-4.69)), head and neck cancer (SMR for oral cavity/pharynx cancer: 4.02 (95% CI: 3.50-4.59)), lymphomas (SMR for lymphoma: 3.28 (95% CI: 2.92-3.68)), leukemias (SMR for leukemia: 3.32 (95% CI: 2.89-3.80)) and myeloma (SMR for myeloma: 3.91 (95% CI: 3.28-4.63)).

Many families live in poor quality (N=574, 28%), and overcrowded (N=364, 19%) housing; this was more common in families of Pakistani heritage and other ethnicities. Financial (N=738 (37%), food (N=396, 20%), employment (N=728, 37%) and housing (N=204, 10%) insecurities were common, particularly in those who were furloughed, self-employed not working or unemployed. Clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms were reported by 372 (19%) and 318 (16%) of the mothers and were more common in White British mothers and those with economic insecurity. Open text responses corroborated these findings and highlighted high levels of anxiety about becoming ill or dying from Covid-19. Conclusions: The experiences of the Covid-19 lockdown in this ethnically diverse and deprived population highlight a large number of families living in poor housing conditions, suffering from economic insecurity and poor mental health. There is a need for policy makers and commissioners to better support these families.","Dickerson, Josie; Kelly, Brian; Lockyer, Bridget; Bridges, Sally; Cartwright, Christopher; Willan, Kathryn; Shire, Katy; Crossley, Kirsty; Sheldon, Trevor A; Lawlor, Deborah A; Wright, John; McEachan, Rosemary R C; Pickett, Kate E",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16317.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709038/,163

A spinescence study on different species of rattans.,2020-07-21,"With each passing day, more cases of Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) are being detected and unfortunately the fear of novel corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) becoming a pandemic disease has come true. Constant efforts at individual, national, and international level are being made in order to understand the genomics, hosts, modes of transmission and epidemiological link of nCoV-2019. As of now, whole genome sequence of the newly discovered coronavirus has already been decoded. Genomic characterization nCoV-2019 have shown close homology with bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Structural analysis of the receptor binding site has confirmed that 2019-nCoV binds with the same ACE 2 receptor protein as human SARS virus. Compared to the previous coronavirus outbreaks, the overall mortality rate is relatively low for COVID-2019 (2-3%). Suspected cases must be quarantined till their test comes positive or they clear infection. At present, treatment of COVID-2019 is mostly based on the knowledge gained from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Remdesivir, originally develop as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections, is being studied for it effectiveness against 2019-nCoV infection. Many other antiviral agents and vaccines are being tested but most of them are in phase I or II and hence unlikely to be of any benefit immediately with regards to current outbreak. Hence, the standard infection control techniques and preventive steps for healthy individuals and supportive care for the confirmed cases is the best available strategy to deal with current viral outbreak. .","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Lal, Amos",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2020.1292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297723/,163
76037,Chemodynamic/photothermal synergistic therapy based on Ce-doped Cu-Al layered double hydroxides.,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Social phobia and depression are common, highly comorbid disorders in middle adolescence. The mechanism underlying this comorbidity, however, is unclear. Decrease in self-esteem caused by the initial disorder might play a decisive role in the development of the subsequent disorder. The present study aimed to determine whether the association between symptoms of social phobia and depression is mediated by decrease in self-esteem in mid-adolescent girls and boys. METHODS As a part of the prospective Adolescent Mental Health Cohort (AMCH), subjects of this study were 9th grade pupils (mean age, 15.5) responding to a survey conducted in 2002-2003 (T1) and to a 2-year follow-up survey in 2004-2005 (T2) (N = 2070, mean age 17.6 years, 54.5% girls). RESULTS Symptoms of social phobia without symptoms of depression at age 15 and symptoms of depression at age 17 were associated only among boys, and this association was mediated by decrease in self-esteem. Symptoms of depression without symptoms of social phobia at age 15 and symptoms of social phobia at age 17 were associated only among girls, and this association was partially mediated by decrease in self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS Decrease in self-esteem plays a decisive role in the association between social phobia and depression. Self-esteem should be a key focus in interventions for adolescents suffering from social phobia or depression. Efficient intervention for the first disorder might help to prevent the decline in self-esteem and thus the incidence of the subsequent disorder. These findings are based on a sample of Finnish adolescents and should be confirmed in other jurisdictions or in more ethnically diverse samples.","Väänänen, Juha-Matti; Isomaa, Rasmus; Kaltiala-Heino, Riittakerttu; Fröjd, Sari; Helminen, Mika; Marttunen, Mauri",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-244x-14-79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24641987/,163

76848,"BioTechniques, covers and coronavirus.",2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVE Osteoarthritis (OA) has long been regarded as a disease of cartilage degeneration, whereas mounting evidence implies that low-grade inflammation contributes to OA. Among inflammatory cells involved, macrophages play a crucial role and are mediated by the local microenvironment to exhibit different phenotypes and polarization states. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to uncover the phenotypic alterations of macrophages during OA and summarized the potential therapeutic interventions via modulating macrophages. METHODS A systematic review of multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Medline) was performed up to February 29, 2020. Included articles were discussed and evaluated by two independent reviewers. Relevant information was analyzed with a standardized and well-designed template. RESULTS A total of 28 studies were included. Results were subcategorized into two sections depending on sources from human tissue/cell-based studies (12 studies) and animal experiments (16 studies). The overall observation indicated that M1 macrophages elevated in both synovium and circulation during OA development, along with lower numbers of M2 macrophages. The detailed alterations of macrophages in both synovium and circulation were listed and analyzed. Furthermore, interventions against OA via regulating macrophages in animal models were highlighted. CONCLUSION This study emphasized the importance of the phenotypic alterations of macrophages in OA development. The classical phenotypic subcategory of M1 and M2 macrophages was questionable due to controversial and conflicting results. Therefore, further efforts are needed to categorize macrophages in an exhaustive manner and to use advanced technologies to identify the individual roles of each subtype of macrophages in OA.","Zhu, Xiaobo; Lee, Chien-Wei; Xu, Hongtao; Wang, Yu-Fan; Yung, Patrick S H; Jiang, Yangzi; Lee, Oscar K",Arthritis research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-021-02457-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838669/,163

A low proportion of lymphocytes may express the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also use ACE2-independent pathways to enter lymphocytes. Both SARS-CoV-2- and immune-mediated mechanisms may contribute to the occurrence of lymphopenia through influencing the lymphocyte production, survival, or tissue re-distribution. The metabolic and biochemical changes can also affect the production and survival of lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients. Lymphopenia can cause general immunosuppression and promote cytokine storm, both of them play an important role in the viral persistence, viral replication, multi-organ failure and eventually death. Here, a comprehensive view concerning the possible mechanisms that may lead to the lymphocyte reduction in COVID-19 patients is provided, while highlighting the potential intervention approaches to prevent lymphopenia.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Jafarzadeh, Sara; Nozari, Parvin; Mokhtari, Pejman; Nemati, Maryam",Scandinavian journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/sji.12967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875598/,163

We report data from a large Italian outbreak of botulism, with patients evaluated at different timepoints after poisoning. METHODS Eighteen male patients (mean age 47 ± 8.4 years) underwent 22 clinical and neurophysiological evaluations (4 patients were re-evaluated). The resting compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude, postexercise CMAP amplitude, CMAP change after high-frequency (50 Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation (HFRNS), and motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) were assessed in the acute (4-8 days after poisoning; 5 patients), early post-acute (32-39 days after poisoning; 5 patients), and late post-acute (66-80 days after poisoning; 12 patients) phases. RESULTS In the acute, early post-acute, and late post-acute phases, respectively, reduced CMAP amplitudes were found in 100%, 20%, and 17% of patients; abnormal postexercise CMAP facilitation was observed in 100%, 40%, and 0% of patients; and pathological incremental responses to HFRNS were found in 80%, 50%, and 8% of patients. Baseline CMAP amplitudes, postexercise CMAP facilitation, and CMAP increases in response to HFRNS differed significantly between the acute and post-acute phases. Small MUAPs were found in 100% of patients in the acute and early post-acute phases and in 50% of patients in the late post-acute phase. DISCUSSION The neurophysiological findings of foodborne botulism vary considerably according to the evaluation timepoint. In the post-acute phase, different neurophysiological techniques must be applied to support a diagnosis of botulism.","Boccagni, Cristina; Prestandrea, Caterina; D'Agostino, Tiziana; Rubino, Francesca; Renda, Maurizio; Sesti, Emanuele; Bagnato, Sergio",Muscle & nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255868/,163

This requires movement of animals, which is inherent with disease risks, such as the introduction of pathogenic Mycobacterium sp. (MTBC) into a zoological collection. Decisions need to be made based on the outcome of perimovement disease screening using an array of tests, the majority of which are unvalidated in the species. A pair of endangered Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) imported from India to the United Kingdom were screened for MTBC using the comparative intradermal tuberculosis (TB) test, the feline interferon-γ blood test, and the experimental bacteriophage assay. Reactions on all three tests prompted screening of the three resident Asiatic lions using the same tests, all of which were negative for MTBC. Based on these test results, the decision had to be made to exclude the genetically valuable pair from the current collection. MTBC could not be identified using further tests, including culture and PCR on a bronchoalveolar lavage, on feces, or on postmortem tissues. This case series highlights the usefulness of a control group when interpreting unvalidated test results for detection of MTBC, the value of training big cats for conscious blood sampling, and the practical implications of placing the comparative intradermal TB test in the eyelids, when dealing with a species that requires a general anesthetic for most hands-on interventions.","Molenaar, Fieke Marije; Burr, Paul D; Swift, Benjamin M C; Rees, Catherine E D; Masters, Nicholas",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2019-0084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32549574/,163
79592,One Health Integration: A Proposed Framework for a Study on Veterinarians and Zoonotic Disease Management in Ghana.,2018,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that people can adapt quickly to ensure that their social needs are met after being forced to isolate and socially distance. Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music. In a time when people across the globe have been unable to meet in person, they have found a way to meet in the music.

80524,In vitro model to study the biomaterial-dependent reaction of macrophages in an inflammatory environment.,2014,"PURPOSE We have conducted a survey of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in 2005 in Europe with the intention of initiating a regular series of surveys to track usage of the technique. METHODS Information was obtained from 234 centres in 18 counties. The returning centres served 27% of the population of their countries, and estimates of the numbers of MPS per million of population (pmp) were made assuming that the population not reported either performed no studies (lower estimate) or the same number pmp as the reporting centres (upper estimate). RESULTS Estimates of MPS for the countries surveyed ranged from a lower limit of 373 pmp to an upper limit of 1,388 pmp. There were marked variations between countries with higher numbers (lower limit of estimate above the mid range of all countries combined) in Austria, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, Sweden and Slovenia, and lower numbers (upper limit of estimate below the mid range of all countries) in Finland, Germany and Poland. The ratio of MPS to coronary angiography to revascularisation procedures was 0.6 to 1.5 to 1. The median number of studies per centre was 496, with 32% of centres performing fewer than 250 studies in the year. The median waiting time for routine studies was 21 days and for urgent studies 3.4 days. Fifty-three percent of studies used pharmacological stress, with roughly equal numbers of adenosine and dipyridamole. Eighty-two percent of studies used (99m)Tc-based tracers. Tomographic acquisition was almost universal with 65% of studies being ECG-gated and 20% attenuation-corrected. Eighteen percent of studies were reported from hard copy alone, and 60% of studies were reported without viewing the rotating planar data. CONCLUSION We conclude that relatively low numbers of MPS studies are being performed in the surveyed centres, particularly when compared with coronary angiography and revascularisation. The use of (99m)Tc-based tracers is high, but ECG-gated studies are less common. Some reporting practices are not ideal. These data will serve as a valuable baseline for future surveys, which are likely to be more complete.","Underwood, S Richard; Wiener, Susanna",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-008-0942-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18807034/,163

GXNU-MA1.,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND The application of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for advanced procedures in children is logical. However, the intracorporeal placement and tying of suture can be challenging, leading to prolonged anesthesia and morbidity. We describe our initial experience with the use of a novel unidirectional barbed knotless suture (V-LOC, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) that permits a safe and efficient advanced MIS reconstruction in infants and children. METHODS From August 2010 to February 2012, 11 infants and children underwent diaphragmatic reconstruction utilizing either the absorbable or the permanent V-LOC suture. Data retrieval included gender, weight, diagnosis, operative time, complications and follow up. RESULTS Thoracoscopic or laparoscopic repairs were carried out in all children. Two of the infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia of Bochdalek (CDH) developed a recurrence at 4 and 6 months of age and required reoperation. There were no other complications or recurrence in the remaining 9 children, and there were no mortalities in the group. CONCLUSION This is the first study to evaluate the use of the unidirectional barbed knotless suture in pediatric surgery. We demonstrate that the use of the V-LOC barbed suture is an innovative, safe and time saving option for pediatric MIS. Prospective analysis with long-term follow-up is required to confirm these initial results and to ascertain if this novel approach can be utilized in other pediatric surgical conditions.","Lukish, Jeffrey; Rasmussen, Sara; Garrett, Deidra; Stewart, Dylan; Buck, James; Abdullah, Fizan; Colombani, Paul",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2013.03.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845647/,163

81144,A different technique in gasless laparoendoscopic single-site hysterectomy.,2017,"BACKGROUND Measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) with noninvasive ocular ultrasonography have been shown to be accurate in determining increased intracranial pressure. Obesity is associated with chronic increases in intraabdominal pressure that could consequently result in intracranial hypertension. By utilizing ONSD ultrasonographic measurements, we compare the difference that may exist between obese and non-obese patients. STUDY DESIGN We prospectively collected data from patients who underwent laparoscopic procedures in the supine position between July 2013 and March 2014. Ophthalmic pathology was not present in any patient. Ultrasonographic measurement of the ONSD was obtained sagittally with a 12-MHz transducer 3 mm from its origin. The measurements were taken at 0, 15, and 30 min, and at the end of surgery. RESULTS There were 62 subjects, 28 females (45.2 %) and 34 males (54.8 %), with a mean age of 44.22 ± 10.44 years (range 23-66). Forty-eight percent of patients were non-obese, and 52 % of patients were obese. The mean body mass index was 30.70 ± 7.61 kg/m(2) (range 20.0-59.5). The mean ONSD of non-obese and obese patients was 4.7 and 5.5 mm at baseline (p = 0.01), 5.4 and 6.2 mm at 15 min (p = 0.01), 5.8 and 6.6 mm at 30 min (p = 0.01), and 5.1 and 5.7 mm after deflation of pneumoperitoneum (p = 0.03), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Utilizing a noninvasive method to measure the ONSD, a chronic increase in intracranial pressure in obese patients was demonstrated. The increase in the ONSD during laparoscopic procedures reflects a temporary increase in the intracranial pressure from baseline.","Dip, Fernando; Nguyen, David; Sasson, Morris; Lo Menzo, Emanuele; Szomstein, Samuel; Rosenthal, Raul",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4458-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743108/,163

The lockdown measures due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may change the social capital among youths. This study aimed to evaluate changes in social capital before and during COVID-19 lockdown among Chinese youths. It was based on the online COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS) conducted among 10 540 youths at three educational levels, including high/vocational school, undergraduate, and graduate, before and during COVID-19 lockdown. Measures of perceptions of social capital were adapted from a validated Chinese version of Health-related Social Capital Measurement based on youths' characteristics of living and studying environment. Social capital was measured at four dimensions, including individual social capital (ISC), family social capital (FSC), community social capital (CSC), and society social capital (SSC). Overall, compared to before lockdown, ISC and CSC scores decreased, while FSC and SSC scores increased during lockdown. When stratified by educational levels, the trends for each dimension of social capital were consistent with the overall population. There were 43.9%, 5.7%, 32.1%, and 3.7% of the participants showing decreased scores during lockdown for ISC, FSC, CSC, and SSC, respectively, while 7.2%, 24.0%, 15.3%, and 10.7% of participants showed increased scores for ISC, FSC, CSC, and SSC, respectively. Our timely, large-scale study showed decreased social capital in individual and community dimensions and increased social capital in family and society dimensions during lockdown.","Luo, Miyang; Zhang, Dong; Shen, Pengyue; Yin, Yun; Yang, Shujuan; Jia, Peng",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904698/,163

Using a mobile phase composed of 80% methanol and 0.1% formic acid, glycocholic, glycodeoxycholic, and glycochenodeoxycholic acids were separated in less than 4 minutes with sensitivity in the low nM range. Bile acids are thought to contribute to the pathology of various complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease, for instance, Barrett's esophagus, which may eventually lead to esophageal carcinoma. In this pilot study, samples of saliva obtained from 15 patients with Barrett's esophagus of various severities were compared to saliva samples from 10 healthy volunteers. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid was significantly elevated in the patients and principal component analysis of all bile acids could distinguish the most severe Barrett's esophagus patients. We also reported on the detection of glycochenodeoxycholic acid in exhaled breath condensate for the first time. The promising results of this pilot study warrant future investigation, aiming at non-invasive diagnostics of Barrett's esophagus susceptibility in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.","Ďurč, Pavol; Dosedělová, Věra; Foret, František; Dolina, Jiří; Konečný, Štefan; Himmelsbach, Markus; Buchberger, Wolfgang; Kubáň, Petr",Journal of chromatography.

The most common symptoms of illness onset were fever (70, 53.0%), cough (66, 50.0%), and fatigue (58, 43.9%). All patients were categorized into mild or moderate COVID-19 type on admission to hospital, and five (3.8%) progress to the severe COVID-19 type. Sixty six HCWs patients were included in both early and later discharged group. In the logistic analysis, the later discharged patients had longer time for illness onset to hospital admission (per 1 day; OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.03-1.18; P=0.006), higher proportion of >3 onset symptoms clustering (OR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.27-7.62; P=0.01) and higher percentage of other HCWs (OR: 6.20; 95% CI: 1.49-25.80; P=0.01). HCWs patients were young, female, nurse with less comorbidities, and most were mild or moderate COVID-19 type. The later discharged patients exhibited characteristics of longer time for illness onset to hospitalization and clustering of onset symptoms. This article is protected by copyright.

82161,Room for improvement.,2007,"INTRODUCTION Several studies have demonstrated that perioperative hemodynamic optimization has the ability to improve postoperative outcome in high-risk surgical patients. All of these studies aimed at optimizing cardiac output and/or oxygen delivery in the perioperative period. We conducted a survey with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) to assess current hemodynamic management practices in patients undergoing high-risk surgery in Europe and in the United States. METHODS A survey including 33 specific questions was emailed to 2,500 randomly selected active members of the ASA and to active ESA members. RESULTS Overall, 368 questionnaires were completed, 57.1% from ASA and 42.9% from ESA members. Cardiac output is monitored by only 34% of ASA and ESA respondents (P = 0.49) while central venous pressure is monitored by 73% of ASA respondents and 84% of ESA respondents (P < 0.01). Specifically, the pulmonary artery catheter is being used much more frequently in the US than in Europe in the setup of high-risk surgery (85.1% vs. 55.3% respectively, P < 0.001). Clinical experience, blood pressure, central venous pressure, and urine output are the most widely indicators of volume expansion. Finally, 86.5% of ASA respondents and 98.1% of ESA respondents believe that their current hemodynamic management could be improved. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, these results point to a considerable gap between the accumulating evidence about the benefits of perioperative hemodynamic optimization and the available technologies that may facilitate its clinical implementation, and clinical practices in both Europe and the United States.","Cannesson, Maxime; Pestel, Gunther; Ricks, Cameron; Hoeft, Andreas; Perel, Azriel",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc10364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21843353/,163

82713,How anti-ageing drugs could boost COVID vaccines in older people.,2020-10-01,"An example of the East-Freeman Automatic Vent from Oxford was found in the early anaesthesia equipment collection at St George Hospital, Sydney. It weighs less than 200 g and is representative of a group of miniature ventilators that were described in the 1960s, including the Minivent from South Africa and the Microvent from Canada. All relied on a pressure-operated inflating valve that was described in 1966 by Mitchell and Epstein from Oxford. The ventilators were compact, portable and were powered by the gas supply from the anaesthesia machine or other driving source that distended a reservoir bag. The main problem was that they could stick in the inspiratory phase. This led to pressure in the lungs rising towards the driving pressure. There was a risk of barotrauma to the patient if the system was not promptly disconnected. While theyhad provided an alternative to hand bagging, they were superseded, as more sophisticated and safer ventilators became widely available.","Morris, Richard W; Cooper, Michael G",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1177/0310057x20947732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222492/,163

83011,Suture complications in a teaching institution among patients undergoing uterosacral ligament suspension with permanent braided suture.,2010,"BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are lesions that originate from digestive tract walls. Several laparoscopic techniques, including local resections, wedge resections and partial gastrectomies, have been used successfully. However, there are no reports on laparoscopic segmental gastrectomy for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. CASE SUMMARY We present our analysis of 17 patients who were admitted to our hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. All tumors were located in the corpus and antrum of the stomach, close to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The tumors originated from the anterior wall in nine cases and from the posterior wall of the stomach in eight cases. Laparoscopic segmental gastrectomy and end-to-end anastomosis between the proximal and the distal residual stomach were used in all patients. The mean operative time was 112.4 min. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.6 d. Mean operative blood loss was 73.5 mL. There were no leaks, no postoperative bleeding nor need for reintervention. Mean postoperative follow-up was 35.4 mo. The Visick grading index showed fewer gastrointestinal symptoms 3 mo after surgery. Two patients (11.8%) had reflux esophagitis and gastritis. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic segmental gastrectomy may be a new function-preserving gastrectomy that is feasible for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors that grow in the middle third of the stomach and on the lesser stomach curvature.","Ren, Yi-Xing; He, Ming; Ye, Peng-Cheng; Wei, Shou-Jiang",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i15.3365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32874994/,163

METHODS We reviewed eight patients referred to the Colorectal Center from 2014 to 2016 with chronic idiopathic constipation and undergoing a sigmoidectomy and appendicostomy. We analyzed the previous medical treatment, indications for the surgical procedure, and outcomes. RESULTS Age at operation was 5-19 years. Time with constipation was 4-15 years. All patients received multiple laxatives, mainly polyethylene glycol, and all had severe social problems. Four patients have autism. The indication for surgery was an unsuccessful laxative trial, refusal to continue with rectal enemas or both, and social fear of continued fecal incontinence. Post-operatively, all patients were having daily bowel movements without fecal accidents. CONCLUSION Selected patients with chronic idiopathic constipation complicated by megarectosigmoid and fecal incontinence can obtain great benefit from primary sigmoidectomy and appendicostomy.","De La Torre, Luis; Cogley, Kimberly; Calisto, Juan; Nace, Gary; Correa, Catalina",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-016-3913-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27372298/,163
83446,Easy slip-knot: a new simple tying technique for deep sutures.,2011,"Primary dysmenorrhea (PD), as characterized by painful menstrual cramps without organic causes, is associated with central sensitization and brain function changes. Previous studies showed the integrated role of the default mode network (DMN) in the pain connectome and its key contribution on how an individual perceives and copes with pain disorders. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the cingulum bundle connecting hub regions of the DMN was disrupted in young women with PD. Diffusion tensor imaging was obtained in 41 PD patients and 41 matched healthy controls (HC) during their periovulatory phase. The production of prostaglandins (PGs) was obtained in PD patients during their pain-free and pain phases. As compared with HC, PD patients had similar scores of pain intensity, anxiety, and depression in their pain-free phase. However, altered white matter properties mainly located in the posterior section of the cingulum bundle were observed in PD. Besides PGs being related to menstrual pain, a close relationship was found between the white matter properties of the cingulum bundle during the pain-free phase and the severity of the menstrual pain in PD patients. Our study suggested that PD had trait changes of white matter integrities in the cingulum bundle that persisted beyond the time of menstruation. We inferred that altered anatomical connections may lead to less-flexible communication within the DMN, and/or between the DMN and other pain-related brain networks, which may result in the central susceptibility to develop chronic pain conditions in PD's later life.

83677,Suppression of underlying neuronal fluctuations mediates EEG slowing during general anaesthesia.,2018,"Continuous and beat-to-beat monitoring of blood pressure (BP), compared to office-based BP measurement, provides significant advantages in predicting future cardiovascular disease. Traditional BP measurement methods are based on a cuff, which is bulky, obtrusive and not applicable to continuous monitoring. Measurement of pulse transit time (PTT) is one of the prominent cuffless methods for continuous BP monitoring. PTT is the time taken by the pressure pulse to travel between two points in an arterial vessel which is correlated with the BP. In this paper, we present a new cuffless BP method using an array of wrist-worn bio-impedance sensors placed on the radial and the ulnar arteries of the wrist to monitor the arterial pressure pulse from the blood volume changes at each sensor site. BP was accurately estimated by using AdaBoost regression model based on selected arterial pressure pulse features such as transit time, amplitude and slope of the pressure pulse which are dependent on the cardiac activity and the vascular properties of the wrist arteries. A separate model was developed for each subject based on calibration data to capture the individual variations of BP parameters. In this pilot study, data was collected from 10 healthy participants with age ranges from 18 to 30 years after exercising using our custom low-noise bio-impedance sensing hardware. Post-exercise BP was accurately estimated with an average correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.77 and 2.6 mmHg for the diastolic BP and 0.86 and 3.4 mmHg for the systolic BP.","Ibrahim, Bassem; Jafari, Roozbeh",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbcas.2019.2946661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603828/,163

Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase 1/2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T-cell responses after BNT162b1 vaccination from a second, non-randomized open-label phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1 to 50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those in a COVID-19 human convalescent sample (HCS) panel. Day 43 SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralising geometric mean titers were 0.7-fold (1 µg) to 3.5-fold (50 µg) those of the HCS panel. Immune sera broadly neutralised pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1) skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell expansion. Interferon (IFN)γ was produced by a high fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T-cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest multiple beneficial mechanisms with potential to protect against COVID-19.","Sahin, Ugur; Muik, Alexander; Derhovanessian, Evelyna; Vogler, Isabel; Kranz, Lena M; Vormehr, Mathias; Baum, Alina; Pascal, Kristen; Quandt, Jasmin; Maurus, Daniel; Brachtendorf, Sebastian; Lörks, Verena; Sikorski, Julian; Hilker, Rolf; Becker, Dirk; Eller, Ann-Kathrin; Grützner, Jan; Boesler, Carsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Kühnle, Marie-Cristine; Luxemburger, Ulrich; Kemmer-Brück, Alexandra; Langer, David; Bexon, Martin; Bolte, Stefanie; Karikó, Katalin; Palanche, Tania; Fischer, Boris; Schultz, Armin; Shi, Pei-Yong; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Perez, John L; Swanson, Kena A; Loschko, Jakob; Scully, Ingrid L; Cutler, Mark; Kalina, Warren; Kyratsous, Christos A; Cooper, David; Dormitzer, Philip R; Jansen, Kathrin U; Türeci, Özlem",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2814-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998157/,163

However, rates of sexual dysfunction ofup to 50% have been described after TME, and rates of urinary dysfunction of up to 30%. Although other factors are involved, the main cause of postoperative genitourinary dysfunction is intraoperative injury to the pelvic autonomic nerves. The risk is particularly high in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The aim of this study is to compare pre- and post-TME sexual dysfunction, depending on the surgical approach usedin the inferior mesenteric vessels: either directly on the IMA, or from the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) to the IMA. METHODS Prospective, randomized,controlled study of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, who will be randomly assigned to one of two groups depending on the surgical approach to the inferior mesenteric vessels. The main variable is pre- and postoperative sexual dysfunction; secondary variables are visualization and preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves, pre- and postoperative urinary dysfunction, and pre- and postoperative quality of life. The sample will comprise 90 patients, 45 per group.

85765,Dismantling the anti-vaxx industry.,2021-03-01,"Low-cost and high-resolution on-chip microscopes are vital for reducing cost and improving efficiency for modern biomedicine and bioscience. Despite the needs, the conventional microscope design has proven difficult to miniaturize. Here, we report the implementation and application of two high-resolution (approximately 0.9 microm for the first and approximately 0.8 microm for the second), lensless, and fully on-chip microscopes based on the optofluidic microscopy (OFM) method. These systems abandon the conventional microscope design, which requires expensive lenses and large space to magnify images, and instead utilizes microfluidic flow to deliver specimens across array(s) of micrometer-size apertures defined on a metal-coated CMOS sensor to generate direct projection images. The first system utilizes a gravity-driven microfluidic flow for sample scanning and is suited for imaging elongate objects, such as Caenorhabditis elegans; and the second system employs an electrokinetic drive for flow control and is suited for imaging cells and other spherical/ellipsoidal objects. As a demonstration of the OFM for bioscience research, we show that the prototypes can be used to perform automated phenotype characterization of different Caenorhabditis elegans mutant strains, and to image spores and single cellular entities. The optofluidic microscope design, readily fabricable with existing semiconductor and microfluidic technologies, offers low-cost and highly compact imaging solutions. More functionalities, such as on-chip phase and fluorescence imaging, can also be readily adapted into OFM systems. We anticipate that the OFM can significantly address a range of biomedical and bioscience needs, and engender new microscope applications.","Cui, Xiquan; Lee, Lap Man; Heng, Xin; Zhong, Weiwei; Sternberg, Paul W; Psaltis, Demetri; Yang, Changhuei",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0804612105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18663227/,163

METHODS We compared the effect of anesthesia regimen using data from the German Stroke Registry-Endovascular Treatment (GSR-ET) between June 2015 and December 2019. Degree of disability was rated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and good outcome was defined as mRS 0-2. Successful reperfusion was assumed when the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scale was 2b-3. RESULTS Out of 6,635 patients, 67.1% (n=4,453) patients underwent general anesthesia (GA), 24.9% (n=1,650) conscious sedation (CS), and 3.3% (n=219) conversion from CS to GA. Rate of successful reperfusion was similar across all three groups (83.0% vs. 84.2% vs. 82.6%, P=0.149). Compared to the CA-group, the GA-group had a delay from admission to groin (71.0 minutes vs. 61.0 minutes, P<0.001), but a comparable interval from groin to flow restoration (41.0 minutes vs. 39.0 minutes). The CS-group had the lowest rate of periprocedural complications (15.0% vs. 21.0% vs. 28.3%, P<0.001). The CS-group was more likely to have a good outcome at follow-up (42.1% vs. 34.2% vs. 33.5%, P<0.001) and a lower mortality rate (23.4% vs. 34.2% vs. 26.0%, P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, GA was associated with reduced achievement of good functional outcome (odds ratio [OR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.94; P=0.004) and increased mortality (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.64; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis for anterior circulation strokes (n=5,808) showed comparable results. CONCLUSIONS We provide further evidence that CS during MT has advantages over GA in terms of complications, time intervals, and functional outcome.","Feil, Katharina; Herzberg, Moriz; Dorn, Franziska; Tiedt, Steffen; Küpper, Clemens; Thunstedt, Dennis C; Hinske, Ludwig C; Mühlbauer, Konstanze; Goss, Sebastian; Liebig, Thomas; Dieterich, Marianne; Bayer, Andreas; Kellert, Lars",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2020.02404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600707/,163

86771,Tocilizumab prescribing criteria for COVID-19 patients.,2020-10-20,"OBJECTIVES Mutual-aid groups are a central part of many individuals' recovery journeys from substance addiction, and this research aimed to identify the key ingredients of a diverse range of recovery groups. METHODS Individuals from 30 different substance addiction recovery groups across the UK (N = 151, 66% male, M age = 42.5 years) completed a survey, which asked participants to provide a narrative about their recovery group experiences. Participants were also asked to rate the extent to which theorized ingredients of addiction recovery groups were offered by their group, and how important each was to them. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The results indicated that the recovery group components suggested in previous literature were both present and rated as important. Component ratings did not differ depending on the type of group, the length of time the person had been in recovery, nor the length of time they had been involved in the group. The qualitative results identified other important components of recovery groups that had not been identified in the previous literature: presence of like-minded individuals and developing self-awareness and reflection skills. An updated list of recovery group components was thereby created. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the findings provide an in-depth, person-focused perspective on what makes an addiction recovery group successful. Asking group members directly about their experiences allowed us to refine and expand on previously theorized components. The updated components can be used as a template for developing future mutual-aid groups.","Rettie, Hannah C; Hogan, Lee M; Cox, W Miles",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1899228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745420/,163

87401,Periodic TableTalks: The Elements Never Go Out of Style.,2021-04-26,"OPINION STATEMENT Pipeline embolization device (PED) is a flow diverter used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms, particularly those with unfavorable configurations. It works by causing progressive flow redirection leading to thrombosis within the aneurysm. PED was initially approved for adults with large or giant wide-necked (≥4 mm or no discernible neck) aneurysms of the internal carotid artery (ICA) from the petrous to the superior hypophyseal segments. Studies have shown a superior aneurysm occlusion rate of 85 % at 6 months for the PED and mortality ranging from 2.6 to 4 %. There appears to be a knowledge gap in terms of the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy and efficacy of assessing platelet inhibition. However, increasing operator experience and favorable longer-term outcome data have led to the exploration of PED for a wide array of off-label uses. Given the paucity of good-quality studies comparing PED with other endovascular/surgical treatment options, several multicenter randomized trials are currently underway to answer these important questions.","Murthy, Santosh B; Shah, Jharna; Mangat, Halinder S; Stieg, Philip",Current treatment options in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-016-0399-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923606/,163
88092,Surgical management of thymic epithelial tumors.,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND In 2019, there were 70.8 million forcibly displaced people worldwide. Among the top causes of morbidity and mortality were measles, diarrhea, respiratory illness, and malaria. Availability of accurate diagnostics that are of low complexity, affordable, and produce timely results on site without the need for expensive laboratory equipment, extensive training, or distant transport of samples, are essential tools in the response to humanitarian emergencies (HE). Early detection of infectious diseases with epidemic potential and coordinated outbreak response, can result in significant decrease in morbidity and mortality. CONTENT This review explores the utility of point of care and rapid diagnostic tests (POCT/RDTs) in HE and presents a review and analysis of the low complexity, availability, and ease of use of these diagnostic modalities that make them helpful tools in these settings, despite the generally lower test performance metrics associated with them over conventional laboratory-based assays. We review the literature to understand how POCT/RDTs have been used in HE response to produce lifesaving information without the need for a robust system for transporting test samples to more sophisticated laboratories, as this is often prohibitive in areas affected by conflict or natural disasters. SUMMARY We propose that POCT/RDTs be considered essential healthcare tools provided to countries following a HE and suggest that UN agencies and vulnerable countries include effective RDTs in their essential diagnostics as part of their national preparedness and response plans.","Chadwick, Stephen; Townes, David A; Perrone, Lucy A",The journal of applied laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfaa180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33247297/,163

To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:<0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy. However, to exploit the radiobiological advantages given by hypofractionation, greater attention to geometric accuracy is required due to increased sensitivity to treatment uncertainties.","Her, Emily Jungmin; Ebert, Martin Andrew; Kennedy, Angel M; Reynolds, Hayley M; Sun, Yu; Williams, Scott; Haworth, Annette",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab9354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408293/,163

88609,In vivo disassembly of IV administered siRNA matrix nanoparticles at the renal filtration barrier.,2013,"Cellulose binding modules (CBMs) are found widely in different proteins that act on cellulose. Because they allow a very easy way of binding recombinant proteins to cellulose, they have become widespread in many biotechnological applications involving cellulose. One commonly used variant is the CBMCipA from Clostridium thermocellum. Here we studied the oligomerization behavior of CBMCipA, as such solution association may have an impact on its use. As the principal approach, we used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. To enhance our understanding of the possible interactions, we used molecular dynamics simulations. By analysis of the sedimentation velocity data by a discrete model genetic algorithm and by building a binding isotherm based on weight average sedimentation coefficient and by global fitting of sedimentation equilibrium data we found that the CBMCipA shows a weak dimerization interaction with a dissociation constant KD of 90 ± 30 μM. As the KD of CBMCipA binding to cellulose is below 1 μM, we conclude that the dimerization is unlikely to affect cellulose binding. However, at high concentrations used in some applications of the CBMCipA, its dimerization is likely to have a marked effect on its solution behavior.","Fedorov, Dmitrii; Batys, Piotr; Hayes, David B; Sammalkorpi, Maria; Linder, Markus B",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937156/,163

The aim was to assess the cross-cultural and cross-linguistic feasibility of an intervention method developed for English-speaking children. Method A nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used with four baseline data points and 16 intervention sessions per participant. The intervention design incorporated implicit learning principles, high treatment dosage, and control of the phonological neighborhood density of the stimuli. The children (24-39 months) attended 7-9 weeks of twice weekly input-based treatment in which no explicit verbal production was required from the child. Each target word was provided as input a minimum of 64 times in at least two intervention sessions. Treatment feasibility was measured by comparison of how many of the target and control words the child produced across the intervention period, and parent-reported expressive vocabulary checklists were completed for comparison of pre- and postintervention child spoken vocabulary size. An omnibus effect size for the treatment effect of the number of target and control words produced across time was calculated using Kendall's Tau. Results There was a significant treatment effect for target words learned in intervention relative to baselines, and all children produced significantly more target than control words across the intervention period. The effect of phonological neighborhood density on expressive word production could not be evaluated because two of the three children learned all target words. Conclusion The results provide cross-cultural evidence of the feasibility of a model of intervention that incorporated a high-dosage, cross-situational statistical learning paradigm to teach spoken word production to children with small expressive lexicons.","S-Y Ng, Christine; Stokes, Stephanie F; Alt, Mary","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_jslhr-20-00087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197356/,163

89647,Modeling Human Steering Behavior in Teleoperation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles With Varying Speed.,2020-09-10,"Importance Since February 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world, with an epidemiological cluster in Lombardy, Italy. The viral communicability may be mediated by various body fluids, but insufficient information is available on the presence of the virus in human tears. Objectives To investigate the rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in tears collected from patients with COVID-19 by means of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and to assess the association of virus presence with concomitant clinical conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study conducted between April 9 and May 5, 2020. The setting was intensive care units at Azienda Socio-Sanitaria Territoriale (ASST) Sette-Laghi Hospital, University of Insubria, in Varese, Lombardy, Italy. A conjunctival swab was performed in 91 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, which was clinically diagnosed by rRT-PCR assay on nasopharyngeal swabs and by radiological imaging. Conjunctival swabs from 17 additional healthy volunteer participants with no symptoms of COVID-19 were examined to evaluate the availability and applicability of the conjunctival swab test. Exposure SARS-CoV-2 detection by means of rRT-PCR assay performed on the collected samples obtained by conjunctival swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures Conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab results are reported, as well as demographic and clinical data. Results A total of 108 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [14.2] years; 55 female and 53 male) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR assay, including 91 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and 17 were healthy volunteers. SARS-CoV-2 was found on the ocular surface in 52 of 91 patients with COVID-19 (57.1%; 95% CI, 46.3%-67.5%), with a wide variability in the mean viral load from both eyes. Among a subset of 41 patients, concordance of 63.0% (95% CI, 41.0%-81.0%) was found between positive conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab test results when performed within 2 days of each other. In 17 of these patients, nasopharyngeal swab results were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In 10 of these 17 patients, conjunctival swab results were positive for the virus. Conclusions and Relevance In this study, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found on the ocular surface in a large part of this cohort of patients with COVID-19, although the infectivity of this material could not be determined. Because patients may have positive test results with a conjunctival swab and negative results with a nasopharyngeal swab, use of the slightly invasive conjunctival swab may be considered as a supplementary diagnostic test.","Azzolini, Claudio; Donati, Simone; Premi, Elias; Baj, Andreina; Siracusa, Claudia; Genoni, Angelo; Grossi, Paolo A; Azzi, Lorenzo; Sessa, Fausto; Dentali, Francesco; Severgnini, Paolo; Minoja, Giulio; Cabrini, Luca; Chiaravalli, Maurizio; Veronesi, Giovanni; Carcano, Giulio; Maffioli, Lorenzo S; Tagliabue, Angelo",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.5464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662099/,163

OBJECTIVE.— To review the hematologic complications associated with the HIV and other viral pandemics, the current theories regarding their causation, and the incidence and clinical impact of these complications on infected patients. DATA SOURCES.— Peer-reviewed medical literature and the author's personal experience. CONCLUSIONS.— The HIV and other viral pandemics have been associated with a variety of hematologic complications that often cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. HIV infection is associated with multiple hematologic disorders, many of which have a lower incidence in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still represent a major clinical problem for HIV-infected patients. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-related hematologic complications, including HIV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, has evolved in recent years. Other viral pandemics, including H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and COVID-19, have also been associated with hematologic complications of varying severity.

This method generates a uniform 3' terminus by ligation of a 5'-phosphorylated oligonucleotide to the 3' end of the transcript that is recognized by a complementary primer during RT-PCR. This analysis showed that CIV virion proteins are encoded by genes in all three predetermined temporal classes: 23 immediate-early, 11 delayed-early and seven late virion gene transcripts were identified and assigned to ORFs. Early transcription of many virion protein genes supports the notion that virion proteins may also play essential roles in the initial stages of infection. In addition, some of the early gene products present in the virion may reflect the intracellular path that the virus follows during infection.","Ince, Ikbal Agah; Ozcan, Kadriye; Vlak, Just M; van Oers, Monique M",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.046359-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23052394/,163

The outcome of an MCI depends upon hospital preparedness, yet many hospitals are unfamiliar with their facility MCI procedure. Educational training drills may be one method to improve staff knowledge of policy and procedure. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to improve knowledge gained through educational MCI mini drills of institutional mass casualty policy and procedure in surgery department staff at a level II trauma center. METHODS A pre-/posttest design was utilized. The hospital implemented MCI mini training drills as a quality improvement project using Plan-Do-Study-Act iterative cycles with prospective data collection. Knowledge scores were measured using a 12-item surgery department MCI policy and procedure questionnaire that was developed by the author and leadership. RESULTS A one-way analysis of covariance analysis in participants that mini drilled more than once indicated significant effect on mean cycle score differences among three cycles F(2,21) = 12.96, p = .00. Multiple comparison using Games-Howell indicated the mean score for Cycle 4 (M = 96.15, SD = 6.54) was significantly different from Cycle 3 (M = 59.71, SD = 25.15). Gender, shift, and credentials of participants influenced knowledge improvement. CONCLUSION Implementation of hospital MCI mini drills improved staff knowledge of institutional mass casualty policy and procedure in the surgery department and may be applied to surgery departments with similar policy, procedure, and participant characteristics.

89901,Guidelines for Vulvar and Vaginal Surgery: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society Recommendations.,2020-07-24,"INTRODUCTION The development of new revascularization devices has significantly improved recanalization rates and time to reperfusion. A direct aspiration first-pass (ADAPT) technique for stroke thrombectomy was recently shown to be an effective and rapid way to achieve revascularization. The technique focuses on engaging and removing a clot without the use of a separator or retriever by relying on the force and aspiration generated by the catheter. We sought to compare the physical and fluid dynamic properties (force and aspiration) of commercially available catheters to determine the most effective catheter for the ADAPT technique. METHODS Benchtop models were employed to compare aspiration for each catheter by submersing the catheter into a graduated cylinder and aspirating water. The volume of fluid aspirated and flow rates were calculated. Force of aspiration at the tip of each catheter was measured using a vacuum pressure gauge while the catheter was attached to a standard aspiration pump. Force was then calculated. RESULTS The Penumbra 5MAX ACE catheter had the greatest aspiration rate of all the catheters at 245 mL/min. The Penumbra 5 MAX catheter aspirated 212 mL/min, followed by the Navien 058 and DAC 057 with 198 mL/min and 197 mL/min, respectively. The Penumbra 5MAX ACE generated the greatest tip force (18.25 g) and the 5MAX had the least amount of force (14.77 g). CONCLUSIONS The physical and fluid dynamic properties of currently available catheters suggest that the 5MAX ACE is the optimal catheter to use in direct aspiration for stroke therapy.","Hu, Yin C; Stiefel, Michael F",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618896/,163
90280,Drug News.,2021-01-01,"ABSTRACT Background: Feeding difficulty is the most common cause of delayed hospital discharge and readmission of late preterm infants. Frequent and adequate feedings from birth are protective against dehydration, hypoglycemia, and jaundice. The National Perinatal Association's feeding guidelines provide the foundation for late preterm infant standards of care. Feeding at least every 3 hours promotes nutritional status and neurologic development. One feeding assessment every 12 hours during the hospital stay can ensure quality of infant feeding.Problem: At a large urban hospital, medical record reviews were completed to evaluate nursing care practices consistent with the hospital's late preterm infant care standard policy. Feeding frequency and nurse assessment of feeding effectiveness were far below acceptable targets. A quality improvement team was formed to address inconsistency with expected practice.Methods: The project included an investigation using the define, design, implement, and sustain method of quality improvement. Parent education, nurse education, and visual cues were developed to sustain enhanced nursing practice.Results: Late preterm infants who received feedings at least every 3 hours increased from 2.5% (1 of 40) to 27% (11 of 40); (M = 0.275, SD = 0.446), p = 0.001. Documented breastfeeding assessments increased from 2% (5 of 264) to 8% (10 of 126), p = 0.001. Documented bottle-feeding assessments increased from 15% (39 of 264) to 31% (53 of 172), p < 0.001. Intervention time was cut short due to reprioritization of efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Conclusion: Interventions and implementation of this process improvement is easy to replicate through attainable and sustainable goals directed toward improved outcomes for late preterm infants.","Lober, Angela; Tussey, Christina; Gorny, Jenny",MCN.

90778,Repurposing vaccines in the fight against COVID-19 (Comment on https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000076).,2020-09-09,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a murine β-coronavirus (m-CoV) which causes a wide range of diseases in mouse and rat, including hepatitis, enteritis, respiratory diseases, and encephalomyelitis in the CNS. MHV infection in mice provides an efficient cause-effect experimental model to understand the mechanisms of direct virus induced neural cell damage leading to demyelination and axonal loss which are pathological features of Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common disabling neurological disease in young adults. Infiltration of T lymphocytes, activation of microglia and their interplay are the primary pathophysiological events leading to the disruption of myelin sheath in MS. However, there are emerging evidences supporting gray matter involvement and degeneration in MS. The investigation of T cell function in the pathogenesis of deep gray matter damage is necessary. Here, we employed RSA59 (isogenic recombinant strain of MHV-A59) induced experimental neuroinflammation model to compare the disease in CD4-/- mice with CD4+/+ mice at days 5, 10, 15, and 30 p.i. Viral titer estimation, nucleocapsid gene amplification and viral anti-nucleocapsid staining confirm enhanced replication of the virions in the absence of functional CD4+ T cells in the brain. Histopathological analyses showed an elevated susceptibility of CD4-/- mice to axonal degeneration in the CNS with augmented progression of acute poliomyelitis, and dorsal root ganglionic inflammation rarely observed in CD4+/+ mice. Depletion of CD4+ T cells shows unique pathological bulbar vacuolation in the brain parenchyma of infected mice with persistent CD11b+ microglia/macrophages in the inflamed regions on day 30 p.i. In summary, the current study suggests that CD4+ T cells are critical for controlling acute stage poliomyelitis (gray matter inflammation) and chronic axonal degeneration, inflammatory demyelination due to loss of protective anti-viral host immunity.IMPORTANCE The current trend in CNS disease biology is to understand the neural cell-immune interaction to investigate the underlying mechanism of neuroinflammation, rather than focusing on peripheral immune activation. Most studies in MS are targeted towards understanding the involvement of CNS white matter. However, the importance of gray matter damage has become critical in understanding the long-term progressive neurological disorder. Our study highlights the importance of CD4+T cells in safeguarding the neurons against axonal blebbing and poliomyelitis from murine Betacoronavirus-induced neuroinflammation. Current knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to gray matter damage in MS is limited, because the most widely used animal model EAE does not present this aspect of the disease. Our results thus, add to the existing limited knowledge in the field. We also show that the microglia, though important for the initiation of neuroinflammation, cannot establish a protective host immune response without the help of CD4+ T cells.","Chakravarty, Debanjana; Saadi, Fareeha; Kundu, Soumya; Bose, Abhishek; Khan, Reas; Dine, Kimberly; Kenyon, Lawrence C; Shindler, Kenneth S; Das Sarma, Jayasri",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00548-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404525/,163

All patients developed local infection to Pseudomona aeruginosa (75%), Stenotrophomona maltophilia (25%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (12.5%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (12.5%). Thus, the average of Meek regrafting after graft-take failure was 13.1 ± 6.4% TBSA (median: 9%; range from 0 to 36%). The period to obtain stable definitive wound closure was in average of 67.2 ± 21 days post injury. The modified Meek micrografting provides a reliable and versatile method for the coverage of large burn wounds with limited autograft donor sites and is now routinely used in our institution. Its systematic use improves operating times and overall outcomes reducing the number of surgeries, increasing the percentage of graft take, and decreasing the length of stay.","Medina, Abelardo; Riegel, Timothy; Nystad, Deborah; Tredget, Edward E",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0000000000000244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27355651/,163
91346,Biomedical omics: first insights of a new MSc degree of the University of Milan.,2021-09-29,"This study was planned to investigate the prevalence and clinical features of the illnesses associated with human bocavirus (hBoV) in children with acute disease. We prospectively enrolled all subjects aged less than 15 years attending an emergency room in Milan, Italy, on Wednesdays and Sundays between 1 November 2004 and 31 March 2005 for any acute medical reason, excluding surgical diseases and trauma. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at admission to detect hBoV; influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus; human metapneumovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4; rhinovirus; adenovirus; and coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 by real-time PCR. Among the 1,332 enrolled children, hBoV was the fifth most frequently detected virus (7.4%). The rate of hBoV coinfections with other viruses was significantly higher than for the other viruses (50.5% versus 27.5%; P < 0.0001). Eighty-nine of the 99 hBoV-positive children (89.9%) had a respiratory tract infection, and 10 (10.1%) had gastroenteritis. hBoV coinfections had a significantly greater clinical and socioeconomic impact on the infected children and their households than hBoV infection alone. In conclusion, these findings show that the role of hBoV infection alone seems marginal in children attending an emergency room for acute disease; its clinical and socioeconomic importance becomes relevant only when it is associated with other viruses.","Esposito, Susanna; Bosis, Samantha; Niesters, Hubert G M; Tremolati, Elena; Sabatini, Caterina; Porta, Alessandro; Fossali, Emilio; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Principi, Nicola",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02160-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18287315/,163
91440,Chemistry under nanoconfinement.,2020-04-17,"Controlling the structure of layered hybrid metal halide perovskites, such as the Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phases, is challenging because of their tendency to form mixtures of varying composition. Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, form dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH3NH3+) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g., C4H9NH3+ and C12H25NH3+). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain-terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix. This study provides a framework to compare the microstructure of colloidal layered perovskites and suggests clear avenues to control phase and colloidal morphology.","Dahlman, Clayton J; Venkatesan, Naveen R; Corona, Patrick T; Kennard, Rhys M; Mao, Lingling; Smith, Noah C; Zhang, Jiamin; Seshadri, Ram; Helgeson, Matthew E; Chabinyc, Michael L",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830961/,163
91966,Recyclable laccase by coprecipitation with aciduric Cu-based MOFs for bisphenol A degradation in an aqueous environment.,2021-04-26,"BACKGROUND Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide with a substantial financial burden on individuals and health care systems. To address this, clinical practice guidelines often recommend non-pharmacological, non-invasive management approaches. One management approach that has been recommended and widely implemented for chronic LBP is group-based exercise programs, however, their clinical value compared with other non-pharmacological interventions has not been investigated systematically. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of group-based exercise with other non-pharmacological interventions in people with chronic LBP. METHODS Four electronic databases were searched by two independent reviewers. Only randomized controlled trials that compared group-based exercise with other non-pharmacological interventions for chronic LBP were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews of Interventions by two independent reviewers. RESULTS Eleven studies were eligible. We identified strong evidence of no difference between group exercise and other non-pharmacologic interventions for disability level and pain scores 3-month post-intervention in people with chronic LBP. We could not find any strong or moderate evidence for or against the use of group-based exercise in the rehabilitation of people with chronic LBP for other time-points and health measurement outcomes. We found no statistically significant differences in disability and quality of life and pain between the group and individual non-pharmacological interventions that included exercise. CONCLUSION With this equivocal finding, group-based exercise may be a preferred choice given potential advantages in other domains not reviewed here such as motivation and cost. Further research in this area is needed to evaluate this possibility.","Lemieux, James; Abdollah, Vahid; Powelske, Brandyn; Kawchuk, Greg",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378346/,163

METHODS A total of 62 patients with symptomatic myomas were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. In the experimental group, the uterine arteries and utero-ovarian arteries were temporarily occluded with laparoscopic bulldog clamps. The primary outcome measures were operative blood loss and change in hemoglobin. RESULTS There were no differences in baseline demographics between the two groups. The amounts of operative blood loss (56.3 ± 42.8 mL vs. 138.2 ± 48.8 mL, p < 0.001) and change in hemoglobin (1.0 ± 0.5 g/dL vs. 1.7 ± 1.1 g/dL, p = 0.002) were significantly lower in the experimental group than that in the control group. The total operative time was not significantly different between the two groups. However, it took less time for myoma enucleation (13.1 ± 14.6 min vs. 17.6 ± 10.4 min, p = 0.006) and for uterine suturing (19.5 ± 10.7 min vs. 24.6 ± 8.8 min, p = 0.006) in the experimental group than that in the control group. None of patients in both groups developed operative complications. CONCLUSION The use of the TESTO procedure is effective in reducing operative blood loss and hemoglobin loss without causing morbidity during laparoscopic myomectomy.","Kim, Hwa Cheong; Song, Taejong",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6482-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334154/,163

Epidemiological studies have employed modeling to unravel knowledge that transformed the lives of families, communities, nations and the entire globe. The study established the stability of both disease free and endemic equilibria. Stability occurs when the reproduction number, R0, is less than unity for both disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium point of the model is established whenever the basic reproduction number R0 is less than or equal to unity. The reproduction number is also shown to be directly related to the transmission probability (β), rate at which latently infected individuals join the infected class (δ) and rate of recruitment (Λ). It is inversely related to natural death rate (μ), rate of early treatment (τ 1), rate of hospitalization of infected individuals (θ) and Covid-induced death rate (σ). The analytical results established are confirmed by numerical simulation of the model.","Bornaa, Christopher Saaha; Seidu, Baba; Seini, Yakubu Ibrahim",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.54268.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34527217/,163

MATERIALS AND METHODS An AR navigation system for TIPS was designed. Three-dimensional (3D) liver models including portal and hepatic vein anatomy were extracted from preoperative CT images. The 3D models, intraoperative subjects, and electromagnetic tracking information of the puncture needles were integrated through the system calibration. In the AR head-mounted display, the 3D models were overlaid on the subjects, which was a liver phantom in the first phase and live beagle dogs in the second phase. One life-size liver phantom and 9 beagle dogs were used in the experiments. Imaging after puncture was performed to validate whether the needle tip accessed the target hepatic vein successfully. RESULTS Endovascular punctures of the portal vein of the liver phantom were repeated 30 times under the guidance of the AR system, and the puncture needle successfully accessed the target vein during each attempt. In the experiments of live canine subjects, the punctures were successful in 2 attempts in 7 beagle dogs and in 1 attempt in the remaining 2 dogs. The puncture time of needle from hepatic vein to portal vein was 5-10 s in the phantom experiments and 10-30 s in the canine experiments. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of AR-based navigation facilitating accurate and successful portal vein access in preclinical models of TIPS was validated.","Yang, Jian; Zhu, Jianjun; Sze, Daniel Y; Cui, Li; Li, Xiaohui; Bai, Yanhua; Ai, Danni; Fan, Jingfan; Song, Hong; Duan, Feng",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2020.07.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33261744/,163

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that may develop in these patients may cause more complicated results with the effect of thrombosis burden. Our aim in this study is to determine the frequency of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients with STEMI and to determine the factors that predict this complication. METHODS In this study, which is a single-centre, retrospective and observational, a total of 126 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in our centre due to STEMI between 11 March 2020 and 10 January 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS While 62 patients were in the COVID-19 (+) group, 64 patients were evaluated in the COVID-19 (-) group. When the two groups are compared, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, and the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the COVID-19 (+) group. No-reflow was numerically higher in patients with COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, D-dimer and NLR were found to be independent predictors of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Although the no-reflow phenomenon was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients who underwent pPCI due to STEMI compared to the non-COVID group, no statistical difference was found in our study. However, NLR and D-dimer have been identified as independent predictors of no-reflow development risk in COVID-19 patients.","Güler, Arda; Gürbak, İsmail; Panç, Cafer; Güner, Ahmet; Ertürk, Mehmet",Acta cardiologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015385.2021.1931638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34053402/,163
93401,Discussion of article by Ellenberg and Morris.,2021-05-20,"This article outlines the evolution of a rescue team in responding to adenovirus prevention with a deployable field hospital. The local governments mobilized a shelter hospital and a rescue team consisting of 59 members to assist with rescue and response efforts after an epidemic outbreak of adenovirus. We describe and evaluate the challenges of preparing for deployment, field hospital maintenance, treatment mode, and primary treatment methods. The field hospital established at the rescue scene consisted of a medical command vehicle, a computed tomography shelter, an X-ray shelter, a special laboratory shelter, an oxygen and electricity supply vehicle, and epidemic prevention and protection equipment. The rescue team comprised paramedics, physicians, X-ray technicians, respiratory therapists, and logistical personnel. In 22 days, more than 3000 patients with suspected adenovirus infection underwent initial examinations. All patients were properly treated, and no deaths occurred. After emergency measures were implemented, the spread of adenovirus was eventually controlled. An emergency involving infectious diseases in less-developed regions demands the rapid development of a field facility with specialized medical personnel when local hospital facilities are either unavailable or unusable.

93424,The Impact of Pet Health Insurance on Dog Owners' Spending for Veterinary Services.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND There have been reports of pro-coagulant activity in patients with COVID-19. Whether there is an association between pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED) is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with PE in ED patients that underwent a CTPA? METHODS A retrospective study in 26 EDs from 6 countries. ED patients in whom a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed for suspected PE during a 2-month period covering the pandemic peak. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a pulmonary embolism on CTPA. COVID-19 was diagnosed in the ED either on CT or RT-PCR. A multivariable binary logistic regression was built to adjust with other variables known to be associated with PE. A sensitivity analysis was performed in patients included during the pandemic period. RESULTS A total of 3358 patients were included, of whom 105 were excluded because COVID-19 status was unknown, leaving 3253 for analysis. Among them, 974 (30%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Mean age was 61 years (19) and 52% were women. A pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on CTPA in 500 patients (15%). The risk of PE was similar between COVID-19 patients and others (15% in both groups). In the multivariable binary logistic regression model, COVID-19 was not associated with higher risk of PE (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.26). There was no association when limited to patients in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION In ED patients that underwent CTPA for suspected PE, COVID-19 is not associated with an increased probability of PE diagnosis. These results were also valid when limited to the pandemic period. However, these results may not apply to patients with suspected COVID-19 in general.","Freund, Yonathan; Drogrey, Marie; Miró, Òscar; Marra, Alessio; Féral-Pierssens, Anne-Laure; Penaloza, Andrea; Lara Hernandez, Barbara A; Beaune, Sebastien; Gorlicki, Judith; Vattinada Ayar, Prabakar; Truchot, Jennifer; Pena, Barbara; Aguirre, Alfons; Fémy, Florent; Javaud, Nicolas; Chauvin, Anthony; Chouihed, Tahar; Montassier, Emmanuel; Claret, Pierre-Géraud; Occelli, Céline; Roussel, Mélanie; Brigant, Fabien; Ellouze, Sami; Le Borgne, Pierrick; Laribi, Said; Simon, Tabassome; Lucidarme, Olivier; Cachanado, Marine; Bloom, Ben",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734624/,163

RECENT FINDINGS Implementation of telegenetics in health systems is still limited, below 10%, somewhat higher for cancer genetic counseling. Nevertheless, telegenetic services have been shown useful in the COVID pandemic. Key factors for efficient implementation include a patient-centered approach, engaging the major stakeholders, and incorporating telegenetics into existing health policies. Main barriers remain: limitations to billing and reimbursement, licensure, proper equipment and technical issues, engagement of referring providers and patients, coordination of services with local health providers, and lack of decision-making power. Further rigorous studies are needed to investigate the outcomes of telegenetics and to motivate health policies for change. SUMMARY Despite continuous evidence of the benefits of telegenetics, its use in health systems remains limited. Further, larger, prospective, randomized, long-term studies are needed to address the outcomes.Enabling factors contributing to the implementation of telegenetics are patient-centeredness, the involvement of major stakeholders, and aligning telegenetics with the existing national health policies.","Peterlin, Borut",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027215/,163

METHODS The TORPEDO trial was a randomized study to demonstrate superiority of PEVI in the reduction of the VTE and PTS at 6 months; in that trial, 183 patients (103 men; mean age 61 ± 11 years) with symptomatic proximal DVT were randomized to receive PEVI + anticoagulation (n = 91) or anticoagulation alone (n = 92). PEVI consisted of one or more of a combination of thrombectomy, balloon venoplasty, stenting, and/or local low-dose thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS At 6 months, recurrent VTE developed in 2.3% of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 14.8% in the anticoagulation only group (p = 0.003); PTS developed in 3.4% vs. 27.2% (p<0.001), respectively. At a mean follow-up of 30 ± 5 months (range 12-41), 88 patients in the PEVI + anticoagulation group and 81 patients in the anticoagulation only group reached target follow-up. Recurrent VTE developed in 4 (4.5%) of the 88 PEVI + anticoagulation patients vs. 13 (16%) of the 81 patients receiving anticoagulation only (p = 0.02). PTS developed in 6 (6.8%) of the PEVI + anticoagulation group vs. 24 (29.6%) of the anticoagulation only group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION In patients with proximal DVT, PEVI is superior to anticoagulation alone in the reduction of VTE and PTS.

Use of the Bleeper Sv monitor resulted in a significant reduction in operator radiation exposure. METHODS We examined the association between several baseline and procedural parameters with operator and patient radiation exposure using univariable and multivariable analysis in the 505 patients that were enrolled in RadiCure. All baseline demographic and procedure characteristics recorded were included in the univariable analysis. RESULTS Median fluoroscopy time was 6.2 (2.5-12.5) minutes, median patient air kerma dose was 0.908 (0.602-1.636) Gray and median first operator exposure was 10 (5-22) μSv. For analysis purposes, the 505 procedures were dichotomized based on the median operator exposure (10 μSv) and median patient radiation dose (0.908 Gray). On multivariable analysis, factors associated with high (above median or >10 μSv) first operator radiation exposure included radial access (odds ratio [OR] 5.44, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.88-10.76), chronic total occlusion (CTO) intervention (OR 12.78, 95% CI 4.42-43.60), real-time radiation monitoring (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.66), and use of a radioabsorbent drape (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28-0.96). High patient radiation dose (above median or >0.908 Gray) was associated with body mass index>30 kg/m2 (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.99-5.29), prior MI (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.29-4.04), prior cerebrovascular disease (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.75), hypertension (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.05-5.82), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.40-4.39) and CTO intervention (OR 12.93, 95% CI 3.28-87.31), but was not associated with real-time radiation monitoring and use of a radioabsorbent drape.

95686,Antimicrobial constituents from the tubers of Bletilla ochracea.,2012,"Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) associated with infection is the major cause of preterm birth (PTB) at <32 weeks' gestation and accounts for ∼40% of all spontaneous PTBs. Pharmacological strategies to prevent PTB and improve fetal outcomes will likely require both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapies. Here we investigated the effects of two cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs), compounds that specifically target inflammatory signalling pathways, in an ovine model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chorioamnionitis. Chronically catheterized ewes at 116 days gestation (n = 7/group) received an intra-amniotic (IA) bolus of LPS (10 mg) plus vehicle or CSAIDS: TPCA-1 (1.2 mg/kg fetal weight) or 5z-7-oxozeaenol (OxZnl; 0.4 mg/kg fetal weight); controls received vehicle (dimethylsulphoxide). Amniotic fluid (AF), fetal and maternal blood samples were taken 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h later; tissues were taken at autopsy (48 h). Administration of TPCA-1 or OxZnl abrogated the stimulatory effects of LPS (P < 0.01 versus vehicle control) on production of PGE2 in AF, with lesser (non-significant) effects on IL-6 production. Fetal membrane polymorphonuclear cell infiltration score was significantly higher in LPS versus vehicle control animals (P < 0.01), and this difference was absent with TPCA-1 and OxZnl treatment. LPS-induced systemic fetal inflammation was highly variable, with no significant effects of CSAIDs observed. Lung inflammation was evident with LPS exposure, but unaffected by CSAID treatment. We have shown in a large animal model that IA administration of a single dose of CSAIDs can suppress LPS-induced IA inflammatory responses, while fetal effects were minimal.

It was instead delivered as a live virtual meeting with six days of planning. Here we report the participants' experience of this live virtual meeting. METHOD Participants were invited to complete custom developed, pre and post meeting surveys to assess their expectations of and satisfaction with the live virtual format. Speakers and moderators were also invited to complete a custom developed satisfaction survey. The working parties of TROG (head neck/skin, genitourinary, breast and lung) were also sampled. RESULTS In total, 188/273 (69%) registered participants logged in to the live virtual meeting. The online engagement for each of the oral sessions ranged from 53-66%. There were 102 and 57 responders to the online pre and post meeting surveys, respectively. The majority of pre meeting responders indicated a significant level of employer support to attend the virtual meeting. Post meeting satisfaction exceeded pre meeting expectations ('very much' and 'quite a bit'; 86% v 54%; p<0.0001). The majority indicated they would be 'quite a bit' or 'very much' interested in future live virtual meetings. CONCLUSION The TROG 2020 ASM was conducted as a live virtual meeting. Participant satisfaction and future interest in a live virtual meeting was high, indicating this is a viable platform for other CCTG's faced with the decision to deliver virtual content at times of global public health threats.","McDowell, Lachlan; Goode, Susan; Sundaresan, Puma",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304265/,163

96455,In conversation with Xin Lu.,2020-11-16,"OBJECTIVE To present the initial clinical experience in children undergoing unilateral and bilateral laparoendoscopic single-site nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed our experience with pediatric patients who had undergone single-port nephrectomy (SPN) at our institution since August of 2009. Access was obtained by using the Hassan technique to place a 2-cm SILS™ Port (Covidien Surgical Devices, Norwalk, CT), which contains a gas insufflation channel and three individual cannulas that can readily accommodate laparoscopic instruments up to 12 mm in diameter. Nephrectomy was performed using a standard set of laparoscopic instruments and a rigid 5 mm 30 degree laparoscope (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) with an end-on light source. Patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative treatment parameters were collected and recorded. RESULTS SPN was successfully performed in three consecutive pediatric patients (one female and two male patients: aged 11, 10, and 13 years, respectively) without placement of additional trocars or conversion to open surgery. The operative time for the unilateral SPN was 188 minutes, whereas bilateral SPNs required 214 and 300 minutes, respectively. Estimated blood loss for the unilateral and bilateral SPNs was 25, 20, and 30 mL; whereas patients were discharged on postoperative days 1, 3, and 12, respectively. The prolonged hospital stay was secondary to fever and pseudomembranous colitis in a patient with dialysis who also required a blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Laparoendoscopic single-site simple nephrectomy is a technically demanding yet feasible procedure in children. Further studies are necessary to define the indications, advantages, and limitations of this technique as compared with standard laparoscopy.","Vricella, Gino J; Ross, Jonathan H; Vourganti, Srinivas; Cherullo, Edward E",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20846003/,163

Teledermatology such as video consultation or ""store-and-forward"" teledermatology could at least partly compensate for this. This systematic review summarizes all published studies on teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is based on a MEDLINE search for articles from 2020 in English and German. Two surveys among dermatologists from the USA and India showed that more than 80 % offered teledermatology. Among German dermatologists 17.5 % of 480 respondents offered online video consultation, 11.3 % offline consultation (store and forward) and 10.0 % both. Five cohort studies on teledermatology during the pandemic were identified. Three of them investigated teledermatology in chronic dermatoses (acne, inflammatory skin diseases), one dealt with the care of oncological patients with dermatological complications, and one analyzed teleconsultation in suspected COVID-19 cases. In all studies, teledermatology largely reduced the number of personal consultations. The results indicate that the limitations of personal dermatological care of patients with skin diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic can be at least partially compensated by an extension of teledermatology. Findings from the use of teledermatology during the pandemic should be employed to improve the use and acceptance of teledermatology by patients and dermatologists.","Elsner, Peter",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.14180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448667/,163
97118,Neuropathogens and Nasal Cleansing: Use of Clay Montmorillonite Coupled with Activated Carbon for Effective Eradication of Pathogenic Microbes from Water Supplies.,2020-09-01,"Treatment of respiratory viral infections remains a global health concern, mainly due to the inefficacy of available drugs. Therefore, the discovery of novel antiviral compounds is needed; in this context, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like temporins hold great promise. Here, we discovered that the harmless temporin G (TG) significantly inhibited the early life-cycle phases of influenza virus. The in vitro hemagglutinating test revealed the existence of TG interaction with the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Furthermore, the hemolysis inhibition assay and the molecular docking studies confirmed a TG/HA complex formation at the level of the conserved hydrophobic stem groove of HA. Remarkably, these findings highlight the ability of TG to block the conformational rearrangements of HA2 subunit, which are essential for the viral envelope fusion with intracellular endocytic vesicles, thereby neutralizing the virus entry into the host cell. In comparison, in the case of parainfluenza virus, which penetrates host cells upon a membrane-fusion process, addition of TG to infected cells provoked ~1.2 log reduction of viral titer released in the supernatant. Nevertheless, at the same condition, an immunofluorescent assay showed that the expression of viral hemagglutinin/neuraminidase protein was not significantly reduced. This suggested a peptide-mediated block of some late steps of viral replication and therefore the impairment of the extracellular release of viral particles. Overall, our results are the first demonstration of the ability of an AMP to interfere with the replication of respiratory viruses with a different mechanism of cell entry and will open a new avenue for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against a large variety of respiratory viruses, including the recent SARS-CoV2.","De Angelis, M; Casciaro, B; Genovese, A; Brancaccio, D; Marcocci, M E; Novellino, E; Carotenuto, A; Palamara, A T; Mangoni, M L; Nencioni, L",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001885rr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538061/,163
97305,The effect of charge on the uptake and resistance to reduction of platinum(IV) complexes in human serum and whole blood models.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STECs) are foodborne pathogens associated with bloody diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although the STEC O157 serogroup accounts for the highest number of infections, HUS-related complications and deaths, the STEC non-O157, as a group, accounts for a larger proportion of STEC infections and lower HUS cases. There is limited information available on how to recognize non-O157 serotypes associated with severe disease. The objectives of this study were to describe a patient with STEC non-O157 infection complicated with HUS and to conduct a comparative whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis among the patient's STEC clinical isolate and STEC O157 and non-O157 strains. RESULTS The STEC O145:H25 strain EN1I-0044-2 was isolated from a pediatric patient with diarrhea, HUS and severe neurologic and cardiorespiratory complications, who was enrolled in a previously reported case-control study of acute gastroenteritis conducted in Davidson County, Tennessee in 2013. The strain EN1I-0044-2 genome sequence contained a chromosome and three plasmids. Two of the plasmids were similar to those present in O145:H25 strains whereas the third unique plasmid EN1I-0044-2_03 shared no similarity with other STEC plasmids, and it carried 23 genes of unknown function. Strain EN1I-0044-2, compared with O145:H25 and O157 serogroup strains shared chromosome- and plasmid-encoded virulence factors, including Shiga toxin, LEE type III secretion system, LEE effectors, SFP fimbriae, and additional toxins and colonization factors. CONCLUSIONS A STEC O145:H25 strain EN1I-0044-2 was isolated from a pediatric patient with severe disease, including HUS, in Davidson County, TN. Phylogenetic and comparison WGS analysis provided evidence that strain EN1I-0044-2 closely resembles O145:H25, and confirmed an independent evolutionary path of STEC O145:H25 and O145:H28 serotypes. The strain EN1I-0044-2 virulence make up was similar to other O145:H25 and O157 serogroups. It carried stx2 and the LEE pathogenicity island, and additional colonization factors and enterotoxin genes. A unique feature of strain EN1I-0044-2 was the presence of plasmid pEN1I-0044-2_03 carrying genes with functions to be determined. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the role that newly acquired genes by O145:H25 strains play in pathogenesis, and to determine if they may serve as genetic markers of severe disease.","Guerra, Julio A; Zhang, Chengxian; Bard, Jonathan E; Yergeau, Donald; Halasa, Natasha; Gómez-Duarte, Oscar G",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06967-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807093/,163
97554,Pan-Colonic Pressurizations Associated With Relaxation of the Anal Sphincter in Health and Disease: A New Colonic Motor Pattern Identified Using High-Resolution Manometry.,2017,"Viral receptors are the cell surface proteins that are hijacked by viruses to initialize their infections. Viral receptors are subject to two conflicting directional forces, namely negative selection due to functional constraints and positive selection due to host-virus arms races. It remains largely obscure whether negative pleiotropy limits the rate of adaptation in viral receptors. Here, we perform evolutionary analyses of 96 viral receptor genes in primates, and find that 41 out of 96 viral receptors experienced adaptive evolution. Many positively selected residues in viral receptors are located at the virus-receptor interfaces. Compared with control proteins, viral receptors exhibit significantly elevated rate of adaptation. Further analyses of genetic polymorphisms in human populations reveal signals of positive selection and balancing selection for 53 and 5 viral receptors, respectively. Moreover, we find that 49 viral receptors experienced different selection pressures in different human populations, indicating that viruses might represent an important driver of local adaptation in humans. Our findings suggest that diverse viruses, many of which have not been known to infect non-human primates, might have maintained antagonistic associations with primates for millions of years, and the host-virus conflicts drive accelerated adaptive evolution in viral receptors.IMPORTANCE Viruses hijack cellular proteins, termed as viral receptors, to assist their entry into host cells. While viral receptors experience negative selection to maintain their normal functions, they also undergo positive selection due to everlasting evolutionary arms race between viruses and hosts. A complete picture on how viral receptors evolve under two conflicting forces is still lacking. In this study, we systematically analyzed the evolution of 96 viral receptors in primates and human populations. We found more than half of viral receptors underwent adaptive evolution, and exhibit significantly elevated rate of adaptation than control genes in primates. We also found signals of past natural selection for 58 viral receptors in human populations. Interestingly, 49 viral receptors experienced different selection pressures in different human populations, indicating that viruses might represent an important driver of local adaptation in humans. Our results suggest that host-virus arms races drive accelerated adaptive evolution in viral receptors.","Wang, Wenqiang; Zhao, Huayao; Han, Guan-Zhu",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00684-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493827/,163

The aim of this research was to assess the efficacy of CCP as an adjunctive treatment in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Four bibliographic databases and a preprint database were searched for potentially relevant articles. Mortality rates between patients treated with standard treatment and standard treatment with CCP were compared using a Z test. Results: A total of 1,937 patients treated with CCP and 3,405 patients without CCP retrieved from 12 studies were included. The risk of mortality was 1.92-fold higher in patients without CCP compared to patients treated with CCP (OR: 1.92; 95%CI: 1.33, 2.77; p=0.0005). In severe COVID-19 sub-group analysis, we found that patients without the CCP had a 1.32 times higher risk of mortality than those treated with the CCP (OR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.09, 1.60; p=0.0040). Conclusions: CCP, as adjunctive therapy, reduces the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients.","Wardhani, Shinta Oktya; Fajar, Jonny Karunia; Wulandari, Laksmi; Soegiarto, Gatot; Purnamasari, Yeni; Asmiragani, Anisa; Maliga, Helnida Anggun; Ilmawan, Muhammad; Seran, Gloriana; Iskandar, Dheka Sapti; Ndapa, Conchita Emiliana; Hamat, Viviana; Wahyuni, Rafika Ajeng; Cyntia, Linda Oktaviana Suci; Maarang, Feronika Maryanti; Beo, Yosef Andrian; Adar, Olivera Agnes; Rakhmadhan, Iraky Mardya; Shantikaratri, Emilia Tiara; Putri, Ayu Sekarani Damana; Wahdini, Rizqa; Broto, Endang Pati; Suwanto, Agnes Wanda; Tamara, Fredo; Mahendra, Aditya Indra; Winoto, Eden Suryoiman; Krisna, Pratista Adi; Harapan, Harapan",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.36396.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34136130/,163
97699,A bioinspired mucoadhesive restores lubrication of degraded cartilage through reestablishment of lamina splendens.,2020-04-30,"Understanding how the tumor microenvironment participates in inhibiting or supporting tumor growth is critical for the development of novel therapies. Osteosarcoma (OS) metastasizes almost exclusively to the lung, an organ where Fas ligand (FasL) is constitutively expressed. This chapter focuses on our studies dedicated to the interaction of OS cells with the lung microenvironment. We will summarize our studies conducted over the past 20 years showing the importance of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway to the establishment and progression of OS metastases in the lung. We demonstrated that the FasL+ lung microenvironment eliminates Fas-positive (Fas+) OS cells that metastasize to the lungs, through apoptosis induced by Fas signaling following interaction of Fas on the tumor cell surface with FasL on the lung epithelial cells. Expression of the Fas receptor on OS cells inversely correlated with the ability of OS cells to form lung metastases. Blocking this pathway interferes with this process, allowing Fas+ cells to grow in the lung. By contrast, upregulation of Fas on Fas- OS cells inhibited their ability to metastasize to the lung. We demonstrated how the FasL+ lung microenvironment can be leveraged for therapeutic intent through the upregulation of Fas expression. To this end, we demonstrated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat upregulated Fas expression on OS cells, reduced their ability to form lung metastases, and induced regression of established micrometastases. Fas expression in OS cells is regulated epigenetically by the microRNA miR-20a. We showed that expressions of Fas and miR-20a are inversely correlated, and that delivery of anti-miR-20a in vivo to mice with established osteosarcoma lung metastases resulted in upregulation of Fas and tumor regression. Therefore, targeting the Fas signaling pathway may present therapeutic opportunities, which target the lung microenvironment for elimination of OS lung metastases. We have also shown that in addition to being critically involved in the metastatic potential, the Fas signaling pathway may also contribute to the efficacy of chemotherapy. We demonstrated that the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (GCB) increased Fas expression in both human and mouse OS cells in vitro. In vivo, aerosol GCB therapy induced upregulation of Fas expression and the regression of established osteosarcoma lung metastases. The therapeutic efficacy of GCB was contingent upon a FasL+ lung microenvironment as aerosol GCB had no effect in FasL-deficient mice. Manipulation of Fas expression and the Fas pathway should be considered, as this concept may provide additional novel therapeutic approaches for treating patients with OS lung metastases.","Koshkina, Nadya; Yang, Yuanzheng; Kleinerman, Eugenie S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43085-6_12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767242/,163

The magnitude of contextual factors cannot be ignored, and directing attention towards the environment teachers face daily is essential. Primary (organisational)-level interventions are documented in organisational health and wellbeing literature; however, to provide teachers with stress management strategies for promoting wellbeing, attention must also be directed towards secondary (individual)-level interventions. The present study addressed the issue of stress management techniques for early career teachers (n = 24) and aimed to contribute to the research surrounding complementary interventions (CIs) for educators. The intervention was designed to include strategies that operated through cognitive and physiological mechanisms that regulated the stress response and increased awareness of behaviours, emotions, and reactivity. The self-report measures included perceived stress, attention awareness, subjective wellbeing, burnout, and job-related affective wellbeing. The results indicated a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress and increases in attention awareness and subjective wellbeing.

98018,New challenges emerge for planned human challenge trials.,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Recent technological advances in single-incision platforms have allowed many general surgeons to add single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) to their armamentarium. However, adopting new surgical technologies comes at a cost to the patient and the surgeon. This study compared retrospective case-matched SILC and traditional multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MILC) to evaluate the effects of SILC on perioperative outcomes and patient cost. METHODS The study compared 50 patients who underwent SILC with a case-matched population of individuals who underwent traditional MILC. The SILC technique was performed using one of three commercially available single-incision platforms currently used for single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) cholecystectomies. All the SILS platforms were placed in a 2-cm supraumbilical incision. All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2008 for Macintosh, with statistical significance determined by a p value of 0.05 or less. RESULTS The average operative time was 42 min for the SILC group and 45 min for the MILC group. The difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the average estimated blood loss was 14 ml for the SILC group and 11 ml for the MILC group. Again, the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the body mass index (BMI) did not differ statistically between the SILC group (28.4 kg/m(2)) and the MILC group (32.2 kg/m(2)). The average patient cost was $18,447 for SILC and $17,701 for MILC, yielding a cost difference of $746. This difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS At the authors' institution, SILS cholecystectomy was performed with blood loss, operating room time, and cost equal to that for MILC. Further research is necessary to assess the economic feasibility of SILC and the trade-off of cost with the improved cosmesis, decreased pain, greater patient satisfaction, reduced postoperative analgesic requirement, and faster return to work to determine the overall value and superiority of SILC compared with MILC.","Beck, Catherine; Eakin, Jeffrey; Dettorre, Rebecca; Renton, David",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2428-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22806511/,163

Rapid and accurate diagnosis and risk stratification are crucial for timely treatment options, especially in high-risk PE. OBJECTIVES The study aims to profile the comprehensive changes of plasma proteomes in PE patients and identify the potential biomarkers for both diagnosis and risk stratification. PATIENTS/METHODS Based on the data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry and antibody array proteomic technology, we screened the plasma samples (13 and 32 proteomes, respectively) in two independent studies consisting of high-risk PE patients, non-high-risk PE patients, and healthy controls. Some significantly differentially expressed proteins were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a new study group with 50 PE patients and 26 healthy controls. RESULTS We identified 207 and 70 differentially expressed proteins in PE and high-risk PE. These proteins were involved in multiple thrombosis-associated biological processes including blood coagulation, inflammation, injury, repair, and chemokine-mediated cellular response. It was verified that five proteins including SAA1, S100A8, TNC, GSN and HRG had significant change in PE and/or in high-risk PE. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis based on binary Logistic regression showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of SAA1, S100A8, and TNC in PE diagnosis were 0.882, 0.788, and 0.795, and AUC of S100A8 and TNC in high-risk PE diagnosis were 0.773 and 0.720.

This culture was built on the notion that a ""better"" nurse is one who could ""get more in,"" and infants who are ""poor feeders"" are ones who ""can't take enough."" The infant who feeds faster is often viewed as more skilled in this task-oriented approach. The feeding relationship and the infant's communication about the experience of feeding may not be nurtured. This article will explain the central role of the preterm infant's communication in successful cue-based feeding. When the infant is perceived as having meaningful behavior (i.e., communicative intent), the focus changes from a volume-driven to a co-regulated approach, through which the infant guides the caregiver.

However, its supplementation has not been successful that attributed to several determinants including poor adherence. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence and determinants of adherence to prenatal iron-folic acid supplementation in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, we will develop a conceptual framework in the context of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). METHODS/DESIGN We will search PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of Science, SCOPUS, WHO Global Index Medicus, and African Journals Online (AJOL) databases to retrieve relevant literatures. Observational (i.e., case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, survey, and surveillance reports) and quasi-randomized and randomized controlled trial studies conducted in LMIC will be included. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist will be used to assess the quality of observational and randomized controlled trial studies respectively. The pooled prevalence and odds ratio of determinants of adherence will be generated using a weighted inverse-variance meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity among studies will be assessed by Cochran's Q χ2 statistics and Higgins (I2 statistics) method. The result will be presented using forest plots and Harvest plots when necessary. Furthermore, we will perform Jackknife sensitivity and subgroup analysis.

Because the diagnostic procedure for the detection of cystic oviducts by postmortem examinations in IBV-positive replacement pullet flocks could involve the unnecessary sacrifice of numerous healthy pullets without reproductive tract anomalies, the development of a noninvasive and nonlethal diagnostic procedure would be desirable. The first objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a transcutaneous ultrasonography method to predict the presence of cystic oviducts compared to postmortem examinations in a commercial pullet flock positive for an IBV genotype Delmarva (DMV) variant. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of the same ultrasonography method to later detect false layers in the same flock in sexually mature hens by identifying the presence of an egg in the oviduct due to the presence of atretic oviducts undetectable by ultrasonography and the absence of cystic oviducts at that age. In replacement pullets, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the ultrasonography (index test) compared to the postmortem examination (reference standard test) were 73% and 91%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 67% and 93%. The ultrasonography technique showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 7.82 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.30. In sexually mature hens, the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of the ultrasonography compared to the laying status were 98%. The LR+ was 49.00 and the LR- was 0.02 when compared to the laying status. In conclusion, the ultrasonography could replace postmortem examinations to detect cystic oviducts in commercial flocks of replacement pullets previously infected with an IBV-DMV 1639 variant. Although the test accuracy of ultrasonography was excellent for the hens at production peak to identify laying and nonlaying hens based on the presence of an egg in the reproductive tract, its practicality was limited due to atretic oviducts being not detectable.","Parent, Eric; Gagnon-Francoeur, Ariane; Lanthier, Benoît; Hébert, Ghislain; Buczinski, Sébastien; Boulianne, Martine",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086-64.2.149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550615/,163

However, much remains unknown about the accuracy of this technology in real-world settings, attitudes of potential users, and differences between delivery formats (mobile applications vs. carriable or wearable devices). OBJECTIVE We pilot-tested two separate Bluetooth contact tracing technologies on a university campus to evaluate their sensitivity and specificity and to learn from the experiences of the participants. METHODS We used a convergent mixed methods study design, and participants included graduate students and researchers working on a university campus during June-July 2020. We conducted separate two-week pilot studies for each Bluetooth technology, the first for a mobile phone application (""App Pilot"") and the second for a small, electronic ""tag"" (""Tag Pilot""). Participants validated a list of Bluetooth-identified contacts daily and reported additional close contacts not identified by Bluetooth. We used these data to estimate sensitivity and specificity. Participants completed a post-participation survey regarding appropriateness, usability, acceptability, and adherence, and provided additional feedback via free text. We used tests of proportions to evaluate differences in survey responses between participants from each pilot, paired t-tests to measure differences between compatible survey questions, and qualitative analysis to evaluate the survey's free-text responses. RESULTS Among the 25 participants in the App Pilot, 53 contact interactions were identified by Bluetooth and 61 by self-report. Among the 17 participants in the Tag Pilot, 171 contact interactions were identified via Bluetooth and four by self-report. The tag had significantly higher sensitivity compared to the app (46/49, 94% vs 35/61, 57%; p<.001), as well as higher specificity (120/126, 95% vs 123/141, 87%; p=.02). Most participants felt that Bluetooth contact tracing was appropriate on campus (26/32, 81%) while significantly fewer participants felt that using other technologies, such as GPS or Wi-Fi, was appropriate (17/31, 55%; p=0.024). Most participants preferred technology developed and managed by the university rather than a third party (27/32, 84%) and preferred not to have tracing applications on their personal phones (21/32, 66%), due to ""concerns with privacy."" There were no significant differences in self-reported adherence rates across pilots. CONCLUSIONS Convenient and carriable Bluetooth technology may improve tracing efficiency while alleviating privacy concerns by shifting data collection away from personal devices. With accuracy comparable to, and in this case superior to, mobile phone applications, such approaches may be suitable for workplace or school settings with the ability to purchase and maintain physical devices.

However, like with other flaviviruses, the generation of ZIKV full-length infectious cDNA clones has been hampered due to the toxicity of viral sequences during its amplification in bacteria. To overcome this problem, we have developed a nontraditional approach based on the use of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Using this approach, the full-length cDNA copy of the ZIKV strain Rio Grande do Norte Natal (ZIKV-RGN) is generated from four synthetic DNA fragments and assembled into the single-copy pBeloBAC11 plasmid under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. The assembled BAC cDNA clone is stable during propagation in bacteria, and infectious recombinant (r)ZIKV is recovered in Vero cells after transfection of the BAC cDNA clone. The protocol described here provides a powerful technique for the generation of infectious clones of flaviviruses, including ZIKV, and other positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with large genomes that have stability problems during bacterial propagation.","Ávila-Pérez, Ginés; Park, Jun-Gyu; Nogales, Aitor; Almazán, Fernando; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/59537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31282877/,163

This present historical account of the past 800 years looks specifically at how some aspects of education were shaped from the early medieval epidemics such as leprosy and the Black Plague to the Spanish Flu and COVID-19. Leprosy changed religious education, and the Black Plague may have contributed to the rise of medical schools, hospitals, public health education, and led to the implementation of lazarettos and the quarantine. The smallpox epidemic helped usher in public health education for immunization, while the 1918 Spanish Flu precipitated the rise of education by correspondence, and recently COVID-19 has catapulted remote digital learning to the forefront of higher education.","Spielman, Andrew I; Sunavala-Dossabhoy, Gulshan",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876429/,163

We investigated the impact of early extubation and ventilation duration in a cohort that underwent thrombectomy under general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 103 consecutive patients from a prospective stroke registry. They met the following criteria: CTA-proved large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation, ASPECTS above 6 on presenting cranial CT, revascularization by thrombectomy with the patient under general anesthesia within 6 hours after onset of symptoms, and available functional outcome (mRS) 90 days after onset. RESULTS The mean ventilation time was 128.07 ± 265.51 hours (median, 18.5 hours; range, 1-1244.7 hours). Prolonged ventilation was associated with pneumonia during hospitalization and unfavorable functional outcome (mRS ≥3) and death at follow-up (Mann-Whitney U test; P ≤ .001). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff after 24 hours predicted unfavorable functional outcome with a sensitivity and specificity of 60% and 78%, respectively. Our results imply that delayed extubation was not associated with a less favorable clinical outcome compared with immediate extubation after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Short ventilation times are associated with a lower pneumonia rate and more favorable clinical outcome. Cautious interpretation of our data implies that whether patients are extubated immediately after the procedure is irrelevant for clinical outcome as long as ventilation does not exceed 24 hours.","Nikoubashman, O; Schürmann, K; Probst, T; Müller, M; Alt, J P; Othman, A E; Tauber, S; Wiesmann, M; Reich, A",AJNR.

100397,Effect of ciliates in transfer of plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance genes in bacteria.,2015,"The giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) is a decapod crustacean widely reared for human consumption. Currently, viruses of two distinct lineages of parvoviruses (PVs, family Parvoviridae; subfamily Hamaparvovirinae) infect penaeid shrimp. Here, a PV was isolated and cloned from Vietnamese P. monodon specimens, designated Penaeus monodon metallodensovirus (PmMDV). This is the first member of a third divergent lineage shown to infect penaeid decapods. PmMDV has a transcription strategy unique among invertebrate PVs, using extensive alternative splicing and incorporating transcription elements characteristic of vertebrate-infecting PVs. The PmMDV proteins have no significant sequence similarity with other PVs, except for an SF3 helicase domain in its nonstructural protein. Its capsid structure, determined by cryoelectron microscopy to 3-Å resolution, has a similar surface morphology to Penaeus stylirostris densovirus, despite the lack of significant capsid viral protein (VP) sequence similarity. Unlike other PVs, PmMDV folds its VP without incorporating a βA strand and displayed unique multimer interactions, including the incorporation of a Ca2+ cation, attaching the N termini under the icosahedral fivefold symmetry axis, and forming a basket-like pentamer helix bundle. While the PmMDV VP sequence lacks a canonical phospholipase A2 domain, the structure of an EDTA-treated capsid, determined to 2.8-Å resolution, suggests an alternative membrane-penetrating cation-dependent mechanism in its N-terminal region. PmMDV is an observed example of convergent evolution among invertebrate PVs with respect to host-driven capsid structure and unique as a PV showing a cation-sensitive/dependent basket structure for an alternative endosomal egress.","Pénzes, Judit J; Pham, Hanh T; Chipman, Paul; Bhattacharya, Nilakshee; McKenna, Robert; Agbandje-McKenna, Mavis; Tijssen, Peter",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008191117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747554/,163

Although stapled IPAA without mucosectomy has a higher risk for developing adenomas in the remnant mucosa, it is the simpler procedure with potential benefit in short-term outcomes. However, it remains controversial as to whether stapled IPAA has any advantages in reducing postoperative complications. The aim of the present study was to compare the postoperative complications and short-term outcomes of stapled and hand-sewn IPAA for patients with FAP, using a multicenter cohort sample in Japan. Data of 143 patients with FAP who underwent TPC with stapled IPAA (n=37) and hand-sewn IPAA (n=106) at 23 institutions between 2000 and 2012 were collected. Postoperative complications, proportion of ostomy, fecal continence and overall survival were compared. Overall rates of the Clavien-Dindo grade II-IV complications were not different between the two groups (19% in stapled vs 25% in hand-sewn, P=.42), with significantly fewer pouch-related complications including leakage, pelvic abscess, vaginal fistula and anastomotic stricture in stapled IPAA (none in stapled vs 11% in hand-sewn, P=.036). There was no mortality. Proportion of ostomy at 12 months was similar (2.7% in stapled vs 4.3% in hand-sewn, P=.26). Mean Wexner score was similar. (0.47 in stapled vs 2.0 in hand-sewn, P=.12).

She fed him directly at the breast with assistance, controlling the delivery of the mother's own milk. The infant received only his mother's own milk, no bottles, and the excess expressed milk was donated to a milk bank. MAIN ISSUE The Cleft Team supported the mother's wish to breastfeed but expressed realism that cleft lip and palate infants could not create suction. Success had never been observed in the unit. Instead, the team suggested expressing to deliver as much of the mother's own milk. The mother had previously breastfed her three children and was keen on finding innovative ways to breastfeed. MANAGEMENT Several techniques were trialed with the help of an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. The most sustainable and successful was the use of a nipple shield applied to the maternal nipple areola complex to cover the lip palate. Underneath, a nasogastric tube connected to a syringe delivered the mother's own milk. Exclusive expressing protected maternal supply, the infant's nutrition and growth were monitored carefully and this technique reinforced mother-infant bonding. CONCLUSION Feeding with the modifications was challenging at times. However, maternal satisfaction was high because the mother had achieved her goal of breastfeeding without assistance post cheiloplasty and palatoplasty.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five patients (17 men, 8 women) with 31 liver metastases >3 cm or located near vessels (>3 mm) were treated in a total of 29 sessions. Tumours were subdivided as follows: colorectal metastases (n=21) and no colorectal metastases (n=10). All procedures were performed percutaneously under ultrasound (US) guidance. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography (CT) scan at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment; mean follow-up period was 12.04 (range, 3-36) months. Technical success, mean disease-free survival, effectiveness and safety were evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was obtained in all cases. Mean disease-free survival was of 20.5 months. Local recurrence was recorded in 12.9% of metastases treated (4/31). No major complications were recorded. The rate of minor complications was 44.8% (13/29 sessions). Mortality at 30 days was 0%.

101390,The heparin recall of 2008.,2013,"Pyronaridine (PYR) is an erythrocytic schizonticide with a potent antimalarial activity against multidrug-resistant Plasmodium. The drug is used in combination with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, in adults and children. The present review briefly retraces the discovery of PYR and recent antimalarial studies which has led to the approval of PYR/artesunate combination (Pyramax) by the European Medicines Agency to treat uncomplicated malaria worldwide. PYR also presents a marked antitumor activity and has revealed efficacy for the treatment of other parasitic diseases (notably Babesia and Trypanosoma infections) and to mitigate the Ebola virus propagation. On the one hand, PYR functions has an inhibitor of hemozoin (biomineral malaria pigment, by-product of hemoglobin digestion) formation, blocking the biopolymerization of β-hematin and thus facilitating the accumulation of toxic hematin into the digestive vacuole of the parasite. On the other hand, PYR is a bona fide DNA-intercalating agent and an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase 2, leading to DNA damages and cell death. Inhibition of hematin polymerization represents the prime mechanism at the origin of the antimalarial activity, whereas anticancer effects relies essentially on the interference with DNA metabolism, as with structurally related anticancer drugs like amsacrine and quinacrine. In addition, recent studies point to an immune modulatory activity of PYR and the implication of a mitochondrial oxidative pathway. An analogy with the mechanism of action of artemisinin drugs is underlined. In brief, the biological actions of pyronaridine are recapitulated to shed light on the diverse health benefits of this unsung drug.","Bailly, Christian",Biopolymers,https://doi.org/10.1002/bip.23398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280083/,163

In both rats and mice, infantile memories, although not expressed, are actually stored long term in a latent form. These latent memories can be reinstated later in life by certain behavioral reminders or by artificial reactivations of neuronal ensembles activated at training. Whether the recovery of infantile memories is limited by developmental age, maternal presence, or contingency of stimuli presentation remains to be determined. Here, we show that the return of inhibitory avoidance memory in rats following a behavioral reactivation consisting of an exposure to the context (conditioned stimuli [CS]) and footshock (unconditioned stimuli [US]) given in a temporally unpaired fashion, is evident immediately after US and is limited by the developmental age at which the reactivations are presented; however, it is not influenced by maternal presence or the time interval between training and reactivation. We conclude that one limiting factor for infantile memory reinstatement is developmental age, suggesting that a brain maturation process is necessary to allow the recovery of a ""lost"" infantile memory.","Bisaz, Reto; Bessières, Benjamin; Miranda, Janelle M; Travaglia, Alessio; Alberini, Cristina M",Learning & memory,https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.052621.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400531/,163

METHODS This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). We searched Medline All, Embase, and PsychINFO in Ovid from inception to June 2019 for articles pertaining to AE and seizure. Included studies reported seizure and/or EEG data in cohorts of ≥10 AE patients. Patient demographics, antibody type, seizure incidence, and EEG findings were extracted. Review of studies and data extraction were performed in duplicate. In addition to descriptive analysis, quantitative synthesis stratified by autoantibody subtype was performed with logistic regression and chi-square analyses. RESULTS Our search yielded 3856 abstracts: 1616 were selected for full-text review and 118 studies met eligibility criteria. Of 3722 antibody-positive AE patients, 2601 (69.9%) had clinical seizures during the course of their illness. Of the 2025 patients with antibody-positive AE and available EEG data, 1718 (84.8%) had some EEG abnormality (eg, epileptiform discharges, slowing, and so on). Anti- N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis (anti-NMDARE) was the most commonly reported type of AE (1985/3722, 53.3%).

102693,Time and cost of administering COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in the United States.,2021-10-06,"The histone variant macroH2A1 contains a carboxyl-terminal ∼30-kDa domain called a macro domain. MacroH2A1 is produced as one of two alternatively spliced forms, macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2. While the macro domain of macroH2A1.1 can interact with NAD(+)-derived small molecules, such as poly(ADP-ribose), macroH2A1.2's macro domain cannot. Here, we show that changes in the alternative splicing of macroH2A1 pre-mRNA, which lead to a decrease in macroH2A1.1 expression, occur in a variety of cancers, including testicular, lung, bladder, cervical, breast, colon, ovarian, and endometrial. Furthermore, reintroduction of macroH2A1.1 suppresses the proliferation of lung and cervical cancer cells in a manner that requires the ability of macroH2A1.1 to bind NAD(+)-derived metabolites. MacroH2A1.1-mediated suppression of proliferation occurs, at least in part, through the reduction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) protein levels. By analyzing publically available expression and splicing microarray data, we identified splicing factors that correlate with alterations in macroH2A1 splicing. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that one of these factors, QKI, regulates the alternative splicing of macroH2A1 pre-mRNA, resulting in increased levels of macroH2A1.1. Finally, we demonstrate that QKI expression is significantly reduced in many of the same cancer types that demonstrate a reduction in macroH2A1.1 splicing.","Novikov, Leonid; Park, Jong Woo; Chen, Hongshan; Klerman, Hadassa; Jalloh, Abubakar S; Gamble, Matthew J",Molecular and cellular biology,https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.05244-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21844227/,163

The exercise program comprised 10 sessions of exercise training. The measurement of pulmonary mechanics and physical functional status (Functional Independence Measurement and Barthel index) were performed pre-study and post-study. The hospitalization outcomes included: days of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization days, and weaning and mortality rates during RCC stay. RESULTS The training group had significant improvement in tidal volume (143.6 mL vs 192.5 mL, P = .02) and rapid shallow breathing index after training (162.2 vs 110.6, P = .009). No significant change was found in the control group except respiratory rate. Both groups had significant improvement in functional status during the study. However, the training group had greater changes in FIM score than the control group (44.6 vs 34.2, P = .024). The training group also had shorter RCC stay and higher weaning and survival rates than the control group, although no statistical difference was found. CONCLUSIONS Subjects with PMV in our RCC demonstrated significant improvement in pulmonary mechanics and functional status after exercise training. The application of exercise training may be helpful for PMV patients to improve hospitalization outcomes.","Chen, Yen-Huey; Lin, Hui-Ling; Hsiao, Hsiu-Feng; Chou, Lan-Ti; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Huang, Chung-Chi; Tsai, Ying-Huang",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152978/,163
102924,Pharmacologic Thromboprophylaxis Other than Aspirin is Associated with Increased Risk for Procedural Intervention for Arthrofibrosis after Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.,2020-09-22,"ABSTRACTBackground:The care of community-dwelling people with dementia often occurs in the context of pre-existing family relationships. The presence of dementia can result in changes to the quality of those relationships. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify factors that enhance or challenge the quality of spousal or offspring relationships in the context of dementia. METHODS Both qualitative and quantitative studies were included in a systematic review of the literature. Thematic analysis of results was conducted that examined factors related to the relationship quality of community dwelling people with dementia and their spousal or offspring carer. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. RESULTS Four themes were extracted from seven qualitative studies: connection to the carer role; identity of the people with dementia; current efforts to maintain relationship connection; and the dyads response to dementia. Each of these four themes incorporated positive and negative facets that impacted on relationship quality. An analysis of nine quantitative and one mixed methods studies identified four domains: influence of dementia characteristics; connection within the dyad; relationship response to stress and carer burden; and carer demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this review highlight relationship factors that are important for supporting relationship quality for the people with dementia and the carer individually, as well as for the dyad together. These findings extend an existing framework of relationship quality in dementia. Implications for interventions to enhance relationship quality in the dementia context are discussed.","Conway, Erin R; Watson, Brittany; Tatangelo, Gemma; McCabe, Marita",International psychogeriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1041610218000303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29667571/,163
102946,Challenges for the Biden presidency.,2021-01-01,"Ankyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a congenital anomaly in which a short lingual frenulum or a highly attached genioglossus muscle restricts tongue movement. The reported prevalence of neonatal ankyloglossia varies between less than 1 and 12.1% depending upon the study population and criteria used to define and grade ankyloglossia. Our hypothesis was that ankyloglossia had a higher prevalence among our newborn population than previously reported. We conducted an observational, transversal cross-sectional study which included all neonates born in our center between January 1 and December 31, 2018, and actively assessed for tongue-tie. We considered ""clinically significant"" or ""symptomatic"" ankyloglossia using the Hazelbaker tool for appearance and function when the mother experienced nipple pain or bruises, or when the neonate had difficulty latching onto the breast. A total of 1392 neonates were born at our center in 2018. Tongue-tie was identified in 645 infants (46.3%), of which 453 were symptomatic (70.2%). Thus, clinically significant ankyloglossia was present in 32.5% of the neonates born in 2018. Their distribution according to Coryllos's types were as follows: 45 type 1 (7.0%), 230 type 2 (35.6%), 321 type 3 (49.8%), and 42 type 4 (6.5%).Conclusion: The prevalence of symptomatic ankyloglossia in our population is higher (32.5%) than studies have reported to date. Actively assessing for tongue-tie increases its diagnosis. What is Known: • There are four types of tongue-tie according to Coryllos (1, 2, 3, and 4), of which the two anterior types (1 and 2) are the most apparent and easy to diagnose. • The reported prevalence of ankyloglossia generally varies from < 1 to 12.1%, although some recent studies report a higher prevalence. What is New: • We found a prevalence of neonatal ankyloglossia of 46.3%, of which 70.2% was symptomatic (clinically significant ankyloglossia was present in 32.5% of the neonates born in 2018 at our hospital). • Actively assessing for ankyloglossia and posterior tongue-ties, which are likely more often undiagnosed, increases its diagnosis.","Maya-Enero, Silvia; Pérez-Pérez, Maria; Ruiz-Guzmán, Luis; Duran-Jordà, Xavier; López-Vílchez, María Ángeles",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03781-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803423/,163

Their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties may be used in the treatment of psoriasis. The aim of this placebo-controlled, double-blind study was to evaluate the clinical effects of D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in mild plaque psoriasis (46 psoriatic patients and 10 healthy volunteers). Three stable psoriatic plaques were selected for evaluation in every patient. Different samples were applied on each lesion twice a day: vehiculum without an active agent, containing 1% DCI and 0.25% DCI. The lesions were assessed using the PSI, VAS scale, and the objective measurement of hydration, TEWL, elasticity and thickness (DermaLab Combo) at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. PSI and VAS were improved in all groups without significant statistical differences. 1% DCI sample presented the highest statistically significant increase in the hydration of 50%, but it was still significantly lower than in healthy controls. TEWL increased for 1% DCI, which was a statistically significant difference compared to 0.25% DCI and still higher than in controls. An improvement in elasticity was observed in all lesions - it was statistically significant for 1% DCI. The thickness of the lesion decreased for 1% DCI, but the change was not statistically significant. Subepidermal low-echogenic band showed a decreasing tendency in all groups, but it was not statistically significant. Favorable 1% DCI sample results indicate that it may be used as an adjuvant to the local treatment of psoriasis. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS 251 TAVR procedures with the implantation of self-expanding valves after predilatation were analyzed. SCB systems were used in 166 and NCB systems in 85 patients. The primary endpoint was defined as device success, a composite endpoint comprising the absence of procedural mortality, correct valve positioning, adequate valve performance and the absence of more than a mild paravalvular leak. The secondary endpoints were chosen in accordance with the valve academic research consortium (VARC-2) endpoint definitions. RESULTS No significant differences were observed with regard to procedural device success between the SCB- and NCB cohort (SCB: 142 [85.5%%] vs. NCB: 77 [90.6%]; P = .257). There was a notable difference between the rates of conversion to open surgery and the postdilatation rate, both of which were higher for the NCB group (SCB: 1 [0.6%] vs. NCB: 4 [5.1%]; P = .042; SCB: 30 [18.1%] vs. NCB: 34 [40%]; P < .001). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of semi-compliant balloon systems for predilatation was associated with a lower risk for postdilatation (OR: 0.296; 95% CI: 0.149-0.588) and conversion to open surgery (OR: 0.205; 95% CI: 0.085-0.493; P = .001) but not for device success. CONCLUSION While the balloon compliance did not affect the procedural mortality, device success or the rate of paravalvular leakage, the use of semi-compliant balloons for predilatation during TAVR should be investigated in larger randomized trials in the light of the lower rates of postdilatation and conversion to open surgery compared to their non-compliant counterparts.","Mach, Markus; Szalkiewicz, Philipp; Poschner, Thomas; Hasan, Waseem; Andreas, Martin; Winkler, Bernhard; Hasimbegovic, Ena; Steinkellner, Theresia; Strouhal, Andreas; Adlbrecht, Christopher; Delle-Karth, Georg; Grabenwöger, Martin",European journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954997/,163

The development of a bioinformatic tool is beneficial to predict the efficacy of TCM against COVID-19. Here we deve-loped a prediction platform TCMATCOV to predict the efficacy of the anti-coronavirus pneumonia effect of TCM, based on the interaction network imitating the disease network of COVID-19. This COVID-19 network model was constructed by protein-protein interactions of differentially expressed genes in mouse pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV and cytokines specifically up-regulated by COVID-19. TCMATCOV adopted quantitative evaluation algorithm of disease network disturbance after multi-target drug attack to predict potential drug effects. Based on the TCMATCOV platform, 106 TCM were calculated and predicted. Among them, the TCM with a high disturbance score account for a high proportion of the classic anti-COVID-19 prescriptions used by clinicians, suggesting that TCMATCOV has a good prediction ability to discover the effective TCM. The five flavors of Chinese medicine with a disturbance score greater than 1 are mainly spicy and bitter. The main meridian of these TCM is lung, heart, spleen, liver, and stomach meridian. The TCM related with QI and warm TCM have higher disturbance score. As a prediction tool for anti-COVID-19 TCM prescription, TCMATCOV platform possesses the potential to discovery possible effective TCM against COVID-19.","Guo, Fei-Fei; Zhang, Yu-Qi; Tang, Shi-Huan; Tang, Xuan; Xu, He; Liu, Zhong-Yang; Huo, Rui-Li; Li, Dong; Yang, Hong-Jun",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200312.401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495578/,163

Urinary incontinence is one of the major drawbacks of radical prostatectomy, regardless of the procedure used (i.e. open, laparoscopic or robotic-assisted). Several technical modifications have been described to improve postoperative continence, highlighting the role of puboprostatic ligaments and posterior reconstruction of the rhabdomyosphincter. The results obtained are inconsistent when applied to robotic surgery. The present multicentre randomized study shows that anterior suspension combined with posterior reconstruction is a safe and easy-to-perform technique for improving early continence after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact on urinary continence of anterior retropubic suspension with posterior reconstruction during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). PATIENTS AND METHODS In total, 72 patients who were due to undergo prostatectomy between July 2009 and July 2010 were prospectively randomized into two groups: group A underwent a standard RALP procedure and group B had anterior suspension and posterior reconstruction during RALP. The primary outcome measure was urinary continence, assessed using the University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index questionnaire at 15 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months, after surgery. Other data recorded were operation duration, blood loss, length of hospital stay, duration of bladder catheterization, complications and positive margin rate. RESULTS The continence rates at 15 days, and at 1, 3 and 6 months, after surgery were 3.6%, 7.1%, 15.4% and 57.9%, respectively, in group A, and 5.9%, 26.5%, 45.2% and 65.4%, respectively, in group B. The continence rates differed statistically between groups at 1 and 3 months (P = 0.047 and P = 0.016, respectively). There was no significant difference between groups regarding complications (P = 0.8) or positive margin rate (P = 0.46).

We hypothesized that LAGB in cirrhotic patients is a safe procedure that may offer positive long-term benefits, both in terms of obesity and avoiding progression of liver disease. METHODS Data were gathered from a prospectively maintained database of 8402 patients who had undergone LAGB from November 1993 and April 2014. RESULTS Fourteen patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis were identified in the database. In all cases, cirrhosis was an unexpected macroscopic finding at the time of surgery, confirmed with intraoperative biopsy. All patients were either Child-Pugh A or B. No patients had preoperative clinical evidence of decompensated liver disease. The mean initial weight was 116.6 kg and BMI 38.9. There was no operative mortality. Two patients experienced a surgical complication (Clavien-Dindo grade II and grade IIIa). At 12 months, the mean excess weight loss was 61.3% giving a mean BMI 31.7. Repeat biopsies were available in three patients. All demonstrated improvement in inflammation and two had fibrosis regression. Baseline liver biochemistry was compared in nine patients who had repeat biochemistry studies after 12 months. There was a significant improvement in alanine transaminase (ALT) (p = 0.04) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (p = 0.02). Two patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). One has died as a result of this disease 11 years after LAGB surgery. CONCLUSION LAGB may be a safe and effective bariatric intervention in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

This can affect the pulmonary health and the gastrointestinal system. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to discuss the impact of probiotics/ prebiotics and supplements on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, especially emerging pathogens. METHODS The data were searched were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google Patents, and The Lens-Patent using keywords of probiotics and viral respiratory infections in the title, abstract, and keywords. RESULT Probiotics consumption could decrease the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and simultaneously enhance vaccine efficiency in infectious disease prevention through the immune system enhancement. Probiotics improve the gut microbiota and the immune system via regulating the innate system response and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, treatment with probiotics contributes to the intestinal homeostasis restitution under antibiotic pressure and decreasing the risk of secondary infections due to viral respiratory infections. Probiotics present varied performances in different conditions; thus, promoting their efficacy through combining with supplements (prebiotics, postbiotics, nutraceuticals, berberine, curcumin, lactoferrin, minerals, and vitamins) is important. Several supplements reported to enhance the probiotics' efficacy and their mechanisms as well as probiotics related patents are summarized in this review. Using nanotechnology and microencapsulation techniques can also improve probiotics efficiency. CONCLUSION Given the global challenge of COVID-19, probiotic/prebiotic and following nutritional guidelines should be regarded seriously. Additionally, their role as an adjuvant in vaccination for immune response augmentation needs attention.","Heidari, Zahra; Tajbakhsh, Amir; Gheibi-Hayat, Seyed Mohammad; Moattari, Afagh; Razban, Vahid; Berenjian, Aydin; Savardashtaki, Amir; Negahdaripour, Manica",Recent patents on biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1872208315666210419103742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33874878/,163

Nevertheless, stress and adversity related to COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents' mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress and COVID-19 family adversity. Approximately 4 years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19, family adversity related to COVID-19, and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or HRV augmentation, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Conversely, lower resting HRV indicated vulnerability to the effect of COVID-19 family adversity on emotional problems. Different patterns of parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress versus vulnerability to the effects of COVID-19 family adversity on mental health during the pandemic.","Miller, Jonas G; Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S; Ho, Tiffany C; Gifuni, Anthony J; Gotlib, Ian H",Development and psychopathology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s095457942100033x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099071/,163
105681,"Diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in wild rodents from the Canary Islands, Spain.",2020-09-04,"Introduction The probability of surviving a cardiac arrest remains low. International resuscitation guidelines state that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) may have a role in selected patients suffering refractory cardiac arrest. Identifying these patients is challenging. This project systematically reviewed the evidence comparing the outcomes of ECPR over conventional-CPR (CCPR), before examining resuscitation-specific parameters to assess which patients might benefit from ECPR. Method Literature searches of studies comparing ECPR to CCPR and the clinical parameters of survivors of ECPR were performed. The primary outcome examined was survival at hospital discharge or 30 days. A secondary analysis examined the resuscitation parameters that may be associated with survival in patients who receive ECPR (no-flow and low-flow intervals, bystander-CPR, initial shockable cardiac rhythm, and witnessed cardiac arrest). Results Seventeen of 948 examined studies were included. ECPR demonstrated improved survival (OR 0.40 (0.27-0.60)) and a better neurological outcome (OR 0.10 (0.04-0.27)) over CCPR during literature review and meta-analysis. Characteristics that were associated with improved survival in patients receiving ECPR included an initial shockable rhythm and a shorter low-flow time. Shorter no-flow, the presence of bystander-CPR and witnessed arrests were not characteristics that were associated with improved survival following meta-analysis, although the quality of input data was low. All data were non-randomised, and hence the potential for bias is high. Conclusion ECPR is a sophisticated treatment option which may improve outcomes in a selected patient population in refractory cardiac arrest.

The purpose of this prospective study was to objectively evaluate intercostal nerve damage using current perception threshold testing in association with chest tube insertion. METHODS Sixteen patients were enrolled in this study. Intercostal nerve function was assessed with a series of 2000-Hz (Aβ fiber), 250-Hz (Aδ fiber), and 5-Hz (C fiber) stimuli using current perception threshold testing (Neurometer CPT/C(®)). Current perception threshold values at chest tube insertion were measured before surgery, during chest tube insertion and after removal of the chest tube. Intensities of ongoing pain were also assessed using a numeric rating scale (0-10). RESULTS Current perception thresholds at each frequency after surgery were significantly higher than before surgery. Numeric rating scale scores for pain were significantly reduced from 3.3 to 1.9 after removal of the chest tube (p = 0.004). The correlation between current perception threshold value at 2000 Hz and intensity of ongoing pain was marginally significant (p = 0.058).

However, subcapsular or lesions close to adjacent viscera preclude a percutaneous approach. In this setting laparoscopic-RFA (LRFA) is a potential alternative. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and feasibility of LRFA in patients with HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective study of patients with HCC meeting strict inclusion criteria who underwent LRFA at a single Institution from December 2000 to March 2013. RESULTS Forty-one patients underwent 42 LRFA of 51 nodules. The median size of the nodule was 2.5 (range 1.2-4.7) cm. Thirty-one tumours were subcapsular and 17 located near the gallbladder. Major complications occurred in 17 patients. The initial complete response (ICR) rate was 94% and was lower among tumours located adjacent to the gallbladder. At the end of the follow-up period, the sustained complete response (SCR) rate was 70% and was lower in tumours adjacent to the gallbladder while increased for subcapsular tumours. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rate was 92.6%, 64.5% and 43%, respectively. CONCLUSION LRFA of HCC is safe, feasible and achieves excellent results in selected patients. LRFA should be the first-line technique for subcapsular lesions as it minimizes the risk of tumoural seeding and improves ICR. Proximity to gallbladder interferes in treatment efficacy (lower rate of ICR and lower rate of SCR).","de la Serna, Sofía; Vilana, Ramón; Sánchez-Cabús, Santiago; Calatayud, David; Ferrer, Joana; Molina, Victor; Fondevila, Constantino; Bruix, Jordi; Fuster, Josep; García-Valdecasas, Juan-Carlos",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/hpb.12379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545319/,163

While identification and containment of new cases remains important, laboratories must now pivot and consider an assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semi-quantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1236 unique participants comprised of naïve, SARS-CoV-2 infected, and vaccinated (including both naïve and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96% after 15 days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naïve, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naïve group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals had several fold higher IgGSP responses than naïve following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.","Narasimhan, Madhusudhanan; Mahimainathan, Lenin; Araj, Ellen; Clark, Andrew E; Markantonis, John; Green, Allen; Xu, Jing; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Alexis, Charles; Fankhauser, Kimberly; Parikh, Hiren; Wilkinson, Kathleen; Reczek, Annika; Kopplin, Noa; Yekkaluri, Sruthi; Balani, Jyoti; Thomas, Abey; Singal, Amit G; Sarode, Ravi; Muthukumar, Alagarraju",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00388-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827901/,163

This rich data set, linking prenatal and postnatal environments, diverse biological samples and rigorous phenotyping, will inform early developmental pathways to allergy, asthma and other chronic inflammatory diseases.","Subbarao, Padmaja; Anand, Sonia S; Becker, Allan B; Befus, A Dean; Brauer, Michael; Brook, Jeffrey R; Denburg, Judah A; HayGlass, Kent T; Kobor, Michael S; Kollmann, Tobias R; Kozyrskyj, Anita L; Lou, W Y Wendy; Mandhane, Piushkumar J; Miller, Gregory E; Moraes, Theo J; Pare, Peter D; Scott, James A; Takaro, Tim K; Turvey, Stuart E; Duncan, Joanne M; Lefebvre, Diana L; Sears, Malcolm R",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26069286/,163
106935,Non-Lethal Endotoxin Injection: A Rat Model of Hypercoagulability.,2017,"AIM Anastomotic leak (AL) after colorectal resection is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality; potential permanent stoma formation, increased local recurrence, reduced cancer related survival, poor functional outcomes and associated quality of life. Techniques to reduce leak rates are therefore highly sought after. METHOD A literature search was performed for published full text articles using PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus databases with a focus on colorectal surgery 1990-2020. Additional papers were detected by scanning references of relevant papers. RESULTS A total of 53 papers were included after a thorough literature search. Techniques assessed included leak tests, endoscopy, perfusion assessment and fluorescence studies. Air-leak testing remains the most commonly used method across Europe, due to ease of reproducibility and low cost. There is no evidence this reduces the leak rate, however identification of a leak intra-operatively provides the opportunity for either suture reinforcement or formal takedown with or without re-do of the anastomosis and consideration of diversion. Suture repair alone of a positive ALT is associated with an increased AL rate. The use of fluorescence studies to guide site of anastomosis has demonstrated reduced leak rates in distal anastomoses, is safe, feasible and has a promising future. CONCLUSION Although over reliance on any assessment tool should be avoided, intra-operative techniques with the aim of reducing AL rates are increasingly being employed. Standardisation of these methods is imperative for routine use. However, in the interim it is recommended that all anastomoses should be assessed intra-operatively for mechanical failure, particularly distal ones.","Clifford, R E; Fowler, H; Manu, N; Sutton, P; Vimalachandran, D",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978892/,163
106952,Five new flavonoid glycosides from Nervilia fordii.,2013,"Improving the speed of outbreak detection and reporting at the community level are critical in managing the threat of emerging infectious diseases, many of which are zoonotic. The widespread use of mobile phones, including in rural areas, constitutes a potentially effective tool for real-time surveillance of infectious diseases. Using longitudinal data from a disease surveillance system implemented in 1500 households in rural Kenya, we test the effectiveness of mobile phone animal syndromic surveillance by comparing it with routine household animal health surveys, determine the individual and household correlates of its use and examine the broader implications for surveillance of zoonotic diseases. A total of 20 340 animal and death events were reported from the community through the two surveillance systems, half of which were confirmed as valid disease events. The probability of an event being valid was 2.1 times greater for the phone-based system, compared with the household visits. Illness events were 15 times (95% CI 12.8, 17.1) more likely to be reported through the phone system compared to routine household visits, but not death events (OR 0.1 (95% CI 0.09, 0.11)). Disease syndromes with severe presentations were more likely to be reported through the phone system. While controlling for herd and flock sizes owned, phone ownership was not a determinant of using the phone-based surveillance system, but the lack of a formal education, and having additional sources of income besides farming were associated with decreased likelihood of reporting through the phone system. Our study suggests that a phone-based surveillance system will be effective at detecting outbreaks of diseases such as Rift Valley fever that present with severe clinical signs in animal populations, but in the absence of additional reporting incentives, it may miss early outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza that present primarily with mortality.

107088,Reusable and Recyclable Graphene Masks with Outstanding Superhydrophobic and Photothermal Performances.,2020-04-24,"Background The major global health threat tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb has a complex cell envelope - a partially covalently linked composite of polysaccharides, peptidoglycan and lipids, including a mycolic acid layer - which conveys pathogenicity but also protects against antibiotics. Given previous successes in treating gram-positive and -negative infections with cell wall degrading enzymes, we investigated such approach for Mtb. Objectives (i) Development of an Mtb microtiter growth inhibition assay that allows undisturbed cell envelope formation, to overcome the invalidation of results by typical clumped Mtb-growth in surfactant-free assays. (ii) Exploring anti-Mtb potency of cell wall layer-degrading enzymes. (iii) Investigation of the concerted action of several such enzymes. Methods We inserted a bacterial luciferase-operon in an auxotrophic Mtb strain to develop a microtiter assay that allows proper evaluation of cell wall degrading anti-Mtb enzymes. We assessed growth-inhibition by enzymes (recombinant mycobacteriophage mycolic acid esterase (LysB), fungal α-amylase and human and chicken egg white lysozymes) and combinations thereof, in presence or absence of biopharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Results Our biosafety level-2 assay identified both LysB and lysozymes as potent Mtb-inhibitors, but only in presence of surfactant. Moreover, most potent disruption of the mycolic acid hydrophobic barrier was obtained by the highly synergistic combination of LysB, α-amylase and polysorbate 80. Conclusions Synergistically acting cell wall degrading enzymes are potently inhibiting Mtb - which sets the scene for the design of specifically tailored antimycobacterial (fusion) enzymes. Airway delivery of protein therapeutics has already been established and should be studied in animal models for active TB.","van Schie, Loes; Borgers, Katlyn; Michielsen, Gitte; Plets, Evelyn; Vuylsteke, Marnik; Tiels, Petra; Festjens, Nele; Callewaert, Nico",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00659-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280017/,163
107106,Biotin Functionalized Self-Assembled Peptide Nanofiber as an Adjuvant for Immunomodulatory Response.,2020-07-17,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE Coptidis rhizoma is traditionally used for heat-clearing and toxic-scavenging and it belongs to liver meridian in Chinese medicine practice. Clinically, Coptidis rhizoma can be used for hepatic and biliary disorders, yet details in the therapies of liver diseases and underlying mechanism(s) remain unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that Coptidis rhizoma aqueous extract (CRAE) against CCl(4)-induced acute liver damage was related to antioxidant property. In the present study, the protection of CRAE on chronic liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) in rats and its related mechanism were explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS The CCl(4)-induced chronic liver damage model was established, and CRAE's protective effect was examined. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, serum and liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were then measured. The histological changes were observed under microscopy and then computed in numerical score. The normal or damaged cells were isolated and related signaling pathway was evaluated. RESULT Serum AST and ALT activities were significantly decreased in rats treated with different doses of CRAE, indicating its protective effect against CCl(4)-induced chronic liver damage. Observation on serum SOD activity revealed that CRAE might act as an anti-oxidant agent against CCl(4)-induced chronic oxide stress. Histological study supported these observations. Erk1/2 inhibition may take part into CRAE's effect on preventing hepatocyte from apoptosis when exposed to oxidative stress. CONCLUSION CRAE showed protective effect against CCl(4)-induced chronic liver damage in rats and its potential as an agent in the treatment of chronic liver diseases by protecting hepatocyte from injury.","Feng, Yibin; Wang, Ning; Ye, Xingshen; Li, Huangyun; Feng, Yigang; Cheung, Fan; Nagamatsu, Tadashi",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.09.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21963555/,163

107992,Photoplethysmography in Normal and Pathological Sleep.,2021-04-22,"INTRODUCTION The numbers of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Indonesia especially in Jakarta as the epicenter continue to rise. Limited published clinical data, scarcity and long turn over time of diagnostic testing put clinician in dilemma to make diagnosis. METHODOLOGY This is an observational case series study from confirmed COVID-19 patient in our hospital from first case admission on 17 March 30 April, 2020. We collected patient's demography, symptoms, comorbidities, therapy, laboratory, chest x-ray and ECG consecutively. RESULTS Between 17 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, there were 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 16 (53.3%) were male. Clinical symptoms were dyspnea in 22 (73.3%) and dry cough 16 (53.3%). Comorbidities were diabetes in 14 (46.6%), hypertension 10 (33.3%) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in 10 (33.3%) patients respectively. Laboratory findings showed lymphopenia in 21 (70%) patients, increased inflammation marker in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 21 (70%), 23 (76.6%) and 12 (40%) patients respectively. Twenty-seven (90%) cases had abnormal Chest X-Ray (CXR) and mostly severe 18 (60%). Descriptive finding for images included consolidation 16 (53.3%) and Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) in 10 (33.3%) patients. CONCLUSIONS Based on our findings, most cases of COVID-19 admitted in secondary referral hospital were already in moderate to severe stages. This is most likely due to late referral from primary care and unspecific clinical features resemblance of other infectious diseases. Inflammation marker and CXR are cost effective findings and can be used as marker to determine further referral.","Hafiz, Muhammad; Icksan, Aziza Ghanie; Harlivasari, Annisa Dian; Aulia, Rizky; Susanti, Febrina; Eldinia, Lourisa",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794466/,163

TFL flaps were elevated and delayed for 4 weeks in both cases. In the second case, Parietex Composite mesh was positioned underneath the TFL flap and allowed to incorporate. After a delay of 4 weeks, the flaps were harvested and tunnelled subcutaneously to repair the abdominal wall defect. Both patients have stable repairs but had donor site seromas requiring drainage. Cadaver dissection was also performed to identify structures related to TFL flap harvest. We identified a variant of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that traversed the TFL flap, necessitating meticulous dissection during surgery. In summary, we describe a new technique of incorporating mesh into the TFL prior to flap harvest for reconstruction of complex abdominal wall.","Wang, Frederick; Buonocore, Samuel; Narayan, Deepak",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr.08.2010.3236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22707661/,163
108503,A Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of an Anorectal Surgery Multimodal Enhanced Recovery Program on Opioid Use.,2020-12-18,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) is increasingly being used as an alternative to surgery and enteral stenting to manage gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). However, no data are available on the learning curve (LC) for EUS-GE. Defining it is necessary for the creation of adequate subspecialty training programs and quality assurance. METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained dataset of patients that underwent EUS-GE at one tertiary referral center. Primary outcome was the LC for EUS-GE defined by the number of cases needed to achieve proficiency and mastery using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Moving average graphs and sequential time-block analysis were also performed to assess procedural time. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety of EUS-GE. RESULTS Eighty-seven consecutive patients underwent EUS-GE, mostly for malignant GOO. For consistency, 14 patients were excluded from analysis (noncautery-assisted EUS-GE 11, surgical anatomy 3). The same endoscopist performed all procedures using the same freehand technique. Technical success was achieved in 68 out of 73 (93%) patients. Immediate AEs occurred in 4 (5.5%) patients, whereas late AEs occurred only in 1 (1%) patient, all managed conservatively or endoscopically. All immediate adverse events occurred during the first 39 cases. Clinical success (defined as resuming at least oral liquid diet within a week) was achieved in 97% of patients. The mean procedural time was 36 minutes (SD 24). Evaluation of the CUSUM curve revealed that 25 cases were needed to achieve proficiency and 40 cases to achieve mastery. These results were confirmed with the average moving curve and sequential time-block analysis. CONCLUSION We report, for the first time, data on the learning curve for EUS-GE. About 25 procedures can be considered as the threshold to achieve proficiency and about 40 cases are needed to reach mastery of the technique.","Jovani, Manol; Ichkhanian, Yervant; Parsa, Nasim; Singh, Sahiljeet; Brewer Gutierrez, Olaya I; Keane, Geri; Al Ghamdi, Sarah S; Ngamruengphong, Saowanee; Kumbhari, Vivek; Khashab, Mouen A",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.09.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991868/,163

A subsequent literature review revealed a lack of studies focused within the healthcare sector. METHODS A tool to measure JHSC effectiveness was developed by a panel of occupational health and safety experts based on a framework from the healthcare sector. Usability testing was conducted in two phases with members of five hospital JHSCs before, during and after a committee meeting. RESULTS Usability of the tool was scored high overall with an average of > 4 on a 5 point scale across twelve items. Downward adjustment of self-assessment scores was reported following JHSC meetings. CONCLUSION Findings demonstrated that the tool was easy to use, effective in supporting discussion and in assisting participants in reaching consensus on rating a large number of JHSC characteristics.

108756,Ablative therapies for small renal tumours.,2013,"INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the added value of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We reviewed our institution database of 3499 consecutive patients treated for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 362 patients with histologically proven DCIS were selected from the institutional database. Of these, 245 (67.7%) preoperatively underwent conventional imaging (CI) (mammography/ultrasonography) (CI group), and 117 (32.3%) underwent CI and dynamic MRI (CI + MRI group). The pathology of surgical specimens served as a reference standard. The Mann-Whitney U, χ2 test, and Spearman correlation coefficient were performed. RESULTS The CI + MRI group showed a sensitivity of 98.5% with an increase of 10.1% compared with the CI group to detect pure DCIS. Dynamic MRI identified 19.7% (n = 13) additional pure DCIS compared with CI. In the CI + MRI group, a single (1.5%) false negative was reported, whereas in the CI group, 11 (11.6%) false negatives were reported. Moreover, the CI + MRI group showed a sensitivity of 98.0% to detect DCIS + small invasive component. In this group, dynamic MRI identified 21.6% (n = 11) additional DCIS and a single (2.0%) false negative compared with the CI group, whereas in the CI group, 7 (4.7%) false negatives were reported. MRI and histopathologically measured lesion sizes, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System MRI assessment categories, and enhancement signal intensity curve types showed a significant correlation. The MRI detection rate of DCIS increased significantly with increasing nuclear grade. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative breast MRI showed a better accuracy then CI in preoperative diagnosis for both pure DCIS and DCIS + small invasive component with a precise assessment of lesion size. This can provide a more appropriate management of DCIS patients.","Petrillo, Antonella; Fusco, Roberta; Petrillo, Mario; Triunfo, Flavia; Filice, Salvatore; Vallone, Paolo; Setola, Sergio Venanzio; Rubulotta, Mariarosaria; Di Bonito, Maurizio; Rinaldo, Massimo; D'Aiuto, Massimiliano; Brunetti, Arturo",Clinical breast cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2016.12.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28111130/,163
108864,Is the Pace of Biomedical Innovation Slowing?,2018,"BACKGROUND Several studies have shown a substantial impact of Rotavirus (RV) vaccination on the burden of RV and all-cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). However, the results of most impact studies could be confused by a dynamic and complex space-time process. Therefore, there is a need to analyse the impact of RV vaccination on RV and AGE hospitalisations in a space-time framework to detect geographical-time patterns while avoiding the potential confusion caused by population inequalities in the impact estimations. METHODS A retrospective population-based study using real-world data from the Valencia Region was performed among children aged less than 3 years old in the period 2005-2016. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was constructed to analyse RV and AGE hospitalisations and to estimate the vaccination impact measured in averted hospitalisations. RESULTS We found important spatio-temporal patterns in RV and AGE hospitalisations, RV vaccination coverage and in their associated adverted hospitalisations. Overall, ~ 1866 hospital admissions for RV were averted by RV vaccination during 2007-2016. Despite the low-medium vaccine coverage (~ 50%) in 2015-2016, relevant 36 and 20% reductions were estimated in RV and AGE hospitalisations respectively. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of the RV vaccines has substantially reduced the number of RV hospitalisations, averting ~ 1866 admissions during 2007-2016 which were space and time dependent. This study improves the methodologies commonly used to estimate the RV vaccine impact and their interpretation.","López-Lacort, Mónica; Orrico-Sánchez, Alejandro; Martínez-Beneito, Miguel Ángel; Muñoz-Quiles, Cintia; Díez-Domingo, Javier",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05373-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894071/,163
109073,Quantifying uncertainty in the chemical master equation.,2017,"INTRODUCTION It is difficult to distinguish coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) from other viral respiratory tract infections owing to the similarities in clinical and radiological findings. This study aims to determine the clinical importance of platelet count and platelet indices in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza and the value of these parameters in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS The medical records of the patients and the electronic patient monitoring system were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, admission symptoms, laboratory findings, radiological involvement, comorbidities, and mortality of the patients were recorded. RESULTS Forty-three patients diagnosed with influenza and 54 diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. The average age of the COVID-19 patients was lower than that of the influenza patients (influenza: 60.5 years, COVID-19: 52.4 years; p = 0.024), and the male gender was predominant in the COVID-19 group (influenza: 42%, COVID-19: 56%). According to laboratory findings, mean platelet volume (MPV) and MPV/platelet ratio were statistically significantly lower, whereas eosinophil count and platelet distribution width (PDW) level were significantly higher (p <0.05) in the COVID-19 group. It was found that the most common symptom in both groups was dyspnea and that the symptom was more prevalent among the influenza patients. CONCLUSIONS In the diagnosis of COVID-19, platelet count and platelet indices are easily accessible, inexpensive and important parameters in terms of differential diagnosis and can help in the differentiation of COVID-19 from influenza during seasonal outbreaks of the latter.

Recent literature suggests that endovascular coil embolization followed by hematoma evacuation can be an acceptable alternative. OBJECTIVE To determine neurological outcomes in patients with ruptured MCA aneurysms and intraparenchymal or sylvian fissure hematomas. METHODS The records of 49 patients with ruptured MCA aneurysms with large intracranial hematomas treated with hematoma evacuation and aneurysm clipping between January 2000 and December 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Within this cohort, 35 patients (71.4%) were Hunt and Hess grade IV or V on presentation. The mean hematoma volume was 100.4 ± 77.2 mL. Craniectomy was performed in 40 patients (81.6%). Angiographic vasospasm developed in 15 patients (30.6%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 28.6% (14 patients). At a mean of 25.3 ± 34.0 months follow-up, a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-3) was observed in 18 patients (36.7%). Significant factors associated with poor outcome or death (mRS scores of 4-6) included increasing age (P < .01), increasing Hunt and Hess grade (P = .03), increasing modified Fisher grade (P = .01), presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P < .01), decreasing percentage of hematoma evacuation (P < .05), need for craniectomy (P <. 01), need for external ventricular drainage (P = .04), and angiographic vasospasm (P = .02). CONCLUSION MCA aneurysm rupture with concomitant large intraparenchymal or sylvian fissure hematoma formation carries a grave prognosis. Simultaneous hematoma evacuation and aneurysm clipping with or without craniectomy can be an effective treatment modality.","Stapleton, Christopher J; Walcott, Brian P; Fusco, Matthew R; Butler, William E; Thomas, Ajith J; Ogilvy, Christopher S",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25603109/,163

A patient with a right adrenal tumor complicated by total situs inversus was treated by laparoscopy. CASE DISCUSSION The patient was a 45-y-old male with lower limb weakness. He had been diagnosed with situs inversus during a general health check-up as an infant. His blood pressure was 230/160 mm Hg, and the serum potassium level was 2.0 mEq/L. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass of about 2cm in diameter in contact with the right adrenal gland. Total situs inversus was simultaneously confirmed. The plasma aldosterone concentration was elevated to 442pg/mL, and renin activity was suppressed, at 0.3ng/mL/hr. DISCUSSION These findings indicated a diagnosis of primary aldosteronism due to an adrenal tumor, and the right adrenal tumor was resected laparoscopically. The right adrenal gland was approached and resected from the lateral side of the spleen, which was located on the right side because of situs inversus. The resected specimen was 4.5cm x 1.6cm, and no intraoperative complications occurred.

The most of OR procedures had been emergencies/urgencies and oncological patients (respectively 113 and 66 vs 164.5 and 84.5 of the previous biennium), while elective surgeries decrease up to -97.1%, as for spinal nerves and endoscopic skull base procedures. The patients phone contacts and telemedicine evaluations of their examinations have permitted to reduce the hospital access for outpatients of 75.6%, but these modalities have, also, permitted to follow-up a large number of cases. CONCLUSIONS The outbreak of COVID-19 has imposed several limits to our current practice, however this should not represent an excuse to reduce the standard of care. In our experience, the net integration of different local centers has permitted for each of them to effectively cope the crisis, managing the local cases requiring a prompt surgery and keeping the care continuity with already discharged patients.","Mazzatenta, Diego; Zoli, Matteo; Cavallo, Michele A; Ferro, Salvatore; Giombelli, Ermanno; Pavesi, Giacomo; Sturiale, Carmelo; Tosatto, Luigino; Zucchelli, Mino",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0390-5616.20.05018-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32525290/,163

111823,"Remote FLS testing in the real world: ready for ""prime time"".",2016,"BACKGROUND Burnout syndrome consists in physical as well as mental exhaustion observed in professionals whose work involves continuous contact with other people. Psychiatrists and psychiatry nursing staff are considered to be vulnerable to experiencing burnout. The purposes of this study aim to investigate the prevalence of burnout syndrome in practitioners, residents and nurses working in the psychiatric hospital of Tunisia. It also aims to investigate the relationship between burnout, depression, and a variety of personal variables, including age, gender, marital, parental and personal difficulties within this population. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among the nursing staff (n=54), residents (n=41) and practitioners (n=11) in Razi hospital in Tunisia. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Beck depression inventory and a general questionnaire on demographic data were used. RESULTS High levels of burnout were detected among nurses. This was true for the emotional tiredness sub-scale (mean score: 26.18); the depersonalization subscale (mean score: 10.20) and for the alteration of personal achievements (mean score: 32.94). High scores in emotional tiredness were correlated to depression (P=0.000; R=0.56) and to personal difficulties (P=0.021; R=0.31) in this group. Residents showed high scores in personal achievements (mean score: 32.56), and practitioners did not reach the cutoff scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory. CONCLUSION Our results are somewhat comparable to those of studies in other countries. Burnout syndrome was highly prevalent among nurses and residents. This study corroborates former results of a relation between depression and burnout. A strong relationship was found between personal difficulties and burnout, but seemed to be more specific to the nursing sample.","Halayem-Dhouib, S; Zaghdoudi, L; Zremdini, R; Maalej, I; Béchir, M Ben; Labbène, R",Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2010.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21094003/,163

Whether rats and mice benefit from being provided with running wheels or plates is discussed controversially. Here we present observations from a feeding experiment, where rats were provided a running plate. As a pilot study, six identical cages, with three animals per cage, were filmed for six days, and the resulting footage was screened for the number of bouts and the time the animals spent on the plates. The main activities observed on the plate in descending order were sitting (18.5 ± 13.8 bouts or 8.0 ± 13.7 min/animal per day), standing (10.2 ± 11.6 bouts, 3.8 ± 4.2 min), running (8.2 ± 13.3 bouts, 10.1 ± 21.4 min), grooming (2.0 ± 2.8 bouts, 6.7 ± 25.7 min), sleeping (1.0 ± 2.6 bouts, 24.0 ± 61.8 min) and playing (0.5 ± 0.9 bouts, 0.1 ± 0.5 min). Most of these activities (91% of all bouts, 90% of total time) occurred at night, similar to previous studies on running wheel usage.

Although respiratory involvement is the mainstay of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), systemic involvement has recently drawn more attention. In particular, a number of recent articles have shed light on the nervous system as one of the possible targets. At our institution, we observed 15 patients with acute brain vascular manifestations; most interesting, we had a higher prevalence of the posterior circulation acute impairment. In our series, 7 patients had acute posterior cerebral injury: 1, hemorrhagic posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; 5, posterior circulation ischemic stroke; and 1, parieto-occipital hemorrhagic stroke.

The method involves endoscopic access into the LV cavity; hence the term ""transapical cardioscopic surgery (TACS)."" METHODS For this proof-of-concept study, we obtained transapical access to the left ventricle in five pigs. A right minithoracotomy was used for cannulation and cardiopulmonary bypass A purse string-secured incision at the apex allows for introduction of a self-made intracavitary expander, 5 mm steerable-tip endoscopic camera as well as 5 and 3 mm endoscopic instruments. RESULTS The trans-apical approach provided a good exposure and an adequate surgical field, which allowed us to perform mitral valve repair, mitral valve replacement, and aortic valve replacement. This approach also enabled excellent access and visualization for atrial ablation and intra-aortic procedures. All animals were rewarmed and weaned off bypass. CONCLUSIONS The proposed transapical cardioscopic platform is feasible for major intra-cardiac procedures.","Kofidis, Theo; Duc Vu, Thang; Pal, Shripad N; Vaibavi, Srirangam Ramanujam; Chang, GuoHao; Chua, Yang Chong; Ti, Lian Kah; Lee, Chuen Neng",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.12419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25099949/,163

We aimed to identify alterations in the hypocretin system in SCZ patients. We measured plasma hypocretin-1 levels in SCZ patients and healthy controls and found significantly decreased plasma hypocretin-1 levels in SCZ patients, which was mainly due to a significant decrease in female SCZ patients compared with female controls. In addition, we measured postmortem hypothalamic hypocretin-1-immunoreactivity (ir), ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels, and hypocretin receptor (Hcrt-R) mRNA expression in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in SCZ patients and controls We observed a significant decrease in the amount of hypothalamic hypocretin-1 ir in SCZ patients, which was due to decreased amounts in female but not male patients. Moreover, Hcrt-R2 mRNA in the SFG was decreased in female SCZ patients compared with female controls, while male SCZ patients showed a trend of increased Hcrt-R1 mRNA and Hcrt-R2 mRNA expression compared with male controls. We conclude that central hypocretin neurotransmission is decreased in SCZ patients, especially female patients, and this is reflected in the plasma.","Lu, Jing; Huang, Man-Li; Li, Jin-Hui; Jin, Kang-Yu; Li, Hai-Mei; Mou, Ting-Ting; Fronczek, Rolf; Duan, Jin-Feng; Xu, Wei-Juan; Swaab, Dick; Bao, Ai-Min",Schizophrenia bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbab042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974073/,163

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients with acute ICH who underwent CT angiography on a dual-layer detector spectral CT scanner. A spectral data analysis was performed to detect contrast enhancement in or adjacent to acute ICH by using spectral image reconstructions including monoenergetic (MonoE), virtual noncontrast (VNC), and iodine overlay fusion images. We also acquired a spectral plot to assess material differentiation within lesions. RESULTS Among the 30 patients, the most common cause of acute ICH was chronic hypertension (18/30, 60%) followed by trauma (5/30, 16.7%), brain tumour (3/30, 10%), Moyamoya disease (2/30, 6.7%), and haemorrhagic diathesis from anticoagulation therapy (2/30, 6.7%). Of 30 patients, 13 showed suboptimal iodine suppression in the subcalvarial spaces on VNC images compared with true noncontrast images. The CT angiographic spot sign within the acute ICH was detected in four patients (4/30, 13.3%). All three tumours were metastatic and included lung cancer (n = 2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1) which showed conspicuous delineation of an enhancing tumour portion in the spectral analysis. Spectral analyses allowed the discrimination of acute haemorrhage and iodine with enhanced lesion visualization on the MonoE images obtained at lower keVs (less than 70 keV) and spectral plot. CONCLUSIONS Even though the image quality of VNC is perceived to be inferior, it is feasible to evaluate acute ICH in clinical settings using dual-layer detector spectral CT. The MonoE images taken at lower keVs were useful for depicting contrast enhancing lesion, and spectral plot might be helpful for material differentiation in patients with acute ICH.","Cho, Soo Buem; Baek, Hye Jin; Ryu, Kyeong Hwa; Moon, Jin Il; Choi, Bo Hwa; Park, Sung Eun; Bae, Kyungsoo; Jeon, Kyung Nyeo; Kim, Dong Wook",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29112977/,163

Postoperative anastomotic leakage (AL) remains problematic. The use of fibrin sealant (FS) may improve the strength of esophageal anastomosis and reduce the incidence of AL. AIM To assess the efficacy and safety of applying FS to prevent AL in patients with EC or EJC. METHODS In this single-arm, phase II trial (Clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT03529266), we recruited patients aged 18-80 years with resectable EC or EJC clinically staged as T1-4aN0-3M0. An open or minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy was performed with a circular stapled anastomosis. After performing the anastomosis, 2.5 mL of porcine FS was applied circumferentially. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with AL within 3 mo. RESULTS From June 4, 2018, to December 29, 2018, 57 patients were enrolled. At the data cutoff date (June 30, 2019), three (5.3%) of the 57 patients had developed AL, including two (3.5%) with esophagogastric AL and one (1.8%) with gastric fistula. The incidence of anastomotic stricture and other major postoperative complications was 1.8% and 17.5%, respectively. The median time needed to resume oral feeding after operation was 8 d (Interquartile range: 7.0-9.0 d). No adverse events related to FS were recorded. No deaths occurred within 90 d after surgery. CONCLUSION Perioperative sealing with porcine FS appears safe and may prevent AL after esophagectomy in patients with resectable EC or EJC. Further phase III studies are warranted.","Lin, Yao-Bin; Fu, Jian-Hua; Huang, Yan; Hu, Yi-Huai; Luo, Kong-Jia; Wang, Ke-Xi; Bella, Amos Éla; Situ, Dong-Rong; Chen, Ji-Yang; Lin, Ting; D'Journo, Xavier B; Novoa, Nuria M; Brunelli, Alessandro; Fernando, Hiran C; Cerfolio, Robert J; Ismail, Mahmoud; Yang, Hong",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,https://doi.org/10.4251/wjgo.v12.i6.651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699580/,163

Schwannomas may take origin from different nerves such as cranial, spinal nerves, and the sympathetic chain. Approximately 25% to 45% of all occur in the head and neck only 1% of them are located in the oral cavity. However, it is quite rare to for schwannomas to form on the tongue base. Ancient schwannoma is the rarest, and also extremely rare in oropharynx. A 32-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with complaints of hoarseness, difficulty in swallowing, throat pain, snoring, and dyspnea. In examination, a smooth surfaced circumscribed mass, which originated from the tongue base was observed. In the magnetic resonance imaging, a 4.5 × 3 cm sized tongue base mass which narrowed the upper airway was detected. An endoscopic transoral excisional biopsy was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was determined as ancient schwannoma. The use of the endoscopic transoral approach can be suitable to protect the important anatomical structures, functions, and reduce the complications and esthetic concerns for the resection of tongue base schwannomas.","Yaslikaya, Serhat; Kizilay, Ahmet; Şamdanci, Emine",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000006416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32195841/,163

Promising disease-modifying treatments to reinstate UBE3A expression are under development and an early measure of treatment response is critical to their deployment in clinical trials. Increased delta power in EEG recordings, reflecting abnormal neuronal synchrony, occurs in AS across species and correlates with genotype. Whether delta power provides a reliable biomarker for clinical symptoms remains unknown. METHODS We analyzed combined EEG recordings and developmental assessments in a large cohort of individuals with AS (N = 82 subjects, 133 combined EEG and cognitive assessments, 1.08-28.16 years; 32F) and evaluated delta power as a biomarker for cognitive function, as measured by the Bayley Cognitive Score. We examined the robustness of this biomarker to varying states of consciousness, recording techniques and analysis procedures. RESULTS Delta power predicted the Bayley Scale cognitive score (P < 10-5 , R2 = 0.9374) after controlling for age (P < 10-24 ), genotype:age (P < 10-11 ), and repeat assessments (P < 10-8 ), with the excellent fit on cross validation (R2 = 0.95). There were no differences in model performance across states of consciousness or bipolar versus average montages (ΔAIC < 2). Models using raw data excluding frontal channels outperformed other models (ΔAIC > 4) and predicted performance in expressive (P = 0.0209) and receptive communication (P < 10-3 ) and fine motor skills (P < 10-4 ). INTERPRETATION Delta power is a simple, direct measure of neuronal activity that reliably correlates with cognitive function in AS.

According to literature only sixty-seven out of seven hundred thirty-five asthmatic patients were submitted to genetic analysis to identify AATD and non-AATD subjects. Fifty-eight patients were studied. Clinical and functional data, including lung function, atopy and bronchial hyperactivity, were recorded.Results: The fifty-eight asthmatic patients were divided in AATD patients (n = 22) and non AATD patients (n = 36), according to genotype.

A second aim was to identify risk factors of ioCS. We retrospectively analyzed patients operated for small-bowel neuroendocrine tumour in our institution between 2007 and 2015, and receiving our preventive local regimen of octreotide continuous administration. ioCS was defined as highly-probable in case of rapid (<5min) arterial blood pressure changes ≥ 40%, not explained by surgical/anaesthetic management and regressive ≥ 20% after octreotide bolus injection. Probable cases were ioCS which did not meet all criteria of highly-probable ioCS. Suspected ioCS were detected on the anaesthesia record by an injection of octreotide due to a manifestation which did not meet the criteria for highly-probable or probable ioCS. A total of 81 patients (liver metastases: 59, prior carcinoid syndrome: 49, carcinoid heart disease: 7) were included; 139 ioCS occurred in 45 patients: 45 highly-probable, 67 probable, and 27 suspected. ioCs was hypertensive (91%) and/or hypotensive (29%). There was no factor, including the use of vasopressors, significantly associated with the occurrence of an ioCS. All surgeries were completed and one patient died from cardiac failure four days after surgery. After preoperative octreotide continuous infusion, ioCS were mainly hypertensive. No ioCS risk factors, including vasopressor use, were identified.

Substantial cost variation has been reported within cardiac surgery in the United States and among non-cardiac surgical procedures globally, but little is known on the global procedural cost variation for common adult cardiac surgical procedures. Objectives and significance This review seeks to assess variation in procedural costs of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve repair, mitral valve replacement, aortic valve repair, aortic valve replacement, and combined CABG-mitral or CABG-aortic valve procedures between and within countries. Results may give insights in the scope and drivers of cost variation around the world, posing cost reduction lessons. Results may further inform the potential of economies of scale in reducing procedural costs, benefiting patients, hospitals, governments, and insurers. Methods and analysis A systematic review will be performed using the EconLit, Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and WHO Global Index Medicus databases to identify articles published between January 1, 2000 and June 1, 2020. Studies describing procedural costs for CABG, mitral valve repair, mitral valve replacement, aortic valve repair, aortic valve replacement, and combined CABG-mitral or CABG-aortic valve procedures will be identified. Articles describing other types of cardiac surgery, concomitant aortic surgery, only describing costs related to non-surgical care, or with incomplete cost data will be excluded from the analysis. No exclusion will be based solely on article type or language. Identified costs will be converted to 2019 USD to account for local currency unit inflation and exchange fluctuations. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol has been prospectively registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols. This review requires no institutional review board approval. Results of this study will be summarized and disseminated in a peer-review journal.","Vervoort, Dominique; Guetter, Camila R; Trager, Lena; Shah, Priyansh; Diaz-Castrillon, Carlos Eduardo; Etchill, Eric W; Salenger, Rawn",International journal of surgery protocols,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isjp.2020.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803024/,163
118429,High-resolution mapping of intracellular fluctuations using carbon nanotubes.,2014,"Cecal infarction is an uncommon lesion in calves that results in localized peritonitis and, on occasion, perforation with secondary diffuse peritonitis and death. This lesion in calves has not been described previously. We reviewed the postmortem cases of cecal infarction in dairy calves ≤30 d of age that had been submitted over the course of 5 y to the Tulare branch of the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System. The area of cecal infarction and the associated lesion margins were examined histologically. Ischemic necrosis of the mucosal side of the cecal wall with various degrees of neutrophilic inflammation of subjacent tissues was found consistently, and thrombosis and vascular occlusion within the areas of necrosis and inflammation was found in 21 of 34 cases. Cecal infarction cases were then compared to controls using a retrospective matched case-control study design. Cases ( n = 34) and controls ( n = 86) were compared with respect to bacteremia (as defined by pure culture of a single bacterial agent from lung and/or liver), species of bacteria isolated, and for the presence of K99 Escherichia coli (calves ≤5 d), attaching and effacing E. coli, Cryptosporidium (calves ≥5 d of age), Salmonella isolation from the intestine, rotavirus, Bovine coronavirus, and Bovine viral diarrhea virus. In addition, the presence of rumenitis or abomasitis, and omphalitis were compared between cases and controls. There were no significant differences in ruminal, abomasal, or umbilical cord tissue inflammation, or pathogen test-positive status between cases and controls.","Adaska, John M; Moeller, Robert B; Blanchard, Patricia C; Aly, Sharif S","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638716688046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28114867/,163
118447,Ethics in surgery.,2013,"BACKGROUND The skills and qualities of effective clinical educators are linked to improved student learning and ultimately patient care; however, within allied health these have not yet been systematically summarised in the literature. AIMS To identify and synthesise the skills and qualities of clinical educators in allied health and their effect on student learning and patient care. METHOD A systematic search of the literature was conducted across five electronic databases in November 2017. Study identification, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed in duplicate. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted separately but analysed together using a thematic analysis approach whereby items used in quantitative surveys and themes from qualitative approaches were interpreted together. RESULTS Data revealed seven educator skills and qualities: (i) intrinsic and personal attributes of clinical educators; (ii) provision of skillful feedback; (iii) teaching skills; (iv) fostering collaborative learning; (v) understanding expectations; (vi) organisation and planning; and (vii) clinical educators in their professional role. Across all themes was the concept of taking time to perform the clinical educator role. No studies used objective measurements as to how these skills and qualities affect learning or patient care. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Despite much primary evidence of clinical educator skills and qualities, this review presents the first synthesis of this evidence in allied health. There is a need to examine clinical education from new perspectives to develop deeper understanding of how clinical educator qualities and skills influence student learning and patient care.","Gibson, Simone Jane; Porter, Judi; Anderson, Amanda; Bryce, Andrea; Dart, Janeane; Kellow, Nicole; Meiklejohn, Sarah; Volders, Evelyn; Young, Anne; Palermo, Claire",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.13782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30549083/,163

METHODS The sample included 204 patients with chronic pain attending nine primary care centres. The CAF-P was developed and validated using standard methodology, which included developing items, cognitive debriefing and psychometric validation. RESULTS CAF-P has excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach's α of 0.91 and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87. We propose a structure of two factors that explain 55.80 % of the variance. The convergent validity showed a moderate positive correlation with the probability of recommending treatment and with the level of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The CAF-P appears to be a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the therapeutic alliance perceived by patients in physiotherapy.

The objectives of our study were to examine the frequency of EVP use; to identify demographic characteristics, risk-taking behaviors, and beliefs about vaping; and to determine symptoms associated with EVPs among adolescents. A questionnaire addressing these objectives was administered to a convenience sample of subjects aged 12 to 23 years. Among 494 completed questionnaires, 80% of responders were considered experimenters/nonusers (never tried or tried one time) and 20% were considered frequent users (at least once a month). We identified demographic features and risk-taking behaviors associated with EVP use. In the previous 6 months, frequent users were more likely to report headache, cough, sleep disturbances, dehydration, weakness, racing heart, chest pain, and tremors. Our findings provide evidence to support efforts to decrease EVP use through screening, education, and preventative strategies.","Benyo, Sarah E; Bruinsma, Tyler J; Drda, Elizabeth; Brady-Olympia, Jodi; Hicks, Steven D; Boehmer, Sue; Olympia, Robert P",Clinical pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1177/00099228211009681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896217/,163
120667,Anti-Melanoma Activity of Indomethacin Incorporated into Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.,2020-08-23,"Currently, no antiviral drug or vaccine is available to treat COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. This underscores an urgent need for developing a drug against SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered an essential protein for maintaining the viral life cycle and, therefore, a potential target for drug development. In a recent study, 1000 potential ligands were identified for 3CLpro by screening 1.3 billion compounds from the ZINC15 library. In the current study, we have further screened these 1000 compounds using structure-based virtual screening utilizing the Schrödinger suite and identified nine compounds having a docking score of ∼ -11.0 kcal/mol or less. The top 5 hits display good pharmacological profiles revealing better absorption, proper permeability across the membrane, uniform distribution, and non-toxic. The molecular docking study is further complemented by molecular dynamics simulations of the top 5 docked complexes. The binding free energy analyses via the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) scheme reveals that ZINC000452260308 is the most potent (ΔGbind = -14.31 kcal/mol) inhibitor. The intermolecular van der Waals interactions mainly drive the 3CLpro-ligand association.

Amid current circumstances, the UDS, which had evolved to signal a ""successful"" recovery, no longer seems feasible, safe, or necessary. Even prior to the pandemic, the UDS had notable drawbacks, including sending a message of mistrust and hierarchy, potentially causing psychological trauma, and incentivizing falsification. Nonetheless, certain patients may state that they depend on the UDS for motivation or structure while some providers may rely on it to discover which patients are struggling. While a combination of self-report and UDS is generally regarded as the strongest measure of substance use among patients, our experiences caring for patients without the results of the UDS during the COVID-19 pandemic have forced us to examine the use of other measures to define a successful recovery. Complete abstinence may not be the goal for all patients and those who achieve abstinence may have additional goals worth supporting. While the UDS will likely be incorporated back into our treatment plans, we suggest unseating it as the centerpiece of substance use care and discovering additional methods of measuring our patients' outcomes in less traumatizing and more patient-centered ways.","Khatri, Utsha G; Aronowitz, Shoshana V",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358617/,163

Materials and Methods Chitosan NPs were prepared and characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and zeta potential measurement. MSCs CM were prepared and entrapped into MSCs CM-CS NPs composite and its release efficiency was measured. Antibacterial efficacy of nano structures was determined by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Antibiofilm activity was assessed by crystal violet assay. Results BM-MSCs were characterized to be negative for CD34 and CD45 markers, positive for CD73 and CD44 markers, and able to differentiate into osteoblast and adipocyte cells. The mean particle size of 96.6% of chitosan NPs was 414.9 nm with a suitable zeta potential and SEM morphology. Entrapment efficiency of MSCs CM-CS NPs was 76.9%. Unstimulated MSCs CM-CS NPs composite as a novel and proficient therapeutic nanostructure against MDR V. cholerae strains showed the synergistic activity of the two components of MSCs CM and CS NPs, leading to greater bacterial killing compared to control groups. MSCs CM more efficiently inhibited biofilm formation, although MSCs CM-CS NPs was also appeared to be effective in inhibiting biofilm formation compared to CS NPs and control group. Conclusion The designed nanodrug composite showed the best release in conditions mimicking the physiological conditions of the intestinal lumen. Given the fact that no overuse or genetic event would cause the emergence of antimicrobial resistance against the MSCs CM-CS NPs nanodrug, it could be considered as a promising alternative for the treatment of MDR V. cholerae infections in clinical settings.","Saberpour, Masoumeh; Bakhshi, Bita; Najar-Peerayeh, Shahin",Infection and drug resistance,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s244990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765001/,163

METHODS A prospective cohort study of 315 consecutive patients who underwent LRYGB was performed between October 2009 and October 2012 using an identical procedure technique. For the first 76 patients, a multifilament absorbable suture was used to assess the gastrojejunal anastomosis and the antecolic jejunal suture. For the following 239 patients, a unidirectional barbed monofilament suture was used. Data including operative time, time required for gastric pouch creation, time spent in both anastomoses constructions, conversion rate, and complications were prospectively recorded. RESULTS The postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Early complications were observed for 1 patient (1.3%) in the multifilament group and for 14 patients (5.8%) in the barbed procedure group (p > 0.05). Late complications were observed for 1 patient (1.3%) in the multifilament group and for 5 patients (2%) in the barbed procedure group (p > 0.05). A shortened operative time was achieved in the barbed suture group. The mean operative time was 74.3 ± 15.3 min in the Vicryl group versus 62.7 ± 15.5 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). The mean operative time required to fashion the gastrojejunal anastomosis was 21.3 ± 6.3 min in the Vicryl group versus 17.4 ± 5.1 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). The mean operative time required to fashion the jejunojejunal anastomosis was 21.4 ± 4.9 min in the Vicryl group versus 15.2 ± 5.5 min in the V-Loc group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The authors' experience has demonstrated that the use of interlocked V-Loc suture during LRYGB anastomosis appears to be safe and efficient. The findings show a shortened total operative time in terms of single gastrojejunal or jejunojejunal anastomosis time. No statistically significant differences in early or late postoperative complications were observed between the V-Loc and multifilament absorbable suture patients.","Costantino, Federico; Dente, Mario; Perrin, Philippe; Sarhan, Fadi Abou; Keller, Philippe",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-2993-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23722892/,163
121885,Overview on Microbial Enzymatic Production of Algal Oligosaccharides for Nutraceutical Applications.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND Research suggests there is a lack of post-diagnostic support to enable people living with dementia to fulfil social and active lives throughout their dementia journey. Gardening has been found to have many benefits for people living with dementia. Although such research is important, most research frames people with dementia as passive recipients of stimulation. Research into the impact of a community-based gardening group, where people living with dementia are active in the development of an outdoor space, is underdeveloped. Knowledge about the impact of participating in such groups is also sparse. The Good Life Club (GLC) was co-developed and evaluated to respond to these gaps. OBJECTIVES The primary aim of this article is to present the findings regarding the impact of attending the GLC on the self-reported well-being for people living with dementia and care partners. METHODS Qualitative data were collected via 22 semi-structured interviews. Fourteen interviews were conducted before the GLC and eight after the GLC. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Dementia Care Mapping data were collected to supplement the interview data. FINDINGS Four key themes were identified. The first was that participants considered having active participation in social life to be a key aspect of living a good life. The second was that the way that the GLC was set up and delivered gave the participants ownership of the GLC and within this they felt able to contribute. The third was the importance of social connectedness and peer support to the well-being of both people living with dementia and care partners. Fourth, positive mood and well-being was directly experienced through gardening. CONCLUSIONS The combination of long-term investment of time and energy to the GLC, ongoing friendships and in-session autonomy act as key ingredients in creating a group that is relaxed, full of humour and highly valued.","Morris, Lydia; Innes, Anthea; Smith, Sarah; Wilson, Jack; Bushell, Sophie; Wyatt, Megan",Dementia,https://doi.org/10.1177/1471301221998897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745346/,163

Both direct effects of COVID-19 and the response to the crisis are unearthing a number of societal inequalities, not least, those relating to gender. The fact that women play a disproportionate role in frontline health and social care roles and perform the majority of caregiving responsibilities is more exposed than ever before. Concurrently, the underrepresentation of women in senior clinical and leadership roles is being brought into stark relief. Redressing gender imbalance across health and social care is vital if we are to translate experience and learnings from our frontline workforce into our national preparedness and response effort. It is also important as we continue to promote wider gender and health equity goals within society. While we focus on responding to the current situation, an opportunity arises for greater value to be assigned to frontline health and caregiver roles. We must raise the profile of women leaders who are taking a stand during this crisis and use this opportunity to ensure that our future health and social care leadership reflects the wider workforce and the population.","Penfold, Rose; Magee, Lucia",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094230/,163
122295,Make equity essential to expedite change in academia.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE This systematic review aimed to estimate the willingness of students to volunteer during a disaster, and how well-prepared medical students are for volunteering by assessing their knowledge and medical school curriculum of disaster and pandemic medicine. RESULTS A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria including 11 168 medical students and 91 medical schools. 24 studies evaluated knowledge (64.9%), 16 evaluated volunteering (43.2%) and 5 evaluated medical school curricula (13.5%). Weighted mean willingness to volunteer during a disaster was 68.4% (SD=21.7%, range=26.7%-87.8%, n=2911), and there was a significant difference between those planning to volunteer and those who actually volunteered (p<0.0001). We identified a number of modifiable barriers which may contribute to this heterogeneity. Overall, knowledge of disasters was poor with a weighted mean of 48.9% (SD=15.1%, range=37.1%-87.0%, n=2985). 36.8% of 76 medical schools curricula included teaching on disasters. However, students only received minimal teaching (2-6 hours). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that there is a large number of students who are willing to volunteer during pandemics. However, they are unlikely to be prepared for these roles as overall knowledge is poor, and this is likely due to minimal teaching on disasters at medical school. During the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future disasters, medical students may be required to volunteer as auxiliary staff. There is a need to develop infrastructure to facilitate this process as well as providing education and training to ensure students are adequately prepared to perform these roles safely.","Byrne, Matthew Henry Vincent; Ashcroft, James; Alexander, Laith; Wan, Jonathan C M; Harvey, Anna",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-211052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620625/,163

However, the restricted maneuverability and severe blurring of these staplers along with their limited hemostability induced strain. In this study, we determined the feasibility and safety of performing delta-shaped anastomosis using the Endo GIA™ Reloads with Tri-Staple™ Technology combined with Endo GIA™ Ultra Universal stapler (Tri-Staple) with a particular focus on short-term surgical outcomes. METHODS We performed a single-institutional prospective interventional study (UMIN 000008014). The Tri-Staple was prospectively used on 23 consecutive patients who underwent a curative totally laparoscopic Billroth I gastrectomy with delta-shaped anastomosis. These patients were matched with the 19 patients previously treated using the ENDOPATH(®) ETS Articulating Linear Cutters (ETS) on clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS There were no differences between the groups in anastomosis-related local complications, morbidity, non-anastomosis-related local complications, total systemic complications, and short-term outcomes with the exception of significantly reduced blood loss in the Tri-Staple group (ETS vs. Tri-Staple: 37 [10-306] vs. 15 [5-210] mL, p = 0.02). Intraoperative bleeding from the staple line was significantly reduced in the Tri-Staple group. The postoperative drain indwelling period (ETS vs. Tri-Staple, 6 [4-10] vs. 4 [2-43] days, p = 0.032), fasting period (5 [3-7] vs. 3 [3-24] days, p = 0.022), and hospital stay (14 [10-47] vs. 11 [6-58] days, p = 0.025) were significantly shorter in the Tri-Staple group. There was no mortality in this series. Acceleration assessed as indices of blurring of stapler tip might have a significant adverse influence on staple-line bleeding at stapling sites. CONCLUSION Totally laparoscopic Billroth I distal gastrectomy using Tri-Staple was feasible and safe with favorable short-term surgical outcomes. Reduced blurring while stapling may be a novel endpoint which newly developed stapling devices should target.","Man-I, Mariko; Suda, Koichi; Kikuchi, Kenji; Tanaka, Tsuyoshi; Furuta, Shimpei; Nakauchi, Masaya; Ishikawa, Ken; Ishida, Yoshinori; Uyama, Ichiro",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4085-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25732753/,163

We assessed the feasibility of TAMIS for lesions located in the mid rectum. METHODS From July 2010 to October 2011, 16 consecutive patients with rectal pathology underwent TAMIS. After a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port was introduced into the anal canal, pneumorectum was established with a laparoscopic device, followed by transanal excision with conventional laparoscopic instruments, including graspers, monopolar electrocautery, and needle drivers. Clinicopathological findings, surgical procedure results, and perioperative outcomes were determined prospectively. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 11 had rectal cancers (3 T1 lesions and 8 after preoperative chemoradiotherapy), 4 had neuroendocrine tumors, and 1 had a mucocele. The median length of the lesions from anal verge was 7.5 cm (range 4-10 cm). All procedures were completed laparoscopically without conversion to conventional transanal approach. The median operating time was 86 min (range 33-160 min), and the median estimated blood loss was 15 ml (range 0-150 ml) with no patient requiring intraoperative transfusions. There was no surgical morbidity or mortality, but one patient died during follow-up due to synchronous advanced gastric cancer. The median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days (range 2-6 days).

In dcuACB mutant membrane potential (ΔΨ) was ~ 30 mV higher than in wild type. dcuD gene expression was increased in the dcuACB mutant respect to wild type at pH 7.5 (~120%), suggesting that an increment of DcuD activity compensates the lack of DcuA, DcuC and DcuB carriers. It can be concluded that active DcuD is important for H± efflux via the FOF1-ATPase and K± uptake at pH 7.5. In addition, DcuA, DcuB and DcuC transporters are crucial for regulating DCCD-sensitive K± transport and ΔΨ in E. coli.","Karapetyan, L; Mikoyan, G; Vassilian, A; Valle, A; Bolivar, J; Trchounian, A; Trchounian, K",Bioelectrochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioelechem.2021.107867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118553/,163

Niclosamide is an anthelmintic drug approved by FDA. Niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) is a salt form of niclosamide and has been demonstrated to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the vasoactivity of NEN and the potential mechanisms. Isometric tension of rat mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta was recorded by using multi-wire myograph system. The protein levels were measured by using western blot techniques. Niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) treatment relaxed phenylephrine (PE)- and high K+ (KPSS)-induced constriction, and pre-treatment with NEN inhibited PE- and KPSS-induced constriction of rat mesenteric arteries. In rat thoracic aorta, NEN also showed antagonism against PE- and KPSS-induced constriction. NEN induced increase of cellular ADP/ATP ratio in vascular smooth muscle cells (A10) and activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in A10 cells and rat thoracic aorta. NEN-induced aorta relaxation was attenuated in AMPKα1 knockout (-/-) mice. SERCA inhibitors cyclopiazonic acid and thapsigargin, but not KATP channel blockers glibenclamide and 5-hydroxydecanoic acid, attenuated NEN-induced vasorelaxation in rat mesenteric arteries. NEN treatment increased cytosolic [Ca2+]i and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential in vascular smooth muscle cells (A10). Niclosamide in non-salt form showed the similar vasoactivity as NEN in rat mesenteric arteries. Niclosamide ethanolamine inhibits artery constriction, indicating that it would be promising to be developed as an anti-hypertensive drug or it would induce vasodilation-related side effects when absorbed in vivo.","Li, Shan-Liang; Yan, Jie; Zhang, Yan-Qiu; Zhen, Chang-Lin; Liu, Ming-Yu; Jin, Jing; Gao, Jin-Lai; Xiao, Xiao-Lin; Shen, Xin; Tai, Yu; Hu, Nan; Zhang, Xin-Zi; Sun, Zhi-Jie; Dong, De-Li",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2016.11.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27872020/,163

Extended care has been shown to improve outcomes. Examining use patterns for longer term programmes can quantify resource requirements and identify opportunities for improving retention. METHODS We analyse 38 094 primary care treatment episodes from a multisite smoking cessation programme in Ontario, Canada that provides free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and counselling. We calculate distributional measures of weeks of NRT used, clinical visits attended and total length of care. We then divide treatment courses into four exclusive categories and fit a multinomial logistic regression model to measure associations with participant characteristics, using multiple imputation to address missing data. RESULTS Time in treatment (median=50 days), visits (median=3) and weeks NRT used (median=8) were well below the maximum available. Of all programme enrolments, 28.8% (95% CI=28.3% to 29.3%) were single contacts, 31.3% (30.8% to 31.8%) lasted <12 weeks, 19.2% (18.8% to 19.6%) were ≥12 weeks with an 8-week interruption and 20.7% (20.3%-21.1%) were ≥12 weeks without interruptions. Care use was most strongly associated with participant age and whether the nicotine patch was dispensed at the first visit. CONCLUSION Treatment use results imply that the marginal costs of extending treatment programmes are relatively low. The prevalence of single contacts supports additional engagement efforts at the initial visit, while interruptions in care highlight the ability of longer term care to address relapse. Results show that use of the nicotine patch is associated with retention in care, and that improving engagement of younger patients should be a priority.","Veldhuizen, Scott; Zawertailo, Laurie; Noormohamed, Aliya; Hussain, Sarwar; Selby, Peter",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419946/,163

METHODS In a prospective study, 110 consecutive patients (88 men; mean age 72 years, range 37-90) referred for critical limb ischemia (26, 24%) or claudication were eligible for lower limb angioplasty via TRA (patients with TASC D lesions of the superficial femoral artery and below-the-knee lesions were excluded). RESULTS The majority of patients (84, 76%) were treated via a left TRA. A total of 170 lesions were addressed, of which 38 (22%) were occlusions; 113 stents were positioned in 82 patients. The overall technical success rate was 91%, with a 63% success rate in occlusions and a 98% success rate in stenoses; by location, the success rates were 91% in suprainguinal lesions and 90% in infrainguinal lesions. No hemorrhagic or local complications requiring surgery were observed. At 1-month follow-up, 101 patients had a downward shift of at least one category in the Rutherford classification of symptoms (clinical success rate 92%); 18 (16%) patients had occlusion of their access radial artery, but none had symptoms or discomfort. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that TRA is a safe and effective approach for lower extremity arterial revascularization, at least for interventionists with longstanding experience in TRA and in selected anatomical subsets.","Lorenzoni, Roberto; Lisi, Cristiano; Corciu, Anca; Lazzari, Mauro; Bovenzi, Francesco",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/14-4747r.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25290790/,163

Treatment aims to prevent additional brain damage and to optimise conditions for brain recovery. TBI is typically considered and treated as one pathological entity, although in fact it is a syndrome comprising a range of lesions that can require different therapies and physiological goals. Owing to advances in monitoring and imaging, there is now the potential to identify specific mechanisms of brain damage and to better target treatment to individuals or subsets of patients. Targeted treatment is especially relevant for elderly people-who now represent an increasing proportion of patients with TBI-as preinjury comorbidities and their therapies demand tailored management strategies. Progress in monitoring and in understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of TBI could change current management in the intensive care unit, enabling targeted interventions that could ultimately improve outcomes.","Stocchetti, Nino; Carbonara, Marco; Citerio, Giuseppe; Ercole, Ari; Skrifvars, Markus B; Smielewski, Peter; Zoerle, Tommaso; Menon, David K",The Lancet.

However, little if any attention is given to substantiating the potential benefits of such treatment or addressing the methodological weaknesses that, in part, limit the pharmacological recommendations made by expert treatment guidelines. Therefore, the authors conducted a systematic review to provide the most up-to-date and inclusive review of published prospective trials of potential pharmacological interventions for the prevention and treatment of delirium, and they discuss potential benefits of pharmacological prevention of delirium and/or reduction of ongoing delirium episode duration and severity. METHOD The analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, including prospective randomized and nonrandomized double-blind, single-blind, and open-label clinical trials of any pharmacological agent for the prevention or treatment of delirium and reviewing them systematically for effectiveness on several predefined outcomes. RESULTS The pharmacological strategies reviewed showed greater success in preventing delirium than in treating it. Significant delirium prevention effects are associated with haloperidol, second-generation antipsychotics, iliac fascia block, gabapentin, melatonin, lower levels of intraoperative propofol sedation, and a single dose of ketamine during anesthetic induction and with dexmedetomidine compared with other sedation strategies for mechanically ventilated patients.

METHODS This study used a large medical claims clearinghouse database representing 5%-7% of the Medicare fee-for-service population to characterize changes in the utilization of cancer care services and gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the US cancer population, including identification of new patients, gaps in access to care, and disruption of treatment journeys. RESULTS In March-July 2020, in comparison with the baseline period of March-July 2019, there is a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, visits, therapy, and surgeries, with variation by cancer type and site of service. At the peak of the pandemic in April, screenings for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers were lower by 85%, 75%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. Significant utilization reductions were observed in April for hospital outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (-74%), new patient E&M visits (-70%), and established patient E&M visits (-60%). A decrease in billing frequency was observed for the top physician-administered oncology products, dropping in both April (-26%) and July (-31%). Mastectomies were reduced consistently in April through July, with colectomies similarly reduced in April and May and prostatectomies dipping in April and July. CONCLUSION The current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in the United States has resulted in decreases and delays in identifying new cancers and delivery of treatment. These problems, if unmitigated, will increase cancer morbidity and mortality for years to come.","Patt, Debra; Gordan, Lucio; Diaz, Michael; Okon, Ted; Grady, Lance; Harmison, Merrill; Markward, Nathan; Sullivan, Milena; Peng, Jing; Zhou, Anan",JCO clinical cancer informatics,https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.20.00134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253013/,163

We reviewed the impact of revascularization on clinical outcomes in 83 patients with M2 occlusions in the Interventional Management of Stroke III trial according to specific M1-M2 segment anatomic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS Perfusion of any M2 branch distinguished M2-versus-M1 occlusion. Prespecified modified TICI and arterial occlusive lesion revascularization and clinical mRS 0-2 end points at 90 days for endovascular therapy-treated M2 occlusions were analyzed. Post hoc analyses of the relationship of outcomes to multiple baseline angiographic M2 and M1 subgroup characteristics were performed. RESULTS Of 83 participants with M2 occlusion who underwent endovascular therapy, 41.0% achieved mRS 0-2 at 90 days, including 46.6% with modified TICI 2-3 reperfusion compared with 26.1% with modified TICI 0-1 reperfusion (risk difference, 20.6%; 95% CI, -1.4%-42.5%). mRS 0-2 outcome was associated with reperfusion for M2 trunk (n = 9) or M2 division (n = 42) occlusions, but not for M2 branch occlusions (n = 28). Of participants with trunk and division occlusions, 63.2% with modified TICI 2a and 42.9% with modified TICI 2b reperfusion achieved mRS 0-2 outcomes; mRS 0-2 outcomes for M2 trunk occlusions (33%) did not differ from distal (38.2%) and proximal (26.9%) M1 occlusions. CONCLUSIONS mRS 0-2 at 90 days was dependent on reperfusion for M2 trunk but not for M2 branch occlusions. For M2 division occlusions, good outcome with modified TICI 2b reperfusion did not differ from that in modified TICI 2a. M2 segment definition and occlusion location may contribute to differences in revascularization and good outcome between Interventional Management of Stroke III and other endovascular therapy studies.","Tomsick, T A; Carrozzella, J; Foster, L; Hill, M D; von Kummer, R; Goyal, M; Demchuk, A M; Khatri, P; Palesch, Y; Broderick, J P; Yeatts, S D; Liebeskind, D S",AJNR.

While surgical disconnection is considered as the favored management option, endovascular treatment has lately gained importance. We present a single institution experience of seven cases. METHOD A retrospective analysis was performed on the institutional patient database. Features analyzed were demographic details, symptoms, angioarchitecture, treatment course, angiographic results, procedural complications, and follow-up. RESULTS This study included seven patients. The age at presentation ranged from 5-67 years. Clinical symptomatology was as intracranial hemorrhage in 4 patients and headache, chemosis and seizures in one patient each. The fistulae were paramedian at the ACF base. All DAVFs were Cognard type 4. The arterial feeders were from the anterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery in all cases (bilateral in n = 5), frontal branches of the middle meningeal artery (MMA) (n = 6), and multiple ECA branches. The arterial route was the choice for access. Complete fistula obliteration was achieved in all but one patient. A traversed vein underwent rupture in one patient. One patient suffered postsurgical hemorrhage. No clinical or angiographic recurrence was noted. CONCLUSION The DAVFs of the ACF are inherently high-grade lesions. Transorbital ECA-ICA branch anastomoses may be recruited as feeders. They may be best managed by multidisciplinary means personalized on an angioarchitectural basis. Endovascular embolization is safe and efficacious when performed through a navigable feeder from the frontal division of the MMA, which according to our interpretation is in anastomosis with the anterior falcine branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery.","Kulanthaivelu, Karthik; Pendharkar, Hima; Prasad, Chandrajit; Kumar Gupta, Arun; Hanumanthapura Ramalingaiah, Arvinda; Saini, Jitender; Srinivas, Dwarakanath",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00932-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666243/,163

Consistently, neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitors alleviated the neuropathic pain. Previous studies demonstrated that aripiprazole is capable of modulating NO synthesis and also has been reported its modulatory effect on NF-kB activity. METHODS Aripiprazole was administered daily to the male Wistar rats at the same time with establishing neuropathic model by I.P. injection of vincristine every 2 days, over 2 weeks. Efficacy of aripiprazole in suppressing the development of neuropathy was evaluated by assessing changes in body weight, mechanical threshold, withdrawal latency, sciatic nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), and compound motor action potential (CMAP) characteristics. Expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation were evaluated by western blotting RESULTS: Rats receiving aripiprazole during neuropathy establishment period demonstrated a normal weight gain pattern, a significantly higher mechanical withdrawal threshold, and SNCV compared to vincristine-treated group. Furthermore, the amplitude and area of CMAP were significantly higher in aripiprazole group. Western blotting demonstrated a significantly reduced expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation in dorsal root ganglia of aripiprazole co-treated rats. CONCLUSION In conclusion, aripiprazole effectively prevents from vincristine-induced neuropathy by limiting nNOS overexpression and NF-kB hyperactivation.","Khalilzadeh, Mina; Hassanzadeh, Fereshteh; Aghamiri, Helia; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Shafaroodi, Hamed",Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00280-020-04127-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803467/,163

We hypothesize that this is a physiological process in immune regulation, and that it occurs within lymph nodes (LNs), which are likely acidic because of low convective flow and high glucose metabolism. Here we show by in vivo fluorescence and MR imaging, that LN paracortical zones are profoundly acidic. These acidic niches are absent in athymic Nu/Nu and lymphodepleted mice, implicating T-cells in the acidifying process. T-cell glycolysis is inhibited at the low pH observed in LNs. We show that this is due to acid inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), resulting in a negative feedback on glycolytic rate. Importantly, we demonstrate that this acid pH does not hinder initial activation of naïve T-cells by dendritic cells. Thus, we describe an acidic niche within the immune system, and demonstrate its physiological role in regulating T-cell activation.","Wu, Hao; Estrella, Veronica; Beatty, Matthew; Abrahams, Dominique; El-Kenawi, Asmaa; Russell, Shonagh; Ibrahim-Hashim, Arig; Longo, Dario Livio; Reshetnyak, Yana K; Moshnikova, Anna; Andreev, Oleg A; Luddy, Kimberly; Damaghi, Mehdi; Kodumudi, Krithika; Pillai, Smitha R; Enriquez-Navas, Pedro; Pilon-Thomas, Shari; Swietach, Pawel; Gillies, Robert J",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17756-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807791/,163
126900,IPCC2020-Advancing melanocyte science and friendship in the Land of the Rising Sun.,2021-03-01,"Use of the electronic health record (EHR) has become a routine part of perioperative care in the United States. Secondary use of EHR data includes research, quality, and educational initiatives. Fundamental to secondary use is a framework to ensure fidelity, transparency, and completeness of the source data. In developing this framework, competing priorities must be considered as to which data sources are used and how data are organized and incorporated into a useable format. In assembling perioperative data from diverse institutions across the United States and Europe, the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG) has developed methods to support such a framework. This special article outlines how MPOG has approached considerations of data structure, validation, and accessibility to support multicenter integration of perioperative EHRs. In this multicenter practice registry, MPOG has developed processes to extract data from the perioperative EHR; transform data into a standardized format; and validate, deidentify, and transfer data to a secure central Coordinating Center database. Participating institutions may obtain access to this central database, governed by quality and research committees, to inform clinical practice and contribute to the scientific and clinical communities. Through a rigorous and standardized approach to ensure data integrity, MPOG enables data to be usable for quality improvement and advancing scientific knowledge. As of March 2019, our collaboration of 46 hospitals has accrued 10.7 million anesthesia records with associated perioperative EHR data across heterogeneous vendors. Facilitated by MPOG, each site retains access to a local repository containing all site-specific perioperative data, distinct from source EHRs and readily available for local research, quality, and educational initiatives. Through committee approval processes, investigators at participating sites may additionally access multicenter data for similar initiatives. Emerging from this work are 4 considerations that our group has prioritized to improve data quality: (1) data should be available at the local level before Coordinating Center transfer; (2) data should be rigorously validated against standardized metrics before use; (3) data should be curated into computable phenotypes that are easily accessible; and (4) data should be collected for both research and quality improvement purposes because these complementary goals bolster the strength of each endeavor.","Colquhoun, Douglas A; Shanks, Amy M; Kapeles, Steven R; Shah, Nirav; Saager, Leif; Vaughn, Michelle T; Buehler, Kathryn; Burns, Michael L; Tremper, Kevin K; Freundlich, Robert E; Aziz, Michael; Kheterpal, Sachin; Mathis, Michael R",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287121/,163

Empirical models were developed using the relations of nutrients (total phosphorus, TP, and total nitrogen, TN) with chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) for efficient lake managements. The empirical models indicated that TP was the key regulating factor for algal growth in agricultural (R2 = 0.69) and power generation (R2 = 0.50) reservoirs. The CHL-a:TP and TN:TP ratios, indicators of phosphorus limitation, were used to validate the phosphorus reduction approach. The mean CHL-a:TP ratio of agricultural reservoirs was 0.60, indicating that algal chlorophyll is potentially limited by TP than any other factors. Agricultural, multipurpose, and power generation reservoirs, based on the N:P ratios, were more P- limited systems than natural lakes and estuarine reservoirs. The trophic state index (TSI) of Korean reservoirs varied between mesotrophy to hypereutrophy based on values of TSI (TP), TSI (CHL-a), and TSI (SD). Agricultural reservoirs were hypereutrophic using the criteria of TSI (CHL-a) and blue-green algae dominated the algal community. Analysis of trophic state index deviation (TSID) indicated that agricultural reservoirs were primarily P limited and other factors had minor effect. In contrast, the trophic status of estuarine and power generation reservoirs and natural lakes was largely modified by non-algal turbidity. Our outcomes may be effectively used for Korean lakes and reservoirs management.","Mamun, Md; Kwon, Seokcheol; Kim, Jeong-Eun; An, Kwang-Guk",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886973/,163

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) as a single procedure has shown promising short-term results, but the long-term efficacy of SG has not yet been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine the preliminary 30-day morbidity and mortality of RYGB and SG in a prospective multicenter randomized setting. METHODS A total of 240 morbidly obese (BMI = 35-66 kg/m²) patients evaluated by a multidisciplinary team were randomized to undergo either RYGB or SG. There were 117 patients in the RYGB group and 121 in the SG group; two patients had to be excluded after randomization. Both study groups were comparable regarding age, gender, BMI, and comorbidities. RESULTS There was no 30-day mortality. The median operating time was significantly shorter in the SG group (66 min vs. 94 min, p < 0.001). All complications were recorded thoroughly. There were 7 (5.8 %) major complications following SG and 11 (9.4 %) after RYGB (p = 0.292). Nine (7.4 %) SG patients and 20 (17.1 %) RYGB patients had minor complications (p = 0.023). The overall morbidity was 13.2 % after SG and 26.5 % after RYGB (p = 0.010). There were three (2.5 %) early reoperations after SG and four (3.3 %) after RYGB (p = 0.719). CONCLUSIONS At 30-day analysis SG is associated with a shorter operating time and fewer early minor complications compared to RYGB. There were no significant differences in major complications or early reoperations. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the effect on weight loss, resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, and improvement of quality of life.","Helmiö, Mika; Victorzon, Mikael; Ovaska, Jari; Leivonen, Marja; Juuti, Anne; Jaser, Nabil; Peromaa, Pipsa; Tolonen, Pekka; Hurme, Saija; Salminen, Paulina",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2225-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22476829/,163
128224,"""Tissue Papers"" from Organ-Specific Decellularized Extracellular Matrices.",2017,"LAY ABSTRACT What is already known about the topic?There has been a lot of research into things like how autistic people's communication styles are different to those of non-autistic people, especially among children. This has tended to focus on parent reports and experiments, rather than asking autistic people about their own experiences and preferences regarding communication.What does this article add?This article is the first to ask autistic adults how they prefer to communicate in different scenarios. We asked whether they preferred to use a range of methods, such email, phone calls, letters and live messaging, in scenarios from education to customer services to friends and family. When contacting unknown people or organisations, we found that generally email was preferred, and phone calls were very unpopular. However, for friends, family and people they felt comfortable with, they preferred both face-to-face and written forms of communication (e.g. email and text message).Implications for practice, research or policyThe findings suggest that services should move away from a reliance on phone calls for communication. They should make sure that access to support is not dependent on the phone, and instead offer written options such as email and live messaging which are more accessible. Future research should investigate the impact of COVID-19 on autistic people's communication preferences, as video calling has become much more commonly used and potentially combines benefits and challenges of other modes discussed in this article.","Howard, Philippa L; Sedgewick, Felicity",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211014995; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169750/,163

128867,The influence of macro-textural designs over implant surface on bone on-growth: A computational mechanobiology based study.,2020-08-09,"UNLABELLED Dose kernel convolution (DK) methods have been proposed to speed up absorbed dose calculations in molecular radionuclide therapy. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of tissue density heterogeneities (TDH) on dosimetry when using a DK method and to propose a simple density-correction method. METHODS This study has been conducted on 3 clinical cases: case 1, non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with (131)I-tositumomab; case 2, a neuroendocrine tumor treatment simulated with (177)Lu-peptides; and case 3, hepatocellular carcinoma treated with (90)Y-microspheres. Absorbed dose calculations were performed using a direct Monte Carlo approach accounting for TDH (3D-RD), and a DK approach (VoxelDose, or VD). For each individual voxel, the VD absorbed dose, D(VD), calculated assuming uniform density, was corrected for density, giving D(VDd). The average 3D-RD absorbed dose values, D(3DRD), were compared with D(VD) and D(VDd), using the relative difference Δ(VD/3DRD). At the voxel level, density-binned Δ(VD/3DRD) and Δ(VDd/3DRD) were plotted against ρ and fitted with a linear regression. RESULTS The D(VD) calculations showed a good agreement with D(3DRD). Δ(VD/3DRD) was less than 3.5%, except for the tumor of case 1 (5.9%) and the renal cortex of case 2 (5.6%). At the voxel level, the Δ(VD/3DRD) range was 0%-14% for cases 1 and 2, and -3% to 7% for case 3. All 3 cases showed a linear relationship between voxel bin-averaged Δ(VD/3DRD) and density, ρ: case 1 (Δ = -0.56ρ + 0.62, R(2) = 0.93), case 2 (Δ = -0.91ρ + 0.96, R(2) = 0.99), and case 3 (Δ = -0.69ρ + 0.72, R(2) = 0.91). The density correction improved the agreement of the DK method with the Monte Carlo approach (Δ(VDd/3DRD) < 1.1%), but with a lesser extent for the tumor of case 1 (3.1%). At the voxel level, the Δ(VDd/3DRD) range decreased for the 3 clinical cases (case 1, -1% to 4%; case 2, -0.5% to 1.5%, and -1.5% to 2%). No more linear regression existed for cases 2 and 3, contrary to case 1 (Δ = 0.41ρ - 0.38, R(2) = 0.88) although the slope in case 1 was less pronounced. CONCLUSION This study shows a small influence of TDH in the abdominal region for 3 representative clinical cases. A simple density-correction method was proposed and improved the comparison in the absorbed dose calculations when using our voxel S value implementation.","Dieudonné, Arnaud; Hobbs, Robert F; Lebtahi, Rachida; Maurel, Fabien; Baechler, Sébastien; Wahl, Richard L; Boubaker, Ariane; Le Guludec, Dominique; Sgouros, Georges; Gardin, Isabelle","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.105825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23249540/,163

129819,This month on Twitter.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Recently, there has been speculation about the possibility of fusing intestinal tissue using bipolar sealing devices. In this study we compare in a porcine model the anastomoses created using the LigaSure(®) device with those created with a stapler after section and closure of a rectal stump. METHODS Thirty pigs underwent laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis. In group A (n = 15), the division of the intestine and distal stump closure were done with a 10-mm LigaSure Atlas(®) device. In group B, these steps were carried out using an endoscopic stapler. Subsequently, the colorectal anastomosis was performed using circular stapling in both groups. The 4-week follow-up included health status, weight gain, blood tests, X-rays, and colonoscopy. Anastomotic tissue was processed to study the mechanical tensile strength and histopathology. RESULTS There was no difference in the rate of conversion to open surgery or in average operating time between the groups. In the sealing device group, there was a significantly higher rate of failure in rectal stump closure (p = 0.042). There was one death in group B due to anastomotic leak. There was no difference in adhesion formation or stenosis. Mid-section anastomosis area was 89.7 mm(2) in group A compared with 100 mm(2) in group B (p = 0.52). In tensile strength studies, the maximum load resisted by the sample was 13.8 ± 4.9 N (group A) versus 15.7 ± 4.4 N (group B) (p = 0.17). There was no difference between the groups in degree of reepithelialization, number of inflammatory cells, or the presence of microabscesses. CONCLUSIONS Division and sealing of the rectal stump with the LigaSure(®) device is feasible in the proposed experimental model, but it is less reliable than conventional closure with a stapler, since it has a significantly greater failure rate. Therefore, The LigaSure(®) device should not be used for this purpose in the clinical setting as this could lead to serious and dramatic complications.","Sánchez-De Pedro, Francisco; Moreno-Sanz, Carlos; Morandeira-Rivas, Antonio; Tenías-Burillo, Jose María; Alhambra-Rodríguez De Guzmán, Cristina",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3194-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24052342/,163
129853,"Biosecurity: tools, behaviours and concepts.",2020-12-14,"Purpose To investigate the effects of different doses of rocuronium on ischemia-reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle induced by tourniquet in patients undergoing elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty. Patients and Methods A total of 90 patients undergoing elective unilateral knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia combined with femoral nerve block were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal saline group (group S), rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg group (group L), and rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group (group H). The primary outcome was the expression of dystrophin in skeletal muscle at 60 min after ischemia. Secondary outcomes included the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in blood at 5 min and 30 min after reperfusion. In addition, thigh girth at 24 h and 48 h after operation, the leaving bed time, the incidence of tourniquet-related hypertension and short-term (3 days after operation) complications (nausea and vomiting, swelling, blister, wound infection) and long-term (3 months after operation) complications (joint instability, stiffness, nerve paralysis, pain) were recorded. Main Results The expression of dystrophin in the rocuronium group was higher than that in group S after ischemia (P <0.05). The concentration of MDA in the rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group was lower at 30 min after reperfusion (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in nNOS among groups at each time point (P > 0.05). The change of thigh girth was the smallest in the rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg group after operation (P<0.05). The leaving bed time was significantly earlier after operation in the rocuronium group than that in group S (P <0.05). Conclusion Rocuronium can protect skeletal muscle from ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by tourniquet. The mechanism may be related to the fact that rocuronium can reduce the loss of dystrophin in skeletal muscle and have the effects of anti-oxidation and anti-stress.

Most pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract uneventfully and rarely cause complications. However, long, sharp, slender, and hard objects such as fish bones, chicken bones, and toothpicks may lead to perforation of the GI tract, which is a potentially life-threatening complication. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 50-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of right lower quadrant abdominal pain of 2 days' duration. Ultrasound imaging and computed tomography scan demonstrated the presence of a foreign body protruding from the lateral cecal wall and surrounded by an area of inflammation. The patient was taken to the operating room, where a toothpick was found to have perforated the cecum. The FB was removed and the defect of the intestinal wall was closed using a TA linear stapler (Covidien, Mansfield, MA). The patient was discharged on the 8(th) postoperative day. We also conducted a literature search for reports on injuries caused by ingested FBs. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Perforation of the GI tract by an ingested FB in the adult population is most commonly secondary to accidental ingestion. Patients rarely recall the episode of the ingestion, or may remember the incident only after a diagnosis is made. We present this case to increase awareness of the diagnosis.","Zouros, Efstratios; Oikonomou, Dimitrios; Theoharis, Georgios; Bantias, Christos; Papadimitropoulos, Konstantinos",The Journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2014.06.065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300206/,163

A number of assessment tools have been used to evaluate the needs of individuals diagnosed with a mental illness. These tools have largely been developed for people with a severe and persistent mental illness and may not be suitable for individuals who are recovering from a first episode of mental illness. The aims of this review were therefore to identify the needs experienced by individuals recovering from a first episode of mental illness; determine what tools have been used to evaluate these needs; and explore whether existing tools adequately reflect the needs described in the literature. Twenty-one articles were included, comprising articles which identified needs (n = 10), needs assessment tools (n = 1), or articles which identified both needs and a needs assessment tool (n = 10). Results indicate that individuals who have been admitted to a specialized mental health unit and are recovering from a first episode of mental illness may experience an extensive range of needs, spanning emotional, psychological, social, informational, functional, practical, and relationship needs. Four established needs assessment tools were found to have been used to evaluate these needs; however, these do not appear to represent all needs discovered in this review, were mostly developed for populations with a long-term mental illness, and may not be suitable for assessing the needs of individuals recovering from a first episode of mental illness following a presentation to a specialized mental health unit.","Davies, Ellen L; Gordon, Andrea L; Pelentsov, Lemuel J; Hooper, Kenneth J; Esterman, Adrian J",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29975442/,163

In the absence of red flags, the clinical utility of routine or repeat radiographs to assess the structure and function of the spine is controversial. OBJECTIVES To determine the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of routine or repeat radiographs (in the absence of red flags) of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine for the functional or structural evaluation of the spine. Investigate whether functional or structural findings on repeat radiographs are valid markers of clinically meaningful outcomes. The research objectives required that we determine the validity, diagnostic accuracy and reliability of radiographs for the structural and functional evaluation of the spine. EVIDENCE REVIEW We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Index to Chiropractic Literature from inception to November 25, 2019. We used rapid review methodology recommended by the World Health Organization. Eligible studies (cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, randomized controlled trials, diagnostic and reliability) were critically appraised. Studies of acceptable quality were included in our synthesis. The lead author extracted data and a second reviewer independently validated the data extraction. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. FINDINGS We identified 959 citations, screened 176 full text articles and critically appraised 23. No relevant studies assessed the clinical utility of routine or repeat radiographs (in the absence of red flags) of the cervical, thoracic or lumbar spine for the functional or structural evaluation of the spine. No studies investigated whether functional or structural findings on repeat radiographs are valid markers of clinically meaningful outcomes. Nine low risk of bias studies investigated the validity (n = 2) and reliability (n = 8) of routine or repeat radiographs. These studies provide no evidence of clinical utility. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that the use of routine or repeat radiographs to assess the function or structure of the spine, in the absence of red flags, improves clinical outcomes and benefits patients. Given the inherent risks of ionizing radiation, we recommend that chiropractors do not use radiographs for the routine and repeat evaluation of the structure and function of the spine.","Corso, Melissa; Cancelliere, Carol; Mior, Silvano; Kumar, Varsha; Smith, Ali; Côté, Pierre",Chiropractic & manual therapies,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12998-020-00323-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641135/,163

Moods are consciously accessible affective states that extend over time that are characterized by their valence and arousal. They also likely have a long evolutionary heritage and serve as an important adaptive affective mechanism. When they become maladaptive or overly biased, pathological affective states such as depression can emerge. Despite the importance of moods for human experience, little is known about their causal neurobiological mechanisms. In humans, methodological and interpretational limitations prevent causal investigations into the origins of mood, highlighting the importance of animal models. Nonhuman primates that share key neuroanatomical, affective, and social features with humans will be essential to uncovering their foundation. Identifying and validating mood-like states in animals is, however, challenging not least because mood is a human construct requiring verbal communication. Here we outline a theoretical framework for animal models of human mood, drawing upon established psychological literature where it exists before reviewing the extant studies of non-human primate models of mood-like states.","Bliss-Moreau, Eliza; Rudebeck, Peter H",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.06.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007355/,163
131811,Wedelolactone Mitigates Parkinsonism Via Alleviating Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Through NRF2/SKN-1.,2020-09-07,"INTRODUCTION Delays in cancer diagnosis arose from the commencement of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) introduced in the UK in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our earlier work predicted this will lead to approximately 3620 avoidable deaths for four major tumour types (breast, bowel, lung, and oesophageal cancer) in the next 5 years. Here, using national population-based modelling, we estimate the health and economic losses resulting from these avoidable cancer deaths. We also compare these with the impact of an equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths to understand the welfare consequences of the different health conditions. METHODS We estimate health losses using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lost economic productivity using the human capital (HC) approach. The analysis uses linked English National Health Service (NHS) cancer registration and hospital administrative datasets for patients aged 15-84 years, diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and oesophageal cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 2010, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2014, and diagnosed with lung cancer between 1st Jan to 31st Dec 31 2012, with follow-up data until 31st Dec 2015. Productivity losses are based on the estimation of excess additional deaths due to cancer at 1, 3 and 5 years for the four cancer types, which were derived from a previous analysis using this dataset. A total of 500 random samples drawn from the total number of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Office for National Statistics, stratified by gender, were used to estimate productivity losses for an equivalent number of deaths (n = 3620) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS We collected data for 32,583 patients with breast cancer, 24,975 with colorectal cancer, 6744 with oesophageal cancer, and 29,305 with lung cancer. We estimate that across the four site-specific cancers combined in England alone, additional excess cancer deaths would amount to a loss of 32,700 QALYs (95% CI 31,300-34,100) and productivity losses of £103.8million GBP (73.2-132.2) in the next five years. For breast cancer, we estimate a loss of 4100 QALYS (3900-4400) and productivity losses of £23.2 m (18.2-28.6); for colorectal cancer, 15,000 QALYS (14,100-16,000) lost and productivity losses of £35.7 m (22.4-48.7); for lung cancer 10,900 QALYS (9,900-11,700) lost and productivity losses of £38.3 m (14.0-59.9) for lung cancer; and for oesophageal cancer, 2700 QALYS (2300-3,100) lost and productivity losses of £6.6 m (-6 to -17.6). In comparison, the equivalent number of COVID-19 deaths caused approximately 21,450 QALYs lost, as well as productivity losses amounting to £76.4 m (73.5-79.2). CONCLUSION Premature cancer deaths resulting from diagnostic delays during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK will result in significant economic losses. On a per-capita basis, this impact is, in fact, greater than that of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. These results emphasise the importance of robust evaluation of the trade-offs of the wider health, welfare and economic effects of NPI to support both resource allocation and the prioritisation of time-critical health services directly impacted in a pandemic, such as cancer care.","Gheorghe, Adrian; Maringe, Camille; Spice, James; Purushotham, Arnie; Chalkidou, Kalipso; Rachet, Bernard; Sullivan, Richard; Aggarwal, Ajay",European journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049776/,163

BACKGROUND B-profile detected by lung ultrasound (LUS) is a sign of pulmonary congestion during SE. METHODS The authors prospectively performed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and LUS in 2,145 patients referred for exercise (n = 1,012), vasodilator (n = 1,054), or dobutamine (n = 79) SE in 11 certified centers. B-lines were evaluated in a 4-site simplified scan (each site scored from 0: A-lines to 10: white lung for coalescing B-lines). During stress the following were also analyzed: stress-induced new regional wall motion abnormalities in 2 contiguous segments; reduced left ventricular contractile reserve (peak/rest based on force, ≤2.0 for exercise and dobutamine, ≤1.1 for vasodilators); and abnormal coronary flow velocity reserve ≤2.0, assessed by pulsed-wave Doppler sampling in left anterior descending coronary artery and abnormal heart rate reserve (peak/rest heart rate) ≤1.80 for exercise and dobutamine (≤1.22 for vasodilators). All patients completed follow-up. RESULTS According to B-lines at peak stress patients were divided into 4 different groups: group I, absence of stress B-lines (score: 0 to 1; n = 1,389; 64.7%); group II, mild B-lines (score: 2 to 4; n = 428; 20%); group III, moderate B-lines (score: 5 to 9; n = 209; 9.7%) and group IV, severe B-lines (score: ≥10; n = 119; 5.4%). During median follow-up of 15.2 months (interquartile range: 12 to 20 months) there were 38 deaths and 28 nonfatal myocardial infarctions in 64 patients. At multivariable analysis, severe stress B-lines (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.544; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.466 to 8.687; p = 0.006), abnormal heart rate reserve (HR: 2.276; 95% CI: 1.215 to 4.262; p = 0.010), abnormal coronary flow velocity reserve (HR: 2.178; 95% CI: 1.059 to 4.479; p = 0.034), and age (HR: 1.031; 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.062; p = 0.037) were independent predictors of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS Severe stress B-lines predict death and nonfatal myocardial infarction.

It focuses on treating the person living with dementia as a person first and foremost. Supporting personhood in dementia is the key goal of person-centred care. Existing qualitative research examines what personhood means to the person living with dementia and explores what is important to their personhood and sense of self. However, to date little work has focused on synthesising these studies. Methods: This is a protocol for a qualitative evidence synthesis of personhood in dementia. The review examines qualitative peer-reviewed research of the perspectives and experiences of personhood for people living with dementia. A systematic search will be carried out on eight electronic databases and supplemented by other purposeful literature search methods. Title and abstract screening, and full text screening will be carried out by two authors independently. Included studies will be critically appraised. Thematic synthesis will be conducted on all of the included studies. Confidence in the review findings will be assessed using GRADE CERQual. Discussion: The findings from this synthesis will be useful to health care providers and policy makers seeking to understand what personhood means for people living with dementia. The findings will also inform optimal service provision, as well as outcome measures in dementia.

Respondents indicated that inadequate disinfection of noncritical, patient care devices pose an underrecognized threat to patient crosscontamination. This led the researchers to question reliance upon the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities for such items. The CDC Guideline follows the Spaulding approach, which categorizes items and their disinfection treatment based on the risk of infection from the intended use of the item. A failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis approach is recommended as an additional refinement to the CDC Guideline whereby likely sources of cross-contamination are identified irrespective of intended use. Enhancing infection control practices with this approach promotes the development of preventive plans for cleaning and disinfection that can mitigate such risk.","Wright, Edward William; Marvel, Jon H; Neubrander, Judy; DesMarteau, Kathleen",The health care manager,https://doi.org/10.1097/hcm.0000000000000015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25068874/,163

METHODS This was an observational study performed using a life-size head model to simulate tonsil surgery and fluorescein-soaked strawberries to mimic tonsils. The Coblation wand was activated over the strawberries for 5 minutes. This was repeated 5 times with 2 surgeons (totalling 10 data sets). The presence of droplet around the surgical field and anatomical subsites on the surgeon was assessed in binary fashion: present or not present. The results were collated as frequency of droplet detection and illustrated as a heatmap; 0 = white, 1-2 = yellow, 3-4 = orange, and 5 = red. RESULTS Fluorescein droplets were detected in all 4 quadrants of the surgical field. The frequency of splatter was greatest in the upper (nearest to surgeon) and lower quadrants. There were detectable splatter droplets on the surgeon; most frequently occurring on the hands followed by the forearm. Droplets were also detected on the visor, neck, and chest albeit less frequently. However, none were detected on the upper arms. CONCLUSION Droplet splatter can be detected in the immediate surgical field as well as on the surgeon. Although wearing a face visor does not prevent splatter on the surgical mask or around the eyes, it should be considered when undertaking tonsil surgery as well as a properly fitted goggle.

This systematic review synthesizes the available English literature on shoulder PJI to quantify treatment effectiveness. METHODS The PubMed and Embase databases were searched in April 2014. Keywords included ""shoulder replacement infection"" and ""shoulder arthroplasty infection."" Of 663 titles, 55 manuscripts underwent full-text review after application of exclusion criteria. Thirty articles were finally included. RESULTS Propionibacterium acnes was most commonly reported, representing 38.9% of infections, followed by Staphylococcus species. Risk factors for shoulder PJI include previous surgery, increased age, male gender, increased body mass index, and diabetes mellitus. The average white blood cell count in 13 studies was 7472 cells/µL. Ten studies reported a mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27.6 mm/h, whereas 14 studies reported a mean C-reactive protein level of 2.6 mg/dL. P. acnes in intraoperative culture specimens was an independent risk factor for failed treatment for shoulder PJI. When outcomes were pooled, no statistical difference was found in the success rates of 1-stage, 2-stage, or resection arthroplasty revision; each displayed a success rate >90%. However, single-stage revision produced the highest mean Constant score; implant retention resulted in the best range of motion. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that single-stage revision can be as effective as 2-stage or resection treatments; however, the retrospective nature of these data precluded our ability to control for confounding variables. Future studies on shoulder PJI should involve direct comparisons of 1-stage vs. 2-stage treatment while comparing cost, morbidity, and functional outcomes.","Nelson, Gregory N; Davis, Daniel E; Namdari, Surena",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2015.11.064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012542/,163

To develop a deeper understanding of the contribution of PM2.5 in the propagation of the SAR-CoV-2 virus in the population, the deposition patterns and efficiencies (DEs) of PM2.5 laced with the virus in healthy and asthmatic airways are studied. Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10-12 of the human airways were applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 were applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 μg⋅m-3 and 80 μg⋅m-3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume was assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations were proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combined to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models had higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy ones. Higher DEs arose in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increased the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.","Chen, Wei-Hsin; Mutuku, Justus Kavita; Yang, Zhe-Wei; Hwang, Chii-Jong; Lee, Wen Jhy; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794172/,163

However, FYM&S may contain high concentrations of pathogens, and complete inactivation through the AD process is unlikely. Thus, following land application of digestate, pathogens may contaminate a range of environmental media posing a potential threat to public health. The present study aimed to combine primary laboratory data with literature-based secondary data to develop an Excel-based exposure assessment model (ADRISK) using a gamma generalised linear model to predict the final microorganism count in the digestate. This research examines the behaviour of a suite of pathogens (Cryptosporidium parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium spp., and pathogenic Escherichia coli) and indicators (total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci) during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (M-AD) at 37 °C, pre/post-AD pasteurisation, and after a period of storage (with/without lime) for different feedstock proportions (slurry:food waste: 0:1, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1). ADRISK tool simulations of faecal indicator bacteria levels across all scenarios show that the digestate can meet the EU standard without pasteurisation if the AD runs at 37 °C or a higher temperature with a higher C:N ratio (recipe 3) and a hydraulic retention time ≥ 7 days. The storage of digestate also reduced levels of microorganisms in the digestate. The Irish pasteurisation process (60 °C for 4 days), although more energy-intensive, is more effective than the EU pasteurisation (70 °C for 1 h) specification. Pre-AD pasteurisation was more effective for C. parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium thermoresistibile. However, post-AD literature-based pasteurisation is most likely to assure the safety of the digestate. The information generated from this model can inform policy-makers regarding the optimal M-AD process parameters necessary to maximise the inactivation of microorganisms, ensuring adverse environmental impact is minimised, and public health is protected.","Nag, Rajat; Auer, Agathe; Nolan, Stephen; Russell, Lauren; Markey, Bryan K; Whyte, Paul; O'Flaherty, Vincent; Bolton, Declan; Fenton, Owen; Richards, Karl G; Cummins, Enda",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399337/,163

Observational studies to assess clinical outcome and related complications have been published. Clear evidence is required to better understand the safety profile of the WEB device. The authors here present a multicenter series that provides a detailed safety analysis focused on patient selection, procedural events, and technical issues of treated patients throughout the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS A nationwide password-protected database was set up to collect anonymous information across the UK (14 centers). Complications and clinical outcome were analyzed for the initial 109 patients (112 procedures). An independent root cause analysis classified the complications into groups (procedural, disease, device, ancillary device, and other). The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used as a marker of clinical outcome. RESULTS Each of the 109 patients had 1 aneurysm suitable for WEB treatment (109 aneurysms). Three patients had 2 procedures, making a total of 112 procedures performed. Eight procedures were abandoned because of access issues; 2 patients went on to have a successful procedure. All 109 patients had a preprocedure and discharge mRS scores recorded. One hundred patients had a recorded mRS score from a > 3-month follow-up. Deployment of the WEB device was successful in 103 (94.5%) of 109 patients and 104 (92.9%) of 112 procedures. One patient had 2 successful WEB procedures on separate occasions. Patients without a successfully implanted WEB device were included in the analysis. Selection analysis showed that the average patient age was 56.5 years among 34 men and 75 women. The percentage of incidental aneurysms was 58.7%, acute 16.5%, symptomatic 18.3%, and recurrent 6.4%. Further results analysis showed that 40 (36.7%) of 109 patients had recorded adverse events, including those unrelated to the WEB device. Events that could be related to the WEB device numbered 17 (15.6%) among the 109 patients. Two patients with device-related complications were symptomatic. Overall, 11 patients (10.1%) had persistent clinical sequelae. Thromboembolism was the most prevalent event, affecting 15.6% of the patients (17 of 109), and 6.4% of the patients (7 of 109) with a thromboembolism were symptomatic. Overall mortality before discharge was 0% and at the > 3-month follow-up was 5% (5 of 100 patients). Morbidity was defined as an mRS score increase to > 2. Overall morbidity at discharge was 1.8% (2 of 109) and at the > 3-month follow-up was 6% (6 of 100). No device-related morbidity or mortality was associated with this group. CONCLUSIONS The UK data show that the WEB device is safe for clinical use. Thromboembolic complication adds a risk that should be minimized with appropriate anticoagulation and correct sizing of the device. There is scope for further evaluation and standardization of an anticoagulation regimen for the WEB device.","Lawson, Aimee; Molyneux, Andy; Sellar, Robin; Lamin, Saleh; Thomas, Allan; Gholkar, Anil; Patankar, Tufail",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.9.jns152849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28156251/,163

DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING OUD treatment in the outpatient setting. PARTICIPANTS A total of 45,210 commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees 18 years or older in the OptumLabs Data Warehouse with an index diagnosis of OUD between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2018. INTERVENTIONS Treatment with buprenorphine. MEASUREMENTS We calculated 6 measures of buprenorphine treatment quality. We conducted survival analyses to characterize treatment duration and logistic regressions to evaluate the association between clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and quality. FINDINGS Of 45,210 eligible individuals with OUD, ∼1 in 10 (n=4600, 10.2%) initiated buprenorphine within 365 days following diagnosis (Measure #1) and 2850 individuals (6.3%) initiated buprenorphine within 14 days of diagnosis (Measure #2). Of individuals initiating treatment within 14 days of diagnosis, 1769 (62.1%) had 2 or more buprenorphine claims within 34 days of initiation (Measure #3). Of the 4600 individuals who received buprenorphine, 2300 (50.0%) were maintained in care with 180 days or more of covered buprenorphine treatment during 365 days after diagnosis (Measure #4). Finally, of the 4600 individuals who received buprenorphine, 2543 (55.3%) did not fill any other concurrent opioid analgesic (Measure #5) and 2951 (64.2%) did not fill any concurrent benzodiazepine (Measure #6). Quality was generally lower for individuals with MA compared with commercial coverage and among Hispanic and Black adults compared with White adults.

Phytotherapy has an established role in everyday self-care and health care, but, since botanical preparations contain many chemical constituents rather than single compounds, challenges arise in demonstrating efficacy and safety. However, there is ample traditional, empirical, and clinical evidence that botanicals can offer some protection and alleviation of disease symptoms as well as promoting general well-being. Newly emerging viral infections, specifically COVID-19, represent a unique challenge in their novelty and absence of established antiviral treatment or immunization. We discuss here the roles and limitations of phytotherapy in helping to prevent and address viral infections, especially regarding their effects on immune response.

The aim of this study was to measure the additional WOB imposed by four current CPAP devices during simulation of a difficult but commonly encountered clinical situation. METHOD Flow contour, respiratory system compliance and total lung-airway resistance of a patient under CPAP were simulated. The devices were tested at a CPAP of 15cm H(2)O with a heated humidifier and a nasal pillow, which increased circuitry resistance and with and without a simulated unintentional leak. RESULTS With no leak, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at the interface varied across devices from 14.0 to 15.3cm H(2)O. With a leak of 1L/s, PEEP varied from 11.5 to 17.1cm H(2)O. Imposed inspiratory WOB ranged from less than 0.1J/min to 0.45J/min with no leak, and the range broadened with leaking. Findings were similar for the imposed expiratory WOB. CONCLUSION The performances of CPAP devices are variable. The device that calibrated for the pressure loss in the circuitry under dynamic conditions and made appropriate pressure adjustments outperformed the other devices.","Louis, Bruno; Leroux, Karl; Boucherie, Maud; Isabey, Daniel; Grillier-Lanoir, Véronique; Fauroux, Brigitte; Lofaso, Frédéric",Sleep medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2009.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892594/,163
136086,Superoxide dismutase nanozymes: an emerging star for anti-oxidation.,2021-06-23,"INTRODUCTION The promotion of mental health well-being among global adolescent populations is of great public health and social significance. This is particularly true for adolescents living with chronic illnesses as studies have shown that these populations are at higher risk for developing mental health problems. There is vast recognition of the need for age and culturally appropriate interventions to promote mental well-being and prevent mental health problems. In stark contrast, there is a dearth of relevant measures of mental well-being for adolescents. Our proposed systematic review aims to identify measures of mental well-being and to assess content, psychometric properties and relevance to adolescent populations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The systematic review methodology will be guided by the seven steps proposed by Eggar, Davey and Smith. Documents will be sourced from electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, Educational Resource Information Center, Medical Literature Analysis Retrieval System Online, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature plus, PsyArticles, SocIndex and Sabinet). All documents will be exported to Mendeley and two reviewers will independently screen the titles, abstracts and full texts for inclusion. Any discrepancies will be resolved by a third party. We will include studies published in all languages from 2000 to 2020, that use an instrument(s) that measure mental well-being among adolescent populations. Studies reporting on clinically significant mental illnesses or disorders will be excluded. A descriptive meta-synthesis approach will be used to identify and describe the mental health instruments used among adolescent populations, and to report on the psychometric properties. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required. The results of this review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication as well as conference presentations.","Orth, Zaida; van Wyk, Brian",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830115/,163
136102,Endoscopic full-thickness resection for GI stromal tumors.,2014,"As a novel enteropathogenic coronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) warrants further investigation. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-1601, was isolated from the feces of a diarrheic piglet. After plaque purification, the genome was determined which shared 97.5%-99.5% nucleotide identities with 71 representative PDCoV strains available in the GenBank. The pathogenic properties of CHN-HN-1601 were evaluated using 5-day-old piglets. All inoculated piglets developed severe diarrhea from 2 days post-infection (dpi) onwards. To our surprise, two periods of diarrhea starting from 2 to 7 dpi and from 13 to 19 dpi were observed in affected piglets during the experiment. Fecal viral shedding of the inoculated piglets was detected by real-time RT-PCR, with viral shedding peaked at 4 and 16 dpi, respectively. At necropsy at 5 dpi, the main gross lesions included transparent, thin-walled and gas-distended intestines containing yellow watery contents. Further histopathological examinations, including hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, RNAscope in situ hybridization revealed that the virus infection caused severe villous atrophy of the small intestines, with PDCoV antigen and RNA mainly distributed in the cytoplasm of the villous epithelial cells of jejunum and ileum in piglets. The dynamic production of PDCoV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies in serum of the affected piglets was also assessed using a whole virus-based ELISA and an immunofluorescence assay-based neutralization test, respectively. Furthermore, a full-length cDNA infectious clone of CHN-HN-1601 was constructed using a bacterial artificial chromosome system. The rescued virus exhibited in vitro growth and pathogenic properties similar to the parental virus. Taken together, our study not only enriches the information of PDCoV, but also provides a useful reverse genetics platform for further pathogenesis exploration of the virus.","Zhou, Xinrong; Zhou, Lei; Zhang, Pingping; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Zhang, Yongning; Yang, Hanchun",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012120/,163

136393,Nanoscale assemblies and their biomedical applications.,2013,"OBJECTIVE To safeguard key workers involved in development and production of medicines and ensure business continuity, we developed an occupational healthcare program, performed by our company's occupational healthcare services, to assess the infection and immune status for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pilot program, conducted at our company facilities, evaluated the suitability of diagnostic tools in our setting for program upscaling. METHODS We used different marketed in vitro diagnostics (including tests for antibodies against spike protein subunits S1 and S2 and nucleocapsid [N] protein) combined with medical history, symptoms and likelihood of infection. We evaluated the testing strategy over four visits in 141 employees (known positive COVID-19 history, n = 20; unknown status, n = 121) between April and June 2020 at four company locations in Germany. Digital self-monitoring over the pilot program duration was also included. RESULTS No incident infections were detected. Based on immune status, medical history and likelihood of infection, 10 participants (8.3%) with previously unknown history of COVID-19 were identified to have been infected before entering the program. These participants, who recalled no or mild symptoms in the preceding months, were primarily identified using an assay that detected both S1 and S2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G. The frequency of positive lateral flow assay (LFA) results (IgM or IgG directed against the N-protein) in this cohort was lower compared with participants with a known history of COVID-19 (0‒10.8% vs. 33.8‒75.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Data from this pilot program suggest that LFA for antibodies may not always reliably detect current, recent or past infections; consequently, these have not been included in our upscaled occupational healthcare program. Regular testing strategies for viral RNA and antibodies directed against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, combined with hygiene rules and a comprehensive baseline assessment, are recommended to ensure avoidance of infections at workplace as reliably as possible.","Moroni-Zentgraf, Petra C; Keller, Christoph; Mahmoudi, Mazyar; Kallsen, Kimberley; Eschenfelder, Christoph C; Sigmund, Ralf; Müller, Hanns Walter; Baum, Patrick; Boos, Bertram; Schneider, Michael; Mundt, Egbert",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1914943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836626/,163

Transcriptomics is frequently used to interrogate alterations in cultured human islet cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We introduce single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) as an alternative approach for investigating transplanted human islets. METHODS The Nuclei EZ protocol was used to obtain nuclear preparations from fresh and frozen human islet cells. Such preparations were first used to generate snRNA-seq datasets and compared to scRNA-seq output obtained from cells from the same donor. Finally, we employed snRNA-seq to obtain the transcriptomic profile of archived human islets engrafted in immunodeficient animals. RESULTS We observed virtually complete concordance in identifying cell types and gene proportions as well as a strong association of global and islet cell type gene signatures between scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq applied to fresh and frozen cultured or transplanted human islet samples. CONCLUSIONS We propose snRNA-seq as a reliable strategy to probe transcriptomic profiles of freshly harvested or frozen sources of transplanted human islet cells especially when scRNA-seq is not ideal.","Basile, Giorgio; Kahraman, Sevim; Dirice, Ercument; Pan, Hui; Dreyfuss, Jonathan M; Kulkarni, Rohit N",Genome medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00941-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34376240/,163
136841,Lymph node transfer and perinodal lymphatic growth factor treatment for lymphedema.,2013,"Reusable soft daily wear contact lenses (CLs) remain popular and were fit to just over half of all wearers in the most recent international CL prescribing survey. Unlike daily disposable CLs, reusables require cleaning and disinfecting after every use, along with storage in a CL case. These additional requirements add a number of steps to the daily wear and care routine, increasing the opportunities for CL wearers to exhibit non-compliant behaviour. The impact of non-compliance ranges from poor lens comfort through to potentially sight-threatening infective keratitis. The coronavirus pandemic has refocused the profession on the importance of hand hygiene in particular, and the need for promoting safe CL wear in general. This review summarises typical non-compliant behaviour related to reusable CLs, and examines strategies and opportunities to better support wearers. Patient education has a central role in encouraging compliant behaviour, although patient recall of information is low, and personal belief systems may result in continuation of non-compliant behaviour despite awareness of the risks. CL care solutions are required for the daily disinfection of lenses, however misuse of multipurpose solutions (MPS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based care systems can challenge their ability to be fully efficacious. Standard efficacy testing is reviewed, with consideration of how well current protocols model real-world use of CL solutions. Although some recommendations are in place for the inclusion of additional variables such as lens cases, CL materials, organic soil and efficacy against Acanthamoeba, opportunity still exists to reevaluate global standards to ensure consistency of testing in all markets. Finally, potential future innovations are discussed which may further support increased safety in reusable lens wear through novel antimicrobial additions to both CL materials and cases.","Yee, Alan; Walsh, Karen; Schulze, Marc; Jones, Lyndon",Contact lens & anterior eye : the journal of the British Contact Lens Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2021.02.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678542/,163

The SARS-CoV-2 possesses RNA as a genetic material with 79% of the match with the bat SARS-CoV genome, which became epidemic in 2002. The SARS-CoV-2 peripheral Spike-Fc protein binds specifically to the ACE2 receptors present on bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes to downmodulates its expression which leads to severe acute respiratory failure. The disease is super infectious from human to human and the symptoms are similar to flu. The old aged and immunocompromised population are severely affected, and healthcare providers globally applied various strategies for treatment including the repurposing of drugs including antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral drugs. Herein, we described the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, immune responses, possible drug targets, vaccines under the trials and correlated the possibility of trained immunity induced by BCG vaccination over control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

OBJECTIVE Evaluate the oncologic and perioperative outcomes of LNU versus ONU in the treatment of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION A systematic review and cumulative analysis of comparative studies reporting both oncologic and perioperative outcomes of LNU and ONU was performed through a comprehensive search of the Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases. All analyses were performed using the Review Manager (RevMan) v.5 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) and Meta-analysis In eXcel (MIX) 2.0 Pro (BiostatXL) software packages. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Twenty-one eligible studies (1235 cases and 3093 controls) were identified. A significantly higher proportion of pTa/Tis was observed in LNU compared to ONU (27.52% vs 22.59%; p = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in other stages and pathologic grades (all p>0.05). For patients who underwent LNU, the 5-yr cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate was significantly higher, at 9% (p = 0.03), compared to those who underwent ONU, while the overall recurrence rate and bladder recurrence rate were notably lower, at 15% (p = 0.01) and 17% (p = 0.02), respectively. However, there were no statistically significant differences in 2-yr CSS, 5-yr recurrence-free survival (RFS), 5-yr overall survival (OS), 2-yr OS, and metastasis rates between LNU and ONU (all p>0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences between LNU and ONU in terms of intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and perioperative mortality (all p>0.05). The results of our study were mainly limited by the retrospective design of most of the individual studies included as well as selection biases based on different management of regional lymph nodes and pathologic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that LNU offers reliable perioperative safety and comparable oncologic efficacy when compared to ONU. Given that some limitations cannot be overcome, well-designed prospective trials are needed to confirm our findings.","Ni, Shaobin; Tao, Weiyang; Chen, Qiyin; Liu, Lianxin; Jiang, Hongchi; Hu, Hailong; Han, Ruifa; Wang, Chunyang",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22349569/,163

138314,A Comparison of Hemostatic Properties between Monopolar and Bipolar Hysteroscopic Surgery using Rotational Thromboelastometry: A Randomized Trial.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To assess critical heat spread of cautery instruments used in robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thermal spread along bovine musculofascial tissues was examined by infrared camera, histology and enzyme assay. Currently used monopolar, bipolar and ultrasonic laparoscopic instruments were investigated at various power settings and application times. The efficacy of using an additional Maryland clamp as a heat sink was evaluated. A temperature of 45 °C was considered the threshold temperature for possible nerve damage. RESULTS Monopolar instruments exhibited a mean (sem) critical thermal spread of 3.5 (2.3) mm when applied at 60 W for 1 s. After 2 s, the spread was >20 mm. For adjustable bipolar instruments the mean (sem) critical thermal spread was 2.2 (0.6) mm at 60 W and 1 s, and 3.6 (1.3) mm at 2 s. The PK and LigaSure forceps had mean (sem) critical thermal spreads of 3.9 (0.8) and 2.8 (0.6) mm respectively, whereas the ultrasonic instrument reached 2.9 (0.8) mm. Application of an additional Maryland clamp as a heat sink, significantly reduced the thermal spread. Histomorphometric analyses and enzyme assay supported these findings. CONCLUSIONS All coagulation devices used in RAL surgery have distinct thermal spreads depending on power setting and application time. Cautery may be of concern due to lateral temperature spread, causing potential damage to sensitive structures including nerves. Our results provide surgeons with a resource for educated decision-making when using coagulation devices during robotic procedures.","Hefermehl, Lukas J; Largo, Remo A; Hermanns, Thomas; Poyet, Cédric; Sulser, Tullio; Eberli, Daniel",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.12498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24127773/,163

Because catheterization is often performed in emergency situations, speed and accuracy are emphasized. METHODS We retrospectively compared the Micropuncture kit with the standard 18-gauge Angiocath IV catheter for tunneled cuffed catheter insertion in the right jugular vein. From June 2016 to May 2017, 31 tunneled cuffed catheters were successfully inserted via the Micropuncture kit and another 31 via the Angiocath IV catheter. All patients underwent the same ultrasound-guided procedure performed by a single experienced interventionalist. Procedure time was the time from draping of the patient to the completion of povidone dressing after the catheterization. In our center, the Angio Lab nurse maintains records, including procedure time and method for every procedure. All patient records were retrospectively tracked through electronic medical record review. The primary outcome was procedure time and the secondary outcomes were complications and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the patients' demographic data between the two groups. However, procedure time was significantly shorter in the Angiocath group than in the Micropuncture group (12.4 ± 3.5 vs 17.6 ± 6.9 min, p = 0.001); there were no serious complications, such as hemorrhage, pneumothorax, or hematoma, in both groups. Moreover, cost-effectiveness was better in the Angiocath group than in the Micropuncture group (0.34 vs 52 US$, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Using the Angiocath IV catheter can reduce procedure time and cost with no severe complications. Moreover, experienced practitioners can reduce the risk of complications when using Angiocath. There are several limitations to this study. First, it was retrospective; second, it was not randomized; and finally, it was conducted by only one experienced interventionalist.","Lee, Jin Ho; Hwang, Seun Deuk; Song, Joon Ho; Kim, HeeYeoun; Lee, Dong Yeol; Oh, Joon Seok; Sin, Yong Hun; Kim, Joong Kyung",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/1129729818777963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30071773/,163

MATERIALS AND METHODS French and English-language articles from Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database were searched, using key words (mesh ; pelvic organ prolapse ; cystocele ; rectocele ; uterine prolapse ; complications ; adverse event ; sacral colpopexy ; extrusion ; infection...). RESULTS As with any surgery, it is recommended to provide a perioperative smoking cessation (expert opinion) and comply with the prevention of nosocomial infections (regulatory requirement). There is no evidence to recommend routine local or systemic estrogen therapy before or after prolapse surgery using mesh, regardless of the surgical approach (grade C). Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended, regardless of the approach (expert opinion). It is recommended to seek a pre-operative urinary tract infection and treat it (expert opinion). The first cases should be made under the guidance of an experienced surgeon in the relevant technique (grade C). It is recommended not to place a non-absorbable synthetic mesh into the rectovaginal septum when a rectal injury occurs (expert opinion). The placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh into the vesicovaginal septum may be considered after the suture of a bladder injury if the suture is considered to be satisfactory (expert opinion). If a synthetic mesh is placed by vaginal route, it is recommended to use a macroporous polypropylene monofilament mesh (grade B). It is recommended not to use polyester mesh for vaginal surgery (grade B). It is allowed to perform a hysterectomy associated with the placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh placed by vaginal route but this is not routinely recommended (expert opinion). It is recommended to minimize the extent of the colpectomy (expert opinion). Laparoscopic approach is recommended for sacral colpopexy (grade C). It is recommended not to place and suture meshes by vaginal route when a sacral colpopexy is performed (grade B). It is recommended not to use silicone-coated polyester, porcine dermis, fascia lata, and polytétrafluoroéthylène meshes (grade B). It is recommended to use polyester (without silicone coating) or polypropylene meshes (grade C). Suture of the meshes to the promontory can be performed using thread/needle or tacker (grade C). A peritonization is recommended to cover the meshes (grade C). If hysterectomy is required, it is recommended to perform a subtotal hysterectomy (grade C). CONCLUSION Implementation of this guideline should decrease the prevalence of complications related to surgical procedures involving the use of prosthetic meshes.","Deffieux, X; Savary, D; Letouzey, V; Sentilhes, L; Agostini, A; Mares, P; Pierre, F","Journal de gynecologie, obstetrique et biologie de la reproduction",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgyn.2011.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22056180/,163

Its use is supported by expert consensus documents and international guidelines. Variation in technology, data acquisition, and analysis affect results and clinical interpretation. This study examined variation in ARM between institutions to establish the status of current practice. METHODS A 50-item web-based questionnaire assessing analysis and interpretation of ARM was distributed by the International Anorectal Physiology Working Group via societies representing practitioners that perform ARM. Study methodology and performance characteristics between institutions were compared. KEY RESULTS One hundred and seven complete responses were included from 30 countries. Seventy-nine (74%) institutions performed at least two studies per week. Forty-nine centers (47%) applied conventional ARM (≤8 pressure sensors) and 57 (53%) high-resolution ARM (HR-ARM). Specialist centers were most likely to use HR-ARM compared to regional hospitals and office-based practice (63% vs 37%). Most conventional ARM systems used water-perfused technology (34/49); solid-state hardware was more frequently used in centers performing HR-ARM (44/57). All centers evaluated rest and squeeze. There was marked variation in the methods used to report results of maneuvers. No two centers had identical protocols for patient preparation, setup, study, and data interpretation, and no center fully complied with published guidelines. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES There is significant discrepancy in methods for data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of ARM. This is likely to impact clinical interpretation, transfer of data between institutions, and research collaboration.

The virions expose a tripartite envelope glycoprotein complex at their surface, formed by the glycoprotein subunits GP1, GP2 and the stable signal peptide. This complex is responsible for binding to target cells and for the subsequent fusion of viral and host-cell membranes for entry. During this process, the acidic environment of the endosome triggers a fusogenic conformational change in the transmembrane GP2 subunit of the complex. We report here the crystal structure of the recombinant GP2 ectodomain of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, the arenavirus type species, at 1.8-Å resolution. The structure shows the characteristic trimeric coiled coil present in class I viral fusion proteins, with a central stutter that allows a close structural alignment with most of the available structures of class I and III viral fusion proteins. The structure further shows a number of intrachain salt bridges stabilizing the postfusion hairpin conformation, one of which involves an aspartic acid that appears released from a critical interaction with the stable signal peptide upon low pH activation.","Igonet, Sébastien; Vaney, Marie-Christine; Vonrhein, Clemens; Bricogne, Gérard; Stura, Enrico A; Hengartner, Hans; Eschli, Bruno; Rey, Félix A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1108910108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22123988/,163

AC is a low-immunogenic derivative of collagen obtained by the removal of N- and C-terminal telopeptide components. Mixed solutions of negatively charged SiNPs and AC were turbid, while positively charged SiNPs (Ludox CL) did not form a complex with AC in pH 4 buffer, indicating that electrostatic attraction is the dominant force to form the complex. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements were made for AC and Ludox LS (or CL) solutions in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and citrate buffer (pH 3.0). The CD data showed that the stability of the triple helical structure of AC in the buffers is not affected by the complexation. The resulting complex consisting of triple helical AC and SiNPs did not influence the SAXS profile except for the lowest q region investigated. On the contrary, different scattering profiles were observed for the single chain AC and SiNP mixture indicating densely packed SiNPs in the complex. This scattering behavior was fairly explained in terms of the sticky hard sphere model (SHSM). This AC conformation-dependent complexation may be because of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the single chain AC and SiNPs. The temperature-induced change of the complex formation can be applied for thermoresponsive hybrid materials.","Terao, Ken; Otsubo, Mari; Abe, Masahiro",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197312/,163

139418,Welcome to the 13th volume of Epigenomics.,2020-12-16,"African swine fever (ASF) was first identified in Estonia in 2014, initially detected in wild boar and spreading to affect almost the whole country from late 2016 onwards. Passive surveillance and the control measures applied in Estonia are the main actions in the attempt to control the wild boar population and therefore limit the spread of ASF. Implementation and success of both activities depend mainly on the involvement and commitment of the executing force: the Estonian hunters. Thus, their acceptance of the measures is of utmost importance and with the help of participatory methods, their acceptability can be assessed. Participatory epidemiology allows the involvement of key stakeholders in planning control measures and surveillance strategies and gathering information otherwise inaccessible. By conducting focus group discussions and utilizing participatory tools, this study aimed to assess the acceptance of ASF control measures by hunters in Estonia. Furthermore, the study aimed to detect means to improve the motivation of hunters to support passive surveillance. Among hunters, the results ranked the trust in lower authorities (e.g. local official veterinarians) towards implementing control measures as high (in contrast to higher officials e.g. 'Ministry of Rural Affairs'), while perceiving themselves as the most trustworthy group among those implementing ASF control measures. Hunting and every measure supporting increased hunting, for example selective hunting, bait feeding and incentives for hunting wild boar, were deemed favourable for hunters. These measures also received the highest trust for controlling ASF. All measures hindering hunting and the movement of wildlife, for example fencing or involvement of the army in ASF control, were described as unpleasant or even unethical and trust in these measures to control the disease successfully was lacking. When assessing the perceived consequences for hunters of finding a dead wild boar, arising financial costs, additional workload and time consumption were highlighted. In line with these results, the two tools with the strongest motivational effect for taking part in passive surveillance were: (1) higher monetary incentives as compensation for the hunters' work, and (2) the reduction of the negative consequences by limiting the hunters' duties to solely reporting found dead wild boar. In conclusion, participatory methods can be used as a highly suitable tool for the evaluation of acceptance of measures and surveillance systems. Potentially, the results can help to improve control and passive surveillance in Estonia, as well as functioning as an example for other countries battling or awaiting ASF.","Urner, Nico; Mõtus, Kerli; Nurmoja, Imbi; Schulz, Jana; Sauter-Louis, Carola; Staubach, Christoph; Conraths, Franz J; Schulz, Katja",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.105121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818692/,163

The anti-viral activities from several ayurvedic herbal medicines (in the form of crude extract or fraction or isolated compounds) have been established but their effectiveness against coronavirus still needs to be explored. They can provide a rich resource of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. In this paper, in-silico techniques have been used to identify the potential lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2. A list of flavonoids having anti-viral activity was prepared and evaluated against the selected target. Rhoifolin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, baicalin, astragalin, luteolin, and kaempferol showed good binding affinity and thus these could be promising compounds.

140875,Balloon expulsion testing for the diagnosis of dyssynergic defecation in women with chronic constipation.,2015,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked the world and caused morbidity and mortality on an unprecedented level in the era of modern medicine. Evidence generated to-date on the virulence and pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests that COVID-19 may be considered a perfect storm, caused by a nature's virtually perfect biological weapon. This conclusion is supported by an updated analysis of pathogenesis and clinical progression of this infectious disease. It is now readily apparent that COVID-19 is not a clear-cut disorder, but is instead a gradually evolving pathology, characterized by a series of stages sustained by different molecular and biological mechanisms. The disease can hence be divided in at least five different phases (incubation, respiratory, pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and death or remission). Whilst the virus triggers direct cytopathic injury during the initial stage of illness, in the following evolving phases, it is the host itself that undergoes an almost suicidal reaction, sustained, amplified and maintained by the immune, complement and hemostatic systems. Another peculiar property making SARS-CoV-2 a devious and vicious pathogen is the biophysical structure of its receptor biding domain, which needs to be primed by human proteases, thus being less efficiently targetable by the host immune system. The unique pathophysiology of COVID-19 requires the customization of therapy by individual patient characteristics and according to the phase-specific, evolving derangement of the multiple biological pathways.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Henry, Brandon M",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32617313/,163
141176,Challenges associated with organising virtual events.,2021-06-01,"AIMS Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcome. However, it is unclear whether cell specific consequences are associated with cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated heart tissue utilizing in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing in consecutive autopsy cases to quantify virus load and characterize cardiac involvement in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS In this study, 95 SARS-CoV-2-positive autopsy cases were included. A relevant SARS-CoV-2 virus load in the cardiac tissue was detected in 41/95 deceased (43%). MACE-RNA-sequencing was performed to identify molecular pathomechanisms caused by the infection of the heart. A signature matrix was generated based on the single-cell dataset ""Heart Cell Atlas"" and used for digital cytometry on the MACE-RNA-sequencing data. Thus, immune cell fractions were estimated and revealed no difference in immune cell numbers in cases with and without cardiac infection. This result was confirmed by quantitative immunohistological diagnosis.MACE-RNA-sequencing revealed 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a q-value <0.05 (e.g. up: IFI44L, IFT3, TRIM25; down: NPPB, MB, MYPN). The upregulated DEGs were linked to interferon pathways and originate predominantly from endothelial cells. In contrast, the downregulated DEGs originate predominately from cardiomyocytes. Immunofluorescent staining showed viral protein in cells positive for the endothelial marker ICAM1 but rarely in cardiomyocytes. The GO term analysis revealed that downregulated GO terms were linked to cardiomyocyte structure, whereas upregulated GO terms were linked to anti-virus immune response. CONCLUSION This study reveals, that cardiac infection induced transcriptomic alterations mainly linked to immune response and destruction of cardiomyocytes. While endothelial cells are primarily targeted by the virus, we suggest cardiomyocyte-destruction by paracrine effects. Increased pro-inflammatory gene expression was detected in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiac tissue but no increased SARS-CoV-2 associated immune cell infiltration was observed. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE Cardiac injury can be documented in COVID-19, regardless the direct cardiac virus infection and is known to be associated with outcome. However, the direct virus infection of the myocardium leads to transcriptomic alterations and might therefore additionally contribute to pathophysiological processes in COVID-19. Therefore, consequences of cardiac virus infection need to be investigated in future studies, since they might also contribute to long-term effects in case of survival.","Bräuninger, Hanna; Stoffers, Bastian; Fitzek, Antonia D E; Meißner, Kira; Aleshcheva, Ganna; Schweizer, Michaela; Weimann, Jessica; Rotter, Björn; Warnke, Svenja; Edler, Carolin; Braun, Fabian; Roedl, Kevin; Scherschel, Katharina; Escher, Felicitas; Kluge, Stefan; Huber, Tobias B; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Schultheiss, Heinz-Peter; Kirchhof, Paulus; Blankenberg, Stefan; Püschel, Klaus; Westermann, Dirk; Lindner, Diana",Cardiovascular research,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvab322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647998/,163

141706,Flexural Properties and Polished Surface Characteristics of a Structural Colored Resin Composite.,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND Bimodal electric tissue ablation (BETA) incorporates the process of electrolysis into radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to increase the size of tissue ablation. This study investigated whether BETA could increase the efficacy of the Cool-Tip RF system (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) to produce larger ablations. It also investigated whether applying electrolysis only during the pretreatment phase (called electrochemical treatment (ECT)/RFA group) is as effective as BETA (where electrolysis was used during both the pretreatment and RFA phases). METHODS A Cool-Tip RF system (Covidien) was used to test three types of ablations (RFA, BETA, and ECT/RFA) in a pig liver model. In BETA, 9 V of direct current was provided for 10 min, after which the RF generator was started and both electrical circuits were allowed to run concurrently. In ECT/RFA, however, the direct current circuit was switched off after 10 min of pretreatment and only RFA was performed as described above. Ablation sizes were measured in three dimensions. RESULTS The size of ablations (transverse diameter A and B) produced by BETA and ECT/RFA was significantly larger compared with standard RFA (P < 0/001). BETA also created larger ablations compared with ECT/RFA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION BETA could improve the efficacy of the Cool-Tip RF system (Covidien) to achieve larger ablations. The increased tissue hydration improved delivery of electrical energy to the tissues and delayed the process of desiccation, thus allowing the ablation process to continue for longer periods of time to produce larger ablations. BETA could be used to treat larger liver tumours more effectively than standard RFA.","Tiong, Leong Ung; Field, John B F; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-2197.2011.05990.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22510186/,163
141902,"Erratum: Cytotoxic and Antimicrobial Efficacy of Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized Using a Traditional Phytoproduct, Asafoetida Gum [Corrigendum].",2020,"Elucidating the diets of insect predators is important in basic and applied ecology, such as for improving the effectiveness of conservation biological control measures to promote natural enemies of crop pests. Here, we investigated the aphid diet of two common aphid predators in Central European agroecosystems, the native Coccinella septempunctata (Linnaeus) and the invasive Harmonia axyridis (Pallas; Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by means of high throughput sequencing (HTS). For acquiring insights into diets of mobile flying insects at landscape scale minimizing trapping bias is important, which imposes methodological challenges for HTS. We therefore assessed the suitability of three field sampling methods (sticky traps, pan traps and hand-collection) as well as new aphid primers for identifying aphid prey consumption by coccinellids through HTS. The new aphid primers facilitate identification to species level in 75% of the European aphid genera investigated. Aphid primer specificity was high in silico and in vitro but low in environmental samples with the methods used, although this could be improved in future studies. For insect trapping we conclude that sticky traps are a suitable method in terms of minimizing sampling bias, contamination risk and trapping success, but compromise on DNA-recovery rate. The aphid diets of both field-captured ladybird species were dominated by Microlophium carnosum, the common nettle aphid. Another common prey was Sitobion avenae (cereal aphid), which got more often detected in C. septempunctata compared to H. axyridis. Around one third of the recovered aphid taxa were common crop pests. We conclude that sampling methodologies need constant revision but that our improved aphid primers offer currently one of the best solutions for broad screenings of coccinellid predation on aphids.","Ammann, Lolita; Moorhouse-Gann, Rosemary; Cuff, Jordan; Bertrand, Colette; Mestre, Laia; Hidalgo, Nicolás Pérez; Ellison, Amy; Herzog, Felix; Entling, Martin H; Albrecht, Matthias; Symondson, William O C",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609728/,163

OBJECTIVE It is vital to recognize how the pandemic has affected dermatology practices and identify methods to maximize clinical efficiency while maintaining patient safety. METHODS Private practice dermatologists in metropolitan areas were interviewed regarding various issues, including patient volume, types of visits or procedures being performed, screening for COVID-19, and operational modifications. RESULTS On average, there was a 65.2% decrease in patient volume during the initial surge of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was improved to a 15.5% decrease in July 2020. Despite this reduction in patient volume, the proportion of acute dermatologic issues, biopsies performed, and skin cancer concerns were all increased compared to pre-COVID. All of the dermatologists reported notable changes in regards to scheduling, staff, operations, and workplaces. LIMITATIONS Interview participants were limited to metropolitan dermatologists mainly within the California region. CONCLUSION Improving patient communication, implementing protocols to facilitate social distancing, and utilizing teledermatology were reported to be essential to optimizing efficiency and safety.

The objective of this study was to explore the influencing factors associated with self-reported psychological distress among a sample of PCPs in China in relation to COVID-19. METHODS An online survey was distributed to a sample of PCPs in Chengdu city between February 10-13, 2020. The survey consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related questions, and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). After five months, a follow-up survey investigating the change of GHQ-12 was conducted. RESULTS A total of 712 PCPs completed the baseline survey (11.8% of those invited), 55.6% were female and 74.4% were aged between 30 and 49 years. High levels of psychological distress (GHQ-12≥3) were observed in 29.2%, and were associated with: low preparedness, high work impact, working with infected residents, personal life impact and concerns, as well as older age and being married (p-values<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that psychological distress was associated with low preparedness (OR=0.91, 95%CI=0.87-0.96), high work impact (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.03-1.20), personal life impact (OR=1.12, 95%CI=1.07-1.17), and safety-related concerns (OR=1.09, 95%CI=1.02-1.16). At the 5-months assessment point, high psychological distress was less frequent (21.8%). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has resulted in high levels of distress in approximately 30% of PCPs in China. Factors associated with high psychological distress levels include low preparedness and high levels of work impact, personal life impact and concerns. These findings highlight the importance of enhance psychological health throughout the course of infectious pandemics.","Zeng, Xin; Peng, Tao; Hao, Xiaofei; Zou, Chuan; Lin, Kai; Liao, Xiaoyang; Chen, Shanping; Hayhoe, Benedict",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0000000000000939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790199/,163

We postulated that a combination of clinical and surgical markers and scoring systems would outperform each of these predictors in isolation. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a multivariable model to examine whether survival outcome can reliably be predicted in peritonitis patients treated with open abdomen. This single-center retrospective analysis used univariable and multivariable logistic regression modeling in combination with repeated random sub-sampling validation to examine the predictive capabilities of domain-specific predictors (i.e., demography, physiology, surgery). We analyzed data of 1,351 consecutive adult patients (55.7% male) who underwent open abdominal surgery in the study period (January 1998 to December 2018). Core variables included demographics, clinical scores, surgical indices and indicators of organ dysfunction, peritonitis index, incision type, fascia closure, wound healing, and fascial dehiscence. Postoperative complications were also added when available. A multidomain peritonitis prediction model (MPPM) was constructed to bridge the mortality predictions from individual domains (demographic, physiological and surgical). The MPPM is based on data of n = 597 patients, features high predictive capabilities (area under the receiver operating curve: 0.87 (0.85 to 0.90, 95% CI)) and is well calibrated. The surgical predictor ""skin closure"" was found to be the most important predictor of survival in our cohort, closely followed by the two physiological predictors SAPS-II and MPI. Marginal effects plots highlight the effect of individual outcomes on the prediction of survival outcome in patients undergoing staged laparotomies for treatment of peritonitis. Although most single indices exhibited moderate performance, we observed that the predictive performance was markedly increased when an integrative prediction model was applied. Our proposed MPPM integrative prediction model may outperform the predictive power of current models.","Petersen, Sven; Huber, Markus; Storni, Federico; Puhl, Gero; Deder, Alice; Prause, Axel; Schefold, Joerg C; Doll, Dietrich; Schober, Patrick; Luedi, Markus M",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-021-00743-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247307/,163

Samples were collected from multiparous Holstein cows (n = 33) over the first 5 d in milk. A total of 183 samples for objective 1 and 181 samples for objective 2 were available. Neutrophil oxidative burst activity was assessed once between 2 and 5 d in milk (n = 29). Linear regression demonstrated strong relationships between serum tCa, Mg, and P concentrations measured by the VetTest compared with the reference method. Bland Altman analysis indicated that the VetTest values were higher than the reference method by 0.22 mmol/L for tCa, 0.12 mmol/L for Mg, and 0.16 mmol/L for P. Compared with hypocalcemia categorized at ≤2.0 or ≤2.125 mmol/L with the reference method tCa, thresholds for the VetTest measured tCa of ≤2.23 mmol/L (sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 89%) or ≤2.30 mmol/L (sensitivity = 86%, specificity = 96%) could be used. The relationship between whole-blood iCa and reference method serum tCa differed by sampling time point after calving. Compared with identification of hypocalcemia with serum tCa measurements from the reference method (thresholds of ≤2.0 and 2.125 mmol/L), a whole-blood iCa threshold of ≤1.17 mmol/L resulted in the highest combined sensitivities (94 and 82%) and specificities (80 and 94%) at either threshold. Ionized Ca measurements were more consistently related to outcomes of neutrophil oxidative burst activity measured in vitro. The VetTest measurements of serum tCa reliably identified hypocalcemia when thresholds were adjusted to account for the bias of the test. The variation in the relationship between iCa and reference method tCa in the days following parturition suggest that these measures cannot be used interchangeably as indicators of Ca status. The more consistent associations between iCa and in vitro measures of neutrophil function, compared with tCa, indicated that this may be a more sensitive predictor of functional outcomes associated with postpartum Ca status.","Leno, B M; Martens, E M; Felippe, M J B; Zanzalari, K P; Lawrence, J C; Overton, T R",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-12971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28918145/,163

We evaluated plant traits and environmental variables determining leaf temperature in tundra shrubs and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions with field measurements on deciduous tundra shrubs, Salix myrsinites and Betula nana, and evergreen Cassiope tetragona and Rhododendron lapponicum. Higher leaf-to-air temperature difference was observed in evergreen, compared to deciduous shrubs. Evergreen shrubs also showed continuously increasing photosynthesis with increasing temperature, suggesting high thermal tolerance. For the deciduous species, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis was between our measurement temperatures of 24 °C and 38 °C. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the most important variables influencing leaf temperature and VOC emissions in all the studied plants, along with stomatal density and specific leaf area in the deciduous shrubs. Using climate data and emission factors from our measurements, we modelled total seasonal tundra shrub VOC emissions of 0.3-2.3 g m-2 over the main growing season. Our results showed higher-than-expected temperature optima for photosynthesis and VOC emission and demonstrated the relative importance of plant traits and local environments in determining leaf temperature and VOC emissions in a subarctic tundra.","Simin, Tihomir; Tang, Jing; Holst, Thomas; Rinnan, Riikka",Environmental and experimental botany,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814646/,163

LUS demonstrated high sensitivity in the visualization of the interstitial signs of the typical pneumonia complicating the infection. However, although this disease gives typical lung alterations, the same LUS signs observed in COVID-19 pneumonia can be detected in other common pulmonary conditions. While being non-specific when considered separately, the analysis of the distribution of the sonographic typical signs allows the assignment of 4 LUS patterns of probability for COVID-19 pneumonia when the whole chest is examined and attention is paid to the presence of other atypical signs. Moreover, the combination of LUS likelihood with the clinical phenotype at presentation increases the accuracy. This mini-review will analyze the LUS signs of COVID-19 pneumonia and how they can be combined in patterns of probability in the first approach to suspected cases.","Volpicelli, Giovanni; Cardinale, Luciano; Fraccalini, Thomas",Praxis,https://doi.org/10.1024/1661-8157/a003696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34107756/,163
145740,Drug repurposing for antimicrobial discovery.,2019,"BACKGROUND Transperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) urethrovesical anastomosis is a critical step. Although the prevalence of urine leaks ranges from 4.5% to 7.5% at high-volume RALP centers, urine leaks prolong catheterization and may lead to ileus, peritonitis, and require intervention. Barbed polyglyconate sutures maintain running suture line tension and may be advantageous in RALP anastomosis for reducing this complication. OBJECTIVE To compare barbed polyglyconate and polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) running sutures for RALP anastomosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-surgeon study comparing RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate (n = 45) or polyglactin 910 (n = 36) sutures. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RALP anastomosis using either barbed polyglyconate or polyglactin 910 sutures was studied. MEASUREMENTS Operative time, cost differential, perioperative complications, and cystogram contrast extravasation by anastomosis suture type were measured. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Although baseline characteristics and overall operative times were similar, barbed polyglyconate sutures were associated with shorter mean anastomosis times of 9.7 min versus 9.8 min (p = 0.014). In addition, anastomosis with barbed polyglyconate rather than polyglactin 910 sutures was associated with more frequent cystogram extravasation 8 d postoperatively (20.0% vs 2.8%; p = 0.019), longer mean catheterization times (11.1 d vs 8.3 d; p = 0.048), and greater suture costs per case ($51.52 vs $8.44; p < 0.001). After 8 of 29 (27.6%) barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites demonstrated postoperative day 8 cystogram extravasation, we modified our technique to avoid overtightening, reducing cystogram extravasation to 1 (6.3%) of 16 subsequent barbed polyglyconate anastomosis sites. Potential limitations include small sample size and the single-surgeon study design. CONCLUSIONS Compared to traditional sutures, barbed polyglyconate is more costly and requires technical modification to avoid overtightening, delayed healing, and longer catheterization time following RALP.","Williams, Stephen B; Alemozaffar, Mehrdad; Lei, Yin; Hevelone, Nathanael; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Plaster, Blakely A; Hu, Jim C",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2010.07.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20708331/,163

However, evidence for media effects are inconsistent in the literature. This study investigated this ""lift big-get big"" culture and effects of imagery on males' beliefs regarding RT. Method: An online survey was conducted with male participants (N = 110) randomized to different images (hyper-muscular/lean/control) and RT information (""lift big-get big""/""evidence based RT""/control). Results: Descriptive data suggested belief in necessity of heavy loads and free weights was pervasive. There was a small significant effect of condition for multivariate analysis of beliefs regarding RT. Univariate analyses showed significant effects of condition regarding the importance of free weights and heavy loads for strength, and free weights for hypertrophy. Small to moderate effects were found comparing ""evidence-based RT"" with a hyper-muscular physique to ""lift big-get big"" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques, the latter more likely to agree free weights and heavy loads are necessary for strength. A small effect was found comparing ""lift big-get big"" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques and the control condition, the former more likely to agree free weights are necessary for hypertrophy. Conclusions: Although hyper-muscular bodies alone did not influence RT beliefs, new information, i.e., ""evidence-based RT"" combined with a hyper-muscular physique had a small effect. The ""lift big-get big"" culture is perhaps pervasive enough that most conditions merely reinforced existing beliefs.","Martino, Elio; Fisher, James P; Wink, Brian; Smith, Dave; Steele, James",Research quarterly for exercise and sport,https://doi.org/10.1080/02701367.2020.1752357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633646/,163

We assessed patterns of recently acquired HIV infection in US blood donors, including before and after the implementation of the 12-month deferral for men who have sex with men (MSM). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A large convenience sample of donations from donors testing HIV-1 nucleic acid testing (NAT) and serology-reactive were further tested with the Sedia HIV-1 Limiting Antigen enzyme immunoassay. Samples were analyzed across available demographic and donation data to provide an assessment of recently acquired HIV infection in US blood donors from 2010 to 2018. RESULTS Overall, 317 of 1154 (27.5%; 95% confidence interval, 24.9%-30.1%) donations from HIV NAT and serology-reactive donors had recently acquired HIV infection. There was no evidence of change in the percentages of recent HIV infection by year over the study period, either in all donors or in male donors, including after the MSM policy change. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, donors aged 24 years or younger were over 2.7 times more likely and repeat donors 2.2 times more likely to have recently acquired HIV infection compared to donors aged 55 years or older and first-time donors, respectively. CONCLUSION Patterns of recently acquired HIV infection varied by demographics but not over time. These findings suggest no impact of the MSM policy change on recently acquired HIV infection in US blood donors.","Quiner, Claire; Bruhn, Roberta; Grebe, Eduard; Di Germanio, Clara; Kessler, Debra; Reik, Rita; Williamson, Phillip; Hampton, Dylan; Fayed, Rahima; Anderson, Steve A; Williams, Alan E; Glynn, Simone A; Busch, Michael P; Stramer, Susan L; Custer, Brian",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860262/,163

AIMS The aim of this study is to explore the clinical significance of peripheral blood eosinophil in diagnosing ECRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective study of 221 patients diagnosed with CRS. Lund-Mackay score, peripheral blood eosinophil absolute count, peripheral blood eosinophil percentage were detection to compare the clinical features with ECRS and non-ECRS. ROC curve was performed to assess the efficiency of clinical index to predict ECRS. RESULTS The ECRS group of patients had significantly higher scores compared with those of the non-ECRS group. Different extent and severity of mucosal thickening on total Lund-Mackay scores, anterior ethmoidal, posterior ethmoidal and ostiomeatal complex have confirmed different blood eosinophil levels in CRS patients. The combination of peripheral blood eosinophil percentage and posterior ethmoidal score to predict ECRS was 0.807. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE The increase in peripheral blood eosinophil percent indicates the deterioration the inflammation of chronic rhinosinusitis and the level of posterior ethmoidal score and peripheral blood eosinophil percentage have a positive predictive value regarding ECRS identification.","Feng, Tingting; Li, Ting; Cao, Wanxin; Xu, Ji; Guo, Yanan; Ren, Nana; Liu, Dong; Zhou, Pei; Liu, Bin; Bao, Ximing; Li, Jiping",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016489.2020.1862910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411597/,163
146392,Proteins unbound - how ectomycorrhizal fungi can tap a vast reservoir of mineral-associated organic nitrogen.,2020-07-31,"Chagas disease is a neglected disease that remains a public health threat, particularly in Latin America. The most important treatment options are nitroimidazole derivatives, such as nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). Some studies suggest that for adults seropositive to T. cruzi but without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a simple fixed-dose scheme of BZN could be equivalent to a weight-adjusted dose. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of BZN with an adjusted dose for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We used the Cochrane methods, and reported according to the PRISMA statement. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to fixed and/or adjusted doses of BZN for T. cruzi seropositive adults without CCC. We searched (December 2019) Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and contacted Chagas experts. Selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane tool, were performed independently by pairs of reviewers. Discrepancies were solved by consensus within the team. Primary outcomes were parasite-related outcomes and efficacy or patient-related safety outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software and used GRADE summary of finding tables to present the certainty of evidence by outcome. We identified 655 records through our search strategy and 10 studies (four of them ongoing) met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any study directly comparing fixed vs adjusted doses of BZN, however, some outcomes allowed subgroup comparisons between fixed and adjusted doses of BZN against placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests no important subgroup differences for positive PCR at one year and for three safety outcomes (drug discontinuation, peripheral neuropathy, and mild rash). The same effect was observed for any serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). All subgroups showed similar effects (I2 0% for all these subgroup comparisons but 32% for peripheral neuropathy), supporting the equivalence of BZN schemes. We conclude that there is no direct evidence comparing fixed and adjusted doses of BZN. Based on low to very low certainty of evidence for critical clinical outcomes and moderate certainty of evidence for important outcomes, fixed and adjusted doses may be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. An individual patient data network meta-analysis could better address this issue.","Ciapponi, Agustín; Barreira, Fabiana; Perelli, Lucas; Bardach, Ariel; Gascón, Joaquim; Molina, Israel; Morillo, Carlos; Prado, Nilda; Riarte, Adelina; Torrico, Faustino; Ribeiro, Isabela; Villar, Juan Carlos; Sosa-Estani, Sergio",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804966/,163

The Action Plan is the culmination of effective advocacy by Rare Voices Australia (RVA) and other stakeholders in the rare disease (RD) sector. RVA is the peak body for Australians living with a RD. The organisation works collaboratively with RD organisations, researchers and clinicians. Since the initial call for a RD plan, a number of health-care initiatives and policy changes have gathered apace including expanded antenatal and newborn screening, the increasing application of next generation sequencing and advances in gene and cell therapeutics. The development of new models of care, diagnostic and treatment pathways, and communities of practice have started to ease the considerable burden and inequitable access to care experienced by RD patients and their families. However, much work remains to be done. The Action Plan outlines the actions to bring about the best possible health and well-being outcomes for Australians living with RD. It is centred around three pillars - awareness and education, care and support, research and data - and will be delivered against the principles of person centredness, equity, and sustainable systems and workforce.","Bhattacharya, Kaustuv; Millis, Nicole; Jaffe, Adam; Zurynski, Yvonne",Journal of paediatrics and child health,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861492/,163
147023,A Yersinia pestis tat mutant is attenuated in bubonic and small-aerosol pneumonic challenge models of infection but not as attenuated by intranasal challenge.,2014,"BACKGROUND Bleeding remains a common occurrence in surgery. Data describing the burden of difficult-to-control bleeding and topical absorbable hemostat use are sparse. This study was conducted to estimate the clinical and economic impact that remains associated with uncontrolled surgical bleeding, even when hemostats are used during surgery. METHODS This US retrospective analysis used the Premier Perspectives Database. Hospital discharges from 2012 were used to identify patients treated with hemostats during eight surgery types. Patients were included if they were ≥18 years, had an inpatient hospitalization with one of the eight surgeries, and received a hemostat on the day of surgery. Patients were stratified by procedure and presence or absence of major bleeding (uncontrolled) despite hemostat use. Outcomes were all-cause hospitalization costs, hemostat costs, length of stay, reoperation, and surgery-related complications (eg, mortality). Statistical significance was tested through chi-square or t-tests. Multivariate analyses were conducted for all-cause costs and length of stay using analysis of covariance. RESULTS Among 25,048 procedures, major bleeding events occurred in 14,251 cases. Despite treatment with hemostats, major bleeding occurred in 32%-68% of cases. All-cause costs were significantly higher in patients with uncontrolled bleeding despite hemostat use versus controlled bleeding (US$24,203-$61,323 [uncontrolled], US$14,420-$45,593 [controlled]; P<0.001). Hemostat costs were significantly greater in the uncontrolled bleeding cohort for all surgery types except cystectomy and pancreatic surgery. Reoperation and mortality rates were significantly higher in the uncontrolled bleeding cohort in all surgical procedures except cystectomy and radical hysterectomy. CONCLUSION Uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding despite hemostat use is prevalent and associated with significantly higher hospital costs and worse clinical outcomes across several surgical procedures compared to controlled bleeding. There is an unmet need for newer hemostats that can more effectively control bleeding, improve outcomes, and reduce hospital resource use.","Corral, Mitra; Ferko, Nicole; Hollmann, Sarah; Broder, Michael S; Chang, Eunice",ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s86369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229495/,163

We investigated co-occurring genetic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as predictive markers of clinical response to first-line erlotinib. METHODS Pretreatment plasma samples were collected from 76 patients with EGFR-mutated, advanced-stage NSCLC treated with first-line erlotinib. We isolated ctDNA from plasma for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS Co-occurring oncogenic drivers were detected in 21% of pretreatment samples and correlated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) (6.9 months vs 14.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 2.088; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8119-5.370; P = .0355). Concurrent MET amplification was identified in 9 samples (12%), predicting inferior PFS (5.5 months vs 14.4 months; HR, 4.750; 95% CI, 0.5923-38.10; P = .0007) and overall survival (7.6 months vs 28.3 months; HR, 3.952; 95% CI, 0.8441-18.50; P = .0005). Co-occurring non-MET-amplification oncogenic alterations showed a tendency for shorter PFS (9.9 months vs 14.4 months; HR, 1.199; 95% CI, 0.3373-4.265; P = .7586). Clearing EGFR-mutated ctDNA during erlotinib treatment is a positive predictor of clinical outcomes. Among patients who cleared the EGFR mutation, 12% had a co-occurring oncogenic driver, with a tendency toward inferior PFS (8.7 months vs 16.1 months; HR, 1.703; 95% CI, 0.5347-5.424; P = .2508). CONCLUSION Co-occurring MET amplification in pretreatment ctDNA samples predict inferior clinical response to first-line erlotinib in advanced-stage, EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients.

The effect of older age and comorbidities associated with hip fracture on this increased perioperative risk is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine if there was a difference in hospital mortality among patients who underwent hip fracture surgery relative to an elective THR, after adjustment for age, sex, and preoperative comorbidities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using the French National Hospital Discharge Database from January 2010 to December 2013, patients older than 45 years undergoing hip surgery at French hospitals were included. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), codes were used to determine patients' comorbidities and complications after surgery. A population matched for age, sex, and preoperative comorbidities of patients who underwent elective THR or hip fracture surgery was created using a multivariable logistic model and a greedy matching algorithm with a 1:1 ratio. EXPOSURE Hip fracture. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Postoperative in-hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 690,995 eligible patients were included from 864 centers in France. Patients undergoing elective THR surgery (n = 371,191) were younger, more commonly men, and had less comorbidity compared with patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Following hip fracture surgery (n = 319,804), 10,931 patients (3.42%) died before hospital discharge and 669 patients (0.18%) died after elective THR. Multivariable analysis of the matched populations (n = 234,314) demonstrated a higher risk of mortality (1.82% for hip fracture surgery vs 0.31% for elective THR; absolute risk increase, 1.51% [95% CI, 1.46%-1.55%]; relative risk [RR], 5.88 [95% CI, 5.26-6.58]; P < .001) and of major postoperative complications (5.88% for hip fracture surgery vs 2.34% for elective THR; absolute risk increase, 3.54% [95% CI, 3.50%-3.59%]; RR, 2.50 [95% CI, 2.40-2.62]; P < .001) among patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large cohort of French patients, hip fracture surgery compared with elective THR was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and measured comorbidities.

Telemedicine and digital medicine also offer critically important approaches to improve access, efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical care for people with diabetes. Methods: Two case reports are presented where telemedicine was used effectively and safely after day 1 in person patient education. These aspects of the management of new-onset T1D patients (adult and pediatric) included ongoing diabetes education of the patient and family digitally. The patients used continuous glucose monitoring with commercially available analysis software (Dexcom Clarity and Glooko) to generate ambulatory glucose profiles and interpretive summary reports. The adult subject used multiple daily insulin injections; the pediatric patient used an insulin pump. The subjects were managed using a combination of e-mail, Internet via Zoom, and telephone calls. Results: These two cases show the feasibility and effectiveness of use of telemedicine in applications in which we had not used it previously: new-onset diabetes education and insulin dosage management. Conclusions: The present case reports illustrate how telemedicine can be used safely and effectively for new-onset T1D training and education for both pediatric and adult patients and their families. The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated the expansion of the use of telemedicine and digital medicine. We conclude that telemedicine is an effective approach for the management of patients with new-onset T1D.","Garg, Satish K; Rodbard, David; Hirsch, Irl B; Forlenza, Gregory P",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2020.0161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302499/,163

Further, maxillary expansion has been associated with nasal airway resistance alterations. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between skeletal features and nasal airflow- and olfaction-related problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study included 68 patients (30 boys, 38 girls; mean age 9 ± 2 years) examined at the Ohu University Hospital. We classified patients into three skeletal Classes (Class I, II, and III) based on the ANB angle. Olfactory disorder history was collected from the guardians. Maxillofacial measurements, nasal airflow assessments, and olfactory tests were performed using cephalometric analysis, rhinomanometry, and T&T olfactometer, respectively. RESULTS Malocclusion, resulting from skeletal mandibular protrusion and smaller maxilla, was associated with reduced olfaction in children. The detection and recognition thresholds of skeletal Class III were significantly higher than those of Classes I (p = .01) and II (p = .01). Significant correlations were observed between SNA and the detection threshold (r = -.50) as well as between nasion perpendicular-point A and the recognition threshold (r = -.53). The detection and recognition thresholds were significantly higher in Class III than in Classes I (r = .3) and II (r = -.1). CONCLUSIONS Maxillary growth and development may be associated with olfaction in children. Changing the maxillofacial morphology may improve olfactory function.

148857,Comparison of real-time three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced elliptic centric-ordered MR venography and two-dimensional time-of-flight MR venography of the intracranial venous system.,2010,"INTRODUCTION Ophthalmic simulation is cost-effective in complication prevention. However, there is no consistent resource allocation to provide the necessary time and finance to sustain such activities. We wished to identify the current support for the regional Simulation Leads in the UK. METHODS An online SurveyMonkey questionnaire was sent to all 26 UK ophthalmic regional Simulation Leads in February 2021 regarding current simulation activity and the degree of time and resource support available. RESULTS There were 22 responses within 1 month (84.6% response rate). 72.7% run regular simulation induction events for new trainees. 60% run mandatory laser simulation events. 38.1% run immersive simulation (vitreous loss fire drill). 47.6% run yearly sub-specialty events. 45.5% were required to make additional work arrangements to run simulation events. 77.3% had no job plan time allocation for simulation. 59.1% dedicated >1 hr/week to simulation. 68.2% EYESI simulators were purchased via charity/endowments. 72.7% had access to dedicated dry lab simulation (40.9% wet lab). 40.9% used deanery funds to purchase initial model eyes (supplemented by charity (36.4%) and endowments (31.8%)). 65% used unspent study leave budgets for ongoing model eyes, yet 15% reported trainees purchasing their own. CONCLUSION Nearly all ophthalmic simulation in the UK is undertaken via goodwill and personal commitment to excellence by the regional Simulation Leads. There is minimal allowance of time or finance for these vital activities, which is sporadic at best, and unsustainable. We call for the necessary investment and dedicated time allocation to permit ophthalmic simulation to be supported and maintained.","Lockington, David; Saleh, George M; Spencer, Anne Fiona; Ferris, John",Eye,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-021-01796-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616004/,163

However, the mechanism by which CD133+ HPCs affect the malignancy of human breast cancer has not been reported. METHODS CD133+ HPCs were isolated and purified from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). We used in vitro culture of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice to evaluate whether CD133+ HPCs affected the apoptosis, proliferation, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT of breast cancer cells. RESULTS Co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, but not UCB CD133- cells, promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied by reducing in vitro spontaneous apoptosis. Co-administration of these two lines with CD133+ HPCs significantly enhanced the growth of implanted breast cancer in vivo. Furthermore, co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, enhanced the invasion of breast cancer cells, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but reduced E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that CD133+ HPCs enhance the malignancy of breast cancer cells by attenuating spontaneous apoptosis and promoting the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition. These findings may provide new insights into the role of human CD133+ HPCs in breast cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, CD133+ HPCs may be a new therapeutic target for inhibiting the progression of breast cancer.","Zhang, Zhe; Zheng, Qinglian; Liu, Yonghui; Sun, Lianqing; Han, Pingping; Wang, Rui; Zhao, Jiao; Hu, Shan; Zhao, Xinhan",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07633-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243165/,163

This introduction to the September 2020 supplement to Academic Medicine provides an overview of the collection, with 145 out of 171 eligible medical schools participating in the project. The authors observe trends and similarities across the reports from participating schools, structuring the introduction to mirror the main questions posed to the schools: highlights of each school's medical education program, curriculum description, curricular governance, education staff, faculty development and support in medical education, regional medical campuses, and initiatives in progress. Key findings from the authors include expansion of student enrichment tracks, early clinical encounters, focus on wellness, expansion in competency-based medical education, and continued evolution of approaches to assessment. The authors note that this supplement was produced before COVID-19, and although it robustly chronicles the prepandemic state of medical education, medical education has already evolved and will continue to do so.

Geospatially distributed diagnostics with minimal uncertainty facilitate efficient point-of-need strategies. OBJECTIVES To use original mathematics to interpret COVID-19 test metrics; assess Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorizations and Health Canada targets; compare predictive values for multiplex, antigen, polymerase chain reaction kit, point-of-care antibody, and home tests; enhance test performance; and improve decision-making. DESIGN PubMed/newsprint generated articles documenting prevalence. Mathematica and open access software helped perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize performance by comparing predictive value geometric mean-squared patterns. RESULTS Tiered sensitivity/specificity comprise: T1) 90%, 95%; T2) 95%, 97.5%; and T3) 100%, ≥99%. Tier 1 false negatives exceed true negatives at >90.5% prevalence; false positives exceeded true positives at <5.3% prevalence. High sensitivity/specificity tests reduce false negatives and false positives yielding superior predictive values. Recursive testing improves predictive values. Visual logistics facilitate test comparisons. Antigen test quality falls off as prevalence increases. Multiplex severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2)*Influenza A/B*Respiratory-Syncytial Virus (RSV) testing performs reasonably well compared to Tier 3. Tier 3 performance with a Tier 2 confidence band lower limit will generate excellent performance and reliability. CONCLUSIONS The overriding principle is select the best combined performance and reliability pattern for the prevalence bracket. Some public health professionals recommend repetitive testing to compensate for low sensitivity. More logically, improved COVID-19 assays with less uncertainty conserve resources. Multiplex differentiation of COVID-19 from Influenza A/B-RSV represents an effective strategy if seasonal flu surges next year.","Kost, Gerald J",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0716-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684204/,163

Like many bacterial infections, antigen-specific antibody responses have been traditionally considered critical, if not solely responsible, for vaccine-induced protection against Y. pestis. Studies in recent years have suggested the importance of T cell immune responses against Y. pestis infection but information is still limited about the details of Y. pestis antigen-specific T cell immune responses. In current report, studies are conducted to identify the presence of CD8+ T cell epitopes in LcrV protein, the leading antigen of plague vaccine development. Furthermore, depletion of CD8+ T cells in LcrV DNA vaccinated Balb/C mice led to reduced protection against lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis. These findings establish that an LcrV DNA vaccine is able to elicit CD8+ T cell immune responses against specific epitopes of this key plague antigen and that a CD8+ T cell immune response is involved in LcrV DNA vaccine-elicited protection. Future studies in plague vaccine development will need to examine if the presence of detectable T cell immune responses, in particular CD8+ T-cell immune responses, will enhance the protection against Y. pestis in higher animal species or humans.","Wang, Shixia; Goguen, Jon D; Li, Fusheng; Lu, Shan",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.12.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21199697/,163

Little is known about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity and neutralization antibody response in COVID-19 patients. Two groups of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study, including 12 severe patients in ICUs who needed mechanical ventilation and 11 mild patients in isolation wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory detection. Results showed that most of the severe patients had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20~40 days post onset of disease (8/12, 66.7%); while the majority of mild patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract and had no detectable virus RNA after 10 days post-onset (9/11, 81.8%). Mild patients showed significantly lower IgM response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses were detected in most patients in both severe and mild groups at 9 days post onset and remained high level throughout the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected in COVID-19 patients but not in MERS patients. High-levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after about 10 days post onset in both severe and mild patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization test with authentic virus showed consistent results. Sera from COVID-19 patients, but not convalescent SARS and MERS patients inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and N IgG level exhibited moderate correlation with neutralization titers in patients' plasma.

150816,Plant multiscale networks: charting plant connectivity by multi-level analysis and imaging techniques.,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND The progressive disease trajectory makes people with dementia increasingly vulnerable and gradually more dependent on others which can lead to admission to a nursing home. Special interest in dignity in people with dementia has led to a growing body of knowledge towards promoting or hindering their dignity. AIM The aim of this narrative review was to synthesise dignifying and undignifying aspects of formal and informal care for people with dementia within nursing homes. METHOD The electronic databases CINAHL, SCOPUS, PSycInfo and PubMed were systematically searched with the terms 'dementia' and 'dignity', complemented with the use of snowballing and reference check. A total of 789 unique items were found. The search and selection process was structured by the PRISMA framework, and both authors formulated the criteria of eligibility. A methodological check was performed using the critical appraisal tool of Hawker. This process led to inclusion of 29 articles which were reviewed with the help of the guidelines for narrative synthesis by Popay et al. FINDINGS: The emerged dignifying and undignifying aspects of formal and informal care are characterised by either a successful or unsuccessful process of adjustment towards changing abilities, preferences and care needs of people with dementia. Three themes appeared as undignifying aspects of care: 'Stigmatisation and objectivation', 'Scarcity and hastiness' and 'Impending estrangement and misunderstanding'. Four themes were identified as dignifying aspect of care: 'Personalisation', 'Respect, attentiveness and encouragement', 'Attention for physical care and bodily gestures', and 'Foster belonging'. Literature synthesis showed mostly relational aspects of care concerning dignity in people with dementia. Formal and informal caregivers are important in maintaining and promoting their dignity.","van der Geugten, Wendy; Goossensen, Anne",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/scs.12791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31750569/,163
151075,Fresh approaches to vaccine development: New financial and economic models are required to bring more vaccines against a wider range of diseases to the market.,2018,"Purpose: This study aimed to describe cerebral Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) profiles during neonatal intubation using two different premedication regimens. Methods: Neonates requiring non-emergency intubation were enrolled in an ancillary study, conducted in two French Neonatal Intensive Care Units participating in a larger on-going multicenter, double blind, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to the ""atropine-propofol"" (Prop) group or the ""atropine-atracurium-sufentanil"" (SufTrac) group. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), pulse oxymetry (SpO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), and transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPCO2) were collected at 9 predefined time points from 1 min before to 60 min after the first drug injection. The two primary outcomes were a decrease in rScO2 value >20% from baseline and a decrease in fractional cerebral tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) value >10% from baseline, at any time point. Secondary outcomes included physiological parameters changes over time and correlations between mean arterial blood pressure, and FTOE at different time points. Descriptive results were obtained and exploratory statistical analyses were performed for 24 included patients. Results: rScO2 decreased in 5/11 (46%) infants from the Prop group and 10/13 (77%) from the SufTrac group (p = 0.11); FTOE decreased in 10/11 (91%) infants from the Prop group, and 12/13 (92%) from the SufTrac group (p = 0.90). rScO2 values decreased over time in both groups, whereas FTOE's pattern appeared more stable. SpO2 and transcutaneous TcPCO2 seemed more preserved in the Prop group while MABP seemed more preserved in the SufTrac group. No important correlation was observed between MABP and FTOE (r = 0.08 to 0.12 across the time points). Conclusion: Our results suggest a frequent decrease in cerebral oxygenation without obvious impairment in cerebral autoregulation during neonatal intubation with premedication.

151219,A new technique for accelerated liver regeneration: An experimental study in rats.,2017,"In an era of Freddie Gray and Black Lives Matter, a long history of structural racism, combined with disproportionate rates of COVID-19, the African American community has seen a lot of reasons to demand social justice, equal treatment and immediate access to solutions to health disparities. Despite the promise of COVID-19 vaccines, the community is highly distrustful of the vaccine and institutions given a history of mistreatment and many other current concerns. Trusted messengers such as Black pastors are crucial to protecting the community that faces a disproportionate amount of disease. We present a framework to build trust and acceptance including understanding history and context; listening and empathy; engaging pastors as trusted messengers; creating partnerships with shared responsibility and power; and co-creation of solutions with faith leaders and their community, governments and institutions to create sustainable, long-term change. Efforts to support vaccine acceptance must be customized to the variety of needs and realities of the African American community, not just the topic of concern to the institution. Evaluations are needed to help ensure the community is engaged and feeling heard. Pastors and other religious leaders can work with government and institutions to bring information, facilitate discussion, build trust and develop measurable improvement efforts. Although acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines may not be achieved overnight, the process of focusing on issues that are important to the community is an important step in laying the foundation for both COVID-19 vaccines and future interventions.","Privor-Dumm, Lois; King, Terris",Journal of health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2021.1873463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719889/,163
151250,Quality fluctuation detection of an herbal injection based on biological fingerprint combined with chemical fingerprint.,2014,"INTRODUCTION This report reviews the clinical and functional outcomes of implanted meshes during a second-look evaluation of 85 cases after a large number (733) of laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repairs (LIVHR), of which 608 were controlled throughout a period of 5 to 10 years. This report demonstrates a minimal occurrence of adhesions and a low rate of recurrences and other complications related to mesh usage. METHODS Eighty-five re-operated cases after LIVHR were reviewed retrospectively. In every redo surgery, the first trocar was always inserted on a lateral side, external to the previous skin incisions of the transabdominal fixations. Mueller's adhesion scale was used to estimate adhesion severity (Mueller 0 indicates no adhesion; Mueller I indicates adhesion of the omentum; and Mueller II indicates serosal adhesions). The mechanism of recurrence is of paramount interest and is analyzed herein. If recurrence was observed, the defect was closed and a larger mesh of Parietex was implanted under the previous one, with transparietal fixation achieved by pulling the threads with the Endoclose device. RESULTS In all of our ""second-look"" surgeries, the neoperitoneum perfectly covered the mesh. In 47.05% of the cases, we observed no adhesions (Mueller 0), 42.3% had adhesions of the omentum (Mueller I), and 10.58% had serosal adhesions (Mueller II). There was no shrinking or wrinkling of the prosthesis in any of the cases, confirming its total peritonization on the anterior abdominal wall. Within the first 3 years, only 4.1% of the controlled patients contracted recurrences, with a mean follow-up of 52 months. CONCLUSION With the double-suturing technique used for LIVHR and the use of a composite mesh, we observed a low rate of recurrences and limited side effects as compared with the use of tacks intra-abdominally. Redo surgeries after LIVHR are feasible, but care must be taken due to unpredictable mesh adhesions.","Chelala, E; Debardemaeker, Y; Elias, B; Charara, F; Dessily, M; Allé, J-L",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0637-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155431/,163
151457,Animal board invited review: OneARK: Strengthening the links between animal production science and animal ecology.,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND Flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) is a new ventilation mode that provides constant inspiratory and expiratory flow. FCV was shown to improve gas exchange and lung recruitment in porcine models of healthy and injured ventilated lungs. The primary aim of our study was to verify the influences of FCV on gas exchange, respiratory mechanics and haemodynamic variables in mechanically ventilated lung-healthy patients. METHODS After obtaining ethical approval and informed consent, we measured arterial blood gases, respiratory and haemodynamic variables during volume-controlled (VCV) and flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) in 20 consecutive patients before they underwent abdominal surgery. After baseline (BL) ventilation, patients were randomly assigned to either BL-VCV-FCV or BL-FCV-VCV. Thereby, BL ventilation settings were kept, except for the ventilation mode related differences (FCV is supposed to be used with an I:E ratio of 1:1). RESULTS Compared to BL and VCV, PaO2 was higher [PaO2 : FCV: 38.2 (7.1), BL ventilation: 35.0 (5.8), VCV: 35.2 (7.0) kPa, p <0.001] and PaCO2 lower [PaCO2 : FCV: 4.8 (0.5), BL ventilation: 5.1 (0.5), VCV: 5.1 (0.5) kPa, p <0.001)] during FCV. With comparable plateau pressure [BL: 14.9 (1.9), VCV: 15.3 (1.6), FCV: 15.2 (1.5) cm H2 O), p = 0.185], tracheal mean pressure was higher during FCV [(BL: 10.2 (1.1), VCV: 10.4 (0.7), FCV: 11.5 (1.0) cm H2 O, p <0.001)]. Haemodynamic variables did not differ between ventilation phases. CONCLUSION FCV improves oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination within a short time, compared to VCV with identical tidal volume, inspiratory plateau pressure and end-expiratory pressure.","Weber, Jonas; Schmidt, Johannes; Straka, Leonie; Wirth, Steffen; Schumann, Stefan",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828755/,163

A prospective ES scale has the purpose to estimate at which level of supervision a student will be ready to perform an activity in subsequent encounters. METHODS We studied the transition to prospective assessment of medical students in clerkships via semi-structured interviews with twelve purposefully sampled clinical teachers, shortly after the introduction of a new undergraduate EPA-based curriculum and EPA-based assessment employing a prospective ES scale. RESULTS While some clinical teachers showed a correct interpretation, rating strategies also appeared to be affected by the target supervision level for completion of the clerkship. Instructions to estimate readiness for a supervision level in the future were not always understood. Further, teachers' interpretation of the scale anchors relied heavily on the phrasing. DISCUSSION Prospective assessment asks clinical teachers to make an extra inference step in their judgement process from reporting observed performance to estimating future level of supervision. This requires a change in mindset when coming from a retrospective, performance-oriented assessment method, i.e., reporting what was observed. Our findings suggest optimizing the ES-scale wordings and improving faculty development.","Postmes, Lieselotte; Tammer, Femke; Posthumus, Indra; Wijnen-Meijer, Marjo; van der Schaaf, Marieke; Ten Cate, Olle",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1853688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305676/,163

This study evaluated the effects of tofogliflozin on the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) without a history of apparent cardiovascular disease. METHODS The using tofogliflozin for possible better intervention against atherosclerosis for type 2 diabetes patients (UTOPIA) trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, comparative study. As one of the prespecified secondary outcomes, changes in baPWV over 104 weeks were evaluated in 154 individuals (80 in the tofogliflozin group and 74 in the conventional treatment group) who completed baPWV measurement at baseline. RESULTS In a mixed-effects model, the progression in the right, left, and mean baPWV over 104 weeks was significantly attenuated with tofogliflozin compared to that with conventional treatment (- 109.3 [- 184.3, - 34.3] (mean change [95% CI] cm/s, p = 0.005; - 98.3 [- 172.6, - 24.1] cm/s, p = 0.010; - 104.7 [- 177.0, - 32.4] cm/s, p = 0.005, respectively). Similar findings were obtained even after adjusting the mixed-effects models for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hypertension, smoking, and/or administration of drugs, including hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, statins, and anti-platelets, at baseline. The findings of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models, which included the treatment group, baseline baPWV, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, resembled those generated by the mixed-effects models.

152197,Long-term results after laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux procedures (Br J Surg 2011; 98: 1581-1587).,2011,"Background During epidemics and pandemics, health systems, and especially hospitals, face many challenges in the management of patients and staff. Hospital preparedness measures are critical for hospitals to respond effectively to the admission and management of COVID-19 patients. Ministry of health policy for pandemics must cover the ability of hospitals to respond to COVID-19. Aims The aim of this study was to develop a checklist for evaluating the preparedness of hospitals to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We searched for and reviewed available evidence, including the literature and guidelines presented by related organizations. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, face-to-face interview was not possible so we used telephone and video connections, mobile applications and email for unstructured interviews. Checklist development was carried out by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. Results After applying the opinions of the experts, the final checklist had 2 main domains: measures at national and measures at hospital level. Preparedness at national level was categorized into 3 aspects that are implemented by the health ministry. Preparedness at hospital level was categorized in 24 subgroups. Conclusion Hospital preparedness for admission and management of COVID-19 patients is essential. A checklist for the assessment of hospital preparedness for COVID-19 patient management and hospital management was designed and developed. Our preparedness assessment checklist is an expanded tool that provides clear and practical guidance that can be adapted for any hospital admitting COVID-19 patients.","Seyedin, Hesam; Moslehi, Shandiz; Sakhaei, Fazeleh; Dowlati, Mohsen",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://doi.org/10.26719/2021.27.2.131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665797/,163

Studies have shown that further reinforcement of the abdominal wall using a mesh may decrease the complication rate.The current study included 40 consecutive patients having unilateral breast reconstruction with the pedicled transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous flap. The defect in the abdominal fascia was closed primarily and further reinforced using a Prolene mesh (Ethicon), n = 20, or using a self-fixating Parietex ProGrip mesh (Covidien), n = 20. The patients were examined at an outpatient consultation, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year and questioned about donor-site symptoms using a standardized questionnaire.Of the 20 patients in the Prolene group, 2 (10%) developed abdominal wall bulging, and of the 20 patients in the ProGrip group, 11 (55%) developed abdominal wall bulging (P = 0.006). In both the Prolene and the ProGrip group, most patients reported having continued donor-site symptoms at the time of the follow-up (70% and 80%, respectively); 15% and 30%, respectively, reported having symptoms that influenced their daily or physical activities (not a significant difference). All but 1 patient in our study reported being very happy with the reconstruction and would have done it again, had they known what they did at the time of the follow-up.We conclude that the self-gripping properties of the Parietex ProGrip mesh are not sufficient in withstanding the abdominal wall tension at the donor site after transverse rectus abdominus musculocutaneous-flap harvest and do not recommend using the Parietex ProGrip mesh without fixating sutures for this procedure.","Sværdborg, Mille; Damsgaard, Tine Engberg",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e318255a293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23392261/,163

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser and diode laser in the reduction of the turbinate size. Methods This randomized controlled trial included 209 patients with ITH. Pre-operative symptoms were assessed based on the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy was done to rule out other nasal sinuses. Nasal mucociliary clearance was measured by saccharin transit time (STT). Postoperatively, the NOSE score, STT and complications were assessed at days one and two, at one week, one month and three months. Results Of the 209 patients analyzed at day one, the median NOSE score was 50 in the diode group and 40 in the KTP group, and at three months, 15 in the diode group and five in the KTP group. KTP laser showed a 93 per cent improvement in the NOSE score as compared to 77 per cent improvement shown by diode laser group. Among the intra-operative complications, of the 104 patients in the diode group, 6.73 per cent had burning sensation and 91.43 per cent had bleeding, and of 105 patients in the KTP group, 54.29 per cent had burning sensation and 36.54 per cent had bleeding. Among the post-operative complications in the KTP group, 32 and 34 per cent had bloody nasal discharge on days one and two, compared to 12 and 14 per cent in diode group. Crusting was present in 61 and 49 per cent on days one and two in KTP group as compared to 9 and 15 per cent in diode group, respectively. In the KTP group 30 per cent had synechiae as compared to 10 per cent in diode group. Interpretation & conclusions KTP laser was more efficacious than diode laser in improving the NOSE scores but with slightly increased rate of complications in early post-operative period. Both the lasers impaired the mucociliary clearance mechanism of the nose till three months of post-operative follow up.","Ravichandran, Subhashini Puducherry; Ramasamy, Karthikeyan; Parida, Pradipta Kumar; Alexander, Arun; Ganesan, Sivaraman; Saxena, Sunil Kumar",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_424_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719231/,163
153311,"Comment on ""Aerosol Filtration Efficiency of Common Fabrics Used in Respiratory Cloth Masks"".",2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND Breathlessness is the prominent symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite optimal therapeutic management including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, many COPD patients exhibit significant breathlessness. Chronic breathlessness is defined as breathlessness that persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying disease. Because of the major disability related to chronic breathlessness, symptomatic treatments including opioids have been recommended by several authors. The prevalence of chronic breathlessness in COPD and its management in routine clinical practice have been poorly investigated. Our aim was to examine prevalence, associated characteristics and management of chronic breathlessness in patients with COPD recruited in a real-life tertiary hospital-based cohort. METHODS A prospective study was conducted among 120 consecutive COPD patients recruited, in stable condition, at Nancy University Hospital, France. In parallel, 88 pulmonologists of the same geographical region were asked to respond to an on-line questionnaire on breathlessness management. RESULTS Sixty four (53%) patients had severe breathlessness (modified Medical Research Council scale≥3), despite optimal inhaled medications for 94% of them; 40% had undergone pulmonary rehabilitation within the past 2 years. The severity of breathlessness increased with increasing airflow limitation. Breathlessness was associated with increased symptoms of anxiety, depression and with osteoporosis. No relation was found with other symptoms, exacerbation rate, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Among the patients with chronic breathlessness and Hospitalized Anxiety and/or Depression score > 10, only 25% were treated with antidepressant or anxiolytic. Among the pulmonologists 46 (52%) answered to the questionnaire and expressed a high willingness to prescribe opioids forchronic breathlessness, which contrasted with the finding that none of these patients received such treatments against breathlessness. CONCLUSION Treatment approaches to breathlessness and associated psychological distress are insufficient in COPD. This study highlights underuse of pulmonary rehabilitation and symptomatic treatment for breathlessness.","Carette, H; Zysman, M; Morelot-Panzini, C; Perrin, J; Gomez, E; Guillaumot, A; Burgel, P R; Deslee, G; Surpas, P; Le Rouzic, O; Perez, T; Chaouat, A; Roche, N; Chabot, F",BMC pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-019-0851-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096982/,163

Mechanisms underlying RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants are largely unknown. Sterile intraamniotic inflammation and chorioamnionitis have been associated with increased lung volume and compliance. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine whether high amniotic fluid interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-α protect against RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants. METHODS We conducted a prospective birth cohort study of healthy term newborns, born after uncomplicated pregnancy. Amniotic fluid was collected during labor. In case of medical attention for respiratory symptoms during the first year of life, a nose-throat swab was taken to establish the presence of respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Physician-attended RSV infection was observed in 27 (9.3%) of 292 children at median age 6 months. Amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-8 were higher in children without physician-attended RSV infection than in children with physician-attended RSV infection (11.1 versus 5.5 ng/mL; P = 0.002). Similarly, in children without physician-attended RSV, the proportion of detectable amniotic fluid tumor necrosis factor-α was higher (159/265 [60%] versus 8/27 [30%]; P = 0.002). Among children with physician-attended RSV infection, amniotic fluid IL-8 was inversely correlated to the number of wheezing days during the first year of life (ρ = -0.38; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS High concentrations of amniotic fluid IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α are associated with low risk of RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants. We hypothesize that direct exposure of fetal lungs to proinflammatory signals induces local protection against viral infection during infancy.","Houben, Michiel L; Rovers, Maroeska M; Wilbrink, Berry; Belderbos, Mirjam E; Bloemen-Carlier, Eltje M; Visser, Gerard H A; Kimpen, Jan L L; Bont, Louis",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31826366e3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699404/,163

Here, we report on the design of a pocket-specific D-peptide, PIE12-trimer, that is extraordinarily elusive to resistance and characterize its inhibitory and structural properties. D-peptides (peptides composed of D-amino acids) are promising therapeutic agents due to their insensitivity to protease degradation. PIE12-trimer was designed using structure-guided mirror-image phage display and linker optimization and is the first D-peptide HIV entry inhibitor with the breadth and potency required for clinical use. PIE12-trimer has an ultrahigh affinity for the gp41 pocket, providing it with a reserve of binding energy (resistance capacitor) that yields a dramatically improved resistance profile compared to those of other fusion inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the gp41 pocket is an ideal drug target and establish PIE12-trimer as a leading anti-HIV antiviral candidate.","Welch, Brett D; Francis, J Nicholas; Redman, Joseph S; Paul, Suparna; Weinstock, Matthew T; Reeves, Jacqueline D; Lie, Yolanda S; Whitby, Frank G; Eckert, Debra M; Hill, Christopher P; Root, Michael J; Kay, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01339-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20719956/,163

We construct stories to weave meanings that help us make sense of our lifeworlds. Like stories, rumors and conspiracy theories can offer deep meanings when analyzed in specific contexts. Such narratives become most prominent in times of looming uncertainties, anxieties, and fears. Thus, the challenging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become surrounded by plentiful rumors and conspiracy theories. These narratives reveal geopolitics when they code the pandemic as ""bioengineered."" They also demonstrate local concerns, as in Pakistan, people started drinking ""miraculous"" tea as a form of prevention, shaving their heads, and/or praying to God to undo his ""punishment."" Some conceptualized the pandemic as an invented ""plot."" These narratives seem to empower individuals to make sense of this pandemic and to deal with its multidimensional effects: they allow them to feel confident enough to go outside and earn their livelihood. In this chapter, the author builds on his long-term ethnographic fieldwork on infectious diseases, recent telephone interviews, and content analysis of the media to discuss narratives revolving around COVID-19 in Pakistan. The author argues that these rumors and conspiracy theories are social phenomena pregnant with multiple meanings that deserve to be thoroughly explored, especially by anthropologists. A dearth of understanding about COVID-19 and narratives surrounding it would substantially impede the strategies to deal with this ongoing pandemic.","Ali, Inayat",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973205/,163

METHODS Patients with HCC between 3 and 5 cm treated with TACE monotherapy or combination TACE + MWA at a single institution between 2007 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-four HCCs (median diameter 3.8 cm) in 16 patients (13 males; median age 64 years) were treated using TACE monotherapy. Combination TACE + MWA was used to treat 23 HCCs (median diameter 4.2 cm) in 22 patients (18 males; median age 61 years). Microwave ablation was performed at a target time of two weeks following TACE. Individual tumors were followed by serial contrast-enhanced CT or MR. Response to treatment was evaluated on a tumor-by-tumor basis using mRECIST criteria with the primary outcome being local tumor progression (LTP). Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Time to LTP was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Relative to TACE monotherapy, TACE + MWA provided a trend toward both a lower rate of LTP (34.8% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.11) and a higher complete response rate (65.2% vs. 37.5%; p = 0.12). Time to LTP (22.3 months vs. 4.2 months; p = 0.001) was significantly longer in the TACE + MWA group compared to TACE monotherapy.

This article reports on the commissioning and delivery of a problem gambling treatment service in a metropolitan area in England, where the concentration of problem gambling is often higher than the national average. STUDY DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study, using purposively sampled 'experts' and stakeholders involved in the conception and set-up of the service. METHODS Individual semistructured interviews were used to ascertain the depth of information required to fully appreciate the nuances and complexities of the service. Eight participants took part in the interviews, with an additional respondent providing written comments in relation to the interview schedule as a workaround to accommodate the organisational impacts of COVID-19. RESULTS The article identifies several factors contributing to the successful delivery of the service. Well-managed collaborative provision with expertise from across sectors is critical, but this needs to be balanced against the challenges faced by bridging cultural variances in practice and language. Adopting evidence-based models of delivery was central to practice, and moreover, geographical location is a key consideration to encourage access for those facing gambling problems and discourage feelings of stigma. CONCLUSIONS This article offers a unique contribution to understanding more about the provision of gambling treatment services. This is crucial, given that a greater number of people face challenges as a consequence of gambling harms, and such services should be seen part of forming a coherent public health response.","Woodall, J; Freeman, C",Public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157455/,163

OBJECTIVE To understand the occurrence and clinical expression of side-branch remodeling in distal intracranial arterial sites after flow diverter deployment by means of correlation of imaging and clinical data. METHODS We analyzed our prospectively collected data on a series of patients treated with flow diverters for intracranial aneurysms at bifurcation sites. From February 2011 to May 2013, 32 patients with 37 aneurysms (anterior communicating artery, 9 [24.3%]; anterior cerebral artery, 5 [13.5%]; middle cerebral artery, 19 (51.4%); terminal internal carotid artery, 4 [10.8%]) were treated. We divided aneurysms into 2 groups based on the side branches covered by the stent during treatment. Group A consisted of cases with side branches that supplied brain territories also receiving a direct collateral supply. Group B consisted of cases in which side branches supplied territories without direct collateral supply. The 2 groups were compared statistically. RESULTS Total exclusion occurred in 97.3% of aneurysms at follow-up. Initial modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 0 to 1 for 29 patients (90.6%) and 2 for 3 patients (9.4%). New permanent neurological deficit was reported in 3 patients (9.4%). At the 6-month follow-up, the mRS score was 0 to 1 for 31 patients (96.8%) and 3 for 1 patient (3.2%). Although 78.5% of side branches in group A underwent narrowing or occlusion after 6 months, no new stroke was found on magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION Symptomatic modifications of side branches after flow diverter treatment depend on the extent and type of collateral supply.","Saleme, Suzana; Iosif, Christina; Ponomarjova, Sanita; Mendes, George; Camilleri, Yann; Caire, François; Boncoeur, Marie-Paule; Mounayer, Charbel",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121791/,163

Frame-shifting insertions and deletions (indels) may also participate in adaptation through gene disruption, which could be reversed by secondary introduction of a frame-restoring indel. We present ScarTrek, a program that scans genomic data for indels, including those that together disrupt and restore a gene's reading frame, producing ""frame-shift scars"" suggestive of reversible gene inactivation. We use ScarTrek to analyze 5977 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. We show that indel frequency inversely correlates with genomic linguistic complexity and varies with gene-position and gene-essentiality. Using ScarTrek, we detect 74 unique frame-shift scars in 48 genes, with a 3.74% population-level incidence of unique scar events. We find multiple scars in the ESX-1 gene cluster. Six scars show evidence of convergent evolution while the rest shared a common ancestor.

Inflammation is associated with numerous fibrotic pathogeneses; however, its role in the multifaceted mechanisms of fibrosis remains unclear. IL-13 is implicated in aberrant responses involved in fibrotic disease, and we aimed to understand its role in the inflammatory processes of a common fibrotic disorder, Dupuytren's disease. We demonstrated T-cells produced IFN-g, which induced IL-13 secretion from mast cells and up-regulated IL-13Ra1 on fibroblasts, rendering them more reactive to IL-13. Consequently, diseased myofibroblasts demonstrated enhanced fibroproliferative effects upon IL-13 stimulation. We established IFN-g and IL-13 responses involved STAT dependent pathways, and STAT targeting (tofacitinib) could inhibit IL-13 production from mast cells, IL-13Ra1 up-regulation in fibroblasts and fibroproliferative effects of IL-13 on diseased myofibroblasts.

157549,Antibiotic potentiation of natural products: A promising target to fight pathogenic bacteria.,2020-09-24,"Induction of type I IFNs during viral infection is crucial for host defense. IRF 3 and IRF7 play a critical role as key transcription factors in the activation of the IFN induction. Viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to evade innate immunity. Our previous studies have shown that the nonstructural protein (NSs) of the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) can suppress the IFN-β induction through its interaction with tank-binding kinase-1 and sequestering the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase(IKK) complex into the inclusion bodies formed by NSs. In this study, we characterized the unique function of IRF7 in innate immunity and its role in inducing IFN-α in particular, regulated by NSs during the SFTSV infection in several cell types of human origin. Whereas IRF3 is constitutively expressed, IRF7 was significantly induced differentially in various cell types in response to SFTSV infection, promoted the induction of IFN-α2 and -α4, and further induced IFN-β, thus contributing to suppressing the viral replication. Our data indicate that NSs directly interacted with and sequestered IRF7 into the inclusion bodies, which is different from IRF3 indirectly interacting with NSs. Although interaction of NSs with IRF7 did not inhibit IRF7 phosphorylation, p-IRF7 was trapped in the inclusion bodies, resulting in a significant reduction of the IFN-α2 and -α4 induction and therefore enhanced viral replication. Interaction of the viral NSs with both IRF7 and IRF3 and subsequent sequestration of these transcription factors into viral inclusion bodies, a unique strategy used by this phlebovirus, may ensure effective evasion and suppression of host innate immunity.","Hong, Ye; Bai, Maosheng; Qi, Xian; Li, Chuan; Liang, Mifang; Li, Dexin; Cardona, Carol J; Xing, Zheng",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1800576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30598516/,163

METHODS This project involved 3 cognitive interviewing studies. In Study 1, a group of patients with chronic pain (N=20) were asked a series of questions regarding the PQAS's understandability, and invited to make suggestions regarding how the measure could be improved. In Study 2, a second group of patients (N=21) responded to questions about a modified version of the PQAS. The PQAS was further modified on the basis of the findings of Study 2, and in Study 3 the participants were asked to indicate whether the changes made improved the understandability of the PQAS further. RESULTS The participants in Studies 1 and 2 identified portions of the PQAS instructions and some of the PQAS items that could be modified to increase their understandability. Modifications resulted in a revised PQAS that was deemed by patients with chronic pain to be more understandable than the original PQAS by the majority of participants. DISCUSSION testing can be used to improve the understandability of pain measures. The results of cognitive testing with the PQAS indicated that much of the content of the original instructions and items were understandable as written, but that minor changes could be made to make them even clearer to patients with chronic pain. The changes made resulted in a revised PQAS that is more understandable and may therefore be even more useful than with the original PQAS.","Jensen, Mark P; Lin, Chen-Ping; Kupper, Amy E; Galer, Bradley S; Gammaitoni, Arnold R",The Clinical journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/ajp.0b013e318260857d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247001/,163

158989,Mechanical suture in rectal cancer.,2017,"BACKGROUND Insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) have been shown to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) at a higher rate than routine monitoring methods in patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, it is unknown whether there are topographic patterns of brain infarction in patients with CS that are particularly associated with underlying AF. If such patterns exist, these could be used to help decide whether or not CS patients would benefit from long-term monitoring with an ICM. METHODS In this retrospective analysis, a neuro-radiologist blinded to clinical details reviewed brain images from 212 patients with CS who were enrolled in the ICM arm of the CRYptogenic STroke And underLying AF (CRYSTAL AF) trial. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe rates of AF detection at 12 months in patients with and without pre-specified imaging characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS We did not find any pattern of acute brain infarction that was significantly associated with AF detection after CS. However, the presence of chronic brain infarctions (15.8 vs. 7.0%, HR 2.84, 95% CI 1.13-7.15, p = 0.02) or leukoaraiosis (18.2 vs. 7.9%, HR 2.94, 95% CI 1.28-6.71, p < 0.01) was associated with AF detection. There was a borderline significant association of AF detection with the presence of chronic territorial (defined as within the territory of a first or second degree branch of the circle of Willis) infarcts (20.9 vs. 10.0%, HR 2.37, 95% CI 0.98-5.72, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence for an association between brain infarction pattern and AF detection using an ICM in patients with CS, although patients with coexisting chronic, as well as acute, brain infarcts had a higher rate of AF detection. Acute brain infarction topography does not reliably predict or exclude detection of underlying AF in patients with CS and should not be used to select patients for ICM after cryptogenic stroke.","Bernstein, Richard A; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Rymer, Marilyn M; Passman, Rod S; Brachmann, Johannes; Morillo, Carlos A; Sanna, Tommaso; Thijs, Vincent; Rogers, Tyson; Liu, Shufeng; Ziegler, Paul D; Diener, Hans-Christoph",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000437018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26182860/,163

This study aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the research trends on coronaviruses using bibliometric analysis to identify new prevention strategies. Methods All relevant publications on coronaviruses were extracted from 2000-2020 from the Web of Science database. An online analysis platform of literature metrology, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder (BICOMB) and CiteSpace software were used to analyse the publication trends. VOSviewer was used to analyse the keywords and research hotspots and compare COVID-19 information with SARS and MERS information. Results We found a total of 9,760 publications related to coronaviruses published from 2000 to 2020. The Journal of Virology has been the most popular journal in this field over the past 20 years. The United States maintained a top position worldwide and has provided a pivotal influence, followed by China. Among all the institutions, the University of Hong Kong was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. Moreover, Professors Yuen KY and Peiris JSM made great achievements in coronavirus research. We analysed the keywords and identified 5 coronavirus research hotspot clusters. Conclusions We considered the publication information regarding different countries, institutions, authors, journals, etc. by summarizing the literature on coronaviruses over the past 20 years. We analysed the studies on COVID-19 and the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. Notably, COVID-19 must become the research hotspot of coronavirus research, and clinical research on COVID-19 may be the key to defeating this epidemic.","Tao, Zhengbo; Zhou, Siming; Yao, Renqi; Wen, Kaicheng; Da, Wacili; Meng, Yan; Yang, Keda; Liu, Hang; Tao, Lin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.04.26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411751/,163

Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of these services compared to those delivered in-person. A series of meta-analyses were conducted using 57 empirical studies (43 examining intervention outcomes; 14 examining assessment reliability) published over the past two decades that included a variety of populations and clinical settings. Using conventional and HLM3 meta-analytical approaches, VCT consistently produced treatment effects that were largely equivalent to in-person delivered interventions across 281 individual outcomes and 4336 clients, with female clients and those treated in medical facilities tending to respond more favorably to VCT than in-person. Results of an HLM3 model suggested assessments conducted using VCT did not appear to lead to differential decisions compared to those conducted in-person across 83 individual outcomes and 332 clients/examinees. Although aggregate findings support the use of VCT as a viable alternative to in-person service delivery of mental healthcare, several limitations in the current literature base were revealed. Most concerning was the relatively limited number of randomized controlled trials and the inconsistent (and often incomplete) reporting of methodological features and results.

Moreover, recent data suggest that commonly used opioids for the management of pain may produce undesirable pharmacological actions and interfere with critical medications commonly used in cardiovascular disease and stroke; however, the impact on outcomes remains controversial. The American Heart Association developed an advisory statement for health care professionals and researchers in the setting of cardiovascular and brain health to synthesize the current literature, to provide approaches for identifying patients with opioid use disorder, and to address pain management and overdose. A literature and internet search spanning from January 1, 2012, to February 15, 2021, and limited to epidemiology studies, reviews, consensus statements, and guidelines in human subjects was conducted. Suggestions and considerations listed in this document are based primarily on published evidence from this review whenever possible, as well as expert opinion. Several federal and institutional consensus documents and clinical resources are currently available to both patients and clinicians; however, none have specifically addressed cardiovascular disease and brain health. Although strategic tools and therapeutic approaches for recognition of opioid use disorder and safe opioid use are available for health care professionals who manage patients with cardiovascular disease and stroke, high-quality evidence does not currently exist. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more research to identify the most effective approaches to improve care for these patients.","Chow, Sheryl L; Sasson, Comilla; Benjamin, Ivor J; Califf, Robert M; Compton, Wilson M; Oliva, Elizabeth M; Robson, Chester; Sanchez, Eduardo J",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/cir.0000000000001007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407637/,163

However, the enduring digital divide raises questions about whether unequal access will exacerbate healthcare disparities. METHODS We collected data on patients seen in Supportive Oncology clinic by palliative care clinicians with an in-person or telemedicine visit from March 1 to December 30, 2020. A logistic regression with generalized estimating equation was fit to assess the association between visit type and patient characteristics. RESULTS A total of 491 patients and 1,783 visits were identified, including 1,061 (60%) in-person visits and 722 (40%) telemedicine visits. Female patients were significantly more likely to utilize telemedicine than male patients (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.11-1.90). Spanish-speaking patients (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.61), those without insurance (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.52), and those without an activated patient portal (Inactivated: OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.82; Pending Activation: OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.48) were less likely to utilize telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals disparities in telemedicine utilization in the ambulatory palliative care setting for patients with cancer who are male, Spanish-speaking, uninsured, or do not have an activated patient portal. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can better meet the palliative care needs of patients with cancer through telemedicine only if equity is kept at the forefront of our discussions.","Frydman, Julia L; Berkalieva, Asem; Liu, Bian; Scarborough, Bethann M; Mazumdar, Adhu; Smith, Cardinale B",Journal of pain and symptom management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34644615/,163
160701,Anatomy of a response.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined associations between moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sitting time with quality of life in cancer survivors compared with a cancer-free group. The current study examined differences in global mental health (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) across levels of MVPA and sitting among cancer survivors and cancer-free participants. METHODS Cancer Prevention Study II participants (59.9% of whom were female with an age of 77.8 ± 5.8 years) were grouped as: 1) survivors who were 1 to 5 years after diagnosis (3718 participants); 2) survivors who were 6 to 10 years after diagnosis (4248 participants); and 3) cancer-free participants (ie, no history of cancer; 69,860 participants). In 2009, participants completed MVPA, sitting, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System GMH/GPH surveys. Mean differences in GMH and GPH T scores across MVPA (none, 0 to <7.5, 7.5 to <15, 15 to <22.5, and ≥22.5 metabolic equivalent [MET]-hours/week) and sitting (0 to <3, 3 to <6, and ≥6 hours/day) were assessed using multivariate generalized linear models. RESULTS The mean GMH and GPH scores were statistically significantly higher in cancer-free participants compared with cancer survivor groups, although the differences were not clinically meaningful (mean difference of 0.52 for GMH and 0.88 for GPH). More MVPA was associated with higher GMH and GPH scores for all 3 groups (P for trend <.001), and differences between the least and most active participants were found to be clinically meaningful (mean differences of ≥4.34 for GMH and ≥6.39 for GPH). Similarly, a lower duration of sitting was associated with higher GMH and GPH scores for all groups (P for trend <.001), with clinically meaningful differences observed between the least and most sedentary participants (mean differences of ≥2.74 for GMH and ≥3.75 for GPH). CONCLUSIONS The findings of the current study provide evidence of the importance of increased MVPA and decreased sitting for improved health in older adults with or without a prior cancer diagnosis.","Rees-Punia, Erika; Patel, Alpa V; Nocera, Joseph R; Chantaprasopsuk, Sicha; Demark-Wahnefried, Wendy; Leach, Corinne R; Smith, Tenbroeck G; Cella, David; Gapstur, Susan M",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079415/,163

In a pooled-data meta-analysis, we analyzed whether serum glucose is a treatment modifier of the efficacy of EVT in acute stroke. Methods- Seven randomized trials compared EVT with standard care between 2010 and 2017 (HERMES Collaboration [highly effective reperfusion using multiple endovascular devices]). One thousand seven hundred and sixty-four patients with large-vessel stroke were allocated to EVT (n=871) or standard care (n=893). Measurements included blood glucose on admission and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale range, 0-6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months. The primary analysis evaluated whether glucose modified the effect of EVT over standard care on functional outcome, using ordinal logistic regression to test the interaction between treatment and glucose level. Results- Median (interquartile range) serum glucose on admission was 120 (104-140) mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L [5.7-7.7] mmol/L). EVT was better than standard care in the overall pooled-data analysis adjusted common odds ratio (acOR), 2.00 (95% CI, 1.69-2.38); however, lower glucose levels were associated with greater effects of EVT over standard care. The interaction was nonlinear such that significant interactions were found in subgroups of patients split at glucose < or >90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L; P=0.019 for interaction; acOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.73-8.41 for patients < 90 mg/dL versus 1.83; 95% CI, 1.53-2.19 for patients >90 mg/dL), and glucose < or >100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L; P=0.004 for interaction; acOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.04-4.93 versus acOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.42-2.08) but not between subgroups above these levels of glucose. Conclusions- EVT improved stroke outcomes compared with standard treatment regardless of glucose levels, but the treatment effects were larger at lower glucose levels, with significant interaction effects persisting up to 90 to 100 mg/dL (5.0-5.5 mmol/L). Whether tight control of glucose improves the efficacy of EVT after large-vessel stroke warrants appropriate testing.","Chamorro, Ángel; Brown, Scott; Amaro, Sergio; Hill, Michael D; Muir, Keith W; Dippel, Diederik W J; van Zwam, Wim; Butcher, Ken; Ford, Gary A; den Hertog, Heleen M; Mitchell, Peter J; Demchuk, Andrew M; Majoie, Charles B L M; Bracard, Serge; Sibon, Igor; Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Lara-Rodriguez, Blanca; van der Lugt, Aad; Osei, Elizabeth; Renú, Arturo; Richard, Sébastien; Rodriguez-Luna, David; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Dixit, Anand; Almekhlafi, Mohammed; Deltour, Sandrine; Epstein, Jonathan; Guillon, Benoit; Bakchine, Serge; Gomis, Meritxell; du Mesnil de Rochemont, Richard; Lopes, Demetrius; Reddy, Vivek; Rudel, Gernot; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Bonafe, Alain; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Cloud, Geoffrey C; Davis, Stephen M; van Oostenbrugge, Robert; Guillemin, Francis; Goyal, Mayank; Campbell, Bruce C V; Menon, Bijoy K",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.023769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777000/,163

DESIGN Prospective pilot study. SETTING Tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS A total of 36 HCWs were included in this study: 18 donned/doffed contact precaution (CP) PPE and 18 donned/doffed Ebola virus disease (EVD) PPE. INTERVENTIONS HCWs donned PPE according to standard protocols. Fluorescent liquid and MS2 bacteriophage were applied to HCWs. HCWs then doffed their PPE. After doffing, HCWs were scanned for fluorescence and swabbed for MS2. MS2 detection was performed using reverse transcriptase PCR. The donning and doffing processes were videotaped, and protocol deviations were recorded. RESULTS Overall, 27% of EVD PPE HCWs and 50% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while donning, and 100% of EVD PPE HCWs and 67% of CP PPE HCWs made ≥1 protocol deviation while doffing (P=.02). The median number of doffing protocol deviations among EVD PPE HCWs was 4, versus 1 among CP PPE HCWs. Also, 15 EVD PPE protocol deviations were committed by doffing assistants and/or trained observers. Fluorescence was detected on 8 EVD PPE HCWs (44%) and 5 CP PPE HCWs (28%), most commonly on hands. MS2 was recovered from 2 EVD PPE HCWs (11%) and 3 CP PPE HCWs (17%). CONCLUSIONS Protocol deviations were common during both EVD and CP PPE doffing, and some deviations during EVD PPE doffing were committed by the HCW doffing assistant and/or the trained observer. Self-contamination was common. PPE donning/doffing are complex and deserve additional study.

AIM To describe the clinical features, risk factors, and predictors of hospitalization in adult patients treated for acute respiratory infections associated with coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. MATERIAL AND METHODS Descriptive prospective study of ambulatory and hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 attended between April 1 and May 31, 2020. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities and demographic data were recorded, and patients were followed for two months as outpatients. RESULTS We assessed 1,022 adults aged 41 ± 14 years (50% men) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. One-third had comorbidities, specially hypertension (12.5%), hypothyroidism (6.6%), asthma (5.4%) and diabetes (4.5%). Hospital admission was required in 11%, 5.2% were admitted to critical care unit and 0.9% were connected to mechanical ventilation. Common symptoms included fatigue (55.4%), fever (52.5%), headache (68.6%), anosmia/dysgeusia (53.2%), dry cough (53.4%), dyspnea (27.4%) and diarrhea (35.5%). One third of patients reported persistence of symptoms at one-month follow-up, specially fatigue, cough and dyspnea. In the multivariate analysis, age, fever, cough, dyspnea and immunosuppression were associated with hospitalization and ICU admission. Age, male sex and moderate-severe dyspnea were associated with requirement of mechanical ventilation. The main predictors of prolonged clinical course were female sex, presence of comorbidities, history of dyspnea, cough, myalgia and abdominal pain.

162562,Photosensitized Electrospun Nanofibrous Filters for Capturing and Killing Airborne Coronaviruses under Visible Light Irradiation,2021-07-30,"Uterine fibroids are a major gynecologic disorder among women and commonly found in the infertile couple. Although numerous surgical techniques exist to destroy or remove these tumors, the role of such surgical procedures in the infertile woman has been heavily debated. The primary reason for this is a lack of evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between fibroids and subfertility. However, review of the evidence suggests that submucous myomas and possibly intramural myomas both serve to decrease female fertility. A second reason for caution is concern over the impact of surgical treatment on fertility enhancement. For submucous myomas, hysteroscopic myomectomy has proven capable of increasing fertility rates, although this statement may not apply to type 2 submucous myomas. No evidence currently exists for a beneficial effect on fertility of surgical intervention for intramural or subserous fibroids. More randomized treatment trials are clearly needed to clarify the role of myomectomy and other procedures in the infertile woman with type 2 submucous and intramural myomas.","Olive, David L",Seminars in reproductive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1272473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21437825/,163

During a pandemic, fear related to COVID-19 is a natural psychological reaction, expressed not only in fear and anxiety related to disease and death, but also correlated with occupational social stress. A different type of developmental event, the emergence of a particular phobia, may be signaled when these fears persist and become more severe. A recent emerging phobia unique to COVID-19 is coronaphobia. CASE REPORT: We presented a case of coronaphobia in a 24-year-old male social and political sciences student in his past year academy at local community college, unmarried, from Melayu tribe. He came with his sister to seek treatment from a psychiatrist for his excessive fear and dysfunctional anxiety about the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We give psychoeducation to him, recognizing the diagnosis, describing the process of learning fear and how it was sustained. Therapy concentrated on giving him potential reasons to challenge his doubts, patterns of avoidance, and efforts were made to replace it with more adaptive values and answers.","Dalimunthe, H.

Findings from this qualitative comparative study revealed that the forty-six participants enacted agency in initiating teaching and learning activities for students, engaging in individual and collaborative learning opportunities, and establishing new partnerships with multiple stakeholders. However, teachers’ ability to practice professional agency was either supported or hindered due to several factors which varied between the public and private sectors within and across the participating countries. Implications on practice, professional development and policy for a post-pandemic era are discussed.","Chaaban, Youmen Arar Khalid Sawalhi Rania Alhouti Ibrahim Zohri Abdelaziz",Teaching and Teacher Education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2021.103451,163
164138,Non intubated video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resections (NI-VATS) in COVID times,2021,"Purpose This paper aims to discuss the consequences for responsible management education and learning (RMEL) as an enduring feature of the post-COVID-19 world: increased inequality and increased vulnerable individuals living in poverty. Because of this, responsible management education and learning (RMEL) must integrate poverty as a threshold concept on which students' cognitive frame is built. Design/methodology/approach This paper advocates for poverty to be taught as a multidimensional threshold concept that encompasses a person's freedoms and capabilities, in addition to their income (Sen, 1999). Further, this paper provides a framework for integration into all curricula grounded in RMEL's unique domain of inquiry and study: the integration of ethics, responsibility and sustainability. Findings Threshold concepts transform student learning in durable, immutable ways. When poverty is taught as such, students develop more elaborate poverty cognitive frames that they can apply across their entire course of study. This paper describes how to: (1) reframe poverty as a threshold concept;(2) apply Biggs' (2003) framework of constructive alignment to assure the integrity of course learning objectives and the curriculum;(3) create poverty-related assignments that are emotionally engaging and relevant for students (Dart, 2008);and (4) use this proposed framework of including poverty in business classes. Research limitations/implications Without an integrated multidimensional understanding of poverty, students will not emerge as managers competent in addressing these critical issues from within a business context (Grimm,2020). It will be imperative in future research to evaluate the outcomes of doing so and to determine whether this solution creates responsible managers more competent in addressing poverty-rooted issues. Originality/value This paper brings together two elements of student learning central to understanding poverty: threshold concepts and cognitive frames. This paper also uses Biggs' (2003) constructive alignment framework to assure that curricular and course changes have both internal coherence and explicit learning outcomes.","Mason, G.; Al, Rosenbloom",Journal of Global Responsibility,https://doi.org/10.1108/jgr-01-2021-0004,163
165251,In situ structures of membrane-assisted assembly and selective autophagy of enteroviruses,2021-10-06,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, masks and the act of masking have become emotive subjects for social and political debate. In Brazil, one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic, the seemingly mundane act of mask-wearing has become part of a deep social, political and economic crisis at the centre of which is the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro. In this paper we explore the politics of (un)masking in Brazil from three vantage points in which the mask serves to dramatise the country’s current moment. Firstly, we trace the connections and disjunctions between the politics of mask-wearing and the genealogies of hygienist policies associated with the modern aspirations of the Brazilian republic. Secondly, we consider how masks are incorporated into the everyday life of the city through popular economies, which reveal the potentialities and limitations of work beyond the modern ideals of waged labour. Finally, we explore the incorporation of masks in urban street-art. We approach graffiti and murals as situated performances of symbolic resistance that contest and reveal the incoherences of Bolsonaro’s anti-science discourse. In tandem, these three perspectives foreground practices of (un)masking that expose long-standing tensions and new contemporary challenges that characterise the politics of a ‘crisis society’. © 2021 The Author(s).

Monitoring and assessing the severity of COVID-19 through artificial intelligence would be a practical support for medical practitioners reviving patients and offloading the burden from medical system. Previous works exploited deep learning, for this purpose, which produces inexplainable diagnosis results and lacks medical evidence. Integrating clinical symptom into diagnosis with deep learning will support generating results more compelled and validated. In this study, we focus on verifying the effectiveness of applying the human lung lesion, specifically Ground Glass Opacity and Consolidation, caused by typical pneumonia for COVID-19 detection or severity assessment on chest X-ray image with deep learning technology. We have conducted multiple experiments with state-of-art machine learning architectures (MobileNetV2, ResNet, Faster R-CNN) on many datasets to establish the conclusion. The experiment result demonstrates that lung lesion is useful when incorporating with deep learning solutions for monitoring COVID-19 progression and will provide solid pathway to develop an improved model and support better research in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Pham, V.; Son, H.

While practical quality considerations include content delivery, teacher training, equipment provision, and networked infrastructure, the situated and enculturated means by which online language education occurs represents a learner-focused factor that language educators may inadvertently neglect as they struggle to accommodate an emerging digital frontier. With this issue in mind, this paper aims to contribute to quality assurance in digital foreign language instruction by providing a sociocultural interpretation of CALL as learners and instructors alike continue to struggle within the boundaries of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: In focussing on learner equity, identity and interaction, the current conceptual paper draws attention to potential affective factors driving computer-assisted language learning (CALL) participation structures, providing sociological consideration of the potential impacts of digital language education and, in doing so, confront the deterministic notion that online language learning represents a general equaliser of hierarchical participation structures. Findings: Although CALL’s dynamic nature does provide users with openings to revise linguistic, semiotic and social practices, a growing body of research contests the broad depiction of digital language learning as automatically strengthening learner equity and interaction. Euphoric visions of technology inexorably engendering positive outcomes thereby risk obscuring those sociocultural pressures that impact user identity and, thus, how diverse social actors interact within unfamiliar learning communities. Originality/value: This conceptual study is among a select few that focusses on CALL quality assurance during COVID-induced online education. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Smith, M.

However, there is significant between-subject heterogeneity in disease activity and response to treatment. Currently, the ability to predict at diagnosis who will have a benign, intermediate, or aggressive disease course is very limited. There is therefore a need for integrated predictive tools to inform individualised treatment decision making. FutureMS is a nationally-representative, prospective observation cohort study comprising 440 participants with a new diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS living in Scotland between May 2016 and March 2019. Established with the aim of addressing this need for individualised predictive tools, the cohort is designed to combine detailed clinical phenotyping with imaging, genetic and biomarker metrics of disease activity and progression. Recruitment, baseline assessment and follow up at year one is complete and longer-term follow up is planned, beginning at five years after first visit. The study aims to address the biology and determinants of disease heterogeneity in MS.

The main focus is to evaluate the counter-effectiveness of disparity in vaccination drive among different regions/countries. The model proposed is simple yet novel in the sense that it captures the spatial transmission-induced activity into consideration, through which we are able to relate the transmission model to the mutated variations of the virus. Some important what-if questions are asked in terms of the number of deaths, and time required and the percentage of the population needed to be vaccinated before the pandemic is eradicated. The simulation results have revealed that it is necessary to maintain a global (rather than regional or country-oriented) vaccination drive in case of a new pandemic or continual efforts against COVID-19.","Zia, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.03.21264494v1?rss=1,163
166480,Highlights from this issue,2021,"Globally, millions of people have been impacted with COVID-19. A fraction of these people develop severe respiratory distress and require prolonged intensive care unit stay. With this, and with the improving recovery rate, the numbers of post-COVID survivors are steeply increasing. This demands an early, effective, inexpensive, and safe post-COVID pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in a low available resource setting. A 56-year-old female diagnosed to have COVID-19 pneumonitis with acute respiratory distress syndrome developed severe exercise limitation after discharge, and a supervised low resource home-based PR program was initiated. The PR was followed as per the American Thoracic society/European Respiratory Society guidelines for 6 weeks with supplemental oxygen with a progressive metabolic equivalent of task level training. By the end of 6 weeks, the patient was independent in most of her self-care activities and was ambulatory in and around the house. We conclude with this case report that, by maintaining necessary precautions as recommended by the World Health Organization, PR can be delivered to remotest places with minimal resources and the outcome of this can make an individual independent in the self-care activities at the least.","Shah, S.",Indian Journal of Respiratory Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijrc.ijrc_125_20,163

The immune response is induced through the production of EVs incorporating Nefmut-derivatives released by muscle cells. In the perspective to a possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety profile by identifying the minimal part of Nefmut retaining the EV-anchoring protein property. We found that a C-terminal deletion of 29-amino acids did not affect the ability of Nefmut to associate with EVs. Furthermore, the EV-anchoring function was preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i.e., E6 and E7) and SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., S1 and S2) were fused to its C-terminus. By analyzing the immune responses induced after intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing fusion products based on the four viral antigens, we found that the Nefmut C-terminal deletion did not impact on the levels of antigen –specific CD8+ T lymphocytes as evaluated by IFN-γ EliSpot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. In addition, immune responses at distal sites remained unaffected, as indicated by the similar percentages of SARS-CoV-2 S1- and S2-specific CD8+ T cells detected in spleens and lung airways of mice injected with DNA vectors expressing the viral antigens fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL. We concluded that the C-terminal Nefmut truncation does not affect stability, EV-anchoring, and CD8+ T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen. Hence, NefmutPL represents a safer alternative to full-length Nefmut for the design of CD8+ T cell vaccines for humans.","Chiozzini, Chiara; Manfredi, Francesco; Ferrantelli, Flavia; Leone, Patrizia; Giovannelli, Andrea; Olivetta, Eleonora; Federico, Maurizio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.429891,163

Uncertainty and unknowns about the pandemic together with the explosion of information created confusion and fear among many populations. A major challenge for public health practitioners is to provide clear and consistent messages that can be understood by different types of audiences, including vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children who are often forgotten in this process. We compared and analyzed the development processes of health communication products for pregnant women in Madagascar and for elementary school children in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study compared these two field experiences in different socioeconomic settings to identify common strategies for the development of communication materials in a health crisis. The two cases both developed communication materials developed in collaboration with key local communicators and the target audiences. Both products used a simple and clear structure and included do's and don'ts. Messages were tailored toward the lifestyles of the target audience and phrased to fit with cultural and linguistic contexts. Both developer teams paid attention to easy-to-understand words and culturally accepted design and colors. The final products were distributed swiftly and widely through multiple channels with the local community. These two field experiences demonstrate common strategies for developing health communication materials that are culturally-tailored and visually-appealing in a timely manner and can be disseminated through existing channels in a health crisis. Our experiences emphasize that collaborative and iterative efforts based on an existing trust relationship with the target community can provide the foundation for a rapid communication response in a health crisis.","Benski, C.; Goto, A.; Reich, M.

In considering these themes, attention is drawn towards three areas which are ripe for further study. Several of the articles bring into focus the notion of Scottish exceptionalism, provoking questions about what impacts this exceptionalism, or perhaps more importantly perceptions of it, may have at policy and attitudinal levels. Questions too, are posed about the heterogeneity of perception, experience and response to Brexit amongst ECE migrants in Scotland. Finally, it can be seen that Brexit has been a protracted process and a source of anxiety and anguish, not least for those who have made Scotland their home. Looking forward, there will be more Brexit related tension to come, a prospect hugely complicated by the impacts of Covid-19.","McCollum, David",Scottish Affairs,https://doi.org/10.3366/scot.2020.0332,163

In case of severe infection, lungs are affected by COVID-19 significantly, whichmay lead to the death of the patient. In this paper, an automated image-assisted system based on artificial intelligence is proposed to extract infected sections from lung CT scan images that are caused due to COVID-19. Multilevel thresholding is a typical example of maximization problem of optimization to identify the threshold(s) levels for image segmentation. In this paper, Elephant Swarm Water Search Algorithm (ESWSA) has been used for multilevel thresholding based on Otsu’s and Kapur’s method and further analysis of lungs images. It has been observed from the obtained simulated results that ESWSA performs better than other state-of-the-art optimization techniques for multilevel thresholding. Moreover, location of infection and severity of infection has also been extracted from the pixel ratio between the infection and lung sections from the lung CT scan images. It is expected that the proposed methodology will support the doctors as it will reduce diagnostic burden and respective treatment process can be planned faster as the severity of infection by COVID-19 is found by this automated methodology.

Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID19) is thought to have originated in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the world during the spring months of 2020. Asian Americans recorded in increase in racially based hate crimes including physical abuse and intimidation as COVID-19 spread throughout the United States. This research study was conducted by high school students in the Bay Area to compare the intention and characteristics of hate crimes against Asian Americans to hate crimes against African Americans. According to studies of both victim-related and most offender-related variables, hate crimes against Asian Americans have been rapidly growing in the United States and vary from those against African Americans. This leads to an investigation into the racial disparity between Asian American offenders and those of other races. The nature and characteristics of hate crimes against Asian Americans are compared to those of hate crimes against African Americans in our research. According to studies of all victim-related factors, hate crimes against Asian Americans are similar to those against African Americans. Hate crimes against Asian Americans, on the other hand, vary greatly from hate crimes against African Americans in terms of the offender's ethnicity and all incident-related variables.","Choi, Myung Suh; Choi, Yuli; Kang, Kevin; Lee, Katherine; Ryu, Jacquelyn; Yu, Nayeon; Yoon, Sihyeon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15124v1.pdf,163

First, from analysis point of view, existence is necessary to be investigated for any applied problem. Therefore, we used fixed point theorem's due to Banach's and Schaefer's to establish some sufficient results regarding existence and uniqueness of the solution to the proposed model. On the other hand, stability is important in respect of approximate solution, so we have developed condition sufficient for the stability of Ulam?Hyers and their different types for the considered system. In addition, the model has also been considered for semianalytical solution via Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM). On Matlab, by taking some real data about Pakistan, we graph the obtained results.

169757,Methods to evaluate sensitivity of biomedical thermographic systems for body temperature determination,2021,"BACKGROUND: Brachial plexus injury (BPI) is one of the most devastating nerve injuries to the extremities. BPI in adults is an increasingly common clinical problem due to road traffic accident. Injury patterns, the timing of surgery, priority on the recovery of function, and patient’s understanding about the expectations of the prognosis are things that are important to consider before deciding on surgical management. The coronavirus pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly affected all sectors, one of which is a surgical practice both in terms of medical personnel and equipment, also patient perceptions of hospital services. AIM: This study will analyze epidemiological data on BPI patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study of BPI profile in Prof. Soeharso Orthopedic Hospital before (2019) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic data, the total number of surgery, type of surgical procedure, and patient origin were collected. We compared to the same period in 2019 before pandemic started. RESULTS: In the data obtained from patients treated or undergoing BPI surgery before pandemic (March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019) and during the pandemic (March 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020), Indonesia first confirms case was on March 2, 2020, until today. There were 51 and 43 cases, respectively. Panplexal type before the pandemic there were 27 patients (52%), and during the pandemic were 20 patients (46%), the upper type before: during the pandemic was 24 (48%): 23 (54%), and lower type 0 cases. Primary reconstruction before: during the pandemic was 26 (55%): 27 (62%) case, and secondary reconstruction before: during the pandemic was 25 (49%): 16 (38%) case, respectively. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has no significant effect in the term of the number of BPI surgery performed. Better outcome in BPI surgery is influenced by the timing of the operation, therefore primary reconstruction remains the main choice for BPI patients with safety concern or health protocols. Pre-operative screening applied in our hospital includes laboratory examination, chest radiograph, and polymerase chain reaction swab test. Surgical personnel using personal protective equipment such as protective suit, face shield, google, shoes and medical mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with significant axon loss and limited clinical recovery are considered “urgent”, as surgery should be performed within 6 months or sooner (depending upon the distance to recipient’s muscle) to avoid irreversible muscle atrophy and degradation of motor endplates.","Hadinoto, S.

170277,Appendix 3 The History of Virology,2016-12-31,"Objective: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by dysregulated intestinal immune responses and constitutes a major clinical challenge in need of new treatment modalities to improve patient care. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the predominant Ca2+ influx pathway in T cells and other immune cells, regulating many of their functional properties. It is currently unknown whether the pharmacologic blockade of SOCE represents a suitable drug-target for IBD treatment. Design: Using mass and flow cytometry the effects of SOCE inhibition on lamina propria (LP) immune cells of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) were investigated.Primary organoid cultures served to study the impact of SOCE inhibition on the function, differentiation and survival of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). T cell transfer models of colitis were applied to examine how the genetic or pharmacologic ablation of SOCE affects the clinical course of IBD in mice. Results: We observed that the LP of IBD patients is characterized by an enrichment of innate lymphoid cells (ILC), CD4+ and CD8+ effector- as well as T regulatory cells producing IL-17 and TNF. The pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE attenuated the production of pathogenic cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, TNF and IFN{gamma} by human colonic T cells and ILC, reduced the production of IL-6 by B cells and the production of IFN{gamma} by myeloid cells, without affecting the viability, differentiation and function of primary IEC. T cell-specific genetic deletion of the SOCE signaling components Orai1, Stim1 or Stim2 revealed that the magnitude of SOCE correlates with the function of T cells and intestinal inflammation in mice. Moreover, the pharmacologic inhibition of SOCE alleviated the clinical course of colitic mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest that SOCE inhibition may serve as a new pharmacologic strategy for treating IBD.","Letizia, M.; Kaufmann, U.; Wang, Y.-H.; Gerbeth, L.; Sand, A.; Brunkhorst, M.; Ziegler, J.

170564,Openwifi CSI fuzzer for authorized sensing and covert channels,2021-05-16,"Encephalitis is most often caused by a variety of infectious agents, the identity of which is commonly determined through diagnostic tests utilising cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immune-mediated disorders are also a differential in encephalitis cases. We investigated the clinical characteristics and potential aetiological agents of unexplained encephalitis through metagenomic next-generation sequencing of residual clinical samples of multiple tissue types and independent clinical review. A total of 43 specimens, from both sterile and non-sterile sites, were collected from 18 encephalitis cases with no cause identified by the Australian Childhood Encephalitis study. Samples were subjected to total RNA sequencing to determine the presence and abundance of potential pathogens, to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes, and epidemiological origins, and to describe the possible aetiologies of unexplained encephalitis. From this, we identified five RNA and two DNA viruses associated with human infection from both non-sterile (nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose/throat swabs, urine, stool rectal swab) and sterile (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) sites. These comprised two human rhinoviruses, two human seasonal coronaviruses, two polyomaviruses and one picobirnavirus. With the exception of picobirnavirus all have been previously associated with respiratory disease. Human rhinovirus and seasonal coronaviruses may be responsible for five of the encephalitis cases reported here. Immune-mediated encephalitis was considered clinically likely in six cases and RNA sequencing did not identify a possible pathogen in these cases. The aetiology remained unknown in nine cases. Our study emphasises the importance of respiratory viruses in the aetiology of unexplained child encephalitis and suggests that the routine inclusion of non-CNS sampling in encephalitis clinical guidelines/protocols could improve the diagnostic yield. Author Summary Encephalitis is caused by both infectious agents and auto-immune disorders. However, the aetiological agents, including viruses, remain unknown in around half the cases of encephalitis in many cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic tests are usually based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid which may limit their utility. We used a combination of meta-transcriptomic sequencing and independent clinical review to identify the potential causative pathogens in cases of unexplained childhood encephalitis. Accordingly, we identified seven viruses associated with both sterile and non-sterile sampling sites. Human rhinovirus and seasonal coronaviruses were considered as most likely responsible for five of the 18 encephalitis cases studied, while immune-mediated encephalitis was considered the cause in six cases, and we were unable to determine the aetiology in nine cases. Overall, we demonstrate the role of respiratory viruses as a cause of unexplained encephalitis and that sampling sites other than cerebrospinal fluid is of diagnostic value.","Li, Ci-Xiu; Burrell, Rebecca; Dale, Russell C; Kesson, Alison; Blyth, Christopher C; Clark, Julia E; Crawford, Nigel; Jones, Cheryl A.; Britton, Philip N.; Holmes, Edward C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.443367,163

As shown in this paper, optimization studies in the context of COVID-19 have been used for many aspects of the pandemic. From these studies, it is observed that since COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem, it cannot be studied from a single perspective or framework, and neither can the related optimization models. Four new and different frameworks are proposed that capture the essence of analyzing COVID-19 (or any pandemic for that matter) and the relevant optimization models. These are: (i) microscale vs. macroscale perspective;(ii) early stages vs. later stages perspective;(iii) aspects with direct vs. indirect relationship to COVID-19;and (iv) compartmentalized perspective. To limit the scope of the review, only optimization studies related to the prediction and control of COVID-19 are considered (public health focused), and which utilize formal optimization techniques or machine learning approaches. In this context and to the best of our knowledge, this survey paper is the first in the literature with a focus on the prediction and control related optimization studies. These studies include optimization of screening testing strategies, prediction, prevention and control, resource management, vaccination prioritization, and decision support tools. Upon reviewing the literature, this paper identifies current gaps and major challenges that hinder the closure of these gaps and provides some insights into future research directions.

The results reveal that there exists an asymmetric effect of EPU on life insurance as well as non-life life insurance consumption. A negative relationship is found between EPU and insurance consumption in both life and non-life insurance. Based on the findings, the study suggests the policymakers to consider the asymmetric effects of EPU while formulating insurance-related policies in India.","Kumar, S.; Sahu, N.

For non-intrusive occupancy analysis, multiple types of sensors can be installed to collect data based on which the consumer occupancy can be learned. However, the overall system cost will be increased as a result. Therefore, this research proposes a cheap and lightweight machine learning approach to predict the energy consumer occupancy based solely on their electricity consumption data. The proposed approach employs a support vector machine (SVM), in which different kernels are used and compared, including positive semi-definite and conditionally positive definite kernels. Efficiency of the proposed approach is depicted by different performance indexes calculated on simulation results with a realistic, publicly available dataset. Among SVM models with different kernels, those with Gaussian (rbf) and sigmoid kernels have the highest performance indexes, hence they may be most suitable to be used for residential energy consumer occupancy prediction.","Nguyen, Dinh Hoa",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158321,163

The article shows that the extreme severity of the corona crisis was caused not only by its specific features but also by the pairing with other social ills inherent in Latin America: fatal miscalculations of ruling populist regimes, deep-rooted corruption, a huge informal sector of the economy. At the same time, the author attempts to understand the reality of the countries of the region in the post-COVID-19 period, what can be done to mitigate the negative effects of the epidemic. And the main thing is whether Latin American states have the resources and opportunities to get out of the crisis with a more advanced technological structure of the regional economy. As a matter of fact, in international business and expert circles it is recognized that in recent years new and extremely important economic and social phenomena of the positive order have been born in the leading Latin American states: the modernization of the business community and the strengthening of the role of tecnolatinas, the improvement of the educational level of young people and, on this basis, the qualitative improvement of human capital, the deployment of modernization processes and technological renewal of the production apparatus.

This study explores how people often involuntarily involved in this type of work evaluate the process and considers potential consequences. The pandemic of 2020 has brought rapid and dramatic changes in the lives of educators and students across the world. In Russia, both students and academics in higher education institutions had to adapt within a week to an online mode of working. Education process implies joint work where the course and success of the process heavily depends on the ability and readiness of all actors to contribute and respond timely. Despite reported stress both from academics and students, many universities have opted to continue online studying as a measure to prevent the spread of the disease. This study aims at analyzing the way academics and students working online conceptualize the process of online learning. Students and professors of four state universities of Saint Petersburg participated in a survey that asked to both directly evaluate the process of online learning and to give metaphorical associations. The study has revealed persistent negative psychological patterns both among students and among academics that may cause resistance to the development of a new learning space and undermine the success of the education process.

Surveillance based on case reporting has become the core pandemic monitoring method in the country and globally. However, population-based seroprevalence studies may provide an unbiased estimate of the actual disease spread and, in combination with multiple surveillance tools, help to define the pandemic course. This study summarises results from four consecutive serological surveys conducted between May 2020 and April 2021 at St.Petersburg, Russia and combines them with other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data. Methods: We conducted four serological surveys of two random samples (May-June, July-August, October--December 2020, and February-April 2021) from adults residing in St.Petersburg recruited with the random digit dialing (RDD), accompanied by a telephone interview to collect information on both individuals who accepted and declined the invitation for testing and account for non-response. We have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CoronaPass total antibodies test (Genetico, Moscow, Russia) to report seroprevalence. We corrected the estimates for non-response using the bivariate probit model and also accounted the test performance characteristics, obtained from independent assay evaluation. In addition, we have summarised the official registered cases statistics, the number of hospitalised patients, the number of COVID-19 deaths, excess deaths, tests performed, data from the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) surveillance, the vaccination uptake, and St. Petersburg search and mobility trends. The infection fatality ratios (IFR) have been calculated using the Bayesian evidence synthesis model. Findings: After calling 113,017 random mobile phones we have reached 14,118 individuals who responded to computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and 2,413 provided blood samples at least once through the seroprevalence study. The adjusted seroprevalence in May-June, 2020 was 9.7% (95%: 7.7-11.7), 13.3% (95% 9.9-16.6) in July-August, 2020, 22.9% (95%: 20.3-25.5) in October-December, 2021 and 43.9% (95%: 39.7-48.0) in February-April, 2021. History of any symptoms, history of COVID-19 tests, and non-smoking status were significant predictors for higher seroprevalence. Most individuals remained seropositive with a maximum 10 months follow-up. 92.7% (95% CI 87.9-95.7) of participants who have reported at least one vaccine dose were seropositive. Hospitalisation and COVID-19 death statistics and search terms trends reflected the pandemic course better than the official case count, especially during the spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation showed rather low genetic SARS-CoV-2 lineages diversity that increased in the spring 2021. Local VOC (AT.1) was spreading till April 2021, but B.1.617.2 substituted all other lineages by June 2021. The IFR based on the excess deaths was equal to 1.04 (95% CI 0.80-1.31) for the adult population and 0.86% (95% CI 0.66-1.08) for the entire population. Conclusion: Approximately one year after the COVID-19 pandemic about 45% of St. Petersburg, Russia residents contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection in, or 2.2 mln people. Combined with vaccination uptake of about 10% it was enough to slow the pandemic until the Delta VOC started to spread.

With the advancement of this temporal network, it is observed that the network is oriented toward the evolution of the motifs with time. So it is crucial to comprehend temporal motifs to study dynamic networks and provide important insights/predictions for them. In this chapter, we study the dynamic structure of motifs. All the key aspects related to the motif and temporal motif structures are explained in depth along with existing work. These multiple temporal motifs provide a finer picture of the network which congruence to the real-world data. It is interesting to note how these temporal motifs elaborated with time. We provide an example of progression in terms of motifs having minimum two nodes, three edges and maximum four nodes, four edges. While computing and analyzing different temporal motifs, a need of parallel algorithm is realized to identify the multiple temporal motifs of various patterns. The chapter also explains a basic application of these concepts by demonstrating the spread of infection such as COVID-19. The chapter serves as a basic starting point for understanding temporal network motifs and these ideas can be used for analyzing many real-world networks/social networks. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Verma, A.

Summary: COVID-19 is the once in a century event which has already devastated millions and millions of lives. The containment of the COVID-19 is a great challenge as the extremely high virulent nature and capability of producing lethal clinical outcome is creating hindrance. Preventive measures are supposedly more beneficial than curative treatment therefore they must be promoted. Conclusion: Preventive measures and its efficacy should be studied and popularize so that more people can adopt them.

On the one hand, the children had more anxiety and regressive behaviors, and the adolescents had more isolation, depressive symptoms and even autolytic ideation. The economic crisis and lockdown have affected the family environment, having reported greater situations of domestic violence and substance use among parents. Studies show a prevalence up to 28-34% of post-traumatic stress symptoms among adolescents. In Spain it has been determined that ¼ children present anxiety and / or depression. Their parents noticed in them greater irritability, less concentration and greater feelings of loneliness There has been an increase in addiction to new technologies. This is partly a method of maintaining social relationships, but prolonged use is associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Regarding to patients with mental pathology, they have presented greater tantrums, especially ADHD and ASD, due to the loss of structure and routine.ConclusionsConfinement and fear of COVID have affected mental health of children and adolescents, with anxiety and depression occurring more frequently. Is highlighted the presence of feelings of loneliness among adolescents and the increase in the use of screens.

We exploit self‐reported survey data from Argentina to study the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic quarantine had unintended consequences on intimate partner violence. The quarantine decree established clear exceptions for heterogeneous subsets of the population and, for reasons plausibly exogenous to the prevalence of intimate partner violence, only some individuals were forced to spend more time with their partners. Using this variability in exposure we find that the lockdown led to an increase between 12% and 35% in intimate partner violence, depending type of violence (emotional, physical or sexual). Given the Argentinian government imposed the full national lockdown when few people felt threatened by the virus, these effects are likely to have been triggered by the actual confinement.","Gibbons, M.

We developed the School-Age Health, Activity, Resilience, Anthropometry and Neurocognitive (SAHARAN) toolbox to measure growth, cognitive and physical function in rural Zimbabwe. Methods: The SAHARAN toolbox was developed using a stepwise approach, with tool selection based on COSMIN principles. Growth was measured with anthropometry, skinfold thicknesses and bioimpedance analysis to obtain lean mass index (LMI) and phase angle. Cognition was assessed using a fine motor finger tapping task, school achievement test (SAT), and the Kaufmann Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-2) to determine the mental processing index (MPI). Physical function combined grip strength, broad jump and the 20m shuttle run test to produce a total physical score (TPS). A detailed caregiver questionnaire was performed in parallel. Results: 80 Zimbabwean children with mean (SD) age 7.6 (0.2) years had mean height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ) of -0.63 (0.81) and -0.55 (0.85), respectively. For growth measures, LMI and total skinfold thicknesses were highly related to both WAZ and BMI Z-score, but not to HAZ. For physical function, TPS was associated with unit rises in HAZ (1.29, 95%CI 0.75,1.82, p<0.001), and LMI (0.50, 95%CI 0.16,0.83, p=0.004), but not skinfold thicknesses. For cognition, the SAT was highly associated with unit increases in the MPI (0.9 marks, 95%CI 0.4,1.3, p<0.001) and a child socioemotional questionnaire (8.2 marks, 95%CI 2.9,13.5, p=0.003). Phase angle was associated with 3.5 seconds quicker time to complete the finger tapping task (95%CI 0.6,6.4, p=0.02). No child outcomes were associated with socioeconomic status, nurturing, discipline, food and water insecurity, or household adversity. Conclusions: We found clear associations between growth, height-adjusted lean mass and physical function, but not cognitive function, in a cohort of Zimbabwean children. The SAHARAN toolbox could be deployed to characterise school-age growth, development and function in sub-Saharan Africa.","Piper, J.

The United States is highly connected to the rest of the world, and importations occur largely as a result of air travel by U.S. residents and international visitors. We developed a model to assess the risk of measles virus importation from Europe, Asia, and Africa through air travel. We projected 308 (95% prediction interval, 151-518) total measles cases imported from 66 countries during 2006-2015; 290 importations were reported. The model projected a spike in importation risk from Israel during October 2018, coincident with large, importation-triggered outbreaks in New York and New Jersey. Our model shows U.S. importation risk primarily originates from European and Asian countries.

The obtained results are most interesting for those regions where the population is shrinking and aging with a rising need to involve youth for educational services and local labor markets, or vice versa, for those losing youth due to their emigration. It is emphasized that youth create an economically active social group, which volume and quality significantly affect the country's development. During the global migration trends identification, the authors identified the international youth migration flows' differences and features. The paper notes that the global trends in the international youth migration development include: increase in volume and percentage of youth in the overall number of migrants and the local population;growth of youth migrants in more developed regions and high-income countries;the dominance of migratory centers for youth in Oceania, North America, and Europe: formation of powerful centers of migration of intellectual young labor resources in the UAE, Canada, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand. The available formational policy in youth migration regulation, on the example of India, China, Taiwan, Japan, USA, and Western Europe, is studied. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international migration flows is considered, including changes in international migration in 2020. Based on the UN data analysis on age groups of migrants within geographical regions, it was determined that the prerequisite for such a structure of migration centers is a high level of migratory attractiveness. Such migration-center structure is also explained by the significant level of cross-regional migration, as in the localized regions, their factors of ""attraction-repulsion"" are formed. It is stressed out that increasing military and political instability has led to the uphill of forced youth migrants. The paper proposes the flow optimization directions of international youth migration by formulating the link between migration policy and elements of other integration policies on migrant youth (employment policy, social, educational, information and security policies).","Sardak, S.

The study also finds that the perception of budgeting mirrors the level of education of SME operators, as educated respondents understand the value of implementing robust budgeting systems. Despite its focus on manufacturing SMEs, this study suggests that the manufacturing budget is the least utilised budgeting system among these organisations.Practical implicationsThe study reinforces the communication power of budgeting and budgetary controls as SMEs and economic agents are not only aware of corporate objectives but are equally incentivised to support the attainment of these objectives.Originality/valueDespite the extensive application of GST among scholars, its use in budgeting and budgetary control literature, particularly among SMEs in developing contexts, is limited. In line with GST, this study indicates that when agents establish and implement a plan, they are motivated to pursue and realise the set expectations while consistently evaluating themselves for improvement opportunities.","Mamorena Lucia, Matsoso Nyathi Moses Nakpodia Franklin A.",Journal of Accounting in Emerging Economies,https://doi.org/10.1108/jaee-04-2020-0082,163

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19), outbreak has become the first pandemic of the 21st century and is the deadliest pandemic after the 1918 Spanish Flu. Except, the two previous epidemics, SARS-CoV (2002 epidemic, China) and MERS-CoV (2012 epidemic, Middle Eastern region), CoVs are known the world over as the mild pathogens of humans and animals. Despite several measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, it has affected more than 210 countries and regional territories distressing more than 5.3 million people and claiming nearly 0.34 million lives globally. Several findings point towards the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the humans through animals, especially the wild animals of the Chinese live seafood wet market. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is another example of diseases originating from the human-animal interface and spreading through international borders causing global health emergencies. Most of the countries around the globe are stumbling due to the COVID-19 pandemic with severe threats and panic among the mass population. World Health Organization (WHO), international and national health authorities are working with excessive efforts for effective and impactful interventions to contain the virus. It is significant to comprehend the inclination of these viruses to jump between different species, and the establishment of infection in the entirely new host, identification of significant reservoirs of coronaviruses. Several animal species such as cats, dogs, tiger, and minks have been confirmed to get SARS-CoV-2 infections from COVID-19 infected person. Laboratory investigations point out those cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and it can evidence with clinical disease. The studies carried out on animal's susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 further support the human-to-animal spread of the virus.

179522,Corona virus,2020,"Abstract The thermomechanical interaction between the cutting tool and the workpiece in any material removal process is a key factor in defining the efficiency and productivity of the process. It is especially important in cutting hard-to-machine materials such as titanium- and nickel-based alloys or hardened steels. The productivity of the process can be defined in terms of machining time, intervals of tool change (due to tool wear) and surface integrity characteristics such as dimensional tolerances, surface roughness and the machining-affected zone. The objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of three different industrial-grade CBN cutting inserts during hard turning of AISI 4320 case-carburized steel. The CBN inserts all had the same geometry but used different edge preparation and coating technologies. To quantify tool performance, the cutting forces and tool wear were measured at consistent intervals and the surface integrity of the workpiece was characterized in terms of surface roughness, white and dark layer depths, micro-hardness and residual stresses. Results show that the stability of the cutting edge on two of the tested inserts plays an important role in determining tool life (where 60% higher tool life was achieved compared to the other tested insert with unstable cutting edge), cutting force stability and the formation of compressive residual stresses on the surface of the turned workpiece","Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Haines, Eric; Dreussi, Roman; Weyer, Gregory",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315390; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315390,163

The transformation of the multi-class deep learning output into binary outputs and the detection of Covid-19 image patterns using Grad-CAM technique show promising results. The discovered patterns are consistent across images from a given class of disease and constitute explanations of how the deep learning model makes classification decisions.

Various wired and wireless connecting patterns are supported by utilizing a hybrid mode for COVID-19 relevant operations. Components generated from deterministic networking, time-sensitive networks, and 5G systems have been integrated to achieve corresponding features.

182503,Impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing and speaking,2020-07-22,"Viral interferon (IFN) antagonist proteins mediate evasion of IFN-mediated innate immunity and are often multifunctional, having distinct roles in viral replication processes. Functions of the Ebola virus (EBOV) IFN antagonist VP24 include nucleocapsid assembly during cytoplasmic replication and inhibition of IFN-activated signalling by STAT1. For the latter, VP24 prevents STAT1 nuclear import via competitive binding to nuclear import receptors (karyopherins). Many viral proteins, including proteins from viruses with cytoplasmic replication cycles, interact with the trafficking machinery to undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport, with key roles in pathogenesis. Despite established karyopherin interaction, the nuclear trafficking profile of VP24 has not been investigated. We find that VP24 becomes strongly nuclear following overexpression of karyopherin or inhibition of nuclear export pathways. Molecular mapping indicates that cytoplasmic localisation of VP24 depends on a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence at the VP24 C-terminus. Nuclear export is not required for STAT1 antagonism, consistent with competitive karyopherin binding being the principal antagonistic mechanism while export mediates return of nuclear VP24 to the cytoplasm for replication functions. Thus, nuclear export of VP24 might provide novel targets for antiviral approaches. Importance Ebola virus (EBOV) is the causative agent of ongoing outbreaks of severe haemorrhagic fever with case-fatality rates between 40 and 60%. Proteins of many viruses with cytoplasmic replication cycles similar to EBOV interact with the nuclear trafficking machinery, resulting in active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling important to immune evasion and other intranuclear functions. However, exploitation of host trafficking machinery for nucleocytoplasmic transport by EBOV has not been directly examined. We find that the EBOV protein VP24 is actively trafficked between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and identify the specific pathways and sequences involved. The data indicate that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is important for the multifunctional nature of VP24, which has critical roles in immune evasion and viral replication, identifying a new mechanism in infection by this highly lethal pathogen, and potential target for antivirals.","Harrison, Angela R.; Moseley, Gregory W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.10.245563,163
182840,Use of Transgenic Animals in Biotechnology: Prospects and Problems,2013,"The novel coronavirus pandemic has brought our concern towards the necessity of digital infrastructure for remote monitoring of infected people as well as the people who are with close contact with them. Though, many nations have finished the clinical trials period of vaccination and started vaccination to people, still there are many uncertainties such as how these vaccines will work to the people with severe illness, which vaccine is more effective compared to others etc. Moreover, vaccination may not provide a full protection against the current situation since there are new variants of corona virus and the number of affected people increasing again. Therefore, a proper diseases detection and individual monitoring system to maintain a smart quarantine facility is still very much needed to minimise the rapid spread of covid-19 and other contagious virus. Here, wearable tools could play important roles to provide valuable information of tracking people such as real-time remote monitoring, contact tracing symptoms prediction etc. to establish and maintain a proper quarantine system. In this manuscript we proposed a geofencing system with a wristband, integrating it with IOT and GPS to trace Covid-19 patients inside a boundary. This design could be an effective quarantine solution as a home isolation system for covid-19 patients as well as the travellers who cross borders. The performance of our proposed system was measured with respect to received signal strength indication (RSSI), GPS accuracy and coverage. © 2021 IEEE.","Monir, M. F.; Chowdhury, A.

We report 4 probable SARS cases with different severity and propose optimal treatment. METHODS Four probable SARS cases were enrolled. Two cases were due to outbreak of SARS in our hospital and two cases were transferred from other hospitals. All patients received standard treatment: ribavirin 1000 mg orally daily for 10 days, Levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 7 days, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 g/kg/day for 2 day after the onset of symptoms. If severe hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 < 200) occurred, protective strategy of mechanical ventilation and methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day were given. The clinical pictures and treatment outcome were discussed. RESULTS Fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, malaise, dizziness and dry cough were initially more common symptoms. Initially chest patterns included focal consolidation, interstitial infiltration or normal. Common laboratory findings were lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. No mortality was found. CONCLUSIONS Highly alert and stringent infection control of SARS cases are required. Otherwise, SARS easily induces hospital-acquired first then community-acquired infection. Initial presentation of radiographic patterns includes normal, interstitial or airspace shadowing. Fever and lymphopenia are occasionally followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise. The standard treatment might be beneficial for decreasing the mortality rate.","Chiang, Chi-Huei; Chen, Hua-Ming; Shih, Jen-Fu; Su, Wei-Juin; Perng, Reury-Perng",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12889501/,163

OBJECTIVES To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","Hidvégi, Máté; Nichelatti, Michele",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236583/,163

RESULTS The construction of the surveillance system in such a model as ""individual-dormitory/home-class/unite-faculty and institute-university"" largely contributed to the achievement of the goals of low incidence, no secondary, no epidemic, and no death. A series of control measures benefited the early diagnosis, effective isolation, prevention, and treatment of SARS control.

188070,SARS in China spreads from Beijing to poorer inland provinces.,2003,"Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that 2 attenuated strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) contain deletions affecting messenger (m) RNAs 2, 3, or 4. In this report, we have compared mRNAs of four modified-live virus vaccines for TGEV with the virulent Miller PP3 isolate to determine whether any transcriptional patterns are shared among attenuated strains. Using northern blot analysis, all vaccine viruses expressed mRNAs indistinguishable in size from those of Miller PP3. However, using S1 nuclease protection experiments, alterations in the regions of the genome from which mRNAs 2 and 3 are transcribed were detected in 2 of the vaccine strains. When genomic cDNA fragments derived from the coding region for mRNA 2 were sequenced, a 6-nucleotide deletion, also found in the attenuated strain Purdue-115, was discovered. The product of mRNA 2, a spike glycoprotein, was visualized by western blotting for each vaccine strain, and no profound differences in mobility were detected relative to Miller PP3. Alterations in the region of the genome from which mRNA 3 is transcribed appear to be identical or very similar to sequence alterations already described in this region for Purdue-115, one of which is likely to alter the polypeptide product of mRNA 3. Insertions or deletions in mRNAs 2 or 3 may contribute to attenuation but are not a prerequisite for this phenotype. The S1 nuclease protection analysis is a sensitive tool for differentiating particular strains of TGEV.","Register, K B; Wesley, R D","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8011775/,163
188237,Lifestyle as medicine - Past precepts for present problems.,2016,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy has emerged as an alternative to conventional multiport laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Technical difficulty, prolonged surgical times and increased complication rates have been reported in single-incision laparoscopic surgery. One of the concerns is lack of triangulation of instruments. The SPIDER® surgical system is a single-incision laparoscopic device that utilizes flexible instruments with the purpose of achieving adequate triangulation. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of SPIDER versus LC. METHODS A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent LC and SPIDER cholecystectomy by a single surgeon during a concurrent 44-month period at Baptist Health South Florida hospitals was performed focusing on demographics, indication for surgery, complications and incisional hernia rates. Exclusion criteria were concomitant surgery and hernia repair at the time of surgery. RESULTS A total of 612 patients underwent minimally invasive cholecystectomy: 279 cases for SPIDER cholecystectomy and 333 for multiport LC. Baseline differences in patient characteristics between the SPIDER and LC groups were statistically significant. The SPIDER group had younger and healthier patients (lower ASA classification scores) with predominant diagnosis of cholelithiasis (69 %) compared to the LC group which had more complex cases. Total complications rate for both SPIDER and LC were 0.4 % (n = 1) and 3 % (n = 10), respectively. Conversion to open cholecystectomy occurred in one patient from the LC group (0.3 %). Conversion rate from SPIDER to additional ports or LC was performed in 5 cases (1.8 %) with no conversions to open surgery. Hemoperitoneum was reported in 2 cases, one for each approach, requiring reoperation. CONCLUSION Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with SPIDER is a safe and feasible technique with similar outcomes to multiport LC. However, statistical significant difference was reported in baseline characteristics of both groups. No incisional hernias were reported in this case series for either technique.","Escobar-Dominguez, Jose E; Garcia-Quintero, Pedro; Hernandez-Murcia, Christian; Verdeja, Juan-Carlos",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26932549/,163

Samples were tested by culture and direct fluorescent antibody testing for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and influenza A and B, and by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for RSV, PIV, influenza A and B, and metapneumovirus (MPV).

PIV, with a cumulative incidence estimate of 17.9%, was the only virus for which asymptomatic infection was detected. Lower virus copy number in patients with no or one symptom compared with 2 or more symptoms was found for all viruses in all patients (P < .001), with PIV infection having a similar virus-specific comparison (P = .004). Subclinical infection with PIV may help explain why infection-control programs that emphasize symptoms are effective against RSV and influenza but often not against PIV.","Peck, Angela J; Englund, Janet A; Kuypers, Jane; Guthrie, Katherine A; Corey, Lawrence; Morrow, Rhoda; Hackman, Robert C; Cent, Anne; Boeckh, Michael",Blood,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17502457/,163

METHODS CD13 antigen was examined by immunocytochemistry, using a recently produced antibody (VS5E) alongside a commercially available anti-CD13 monoclonal antibody. The VS5E recognising CD13 was produced by immunising a doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cell line (MCF-7-ADr). A striking feature of this antibody was that it stained the doxorubicin resistant cells but not the parental cell line. Both antibodies were tested on a broad range of normal tissues and three common types of epithelial malignancy (colon n = 28, lung n = 30, breast n = 35), and 12 cases of Hodgkin's and 52 of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. RESULTS CD13 was expressed on many tissue and cell types outside the haematopoietic system. In particular it was present on breast epithelium and in 20% (seven of 35) of breast carcinomas, but absent in normal and neoplastic colonic and bronchial tissues and lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS This study provides not only detailed information about the expression of the CD13 antigen, but also raises the important possibility that CD13 expression may correlate with drug resistance in breast carcinomas.","Dixon, J; Kaklamanis, L; Turley, H; Hickson, I D; Leek, R D; Harris, A L; Gatter, K C",Journal of clinical pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7907609/,163

A total of 49 samples (15 throat washes, 13 throat swabs, and 21 combined throat and nasal swabs) collected from patients admitted to the Hanoi-French and Ninhbinh hospitals in Vietnam during the SARS epidemic were evaluated and compared to conventional RT-PCR. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 100-fold-greater sensitivity, with a detection limit of 0.01 PFU. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP assay for detecting viral RNA in clinical specimens with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 87%, respectively. The specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was further validated by restriction analysis as well as nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product. The concentration of virus in most of the clinical samples was 0.1 PFU (0.1 to 10(2) PFU), as determined from the standard curve of SARS RT-LAMP and based on the time of positivity. The assay procedure is quite simple, wherein the amplification is carried out in a single tube under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C, and the result can be obtained in less than 1 h (as early as 11 min).

193065,"Droplet fate in indoor environments, or can we prevent the spread of infection?",2006,"New variants of pathogenic fungal viruses are emerging and they are enigmatic in revealing their molecular identity and of their origin. Double-stranded RNAs, some in non-encapsidated forms are increasingly becoming causal agents for sporadic diseases and are consistently associated with a complex profile of dsRNAs, presumably of (multiple) viral origin present in the host while the same are conspicuously absent in healthy (looking) counterparts. The emergence of an unusual Agaricus bisporus mushroom 'patch disease' first reported in 1996, later termed as 'mushroom virus X' (MVX), exhibited a wide range of symptoms (e.g. barren patches beside healthy looking mushrooms, arrested pins, premature opening, brown, off-colour and distortions in shape). A variable compendium of novel 26 (dsRNA) elements, ranging in sizes between 20.2kb to 0.64kb, several of them (-17/26) in non-encapsidated form have been shown to occur in the diseased mushroom fruiting bodies and are thought to comprise multiple viruses. Ten years on, this devastating disease is now more widespread and prevalent in a number of European countries (e.g. The Netherlands, Ireland) ranging from occasional to severe outbreaks leading to crop losses. Impressive data has been accumulated on the symptoms, but the potential aetiological sources, biochemical and molecular characterizations corresponding to the symptoms vis-a-vis MVX linked dsRNAs still remain either elusive or unclear. We have overviewed mainly the molecular findings of research groups working on MVX in these countries together with our own work on MVX in Northern Ireland. To date, the results reviewed suggest that with the exception of 4 low molecular weight dsRNA bands (sizes 2.0. 1.8, 0.8 and 0.6 kb) which consistently were found synchronous to mushroom off-colour/browning symptoms in the UK and The Netherlands, other individual MVX dsRNAs or their banding patterns clearly lack credible relationship with other symptoms of the MVX disease complex. The issues in the molecular characterisation of the MVX dsRNAs include the disparate results on the molecular sequences obtained for some of these by the different research groups, the varying molecular methods or approaches adopted by them for deciphering the nucleotide sequences of the novel dsRNAs that are different from previously encountered mushroom viruses. The future outlook and general consensus among mushroom researchers worldwide is for an urgent need to recruit international taskforce and re-focus on clarifying the symptom vis-a-vis dsRNAs in the enigmatic MVX disease complex. As crossing the cellular membrane is a key step to infection process, we have also attempted to draw parallels with other viruses in terms of the potential cell entry mechanisms for MVX dsRNAs. In the light of MVX disease and A. bisporus being a commercial crop worldwide in agri-food markets, and taking cue from its nearest Basidiomycete model mushroom, Coprinus cinereus whose genome mapping is completed, we also propose that it may be timely for the international research groups to renew efforts to prop up a network for sequencing the host A. bisporus mushroom genome (-38 MB) for a better understanding of host-pathogen relationships.","Rao, Juluri R; Nelson, David W A; McClean, Stephen",Current issues in molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17489438/,163

In order to identify specific characteristics of Mu-3, the pathology of Mu-3-infected mice was compared with that of srr7- and cl-2-infected mice. The neuropathology after Mu-3 infection exhibited a mixed pattern comparable to that induced by srr7 and cl-2 infections. In addition, Mu-3 infection caused marked apoptotic lesions in the hippocampal region, particularly in the CA2 and CA3 subregions, in the brains of all infected mice. In contrast, in cl-2 infection, 10-20% of the infected mice exhibited apoptosis in the hippocampus, which was primarily observed in the CA1 subregion. Apoptosis also occurred in the pyramidal neurons and CD11b-bearing cells. The apoptotic cells, indicated by caspase 3-activation, were a mixed population of infected and a higher number of uninfected cells. These data indicated that apoptosis observed in Mu-3 infection could be induced by the indirect effects of infection in addition to direct effects of the infected cells occurring in a cell-autonomous manner.","Kakizaki, Masatoshi; Kashiwazaki, Hiromi; Watanabe, Rihito",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24451095/,163

196095,Elucidating mouse transmission ratio distortion.,2005,"OBJECTIVES To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs, and to study the factors associated with this seroprevalence. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study of HCWs from a Dedicated COVID Hospital was conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. Universal sampling for qualitative testing(by COVID-19 IgG rapid test device by Voxpress) was done and the samples which tested positive were subjected to quantitative testing (chemiluminescent immunoassay) by Serial testing.3 Results: A total of 1005 HCWs were tested out of which 124(12.3%) tested positive by qualitative test and 101(10%) tested positive by both tests. Out of the 1005 HCWs, 155(15.4%) were doctors and 496 (49.4%) were nurses. There was statistically no significant difference between the seropositivity of HCWs with regards to the designation, age, place of work, duration of work in this DCH and Comorbidities. Most HCWs received training in Infection prevention and control(IPC) 988(98.3%), used personal protective equipment(PPE) whenever indicated 997(99.2%), performed hand hygiene before and after handling patients or their material 981(97.6%). Out of 1005 HCWs, 116(11.5%) had a history of COVID-19.The seroprevalence in HCWs not having history of COVID-19 was 74(8.3%). CONCLUSION Good infection prevention practices can keep the infection rate in HCWs low. HCWs with mild symptoms should also be tested and asymptomatic HCWs should be screened periodically to decrease the spread of COVID-19.","Santosh, Chavhan Smita; Tukaram, Dhikale Prasad; Maharudra, Kumbhar; Balkrishna, Adsul; Chinmay, Gokhale; Aniket, Ingale; Kinge, Kirti; Nilam, Jadhav",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34472805/,163

Subsequent work has cast doubts on these findings. This review will examine the current state of awareness monitoring. RECENT FINDINGS Recently published randomized controlled trials examining the use of the bispectral index during general anesthesia have not been able to show superiority over other forms of monitoring depth of anesthesia, such as end-tidal anesthetic-agent concentration. Additionally, there is current interest in utilizing the unprocessed electroencephalogram to ascertain depth of anesthesia and recent studies have demonstrated its use in preventing postoperative delirium. SUMMARY Although awareness monitors such as the bispectral index monitor may have benefit in patients in whom volatile anesthetic agents must be minimized - such as in hemodynamically unstable patients, or patients undergoing total intravenous anesthesia - these monitors do not appear to be useful for all patients.","Stein, Erica J; Glick, David B",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585361/,163
199562,Phosphate linkers with traceable cyclic intermediates for self-immolation detection and monitoring,2020,"AIM This paper presents the findings of a staff survey conducted at a 350-bed acute care facility located on the periphery of Toronto, Canada. BACKGROUND Toronto's severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis resulted in trauma-like effects at hospitals hardest hit by the disease. A systematic examination of the impact on staff working in hospitals that saw relatively few cases, while maintaining the precautions associated with elevated alert levels, has not been undertaken. METHODS A questionnaire was distributed for 1 month commencing 17 April 2003 and 300 completed responses were obtained (approximately one in six staff members). The data collected included demographic and occupational information, in addition to perceptions of SARS' impact on patient care, factors contributing to adverse impacts on patient care, working conditions, decision-making, communication and relations, sources of support, and the impact on workers' lives outside work. Items for these sections were developed by a multi-disciplinary team of health care workers and hospital administrators. RESULTS In the absence of pre-SARS normative data for the survey, demographic and occupational variables were used to look for patterns of differences between relevant subgroups of respondents. Statistically significant differences were found for gender (73.9% women), nurses (24.7%) vs. others, doctors (20.3%) vs. others, older (40 years or older, 60.0%) vs. younger persons, emergency or intensive care unit workers (8.0%) vs. others, and those employed fewer years at the hospital (less than 5 years: 46.2%) vs. five or more years. These differences varied across the following domains: factors adversely affecting patients, communications, support, working conditions, decision-making and, to a lesser extent, impact on life outside work. While all groups found SARS stressful, nurses reported a greater impact on morale and job satisfaction. Nurses relied more on peer support than doctors, felt less informed and less involved in decision-making than doctors felt, and were more likely to report that infection control procedures were not strict enough. CONCLUSIONS The between-group differences and the pattern of these differences clearly illustrate the polarizing and stressful impact SARS had at a hospital with only a small number of probable or suspect cases. The clear differences between groups defined by demographics, professions and clinical roles suggest a subtle and pervasive secondary impact of the SARS outbreak, with repercussions health care facilities must contend with while maintaining increased levels of vigilance in the wake of SARS.","Tolomiczenko, George S; Kahan, Meldon; Ricci, Maria; Strathern, Lynne; Jeney, Christa; Patterson, Karen; Wilson, Lynn",Journal of advanced nursing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788070/,163

Here, we report that IRAK-4 signaling is also essential for eliciting adaptive immune responses. Thus, in the absence of IRAK-4, in vivo T cell responses were significantly impaired. Upon T cell receptor stimulation, IRAK-4 is recruited to T cell lipid rafts, where it induces downstream signals, including protein kinase C activation through the association with Zap70. This signaling pathway was found to be required for optimal activation of nuclear factor kappaB. Our findings suggest that T cells use this critical regulator of innate immunity for the development of acquired immunity, suggesting that IRAK-4 may be involved in direct signal cross talk between the two systems.","Suzuki, Nobutaka; Suzuki, Shinobu; Millar, Douglas G; Unno, Midori; Hara, Hiromitsu; Calzascia, Thomas; Yamasaki, Sho; Yokosuka, Tadashi; Chen, Nien-Jung; Elford, Alisha R; Suzuki, Jun-Ichiro; Takeuchi, Arata; Mirtsos, Christine; Bouchard, Denis; Ohashi, Pamela S; Yeh, Wen-Chen; Saito, Takashi",Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16574867/,163

Several genomic sequences including velogenic strains and low virulent strains have been identified. However, the reasons for the virulence of the virus have remained unclear. Based on selective pattern and pressure strength, we classified all genes of CSFV into three classes. Among these genes, the E2 gene was under the strongest positive selection. Based on the analysis of 85 representative E2 gene sequences, the location and intensity of positive selection in CSFV isolates from group one and group two were identified. These results suggest that these two groups employ evolutionary difference. Moreover, the mutations, potentially driven by positive selection, can be correlated with the virulence of CSFV by altering the conformation and function of E2 and/or changing its glycosylation pattern. Based on these results, a model for the evolution of virulence of CSFV is proposed. The results provide a link between epidemiology and the gene function of CSFV, and may shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the variation of CSFV virulence.","Wu, Zhiyin; Wang, Qin; Feng, Qian; Liu, Yingying; Teng, Junlin; Yu, Albert Cheunghai; Chen, Jianguo",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036871/,163

Given both COVID-19 infection and obesity have been associated with increased systemic inflammation, we evaluated inflammatory markers in obese and non-obese individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital. We hypothesized that obese patients would have a more exuberant inflammatory response as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers along with worse clinical outcomes. Of the 781 patients, 349 were obese (45%). Obese individuals had higher initial and peak levels of CRP and ESR as well as higher peak d-dimer (P < 0.01 for all) in comparison to non-obese individuals, while. IL-6 and ferritin were similar. In addition, obese individuals had a higher odds of requiring vasopressor use (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00-2.38, P = 0.05), developing hypoxemic respiratory failure (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.04-2.40, P = 0.03) and death (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.31-3.70, P = 0.003) within 28 days of presentation to care. Finally, higher baseline levels of CRP and D-dimer were associated with worse clinical outcomes even after adjustment for BMI. Our findings suggest greater disease severity in obese individuals is characterized by more exuberant inflammation.","McNeill, Jenna N; Lau, Emily S; Paniagua, Samantha M; Liu, Elizabeth E; Wang, Jessica K; Bassett, Ingrid V; Selvaggi, Caitlin A; Lubitz, Steven A; Foulkes, Andrea S; Ho, Jennifer E",Obes Res Clin Pract,,163

HCQ has several side effects and warnings, including blindness, heart failure, and renal toxicity, even with recommended doses. For severe cases of COVID-19 or in patients with preexisting conditions, administering such a drug could be fatal, particularly when taken at high doses or in combination with other antibiotics. However, further well-designed studies that would address the optimal dose, duration of treatment, possible side effects, and long-term usage outcomes are needed to make the final decision.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of cognitive telerehabilitation in adolescents with learning disabilities to overcome the treatment problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: Twenty-four patients diagnosed with Unspecified Learning Disability (mean ± SD age: 18.2 ± 2.9 years; 50% male) were enrolled in this study. The patients were assessed by a neuropsychological evaluation at the beginning and at the end of the program. All patients received cognitive treatment via a specific telehealth app to stimulate the cognitive skills related to learning. The treatment lasted four weeks, with a daily training (lasting up to 60 min), for five days a week. RESULTS: Our young patients reported a statistically significant improvement in the main cognitive domains that are usually compromised in learning disabilities, including sustained and selective attention, shifting of attention, control of interference, memory and speed of information processing. Moreover, the patients showed a good usability and motivation during the training. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that telerehabilitation could be a valid tool for the rehabilitation of specific cognitive skills in adolescents with learning difficulties.","Maggio, Maria Grazia; Foti Cuzzola, Marilena; Calatozzo, Patrizia; Marchese, Domenicaroberta; Andaloro, Adriana; Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore",J Adolesc,,163

METHODS: A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The mean age was 55.3 years (SD ± 21.1). Comorbidities were present in 110 (60.8%) cases. The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5%]) predominated. Metastatic disease accounted for 90 (49.7%) cases. In total, 63 (34.8%) had recently received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7%]), septic shock (40 [22.1%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2%]). A total of 60 (33.1%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. For solid tumors, the COVID-19-specific mortality rate was 37.7% (52 out of 138 patients) and for hematological malignancies, 23.5% (8 out of 34). According to the univariate analysis COVID-19-specific mortality was significantly associated with age over 75 years (P = .002), metastatic cancer (p <0.001), two or more sites of metastases (P < .001), the presence of lung (P < .001) or bone metastases (P = .001), non-curative treatment or best supportive care intent (P < .001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P = .002), admission due to COVID-19 (P = .009), and antibiotics use (P = .02).

210811,COVID-19 platform trial delivers,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region established a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) temporary test centre at the AsiaWorld-Expo from March 2020 to April 2020, which allowed high-risk individuals to undergo early assessment of potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This study reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of individuals who attended the centre for COVID-19 testing. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study collected epidemiological and clinical data. The primary outcome was a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected at the centre. The relationships of clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 positive test results were assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1258 attendees included in the analysis, 86 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (positivity rate=6.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.57%-8.37%). Of these 86 individuals, 40 (46.5%) were aged 15 to 24 years and 81 (94.2%) had a history of recent travel. Symptoms were reported by 86.0% and 96.3% of individuals with positive and negative test results, respectively. The clinical characteristics most strongly associated with a positive test result were anosmia (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=8.30; 95% CI=1.12-127.09) and fever ORadj=1.32; 95% CI=1.02-3.28). CONCLUSION: The temporary test centre successfully helped identify individuals with COVID-19 who exhibited mild disease symptoms. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 to arrange early testing to reduce community spread.","Leung, W L H; Yu, E L M; Wong, S C; Leung, M; Lee, L L Y; Chung, K L; Cheng, V C C",Hong Kong Med J,,163

It is necessary that Nigerian dental students have adequate knowledge about prevention/control of COVID-19 pandemic in dental practice. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception about COVID-19 among Nigerian dental students and its impact on their academic life. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire assessing knowledge and perception with a total of 46 scoreable responses was created using Survey Monkey, an online survey tool. We surveyed 178 out of 507 clinical dental students attending the 10 dental schools. Bivariate analysis was conducted to test the association between students' age, gender and knowledge and perception of COVID 19 infection. Logistic regression was also conducted to determine the predictors of having good knowledge of COVID 19. The effect of all significant factors was inferred at P< 0.05. RESULTS: The mean knowledge score of the dental students about infection control and COVID-19 was 32.19 (SD: 7.30, Range: 2-46). Knowledge scores significantly differed across genders, age-groups, class levels, university of study, previous lectures on infection prevention and control and risk-perception. The linear regression analysis showed that male gender (vs. female, beta: 0.242, P<0.001), age-group of 18-24 years (vs. 45-54years, beta: -0.305, P<0.001), class level 600 (vs. 500 level, beta: -0.154, P<0.001), previous lectures on infection prevention and control (vs. no lecture, beta: -0.186 , P=0.007), and a high-risk perception of COVID-19 ( vs. low-risk perception, beta: 0.220, P=0.001) were significantly associated with higher knowledge scores. CONCLUSION: The students were knowledgeable about mode of transmission, complications and diagnosis of COVID-19 but had limited understanding of the extra precautionary measures against COVID-19. These results imply that there is a need for an update of the infection prevention and control curriculum for dental students and improved quality assurance.","Olatosi, O.; Nzomiwu, C.

213644,A novel disinfected Trombe wall for space heating and virus inactivation: Concept and performance investigation,2021,"The cytokine storm is an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines, due to the over-activation of the innate immune response. This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections. Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-Î³ also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-Î³ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia. In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-Î³, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-Î³ activation. Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-Î³ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.","Ciavarella, Carmen; Motta, Ilenia; Valente, Sabrina; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea",Molecules (Basel),,163

215628,"Editorial: Strategizing food: stick, carrot but not nearly enough dairy?",2021,"One of the main applications of ultrasonic melt treatment is the grain refinement of aluminium alloys. Among several suggested mechanisms, the fragmentation of primary intermetallics by acoustic cavitation is regarded as very efficient. However, the physical process causing this fragmentation has received little attention and is not yet well understood. In this study, we evaluate the mechanical properties of primary Al3Zr intermetallics by nano-indentation experiments and correlate those with in-situ high-speed imaging (of up to 1 Mfps) of their fragmentation process by laser-induced cavitation (single bubble) and by acoustic cavitation (cloud of bubbles) in water. Intermetallic crystals were chemically extracted from an Al-3 wt% Zr alloy matrix. Mechanical properties such as hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness of the extracted intermetallics were determined using a geometrically fixed Berkovich nano-diamond and cube corner indenter, under ambient temperature conditions. The studied crystals were then exposed to the two cavitation conditions mentioned. Results demonstrated for the first time that the governing fragmentation mechanism of the studied intermetallics was due to the emitted shock waves from the collapsing bubbles. The fragmentation caused by a single bubble collapse was found to be almost instantaneous. On the other hand, sono-fragmentation studies revealed that the intermetallic crystal initially underwent low cycle fatigue loading, followed by catastrophic brittle failure due to propagating shock waves. The observed fragmentation mechanism was supported by fracture mechanics and pressure measurements using a calibrated fibre optic hydrophone. Results showed that the acoustic pressures produced from shock wave emissions in the case of a single bubble collapse, and responsible for instantaneous fragmentation of the intermetallics, were in the range of 20-40 MPa. Whereas, the shock pressure generated from the acoustic cavitation cloud collapses surged up to 1.6 MPa inducing fatigue stresses within the crystal leading to eventual fragmentation.","Priyadarshi, Abhinav; Khavari, Mohammad; Subroto, Tungky; Conte, Marcello; Prentice, Paul; Pericleous, Koulis; Eskin, Dmitry; Durodola, John; Tzanakis, Iakovos",Ultrason Sonochem,,163

The typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, headache and fatigue. However, atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being increasingly reported. Recently, a number of studies have recognized various mucocutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This study sought to summarize the available literature and provide an overview of the potential orofacial manifestations of COVID-19. An online literature search in the PubMed and Scopus databases was conducted to retrieve the relevant studies published up to July 2020. Original studies published in English that reported orofacial manifestations in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included; this yielded 16 articles involving 25 COVID-19-positive patients. The results showed a marked heterogeneity in COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations. The most common orofacial manifestations were ulcerative lesions, vesiculobullous/macular lesions, and acute sialadentitis of the parotid gland (parotitis). In four cases, oral manifestations were the first signs of COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 may cause orofacial manifestations that might be the initial features in several cases. However, the occurrence of orofacial manifestations in COVID-19 seems to be underreported, mainly due to the lack of oral examination of patients with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19. Oral examination of all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases is crucial for better understanding and documenting COVID-19-associated orofacial manifestations.","Halboub, Esam; Al-Maweri, Sadeq Ali; Alanazi, Rawan Hejji; Qaid, Nashwan Mohammed; Abdulrab, Saleem",Braz Oral Res,,163

These products are popular during the spread of pandemic COVID-19 and become an option of disinfection method for surface and air such as in office, hospital, hotel room and car. The objective of the study is to investigate the UVC lamps of the UVGI products based on their wavelength. This is to validate whether the product samples are using UVC lamp as stated in the specification which normally has 253.7 to 254 nm wavelength. Besides that, the UVC intensity level has been measured to determine the irradiance emitted by the lamps. The measurement was carried out at various distance to see the effectiveness of the UVGI in disinfection process at different size of spaces. UVC is categorised as non-ionising radiation and has potential health effects due to excessive exposure specially to eye and skin. The equipment used for the irradiance measurement is IL 1700 radiometer with UVC sensor and the measurement data recorded in microwatt/cm2. The irradiance level of the samples was compared with the permissible exposure limit to the members of public by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).","Wan Syazlin Wan, Yunoh Roha Tukimin Naurah Mat Isa Mohd Yusof Hamzah Khairul Azhar Abdul Halim",IOP Conference Series.

217719,Surface Design for Antibacterial Materials: From Fundamentals to Advanced Strategies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Absolute numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported to date in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region have been significantly lower than those across the Americas, Asia and Europe. As a result, there has been limited information about the demographic and clinical characteristics of deceased cases in the region, as well as the impacts of different case management strategies. METHODS: Data from deceased cases reported across SSA through 10 May 2020 and from hospitalized cases in Burkina Faso through 15 April 2020 were analyzed. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information on deceased cases in SSA was derived through a line-list of publicly available information and, for cases in Burkina Faso, from aggregate records at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Tengandogo in Ouagadougou. A synthetic case population was probabilistically derived using distributions of age, sex and underlying conditions from populations of West African countries to assess individual risk factors and treatment effect sizes. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the adjusted odds of survival for patients receiving oxygen therapy or convalescent plasma, based on therapeutic effectiveness observed for other respiratory illnesses. RESULTS: Across SSA, deceased cases for which demographic data were available were predominantly male (63/103, 61.2%) and aged >50 years (59/75, 78.7%). In Burkina Faso, specifically, the majority of deceased cases either did not seek care at all or were hospitalized for a single day (59.4%, 19/32). Hypertension and diabetes were often reported as underlying conditions. After adjustment for sex, age and underlying conditions in the synthetic case population, the odds of mortality for cases not receiving oxygen therapy were significantly higher than for those receiving oxygen, such as due to disruptions to standard care (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.56-2.75). Cases receiving convalescent plasma had 50% reduced odds of mortality than those who did not (95% CI 0.24-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Investment in sustainable production and maintenance of supplies for oxygen therapy, along with messaging around early and appropriate use for healthcare providers, caregivers and patients could reduce COVID-19 deaths in SSA. Further investigation into convalescent plasma is warranted until data on its effectiveness specifically in treating COVID-19 becomes available. The success of supportive or curative clinical interventions will depend on earlier treatment seeking, such that community engagement and risk communication will be critical components of the response.","Skrip, Laura; Derra, Karim; Kaboré, Mikaila; Noori, Navideh; Gansané, Adama; Valéa, Innocent; Tinto, Halidou; Brice, Bicaba W; Gordon, Mollie Van; Hagedorn, Brittany; Hien, Hervé; Althouse, Benjamin M; Wenger, Edward A; Ouédraogo, André Lin",Int J Infect Dis,,163

In the face of a new infectious agent causing acute respiratory failure for which there were no known effective therapies, rapid, often pragmatic trials were necessary to evaluate potential treatments, frequently starting with medications that are already marketed for other indications. Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were two such candidates. OBJECTIVE: Assess the relative efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a randomized clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Treatment was 5 days of study medication. The primary endpoint was the COVID Ordinal Outcomes scale at day 14. Secondary endpoints included hospital-, ICU-, and ventilator-free days at day 28. The trial was stopped early after enrollment of 85 patients when a separate clinical trial concluded that a clinically important effect of hydroxychloroquine over placebo was definitively excluded. Comparisons were made a priori using a proportional odds model from a Bayesian perspective. RESULTS: We enrolled 85 patients at 13 hospitals over 11 weeks. Adherence to study medication was high. The estimated odds ratio for less favorable status on the ordinal scale for hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin from the primary analysis was 1.07, with a 95% credible interval from 0.63 to 1.83 with a posterior probability of 60% that hydroxychloroquine was worse than azithryomycin. Secondary outcomes displayed a similar, slight preference for azithromycin over hydroxychloroquine. QTc prolongation was rare and did not differ between groups. The twenty safety outcomes were similar between arms with the possible exception of post-randomization onset acute kidney injury, which was more common with hydroxychloroquine (15% vs. 0%). Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm received remdesivir more often than in the azithromycin arm (19% vs. 2%). There was no apparent association between remdesivir use and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: While early termination limits the precision of our results, we found no suggestion of substantial efficacy for hydroxychloroquine over azithromycin. Acute kidney injury may be more common with hydroxychloroquine than azithromycin, although this may be due to the play of chance. Differential use of remdesivir may have biased our results in favor of hydroxychloroquine. Our results are consistent with conclusions from other trials that hydroxychloroquine cannot be recommended for inpatients with COVID-19; azithromycin may merit additional investigation.

The CoVs are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA and therefore, it is considered a complicated virus structure. The spike (S) is the major protein that exists in CoV's structure regulates the viral access to the host using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for both severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronaviruses-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and/or SARS-CoV initiates the animal/human disease and elevated immune responses. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S-proteins is essential for the CoVs-gene sequences;however the literature discussed CoV S-protein in relation to receptor-binding is little. Therefore, finding a natural antiviral to limit the spreading of CoVs is important. Herein, Immunoglobulin (Ig) Y is considered a kind of passive immunizations, represents 60% of the egg-yolk and can preventing many infectious diseases due to the particularities of IgY-molecule shape functional bioactivity to combat the pathogens. Comparing IgY to other Ig(s) antibodies, it makes the minimal animal stress, produces the lowest responses to mammalian factors. Besides, IgY is the most cost-effective extraction using the precipitation which is efficient protocol produce about (95% purity) of antibodies. We reported that IgY has a killing power to bacterial infections in broilers which beneficial to produce hygienic meat. Also, IgY-technology has a global application for treatment of viral infections and cancers.

While globally the pandemic is at different stages and far from under control in some countries, now is the time for public health researchers and political scientists to start understanding how and why governments responded the way they have, explore how effective these responses appear to be, and what lessons we can draw about effective public health policymaking in preparation of the next wave of COVID-19 or the next infectious disease pandemic. We argue that there will be no way to understand the different responses to COVID-19 and their effects without understanding policy and politics. We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.","Greer, Scott L; King, Elizabeth J; da Fonseca, Elize Massard; Peralta-Santos, Andre",Glob Public Health,,163

230804,Minimax and pointwise sequential changepoint detection and identification for general stochastic models,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect life in the United States, the important role of nonpharmaceutical preventive behaviors (such as wearing a face mask) in reducing the risk of infection has become clear. During the pandemic, researchers have observed the rapid proliferation of misinformed or inconsistent narratives about COVID-19. There is growing evidence that such misinformed narratives are associated with various forms of undesirable behavior (eg, burning down cell towers). Furthermore, individuals' adherence to recommended COVID-19 preventive guidelines has been inconsistent, and such mandates have engendered opposition and controversy. Recent research suggests the possibility that trust in science and scientists may be an important thread to weave throughout these seemingly disparate components of the modern public health landscape. Thus, this paper describes the protocol for a randomized trial of a brief, digital intervention designed to increase trust in science. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine whether exposure to a curated infographic can increase trust in science, reduce the believability of misinformed narratives, and increase the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, superiority trial comprising 2 parallel groups. A sample of 1000 adults aged &#8805;18 years who are representative of the population of the United States by gender, race and ethnicity, and age will be randomly assigned (via a 1:1 allocation) to an intervention or a placebo-control arm. The intervention will be a digital infographic with content based on principles of trust in science, developed by a health communications expert. The intervention will then be both pretested and pilot-tested to determine its viability. Study outcomes will include trust in science, a COVID-19 narrative belief latent profile membership, and the likelihood to engage in preventive behaviors, which will be controlled by 8 theoretically selected covariates. RESULTS: This study was funded in August 2020, approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board on September 15, 2020, and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 misinformation prophylaxis is crucial. This proposed experiment investigates the impact of a brief yet actionable intervention that can be easily disseminated to increase individuals' trust in science, with the intention of affecting misinformation believability and, consequently, preventive behavioral intentions.

234242,Algorithms meet sequencing technologies – 10th edition of the RECOMB-Seq workshop,2021,"The unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 has placed the tourism sector in an unfavourable position. It has altered the reality of destinations worldwide, changing the paradigm of tourism and showing an unusual scenario within the tourism sector, the undertourism. This paper confirms how this global pandemic has put the Spanish tourism sector at a halt, making it essential to establish public–private response strategies that reactivate it and, in turn, avoid overtourism in the post-COVID-19 scenario. This is done to emphasise the necessity of embracing an adapted systematic approach that entails a realistic set of factors to quantitatively measure the impact of overtourism on the local community. In this sense, a fuzzy modified hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, combining the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model, the multi-attribute ideal–real comparative analysis (MAIRCA) model, and the sensitivity analysis. The modified F-AHP model is used to identify the criteria importance. For the final ranking of the considered alternative municipalities, the modified F-MAIRCA is applied. To validate the applicability of the proposed approach, we designated the province of Malaga (Costa del Sol) as an empirical study. The findings show that the municipality of Nerja was the most affected by overtourism in the pre-pandemic scenario, and today it is found in undertourism. This calls for transformative decisions of fully engaged tourism policymakers and practitioners to thrive in the post-COVID-19 tourism scenarios in terms of sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

The gut has been so far out of the frame of the discussion on the pathophysiology of COVID-19-induced diabetes, with the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissue being under the spotlight of medical research. Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT) 1 represent important regulators of glucose absorption, expressed in the small intestine where they mediate almost all sodium-dependent glucose uptake. Similar to what happens in diabetes and other viral infections, SGLT1 upregulation could result in increased intestinal glucose absorption and subsequently promote the development of hyperglycaemia in COVID-19. Considering the above, the question whether dual SGLT (1 and 2) inhibition could contribute to improved outcomes in such cases sounds challenging, deserving further evaluation. Future studies need to clarify whether putative benefits of dual SGLT inhibition in COVID-19 outweigh potential risks, particularly with respect to drug-induced euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal side effects, and compromised host response to pathogens.","Koufakis, Theocharis; Metallidis, Symeon; Zebekakis, Pantelis; Kotsa, Kalliopi",,,163

236781,Plasmonic Biosensors for Single-Molecule Biomedical Analysis,2021,"Resistin and resistin-like molecules are pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in inflammatory diseases. Our previous work suggested that resistin has the potential to be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for human pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, data are limited on the distribution of resistin in healthy human organs. In this study, we used our newly developed anti-human resistin (hResistin) antibody to immunohistochemically detect the expression, localization, and intracellular/extracellular compartmentalization of hResistin in a full human tissue panel from healthy individuals. The potential cross reactivity of this monoclonal anti-hResistin IgG1 with normal human tissues also was verified. Results showed that hResistin is broadly distributed and principally localized in the cytoplasmic granules of macrophages scattered in the interstitium of most human tissues. Bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells also exhibited hResistin signals in their cytoplasmic granules. Additionally, hResistin labeling was observed in the cytoplasm of nervous system cells. Notably, the cytokine activity of hResistin was illustrated by positively stained extracellular material in most human tissues. These data indicate that our generated antibody binds to the secreted hResistin and support its potential use for immunotherapy to reduce circulating hResistin levels in human disease. Our findings comprehensively document the basal expression patterns of hResistin protein in normal human tissues, suggest a critical role of this cytokine in normal and pathophysiologic inflammatory processes, and offer key insights for using our antibody in future pharmacokinetic studies and immunotherapeutic strategies.","Lin, Qing; Price, Shari A; Skinner, John T; Hu, Bin; Fan, Chunling; Yamaji-Kegan, Kazuyo; Johns, Roger A",PLoS One,,163
236782,Plasmonic Biosensors for Single-Molecule Biomedical Analysis,2021,"Several medicines, including cancer therapies, are known to alter the electrophysiological function of ventricular myocytes resulting in abnormal prolongation and dispersion of ventricular repolarization (quantified by multi-lead QTc measurement). This effect could be amplified by other concomitant factors (e.g., combination with other drugs affecting the QT, and/or electrolyte abnormalities, such as especially hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, and hypocalcemia). Usually, this condition results in higher risk of torsade de point and other life-threatening arrhythmias, related to unrecognized unpaired cardiac ventricular repolarization reserve (VRR). Being VRR a dynamic phenomenon, QT prolongation might often not be identified during the 10-s standard 12-lead ECG recording at rest, leaving the patient at increased risk for life-threatening event. We report the case of a 49-year woman, undergoing tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer, which alteration of ventricular repolarization reserve, persisting also after correction of concomitant recurrent hypokalemia, was evidenced only after manual measurements of the corrected QT (QTc) interval from selected intervals of the 12-lead ECG Holter monitoring. This otherwise missed finding was fundamental to drive the discontinuation of tamoxifen, shifting to another ""safer"" therapeutic option, and to avoid the use of potentially arrhythmogenic antibiotics when treating a bilateral pneumonia in recent COVID-19.","Brisinda, Donatella; Merico, Barbara; Fenici, Peter; Fenici, Riccardo",Cardiovasc. toxicol.

236899,Hard Nanomaterials in Time of Viral Pandemics,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Puerto Rico and third among Hispanics in the USA. Up to 2-4% of colorectal cancer cases are a result of Lynch syndrome (LS), a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation in at least one of the DNA mismatch repair genes. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of LS in colorectal tumors during the first 15-months after the implementation of universal tumor-based screening for LS in Puerto Rico. METHODS: A total of 317 colorectal tumors were evaluated in a large private pathology laboratory from September 2014 to December 2015. Clinical characteristics were obtained from the pathology reports. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate the magnitude of association (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) between absent MMR protein expression and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Most cases (93.4%) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry; 11.8% (35 of 296) had deficient mismatch repair protein expression. While 29 of the 317 cases were subjected to PCR-based microsatellite instability analysis of which 10.3% (3 of 317) had microsatellite instability. In total, 11.0% of the tumors were reported MMR deficient. These tumors were more likely from females and more likely localized in the proximal colon compared to those with proficient MMR expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data is consistent with the results from other studies including US Hispanics, where approximately 10% of Hispanic individuals with colorectal cancer have microsatellite instability. Our results support universal tumor-based screening for LS among Hispanics in accordance with National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.","Sierra, Isabel; Pérez-Mayoral, Julyann; Rosado, Kathia; Maldonado, Valerie; Alicea-Zambrana, Kimberly; Reyes, José S; Torres, Marla; Tous, Luis; Lopéz-Acevedo, Nicolas; Diaz-Algorrí, Yaritza; Carlo-Chevere, Victor; Rodriguez-Quilichini, Segundo; Cruz-Correa, Marcia",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,163

237110,Postweaning isolation alters the responses of auditory neurons to serotonergic modulation,2021,"On March 11th, 2020, the National Basketball Association (NBA) paused its season after ~ 64 games due to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, only to resume ~ 5 months later with the top 22 teams isolated together (known as the ""bubble"") in Orlando, Florida to play eight games each as an end to the regular season. This restart, with no new travel by teams, provided a natural experiment whereby the impact of travel and home-court advantage could be systematically examined. We show here that in the pre-COVID-19 regular season, traveling across time zones reduces winning percentage, team shooting accuracy, and turnover percentage, whereas traveling in general reduces offensive rebounding and increases the number of points the opposing (home) team scores. Moreover, we demonstrate that competition in a scenario where no teams travel (restart bubble) reduces the typical effects of travel and home-court advantage on winning percentage, shooting accuracy, and rebounding. Thus, home-court advantage in professional basketball appears to be linked with the away team's impaired shooting accuracy (i.e., movement precision) and rebounding, which may be separately influenced by either circadian disruption or the general effect of travel, as these differences manifest differently when teams travel within or across multiple time zones.","McHill, Andrew W; Chinoy, Evan D",Sci Rep,,163

Four types of dying will be discussed in this paper: (1) suicide, (2) dying in older age, (3) deaths post-release, and (4) COVID-19 deaths. The importance of providing good end-of-life care and palliative care in prison is acknowledged in the literature, but this only shows awareness of the needs of a particular part of the prison population. To understand the complexities and nuances of dying in prison, all voices need to be included in research, otherwise what is left post-death of a person who died in prison is a Fatal Incidence Report.

In contrast to acute COVID-19 infection, which is usually mild in children, 68% of patients with MIS-C will need intensive care unit. Myocarditis and coronary artery ectasia/aneurysm are included between the main cardiovascular complications in MIS-C. Therefore, close clinical assessment is need it both at diagnosis and during follow-up. Echocardiography is the cornerstone modality for myocardial function and coronary artery evaluation in the acute phase. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) detects diffuse myocardial inflammation including oedema/fibrosis, myocardial perfusion and coronary arteries anatomy during the convalescence and in adolescents, where echocardiography may provide inadequate images. Brain involvement in MIS-C is less frequent compared to cardiovascular disease. However, it is not unusual and should be monitored by clinical evaluation and brain magnetic resonance (MRI), as we still do not know its effect in brain development. Brain MRI in MIS-C shows T2-hyperintense lesions associated with restricted diffusion and bilateral thalamic lesions. To conclude, MIS-C is a multisystem disease affecting many vital organs, such as heart and brain. Clinical awareness, application of innovative, high technology imaging modalities and advanced treatment protocols including supportive and anti-inflammatory medication will help physicians to prevent the dreadful complications of MIS-C.","Mavrogeni, Sophie I; Kolovou, Genovefa; Tsirimpis, Vasileios; Kafetzis, Dimitrios; Tsolas, Georgios; Fotis, Lampros",Rheumatol Int,,163

257014,AID in Antibody Diversification: There and Back Again,2020,"BACKGROUND: Suicide amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an important issue. In Japan, the number of suicides in April 2020 decreased by nearly 20% from that in 2019. To assess the impact of an infectious disease pandemic, excess mortality is often discussed. Our main purpose was evaluating excess mortality from suicide in Japan during the early pandemic period. METHODS: We used data on suicides collected by the National Police Agency of Japan until June 2020. We estimated excess mortality during the early pandemic period (March-June 2020) using a time-series model of the number of suicides before the pandemic. A quasi-Poisson model was employed for the estimation. We evaluated excess mortalities by the categories of age and sex, and by prefecture. RESULTS: No significant excess mortality was observed throughout the early pandemic; instead, a downward trend in the number of suicides for both sexes was noted. For males, negative values of excess mortalities below the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval were observed in April and May. All numbers of females during the period were included in the interval, and the excess mortalities in June were positive and higher than those in April and May. In Tokyo, the number of suicides was below the lower bound throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that various changes, such as communication, and social conditions amid the early COVID-19 pandemic induced a decrease in suicides in Japan. However, continuous monitoring is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of the pandemic on suicides.","Anzai, Tatsuhiko; Fukui, Keisuke; Ito, Tsubasa; Ito, Yuri; Takahashi, Kunihiko",J Epidemiol,,163

However, individuals preferences regarding EoL care may differ internationally. Current literature lacks insight in how preferences in EoL care differ between countries and continents. This study's aim is to compare Dutch and Japanese general publics attitudes and preferences toward EoL care, and EoL decisions. Methods: a cross-sectional survey design was chosen. The survey was held among samples of the Dutch and Japanese general public, using a Nationwide social research panel of 220.000 registrants in the Netherlands and 1.200.000 in Japan. A quota sampling was done (age, gender, and living area). Nâ=â1.040 in each country.More Japanese than Dutch citizens tend to avoid thinking in advance about future situations of dependence (26.0% vs 9.4%; Pâ=â.000); say they would feel themselves a burden for relatives if they would become dependent in their last phase of life (79.3% vs 47.8%; Pâ=â.000); and choose the hospital as their preferred place of death (19.4% vs 3.6% Pâ=â.000).

We reported 2 cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 receiving tracheal intubation twice during the hospitalization. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two elderly patients with onset of fever and upper respiratory tract infection were confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 19, 1 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease previously. With active antiviral and noninvasive respiratory supportive therapy, there was no improvement, thus mechanical ventilation (MV) was adopted. Combining with symptomatic and supportive treatment, their oxygenation recovered and then extubation was carried out. However, 96âhours later, they underwent endotracheal intubation again due to their Coronavirus Disease 19 progression. DIAGNOSIS: Critically ill Coronavirus Disease 19 requiring tracheal intubation owing to respiratory failure with lung.javascript. INTERVENTIONS: Initial Strategy for respiratory failure included endotracheal intubation, MV, antiviral treatment and cortisol in both cases. When extubation criteria were satisfied, early discontinuation of MV was conducted, then rehabilitation exercise and nutritional support followed. However, 96âhours later, the disease progressed leading to respiratory failure again, thus reintubation was performed. Later, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed owing to aggravation of respiratory failure, assisted by prone position treatment and sputum drainage, then status became stable and stepped into recovery stage. OUTCOMES: Both patients underwent reintubation, and their MV time and Intensive care unit residence time were prolonged. Through prone position treatment, sputum drainage and awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation strategy, patient has been transferred to rehabilitation unit in Case 1, and patient in Case 2 has been in recovery stage as well with stable pulmonary status and was expected to receive evaluation in recent future. LESSONS: Course of Coronavirus Disease 19 is relatively longer, and failure rate of simple early extubation seemes higher. To reduce the likelihood of reintubation and iatrogenic injury, individualized assessment is recommended.","Zhang, Jingchen; He, Xujian; Hu, Jia; Li, Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),,163
265662,What Is a Coronavirus?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients and its association with adverse outcomes including mortality in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. METHODS: A retrospective study conducted between February and June 2020 in Dubai, UAE, for all laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus disease-19 patients. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with and without acute cardiac injury. RESULTS: During the study period, 203 patients were included, of which, 44 (21.7%) had evidence of acute cardiac injury. Compared with patients without acute cardiac injury, patients with acute cardiac injury were: older, had more shortness of breath, diabetes, hypertension, and more bilateral airspace shadowing on admission chest radiography. These patients also had a higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimers and lactate dehydrogenase but lower lymphocyte count. Regarding outcomes, these patients had higher intensive care admissions; a higher rate of complications including acute kidney and liver injury, acidosis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, needed more mechanical ventilation, and had a significantly higher risk of death. CONCLUSION: Acute cardiac injury is common among Coronavirus disease-19 patients. These patients present with higher comorbidities, have high inflammatory markers and have greater risk for in-hospital multi-organ damage, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. Prompt full assessment and intervention are recommended.","Naeem, Kashif B; Hachim, Mahmood Y; Hachim, Ibrahim Y; Chkhis, Ayman; Quadros, Rajesh; Hannawi, Haifa; Al Salmi, Issa; Alokaily, Fahdah; Hannawi, Suad",Saudi Med J,,163

Covid-19 leads to respiratory illnesses ranging from mild infections to pneumonia and lung failure. Strikingly, within a few months of its first report, Covid-19 has spread worldwide at an exceptionally high speed and it has caused enormous human casualties. As yet, there is no specific treatment for Covid-19. Designing inhibitory drugs that can interfere with the viral entry process constitutes one of the main preventative therapies that could combat SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early stage. In this review, we provide a brief introduction of the main features of coronaviruses, discuss the entering mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells and review small molecules that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Specifically, we focus on small molecules, identified by experimental validation and/or computational prediction, that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the different host cell proteases that activate viral fusion. Given the persistent rise in Covid-19 cases to date, efforts should be directed towards validating the therapeutic effectiveness of these identified small molecule inhibitors.","Al Adem, Kenana; Shanti, Aya; Stefanini, Cesare; Lee, Sungmun",,,163

DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed using the following search terms: ECMO, ARDS, sedation, COVID-19, coronavirus, opioids, analgesia, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant clinical and pharmacokinetic studies were considered. All studies included were published between January 1988 and March 2021. DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 may progress to requiring VV-ECMO support. Agents frequently used for sedation and analgesia in these patients have been shown to have significant adsorption to ECMO circuitry, leading to possible diminished clinical efficacy. Use of hydromorphone-based analgesia has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients on VV-ECMO. However, safety and efficacy regarding use of other agents in this patient population remains an area of further research. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review addresses clinical challenges associated with sedation management in COVID-19 patients requiring VV-ECMO support and provides potential strategies to overcome these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Historically, sedation and analgesia management in patients requiring ECMO support have posed a challenge for bedside clinicians given the unique physiological and pharmacokinetic changes in this patient population. A multimodal strategy to managing analgesia and sedation should be used, and the use of enteral agents may play a role in reducing parenteral agent requirements.","Dreucean, Diane; Harris, Jesse E; Voore, Prakruthi; Donahue, Kevin R",Ann Pharmacother,,163

Dynamics and numerical approximations for the proposed fractional-order model are studied. Firstly, positivity and boundedness of the model are established. Secondly, the basic reproduction number of the model is calculated by using the next generation matrix approach. Then, asymptotic stability of the model is investigated. Lastly, we apply the adaptive predictor–corrector algorithm and fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) method to simulate the proposed model. Consequently, a set of numerical simulations are performed to support the validity of the theoretical results.

267844,Immunized by irony,2020,"The COVID-19 crisis profoundly disguised the vulnerability of human societies and healthcare systems in the situation of a pandemic. In many instances, it became evident that the quick and safe reduction of viral load and spread is the foremost principle in the successful management of such a pandemic. However, it became also clear that many of the established routines in healthcare are not always sufficient to cope with the increased demand for decontamination procedures of items, healthcare products, and even infected tissues. For the last 25 years, the use of gas plasma technology has sparked a tremendous amount of literature on its decontaminating properties, especially for heat-labile targets, such as polymers and tissues, where chemical decontamination often is not appropriate. However, while the majority of earlier work focused on bacteria, only relatively few reports are available on the inactivation of viruses. We here aim to provide a perspective for the general audience of the chances and opportunities of gas plasma technology for supporting healthcare during viral pandemics such as the COVID-19 crisis. This includes possible real-world plasma applications, appropriate laboratory viral test systems, and critical points on the technical and safety requirements of gas plasmas for virus inactivation.","Bekeschus, Sander; Kramer, Axel; Suffredini, Elisabetta; Von Woedtke, Thomas; Colombo, Vittorio",IEEE Trans.

This past year, Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs converted to online interviews and virtual visits for all applicants. Given the unpredictable nature of this pandemic, it remains unclear when or if conventional travel for residency interviews will resume. Therefore, it is important to reflect on this past season and look ahead to our next recruitment and interview cycle. Here, we review prior publications studying faculty and applicant experiences with web-based interviewing strategies, and we describe our own residency program's recruitment strategy for a virtual interview season, including survey results of reactions by both interviewers and candidates following our first season in this new era of virtual meetings and interviews. Web-based recruitment and interviews are feasible and can be done well with careful planning and preparation of those involved. Concerns persist primarily among applicants that virtual visits to a training program are inadequate for providing sufficient information prior to ranking. Regardless of future travel restrictions, GME programs will likely benefit all stakeholders by offering web-based recruitment and interviews, while also providing opportunities for optional in-person visits.","Yee, Janis M; Moran, Shamus; Chapman, Teresa",Acad. radiol,,163

Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. Methods: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). Results: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. Discussion: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. Conclusion: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","Santana, Rui; Sousa, Joana Santos; Soares, Patrícia; Lopes, Sílvia; Boto, Paulo; Rocha, João Victor",Port J Public Health,,163

280924,Process Intensification for the Purification of Peptidomimetics: The Case of Icatibant through Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP),2021,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all European countries were hit, but mortality rates were heterogenous, with some countries being hit very hard, while others including Greece had a much lower death rate during the first wave of spring 2020. The ultra-fast application of measures was probably the reason of this outstanding success. This outbreak is expected to trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress, as responses to an extreme threat for the community and the individual. In addition, changes in social behavior, as well as in working conditions, daily habits and routine, are expected to impose further stress, especially with the expectation of an upcoming economic crisis and possible unemployment. In Greece, where the lockdown was extremely successful in terms of containing the outbreak, worries concerning the possible adverse effects on mental health were also predominant. A collaboration concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was established, between the Aristotle University School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association. Two large multinational studies were launched, one concerning the general population and one university students. Students' mental health is an area of special interest, both because of the vulnerability of this age group as well as because any disruption during the time of the studies has profound long-term consequences in the lives of the individuals, and this might trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress. According the results from the Greek arm of the students' study, during the lockdown, two-thirds of university students reported at least 'much' increase in anxiety, one third in depressive feelings and in 2.59% concerning suicidal thoughts. There was also a worsening of quality of life and deterioration of lifestyle issues. Major depression was present in 12.43% with an additional 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Beliefs in conspiracy theories enjoyed wide acceptance ranging from 20-68%, with students of law, literature, pedagogics, political sciences and related studies manifesting higher acceptance rates. Female sex and depression/dysphoria both independently but also in interaction were related to higher rates of such beliefs. The results of the Greek arm of the general population study suggested that during the lockdown, clinical depression was present in 9.31%, with an additional 8.5% experiencing severe distress. Increased anxious and depressive emotions (including subclinical cases) were present in more than 40% of the population. In persons with a previous history of depression, 23.31% experienced depression vs. 8.96% of cases without previous history, who were experiencing their first depressive episode. Family dynamics suggested that fewer conflicts and better quality of relationships were surprisingly related to higher anxiety and depressive emotions, higher rates of depression and distress, and greater rates of suicidal thoughts. Eventually, spiritual and religious affiliation could protect the individual from the emerging suicidal thoughts. As correlation does not imply causation, the results suggest that conspiracy theories could be either the cause of depression or on the contrary a coping mechanism against depression. After taking into consideration that also in the family environment the expression of anger seemed to be a protective factor, the most likely explanation could be that the beliefs in conspiracy theories are a coping and 'protective' mechanism against the emergence of depression. These studies were among the first published, they went deeper in the data collection and even led to the creation of a model with distinct stages for the development of mental disorders during the lockdown. The analysis of the international data will probably provide further insight into the prevalence of mental disorders and the universal but also culturally specific models and factors pertaining to their development. At the time this editorial was in press, more than 40 countries representing more than two thirds of earth's population were participating with more than 45,000 responses already gathered.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Exadactylos, Athanasios; Anastasiadis, Kyriakos; Papaioannou, Nikolaos; Javed, Afzal",Psychiatriki,,163

281984,Multiple imputation and direct estimation for qPCR data with non-detects,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (eg, hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients' medical history, thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative cohort of patients, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (ie, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit, or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and noncomplicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. RESULTS: Of the 4353 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all age &#8805;18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (eg, males &#8805;65 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.94, 95% CI 1.55-5.58; P=.01) as well as cognitive and neurological disorders (eg, individuals &#8805;65 years old: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69-4.17; P<.001) are significant risk factors. Smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression as well as cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment and recovery efforts.","Yanover, Chen; Mizrahi, Barak; Kalkstein, Nir; Marcus, Karni; Akiva, Pinchas; Barer, Yael; Shalev, Varda; Chodick, Gabriel",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,163

We review the cardiac presentations, in-hospital outcomes and development of cardiovascular complications in the initial cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, UK. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 498 COVID-19 positive adult admissions to our institute from 7 March to 7 April 2020. Patient data were collected for baseline demographics, comorbidities and in-hospital outcomes, especially relating to cardiovascular intervention. RESULTS: Mean age was 67.4±16.1 years and 62.2% (n=310) were male. 64.1% (n=319) of our cohort had underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) with 53.4% (n=266) having hypertension. 43.2%(n=215) developed acute myocardial injury. Mortality was significantly increased in those patients with myocardial injury (47.4% vs 18.4%, p<0.001). Only four COVID-19 patients had invasive coronary angiography, two underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and one required a permanent pacemaker implantation. 7.0% (n=35) of patients had an inpatient echocardiogram. Acute myocardial injury (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.40, p=0.005) and history of hypertension (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.55, p=0.049) approximately doubled the odds of in-hospital mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 after other variables had been controlled for. CONCLUSION: Hypertension, pre-existing CVD and acute myocardial injury were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in our cohort of COVID-19 patients. However, only a low number of patients required invasive cardiac intervention.","Khawaja, Saud Ahmed; Mohan, Poornima; Jabbour, Richard; Bampouri, Theodora; Bowsher, Gemma; Hassan, Ahmed M M; Huq, Farhan; Baghdasaryan, Lilit; Wang, Brian; Sethi, Amarjit; Sen, Sayan; Petraco, Ricardo; Ruparelia, Neil; Nijjer, Sukhjinder; Malik, Iqbal; Foale, Rodney; Bellamy, Michael; Kooner, Jaspal; Rana, Bushra; Cole, Graham; Sutaria, Nilesh; Kanaganayagam, Gajen; Nihoyannopoulos, Petros; Fox, Kevin; Plymen, Carla; Pabari, Punam; Howard, Luke; Davies, Rachel; Haji, Gulammehdi; Lo Giudice, Francesco; Kanagaratnam, Prapa; Anderson, Jon; Chukwuemeka, Andrew; Khamis, Ramzi; Varnava, Amanda; Baker, Christopher S R; Francis, Darrel Parthipan; Asaria, Perviz; Al-Lamee, Rasha; Mikhail, Ghada W",,,163
286498,"4,4'-Diaminodiphenyl Sulfone (DDS) as an Inflammasome Competitor",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe COVID-19 illness in adults has been linked to underlying medical conditions. This study identified frequent underlying conditions and their attributable risk of severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: We used data from more than 800 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) to describe hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 from March 2020 through March 2021. We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate adjusted risk of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death associated with frequent conditions and total number of conditions. RESULTS: Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667 (11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension (50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity (33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27-1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25-1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24-1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.67) for patients with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45-4.23) for patients with more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions). CONCLUSION: Certain underlying conditions and the number of conditions were associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent, whereas obesity, diabetes with complication, and anxiety disorders were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness.

An in-depth investigation of the amino acid substitutions in the genomic signature of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is highly essential for understanding its host adaptation and infection biology. A total of 9587 SARS-CoV-2 structural protein sequences collected from 49 different countries are used to characterize protein-wise variants, substitution patterns (type and location), and major substitution changes. The majority of the substitutions are distinct, mostly in a particular location, and lead to a change in an amino acid's biochemical properties. In terms of mutational changes, envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are relatively more stable than nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. Several co-occurrence substitutions are observed, particularly in S and N proteins. Substitution specific to active sub-domains reveals that heptapeptide repeat, fusion peptides, transmembrane in S protein, and N-terminal and C-terminal domains in the N protein are remarkably mutated. We also observe a few deleterious mutations in the above domains.

DESIGN: A Finite Mixture Model (FMM) is used to uncover a mix of two latent groups of hospitals that differ in quality. In the FMM, a multinomial logistic equation relates hospital-level factors to the odds of being in either group. And a multiple linear regression relates the characteristics of communities served by hospitals to the patients' expected ratings of their experiences at hospitals in each group. Thus, this association potentially varies with hospital quality. The analysis was conducted via Stata. SETTING: Hospital Ratings are measured by Hospital Compare using the HCAHPS survey, a patient satisfaction survey required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for hospitals in the United States.

In Germany, university students had to shift from in-person group learning in lectures and seminars to new forms of e-learning and distance teaching. Even before COVID-19, stress was a common experience among university students, and these changes have reinforced students' stress levels. Based on a sample of n = 110 German university students, this study explores whether students' perceived stress levels in summer term 2020 differed from their perceived stress levels in preceding academic terms. The results show that students experienced lower levels of stress and higher levels of joy in summer term 2020 compared to preceding academic terms.

Much of the research has been focused on minimizing transmission in hospitals and in the general community. However, a particularly vulnerable community that has received relatively little attention is elders residing in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). In this article we address this relative lack of attention, arguing that enhanced traffic control bundling (eTCB) can and should be adopted and implemented as a means of protecting LTCF residents and staff. Enhanced TCB has been widely applied in hospital settings and has proven effective at limiting droplet and fomite transmissions both within hospitals and between hospitals and the general community. By effectively adapting eTCB to LTCF conditions, particularly by incorporating compartmentalization within zones plus active surveillance, COVID-19 transmission into and throughout LTCFs can be minimized, thereby saving numerous lives among an especially vulnerable population.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Schwartz, Jonathan; King, Chwan-Chuen; Lee, Chung-Ming; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,163
301776,Educación artística más allá del coronavirus: diálogo con Estitxu,2020,"Information obtained from autopsies of patients infected with high-risk pathogens is an important pillar in managing a proper response to pandemics, particular in the early phase. This is due to the fact that autopsy allows efficient evaluation of comorbidities for risk assessment, as well as identification of key pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms in organs driving the severity of disease which might be important targets for therapeutic interventions. In the case of patients who have died of infection with unknown pathogens, isolation and culture of pathogens from the affected organs is another important opportunity for a proper response to (re)emerging infectious diseases. However, the situation of COVID-19 demonstrated that there were concerns about performing autopsies because of biosafety risks. In this review we compare requirements for biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories from the European Commission and the World Health Organization and summarize specific recommendations for postmortem analysis of COVID-19-deceased patients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, we describe in detail a BSL-3 facility with enhanced protection of personnel and an environment that has been designed for performing autopsies, biobanking of collected tissue specimens, and culture of pathogens in cases of high-risk pathogen infections and report on the experience obtained in operating this facility in the context of COVID-19.","Loibner, Martina; Langner, Christine; Regitnig, Peter; Gorkiewicz, Gregor; Zatloukal, Kurt",Pathobiology,,163

304333,Expanding our understanding of the role polyprotein conformation plays in the coronavirus life cycle,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The standard RT-PCR assay for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is laborious and time-consuming, limiting testing availability. Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive; however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely. The objective of this study was to determine the performance of the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study was carried out in ten Spanish university hospitals and included individuals with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria of COVID-19. Only individuals with &#8804;7 days from the onset of symptoms or from exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 were included. Two nasopharyngeal samples were taken to perform the PanbioRT as a point-of-care test and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. RESULTS: Among the 958 patients studied, 325 (90.5%) had true-positive results. The overall sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% (95%CI 87.5-93.6) and 98.8% (95%CI 98-99.7), respectively. Sensitivity in participants who had a threshold cycle (CT) < 25 for the RT-PCR test was 99.5% (95%CI 98.4-100), and in participants with &#8804;5 days of the clinical course it was 91.8% (95%CI 88.8-94.8). Agreement between techniques was 95.7% (&#954; score 0.90; 95%CI 0.88-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: The PanbioRT performs well clinically, with even more reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral load. The results must be interpreted based on the local epidemiological context.","Merino, Paloma; Guinea, Jesús; Muñoz-Gallego, Irene; González-Donapetry, Patricia; Galán, Juan Carlos; Antona, Nerea; Cilla, Gustavo; Hernáez-Crespo, Silvia; Díaz-de Tuesta, José Luis; Gual-de Torrella, Ana; González-Romo, Fernando; Escribano, Pilar; Sánchez-Castellano, Miguel Ángel; Sota-Busselo, Mercedes; Delgado-Iribarren, Alberto; García, Julio; Cantón, Rafael; Muñoz, Patricia; Folgueira, María Dolores; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Oteo-Iglesias, Jesús",Clin. microbiol. infect,,163

The COVID-19 pandemic pushed telemedicine from small and pilot programs to widespread practice at an unprecedented rate. With the rapid implementation of telemedicine, it is important to consider how to create a telehealth system that provides both good care for patients and families while maintaining an excellent education environment for trainees of all levels. To this end, we developed telemedicine educational milestones to describe novel skills required to provide high quality telemedicine care, and allow trainees and clinical educators a metric by which to assess trainee progress. We also created methods and tools to help trainees learn and families feel comfortable in their new role as virtual collaborators. We envision a time when safety does not set the venue; instead the needs of the patient will dictate whether a virtual or in-person visit is the right choice for a family. We expect that pediatric medical genetics and metabolism groups across the country will continue to set a standard of a hybrid care system to meet the unique needs of each individual patient, using telemedicine technology.","Cohen, Andrea J; Shur, Natasha; Starin, Danielle; MacLeod, Erin; Roshan Lal, Tamanna; Leon, Eyby; Regier, Debra S",,,163

Meanwhile, increased demand for testing has led to a shortage of reagents and supplies and compromised the performance of diagnostic laboratories in many countries. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend multi-step RT-PCR assays using multiple primer and probe pairs, which might complicate the interpretation of the test results, especially for borderline cases. In this study, we describe an alternative RT-PCR approach for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be used for the probe-based detection of clinical isolates in diagnostics as well as in research labs using a low-cost SYBR green method. For the evaluation, we used samples from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and performed RT-PCR assays along with successive dilutions of RNA standards to determine the limit of detection. We identified an M-gene binding primer and probe pair highly suitable for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for diagnostic and research purposes.","Toptan, Tuna; Hoehl, Sebastian; Westhaus, Sandra; Bojkova, Denisa; Berger, Annemarie; Rotter, Björn; Hoffmeier, Klaus; Cinatl, Jindrich; Ciesek, Sandra; Widera, Marek",,,163
307649,Coronaviruses - a new old menace,2020,"Recombination is crucial for chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. SPATA22, along with its direct binding partner and functional collaborator, MEIOB, is essential for the proper repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiotic recombination. Here, we describe a novel point-mutated allele (shani) of mouse Spata22 that we isolated in a forward genetic screen. shani mutant mice phenocopy Spata22-null and Meiob-null mice: mutant cells appear to form DSBs and initiate meiotic recombination, but are unable to complete DSB repair, leading to meiotic prophase arrest, apoptosis and sterility. shani mutants show precocious loss of DMC1 foci and improper accumulation of BLM-positive recombination foci, reinforcing the requirement of SPATA22-MEIOB for the proper progression of meiotic recombination events. The shani mutation lies within a Spata22 coding exon and molecular characterization shows that it leads to incorrect splicing of the Spata22 mRNA, ultimately resulting in no detectable SPATA22 protein. We propose that the shani mutation alters an exonic splicing enhancer element (ESE) within the Spata22 transcript. The affected DNA nucleotide is conserved in most tetrapods examined, suggesting that the splicing regulation we describe here may be a conserved feature of Spata22 regulation.","Petrillo, Cynthia; Barroca, Vilma; Ribeiro, Jonathan; Lailler, Nathalie; Livera, Gabriel; Keeney, Scott; Martini, Emmanuelle; Jain, Devanshi",Chromosoma,,163

This study aimed to understand the influences of COVID-19 on different comorbidities and vice versa through network-based gene expression analyses. Using the shared dysregulated genes, we identified key genetic determinants and signaling pathways that may involve in their shared pathogenesis. The COVID-19 showed significant upregulation of 93 genes and downregulation of 15 genes. Interestingly, it shares 28, 17, 6 and 7 genes with diabetes mellitus (DM), lung cancer (LC), myocardial infarction and hypertension, respectively. Importantly, COVID-19 shared three upregulated genes (i.e. MX2, IRF7 and ADAM8) with DM and LC. Conversely, downregulation of two genes (i.e. PPARGC1A and METTL7A) was found in COVID-19 and LC. Besides, most of the shared pathways were related to inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we identified six potential biomarkers and several important regulatory factors, e.g. transcription factors and microRNAs, while notable drug candidates included captopril, rilonacept and canakinumab. Moreover, prognostic analysis suggests concomitant COVID-19 may result in poor outcome of LC patients. This study provides the molecular basis and routes of the COVID-19 progression due to comorbidities.

Numerous studies on ARC show that its beneficial health effects correlate with the health effects of both BGP and B. dracunculifolia. Its wide range of pharmacological benefits include antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-cancer effects. Most studies have focused on anti-oxidation, inflammation, diabetic, and cancers using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Mechanisms underlying anti-cancer properties of ARC are apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a protein characterized in many human diseases/disorders including COVID-19 infection. Therefore, further pre-clinical and clinical studies with ARC are necessary to explore its potential as intervention for a wide variety of diseases including the recent pandemic coronaviral infection. This review summarizes the comprehensive data on the pharmacological effects of ARC and could be a guideline for its future study and therapeutic usage.","Shahinozzaman, Md; Basak, Bristy; Emran, Rashiduzzaman; Rozario, Patricia; Obanda, Diana N",Fitoterapia,,163
316172,"DPL: a comprehensive database on sequences, structures, sources and functions of peptide ligands",2020,"The neuropeptide oxytocin has attracted great attention of the general public, basic neuroscience researchers, psychologists, and psychiatrists due to its profound pro-social, anxiolytic, and ""anti-stress"" behavioral and physiological effects, and its potential application for treatment of mental diseases associated with altered socio-emotional competence. During the last decade, substantial progress has been achieved in understanding the complex neurobiology of the oxytocin system, including oxytocinergic pathways, local release patterns, and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain, as well as intraneuronal oxytocin receptor signaling. However, the picture of oxytocin actions remains far from being complete, and the central question remains: ""How does a single neuropeptide exert such pleotropic actions?"" Although this phenomenon, typical for many of about 100 identified neuropeptides, may emerge from the anatomical divergence of oxytocin neurons, their multiple central projections, distinct oxytocin-sensitive cell types in different brain regions, and multiple intraneuronal signaling pathways determining the specific cellular response, further basic studies are required. In conjunction, numerous reports on positive effects of intranasal application of oxytocin on human brain networks controlling socio-emotional behavior in health and disease require harmonic tandems of basic researchers and clinicians. During the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, oxytocin research seems central as question of social isolation-induced inactivation of the oxytocin system, and buffering effects of either activation of the endogenous system or intranasal application of synthetic oxytocin need to be thoroughly investigated.","Grinevich, Valery; Neumann, Inga D",Mol. psychiatry,,163

318302,The administration of vaccines,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To meet hospital preparedness for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ACR recommended delay of all nonemergent tests and elective procedures. The purpose of this article is to report our experience for rescheduling nonemergent imaging and procedures during the pandemic at our tertiary academic institution. METHODS: We rescheduled the nonemergent imaging and procedures in our hospitals and outpatient centers from March 16 to May 4, 2020. We created a tiered priority system to reschedule patients for whom imaging could be delayed with minimal clinical impact. The radiologists performed detailed chart reviews for decision making. We conducted daily virtual huddles with discussion of rescheduling strategies and issue tracking. RESULTS: Using a snapshot during the rescheduling period, there was a 53.4% decrease in imaging volume during the period of March 16 to April 15, 2020, compared with the same time period in 2019. The total number of imaging studies decreased from 38,369 in 2019 to 17,891 in 2020 during this period. Although we saw the largest reduction in outpatient imaging (72.3%), there was also a significant decrease in inpatient (40.5%) and emergency department (48.9%) imaging volumes. DISCUSSION: The use of multiple communication channels was critical in relaying the information to all our stakeholders, patients, referring physicians, and the radiology workforce. Teamwork, quick adoption, and adaptation of changing strategies was important given the fluidity of the situation.","Vagal, Achala; Mahoney, Mary; Allen, Becky; Kapur, Sangita; Udstuen, Gavin; Wang, Lily; Braley, Susan; Makramalla, Abouelmagd; Chadalavada, Seetharam; Choe, Kyuran A; Scheler, Jennifer; Brown, Ann; England, Eric; Hudepohl, Joseph; Rybicki, Frank J",J Am Coll Radiol,,163

Hyperglycemia occurring in the setting of either previously diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes is known to be associated with poor outcomes. Here, we aim to provide a simple and practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in admitted patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The guidance is formulated based on experience of authors and relevant literature on the subject searched using Pubmed. RESULTS: Every patient admitted to a COVID care facility should be investigated for hyperglycemia using a combination of tests including capillary blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral glucose lowering drugs can be considered in patients with mild COVID illness who have mild hyperglycemia [pre-meal blood glucose of <180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L) and post-meal blood glucose of <250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/L)] and no contraindication to the use of these agents.. All patients with moderate-severe disease and/or hyperglycemia of greater severity should be initiated on insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively screened for and managed in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids. CONCLUSION: This document provides a broad overview on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia at COVID care facilities and should be useful to a wide range of healthcare personnel involved in care of patients with COVID-19.","Gupta, Yashdeep; Goyal, Alpesh; Kubihal, Suraj; Golla, Kiran Kumar; Tandon, Nikhil",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,163

DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. METHODS: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). RESULTS: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81% (95% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44% (95% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70% (95% CI: 24.63-33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.","Zhu, Siyi; Gao, Qiang; Yang, Lin; Yang, Yonghong; Xia, Wenguang; Cai, Xiguo; Hui, Yanping; Zhu, Di; Zhang, Yanyan; Zhang, Guiqing; Wu, Shuang; Wang, Yiliang; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Liu, Hongfei; Zhang, Changjie; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Jianrong; Feng, Mei; Ni, Zhong; Chen, Baoyu; Du, Chunping; He, Hongchen; Qu, Yun; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi; Reinhardt, Jan D",PLoS One,,163

In Spring 2020, when ongoing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics, the Veneto Region (V-R) has proposed setting-up an anti-SARS-CoV-2 CP (CCP) Bank, with the aim of preparing a supply of CCP immediately available in case of subsequest epidemic waves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Key-points to be developed for a quick set-up of the V-R CCP Bank have been recruitment of donors recovered from COVID-19 infection, laboratory analysis for the biological qualification of the CCP units, including titre of neutralizing antibodies and reduction of pathogens, according to National Blood Centre (CNS) Directives, adaptation of the V-R Information Technology systems and cost analysis. Some activities, including diagnostic and viral inactivation processes, have been centralized in 2 or 3 sites. Laboratory analysis upon preliminary admission of the donor included all tests required by the Italian laws and the CNS directives. RESULTS: From April to August 2020, 3,298 people have contacted the V-R Blood Transfusion Services: of these, 1,632 have been evaluated and examined as first time donors and those found to be suitable have carried out 955 donations, from which 2,626 therapeutic fractions have been obtained, at a cost around 215,00 Euro. Since October 2020, the number of COVID-19 inpatients has had a surge with a heavy hospital overload. Moreover, the high request of CCP therapy by clinicians has been just as unexpected, showing a wide therapeutic use. CONCLUSIONS: The organizational model here presented, which has allowed the rapid collection of a large amount of CCP, could be useful when facing new pandemic outbreaks, especially in low and middle income countries, with generally acceptable costs.","De Silvestro, Giustina; Gandini, Giorgio; Fiorin, Francesco; Marson, Piero; Barbone, Ersilia; Frigato, Andrea; Gessoni, Gianluca; Veronesi, Arianna; Pacenti, Monia; Castelli, Monica; Rinaldi, Marianna; Rizzi, Monica; Stefani, Francesca; Roveroni, Giovanni",Transfus Apher Sci,,163

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks.

Study Design: Literature Review Methods: This literature review compares eight different rapid (minutes/hours) real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen tests with laboratory-controlled RTPCR quantitative assays (days) to determine positive predictive agreement (PPA) and negative predictive agreement (NPA) through studies found on PubMed using keywords The laboratorycontrolled RT-PCR tests were used as a reference because of their quantitative accurate approach The RT-PCR-based Abbott ID NOW® was the most featured rapid test because it is used at several rapid testing sites Results: Over 1300 tests conducted with the Abbott ID NOW® showed 78 7% PPA and almost 100% NPA with an average test time of 13 minutes The Cepheid Xpert Xpress®, another RT-PCR-based rapid qualitative test, had a much higher PPA of 98% but had only 96% NPA with 45-minute test time Among the antigen tests, the immunofluorescence-based Bioeasy test had the most accuracy with 93 9% PPA and 100% NPA but the median cycle threshold was 17 1 Conclusion: With the most commonly used rapid test having &lt;80% PPA, there is room for improvement in COVID-19 point-of-care testing;however, other rapid tests have the drawbacks of longer wait time or inability to detect low viral load Thus, patients receiving a negative result on a rapid COVID-19 test, may follow-up with a quantitative test to confirm","Arrighi, S.; Duque, A.; Deb, S.",JACCP Journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy,,163

327095,Stable and Efficient Nanofilm Pure Evaporation on Nanopillar Surfaces,2021,BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic necessitates a rapid reorganization of the hospital procedures. The establishment of centers dedicated to COVID-19 treatment and care also necessitates preparation of the surgical departments for the forthcoming emergency interventions for infected patients and patients with an unclear infection status. This article summarizes the evidence on standards for personal protective equipment for personnel in the central emergency admission department and in the operations area as well as restructuring measures for the procedures in the operations area in a COVID-plus area. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out. RESULTS: The grey area of unknown infected and potential transmitters of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is high. Patients with an unclear infection status or who are highly suspected of having an infection should be classified as infectious until the contrary can be proven. The protection of personnel in healthcare professions against infections is of particular importance. The supply of adequate personal protective equipment in a risk-stratified form can substantially influence the success of combating the pandemic. Most operations must be assessed as aerosol-forming procedures and necessitate the maximum protection of personnel working directly on the patient. Particular attention should be paid to obligatory hygiene regulatory measures for protection against contamination during the reorganization in the operations area and on the transport routes between the wards. CONCLUSION: The correct personal protective equipment considering the occupational safety helps to sustainably protect personnel from infections. Reorganizational measures in the operating room are urgently indicated for potential aerosol-forming procedures in infected patients or patients with an unclear infection status. The current dynamic situation necessitates a high level of flexibility as well as reassessment and adaptation of the measures at short intervals.,"Schnitzbauer, Andreas A; Kempf, Volkhard A J; Hack, Daniel; Ciesek, Sandra; Meier, Simon; Vehreschild, Maria J G T; Wicker, Sabine; Kippke, Ulf; Graf, Jürgen; Marzi, Ingo",Chirurg,,163
327158,Kinetic evaluation of sterically hindered amines under partial oxy‐combustion conditions,2020,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an &#945;-coronavirus causing severe diarrhea and high mortality rates in suckling piglets and posing significant economic impact. PEDV replication is completed and results in a large amount of RNA in the cytoplasm. Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytosolic RNA granules formed under various stress conditions, including viral infections. Several previous studies suggested that SGs were involved in the antiviral activity of host cells to limit viral propagation. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the SG response to PEDV infection. SG formation is induced early during PEDV infection, but as infection proceeds, this ability is lost and SGs disappear at late stages of infection (>18 h postinfection). PEDV infection resulted in the cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) mediated by caspase-8. Using mutational analysis, the PEDV-induced cleavage site within G3BP1 was identified, which differed from the 3C protease cleavage site previously identified. Furthermore, G3BP1 cleavage by caspase-8 at D168 and D169 was confirmed in vitro as well as in vivo The overexpression of cleavage-resistant G3BP1 conferred persistent SG formation and suppression of viral replication. Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous G3BP1 abolished SG formation and potentiated viral replication. Taken together, these data provide new insights into novel strategies in which PEDV limits the host stress response and antiviral responses and indicate that caspase-8-mediated G3BP1 cleavage is important in the failure of host defense against PEDV infection.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are drawing extensive attention again since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019. CoVs are prone to variation and own the transmission capability by crossing the species barrier resulting in reemergence. How CoVs manipulate the antiviral responses of their hosts needs to be explored. Overall, the study provides new insight into how porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) impaired SG assembly by targeting G3BP1 via the host proteinase caspase-8. These findings enhanced the understanding of PEDV infection and might help identify new antiviral targets that could inhibit viral replication and limit the pathogenesis of PEDV.","Sun, Liumei; Chen, Huan; Ming, Xin; Bo, Zongyi; Shin, Hyun-Jin; Jung, Yong-Sam; Qian, Yingjuan",J. virol,,163

In the past weeks, the administration of vaccines has started in different parts of the world sustaining the hype of significantly containing the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the rapid time lapse from vaccine development to distribution has raised several concerns on its safety and efficacy. This topic is particularly felt by patients with chronic conditions and immumodulating therapies that could compromise their immune system such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we explore the potential future implications of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines introduction in the IBD field, touching upon the clinical experience coming from available data on vaccinations against other infections. We also dissect the factors associated with the acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, describing the possible strategies that gastroenterologist should adopt to reach the highest rate of vaccinations in IBD patients.","Papa, Alfredo; Scaldaferri, Franco; Vetrone, Lorenzo Maria; Neri, Matteo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo",,,163

We aimed to investigate the mental health status of staff at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, the largest hospital specializing in infectious diseases in Wuhan. A total of 507 staff members (82.64% were female, age: mean = 37.53, SD = 10.08) in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital were recruited from March 15, 2020, to May 1, 2020. Questionnaires of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale), and ISI (Insomnia Severity Index) were adopted. The results showed 39.64%,19.53%, and 6.90% had mild, moderate, and moderate-severe depression, respectively. In addition, 41.03%, 10.45%, and 3.94% had mild, moderate, and moderate-severe anxiety, respectively, and 27.02% and 12.03% had mild and moderate-severe insomnia, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression models revealed that those unmarried and females were more likely to exhibit depression symptoms, while being a nurse, having a normal body mass index, and not experiencing severe acute respiratory syndrome increased the likelihood for insomnia.","Huang, Xin; Liang, Yiming; Eli, Buzohre; Yang, Yufang; Han, Ru; Liu, Zhengkui",Asia Pac J Public Health,,163

The usual intervention was based on two daily 8-min sessions of slow intermittent in-home walking prescribed in circa-monthly hospital visits. During the lockdown, the program was updated by phone. Six-minute (6MWD) and pain-free walking distance (PFWD) were measured pre- and post-lockdown as well as body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Sixty-six patients were measured 117 ± 23 days after their previous visit. A safe, pain-free execution of the prescribed sessions was reported (median distance: 74 km). Overall, the 6MWD was stable, while PFWD improved (p < 0.001). The improvement was not related to age/gender, comorbidities, type of home but to the time of enrollment before lockdown. The new-entry subjects (&#8804; 3 months; n = 35) obtained significant improvements post-lockdown for 6MWD and PFWD, while those previously enrolled (> 3 months; n = 31) were stable. Decreased BW with stable BP and ABI values were also recorded, with better outcomes for new-entry subjects. In PAD patients, a structured walking program performed inside home and purposely guided by phone was adhered to by patients and favored mobility and risk factor control during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of walking ability, type of home and external conditions.","Lamberti, Nicola; Straudi, Sofia; Manfredini, Roberto; De Giorgi, Alfredo; Gasbarro, Vincenzo; Zamboni, Paolo; Manfredini, Fabio",Intern. emerg. med,,163

Despite abundant data on that many COVID-19 patients also displayed kidney disease, there is limited information available about the recovery of kidney disease after discharge. METHODS: Retrospective and prospective cohort study to patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization, admitted between January 28 to February 26, 2020. The median follow-up was 4 months after discharge. The follow-up patients were divided into the recovery group and non-recovery group. Descriptive statistics and between-groups comparison were used. RESULTS: In total, 143 discharged patients with new-onset kidney disease during the COVID-19 hospitalization were included. Patients had a median age was 64 (IQR, 51-70) years, and 59.4% of patients were men. During 4-months median follow-up, 91% (130 of 143) patients recovered from kidney disease, and 9% (13 of 143) patients haven't recovered. The median age of patients in the non-recovery group was 72 years, which was significantly higher than the median age of 62 years in the recovery group. Discharge serum creatinine was significantly higher in the non-recovery group than in the recovery group. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the new-onset kidney diseases during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients recovered 4 months after discharge. We recommend that COVID-19 patients with new-onset kidney disease be followed after discharge to assess kidney recovery, especially elderly patients or patients with high discharge creatinine.","Zhang, N.

345283,The development of a vaccine - a highly regulated process,2021,"Individualized lung-protective ventilation strategy is essential for patients with COVID-19. In this study, a wireless, low-power and miniaturized electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system was developed for remote and long-term monitoring of lung ventilation for patients with COVID-19 in the isolation ward of ICU. A new strategy of combining filtering and improved voltage-controlled current was employed to design the current source for a simplified system structure, and a new differential receiver circuit consisting of a buffer amplification and a differential amplification was proposed to design the voltage measurement unit for high precision. Moreover, a Bluetooth interface was adopted for wireless data transmission, and components characterized by low power consumption were selected to minimize the system power consumption. The proposed EIT system occupies a total size of 6.5*4.5*0.6 cm3 and can work stably within 25 m from the wireless terminal installed with host EIT software. The system has a signal-to-noise of 70 dB at 50 kHz, stability of 0.1% relative change, and power consumption of 114 mW, as tested with a resistor phantom. Further, a comparison between the proposed system and a commercial ICU EIT device was conducted on nine healthy volunteers for ventilation monitoring. The correlation between lung volume and relative impedance changes was higher than 0.9 for both EIT systems (p&#x003C;0.001). The analysis of the corresponding EIT images revealed that both systems delivered comparable images in terms of linearity, repeatability and regional ventilation distribution. The test and experimental results suggested that the proposed system could conveniently provide reliable data acquisition for remote and long-term lung ventilation monitoring.

METHODS: We gathered epidemiological and clinical data from individuals with confirmed COVID-19, via interviews and inpatient medical records, and we did field investigations to assess interactions and possible modes of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Open source reports were obtained for overseas cases. We reported the median (IQR) incubation period of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: As of Feb 15, 2020, 36 cases of COVID-19 were linked epidemiologically to the first three clusters of circumscribed local transmission in Singapore. 425 close contacts were quarantined. Direct or prolonged close contact was reported among affected individuals, although indirect transmission (eg, via fomites and shared food) could not be excluded. The median incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 was 4 days (IQR 3-6). The serial interval between transmission pairs ranged between 3 days and 8 days. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible in community settings, and local clusters of COVID-19 are expected in countries with high travel volume from China before the lockdown of Wuhan and institution of travel restrictions.

We aimed at validating these findings in independent patient cohorts. METHODS: We obtained peripheral blood samples from 112 children with a new diagnosis of IBD (71 with Crohn's disease and 41 with ulcerative colitis) and 19 children without IBD (controls) and recorded medical information on disease activity and outcomes. CD8+ T cells were isolated from blood samples by magnetic bead sorting at the point of diagnosis and during the course of disease. Genome-wide transcription (n=192) and DNA methylation (n=66) profiles were generated using Affymetrix and Illumina arrays, respectively. Publicly available transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of CD8+ T cells from three adult patient cohorts with and without IBD were included in data analyses. RESULTS: Previously reported CD8+ T cell prognostic expression and exhaustion signatures were only found in the original adult IBD patient cohort. These signatures could not be detected either in a pediatric, or in a second adult IBD cohort. In contrast, an association between CD8+ T cell gene expression with age and sex was detected across all three cohorts. CD8+ gene transcription was clearly associated with IBD in the two cohorts that included non-IBD controls. Lastly, DNA methylation profiles of CD8+ T cells from children with Crohn's disease correlated with age but not with disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to validate previously reported findings of an association between CD8+ T cell gene transcription and disease outcome in IBD.

We analyzed the peripheral blood parameters of 169 COVID-19 patients and 131 influenza patients during the early-onset stage. Results from the patients with COVID-19 were compared with those from healthy controls and influenza patients. In addition, results from patients with common and severe COVID-19 were further compared. There were significant differences between COVID-19 and influenza patients in terms of age, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, percentage of lymphocytes, percentage of monocytes, percentage of eosinophils, percentage of basophils, neutrophil, count and monocyte count. Two parameters (monocyte count and percentage of basophils) were combined to clarify the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza and the area under the curve was found to be 0.772. Comparison of peripheral blood parameters from common COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and influenza patients revealed many differences during the early disease stages. The diagnostic formula developed by this study will be of benefit for physicians in the differentiation of COVID-19 and influenza.","Chen, Jiangnan; Pan, Yong; Li, Gangfeng; Xu, Wenfang; Zhang, Lihong; Yuan, Shijin; Xia, Yan; Lu, Pei; Zhang, Jun",J. med. virol,,163

358032,Editorial: Multiphase flow community must have a role in predicting host-to-host airborne contagion,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the available evidence on aerosol viral transmission risk during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and evaluate its impact on guidelines development and clinical activity worldwide during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: We performed a scoping review on PubMed, Cochrane, the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Clinical Trial Register, and the Grey Literature Repository databases, to identify reports on viral transmission via surgical smoke or aerosolisation. A systematic review of all available national and international guidelines was also performed to report their recommendations. Additionally, a worldwide transdisciplinary survey was performed to capture the actual compliance to dedicated guidelines and their impact on MIS activity. RESULTS: Based on a selection of 17 studies, there was no evidence to support the concerns of an intraoperative viral transmission via pneumoperitoneum aerosolisation. Most national surgical and urological societies either did address this topic or referred to international guidelines. The guidelines of the American College of Surgery, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section, recommended an avoidance of MIS due to an increased risk of intraoperative aerosol-enhanced transmission. The results of the survey completed by 334 respondents, from different surgical abdominal specialties, suggested a lack of compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a dissonance between contemporary guidelines and ongoing surgical activity, possibly due to the perceived lack of evidence. Recommendations regarding changes in clinical practice should be based on the best available research evidence and experience. A scoping review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms together with a survey showed that laparoscopic procedures do not seem to increase the risk of viral transmission. Nevertheless, the few publications and low quality of existing evidence limits the validity of the review.","Mun, Dong-Ho; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Remzi, Mesut",BJU int,,163

359408,Eight-Month-Old Infants' Perception of Possible and Impossible Events,2000,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the provision of elective and trauma orthopaedic surgery worldwide with millions of operations cancelled. The risk of patients developing COVID-19 after undergoing ambulatory procedures in hospitals is unknown. This paper aims to investigate the risk of developing COVID-19 from day-case and overnight stay upper limb procedures during the peak of the pandemic in London, and to discuss the implications for the safe management of elective hand and upper limb patients in the coming months. Methods: 56 patients underwent emergency trauma upper limb procedures as a day case or with a single overnight stay from 1st March to May 31, 2020 at two central London hospitals that were also key players in the pan-London COVID response. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical and theatre records. Patients were contacted post-operatively and answered a structured questionnaire, including whether patients had experienced any of the symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the 14 days prior or 30 days following surgery. Results: Of 56 patients, one patient reported COVID-19 symptoms, which were minor and did not require hospitalisation. Five patients experienced minor post-operative complications such as stiffness and scar hypersensitivity; one patient had a superficial wound infection. The mean age was 46 years (20–90) with 68% patients ASA I, 25% ASA II and 4% ASA III. 9% had LA, 30% a regional block and 61% had a GA. The most common operation was a distal radius open reduction and internal fixation. The average time spent in hospital was 11 h (3–34 h) and 12 patients required an overnight stay. The median length of face-to-face follow up was 38.5 days. Conclusion: Our study suggests that, with appropriate precautions, elective upper limb ambulatory surgery can be safely restarted with a low risk of contracting COVID-19 or its complications.","Trowbridge, Samuel; Wignadasan, Warran; Davenport, Dominic; Sarker, Shahrier; Hunter, Alistair; Gidwani, Sam",J.

362154,Dozens to be deliberately infected with coronavirus in UK 'human challenge' trials,2020,"AIMS: To estimate (1) associations between self-reported COVID-19, hand-washing, smoking status, e-cigarette use and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and (2) the extent to which COVID-19 has prompted smoking and vaping quit attempts and more smoking inside the home. DESIGN: Cross-sectional household surveys. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of the population in England from April to May 2020. The sample included 3179 adults aged &#8805; 18 years. MEASUREMENTS: Participants who reported that they definitely or thought they had coronavirus were classified as having self-reported COVID-19. Participants were asked how often they wash their hands after returning home, before preparing foods, before eating or before touching their face. They were also asked whether, due to COVID-19, they had (i) attempted to quit smoking, (ii) attempted to quit vaping and (iii) changed the amount they smoke inside the home. FINDINGS: Odds of self-reported COVID-19 were significantly greater among current smokers [20.9%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.73] and long-term (> 1-year) ex-smokers (16.1%, aOR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.05-1.68) compared with never smokers (14.5%). Recent (< 1-year) ex-smokers had non-significantly greater odds of self-reported COVID-19 (22.2%, aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.85-2.53). Bayes factors indicated there was sufficient evidence to rule out large differences in self-reported COVID-19 by NRT use and medium differences by e-cigarette use. With the exception of hand-washing before face-touching, engagement in hand-washing behaviours was high (> 85%), regardless of nicotine use. A minority (12.2%) of quit attempts in the past 3 months were reportedly triggered by COVID-19, and approximately one in 10 current e-cigarette users reported attempting to quit vaping because of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In England, current smokers and long-term ex-smokers appear to have higher odds of self-reported COVID-19 compared with never smokers in adjusted analyses, but there were no large differences between people who used nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes. Engagement in hand-washing appears to be high, regardless of nicotine or tobacco use. A minority of past-year smokers and current e-cigarette users, respectively, report attempting to quit smoking/vaping due to COVID-19.","Tattan-Birch, Harry; Perski, Olga; Jackson, Sarah; Shahab, Lion; West, Robert; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,,163

With the genome sequencing of strains from various countries, several classification systems were established via genome comparison. For instance, the GISAID clades classification highlights key mutations in the encoded proteins that could potentially affect the virus’ infectivity and transmission rates. In this study, 58 genomes of Lebanese SARS-CoV-2 strains were analyzed, 28 of which were sequenced for this study, and 30 retrieved from the GISAID and GenBank databases. We aimed to classify these strains, establish their phylogenetic relationships, and extract the mutations causing amino acid substitutions within, particularly, the structural proteins. The sequenced Lebanese SARS-COV-2 strains were classified into four GISAID clades and 11 Pango lineages. Moreover, 21 uncommon mutations in the structural proteins were found in the newly sequenced strains, underlining interesting combinations of mutations in the spike proteins. Hence, this study constitutes an observation and description of the current SARS-CoV-2 genetic and clade situation in Lebanon according to the available sequenced strains.","Fayad, Nancy Abi Habib Walid Kandeil Ahmed El-Shesheny Rabeh Kamel Mina Nabil Mourad Youmna Mokhbat Jacques Kayali Ghazi Goldstein Jimi Abdallah Jad",Biology,,163

We leverage insights from time series regression in econometrics and construct asymptotically pivotal statistics via random scaling. Our approach is fully operational with online data and is rigorously underpinned by a functional central limit theorem. Our proposed inference method has a couple of key advantages over the existing methods. First, the test statistic is computed in an online fashion with only SGD iterates and the critical values can be obtained without any resampling methods, thereby allowing for efficient implementation suitable for massive online data. Second, there is no need to estimate the asymptotic variance and our inference method is shown to be robust to changes in the tuning parameters for SGD algorithms in simulation experiments with synthetic data.","Lee, Sokbae; Liao, Yuan; Seo, Myung Hwan; Shin, Youngki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03156v3.pdf,163
370365,Photoinactivation of the Coronavirus Surrogate phi6 by Visible Light,2020,"COVID-19 manifests as a mild disease in most people but can progress to severe disease in nearly 20% of individuals. Disease progression is likely driven by a cytokine storm, either directly stimulated by SARS-CoV-2 or by increased systemic inflammation in which the gut might play an integral role. SARS-CoV-2 replication in the gut may cause increased intestinal permeability, alterations to the fecal microbiome, and increased inflammatory cytokines. Each effect may lead to increased systemic inflammation and the transport of cytokines and inflammatory antigens from the gut to the lung. Few interventions are being studied to treat people with mild disease and prevent the cytokine storm. Serumderived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) may prevent progression by (1) binding and neutralizing inflammatory antigens, (2) decreasing gut permeability, (3) interfering with ACE2 binding by viral proteins, and (4) improving the fecal microbiome. SBI is therefore a promising intervention to prevent disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Utay, Netanya S; Asmuth, David M; Gharakhanian, Shahin; Contreras, Moises; Warner, Christopher D; Detzel, Christopher J",Drug dev. res,,163

372432,Deep drug-target binding affinity prediction with multiple attention blocks,2021,"The ability to deal with uncertainty in machine learning models has become equally, if not more, crucial to their predictive ability itself. For instance, during the pandemic, governmental policies and personal decisions are constantly made around uncertainties. Targeting this, Neural Process Families (NPFs) have recently shone a light on prediction with uncertainties by bridging Gaussian processes and neural networks. Latent neural process, a member of NPF, is believed to be capable of modelling the uncertainty on certain points (local uncertainty) as well as the general function priors (global uncertainties). Nonetheless, some critical questions remain unresolved, such as a formal definition of global uncertainties, the causality behind global uncertainties, and the manipulation of global uncertainties for generative models. Regarding this, we build a member GloBal Convolutional Neural Process(GBCoNP) that achieves the SOTA log-likelihood in latent NPFs. It designs a global uncertainty representation p(z), which is an aggregation on a discretized input space. The causal effect between the degree of global uncertainty and the intra-task diversity is discussed. The learnt prior is analyzed on a variety of scenarios, including 1D, 2D, and a newly proposed spatial-temporal COVID dataset. Our manipulation of the global uncertainty not only achieves generating the desired samples to tackle few-shot learning, but also enables the probability evaluation on the functional priors.","Wang, Xuesong; Yao, Lina; Wang, Xianzhi; Paik, Hye-young; Wang, Sen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00691v1.pdf,163

The purpose of this study was to assess the psychological and lifestyle impact of the pandemic on Australian adolescents, using an online survey, administered during the outbreak. Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years assessing impact on a range of domains including behaviour, education, relationships, lifestyle factors (exercise, technology use, and sleep), and mental health outcomes (psychological distress, loneliness, health anxiety and well-being). Results showed that three quarters of the sample experienced a worsening in mental health, since the pandemic began, with negative impacts reported on learning, friendships and family relationships. There were also high higher levels of sleep disturbance, psychological distress and health anxiety, relative to normative samples. Effects on mental health were worse among those who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety relative to those without no such history. Adolescents are already vulnerable to the onset of mental illness at this developmental stage, and the current research underscores the need to find rapid and accessible ways to support adolescent mental health during times of crisis.","Li, Sophie H; Beames, Joanne R; Newby, Jill M; Maston, Kate; Christensen, Helen; Werner-Seidler, Aliza",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,163

By April 19, 2021, eligibility was expanded to all adults aged &#8805;18 years nationwide. To assess patterns of COVID-19 vaccination coverage among U.S. adults, CDC analyzed data submitted on vaccinations administered during December 14, 2020-May 22, 2021, by age, sex, and community-level characteristics. By May 22, 2021, 57.0% of persons aged &#8805;18 years had received &#8805;1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; coverage was highest among persons aged &#8805;65 years (80.0%) and lowest among persons aged 18-29 years (38.3%). During the week beginning February 7, 2021, vaccination initiation among adults aged &#8805;65 years peaked at 8.2%, whereas weekly initiation among other age groups peaked later and at lower levels. During April 19-May 22, 2021, the period following expanded eligibility to all adults, weekly initiation remained <4.0% and decreased for all age groups, including persons aged 18-29 years (3.6% to 1.9%) and 30-49 years (3.5% to 1.7%); based on the current rate of weekly initiation (as of May 22), younger persons will not reach the same levels of coverage as older persons by the end of August. Across all age groups, coverage (&#8805;1 dose) was lower among men compared with women, except among adults aged &#8805;65 years, and lower among persons living in counties that were less urban, had higher social vulnerabilities, or had higher percentages of social determinants of poor health.

Mechanical loading is one of the critical factors that affect cell/tissue behaviors and metabolic activities, but the reported models or detection methods offer little direct and real-time information about mechanically induced cell responses. Herein, for the first time, a stretchable and multifunctional platform integrating 3D cell culture, mechanical loading, and electrochemical sensing is developed by immobilization of biomimetic peptide linked gold nanotubes on porous and elastic polydimethylsiloxane. The 3D scaffold demonstrates very good compatibility, excellent stretchability, and stable electrochemical sensing performance. This allows mimicking the articular cartilage and investigating its mechanotransduction by 3D culture, mechanical stretching of chondrocytes, and synchronously real-time monitoring of stretch-induced signaling molecules. The results disclose a previously unclear mechanotransduction pathway in chondrocytes that mechanical loading can rapidly activate nitric oxide signaling within seconds. This indicates the promising potential of the stretchable 3D sensing in exploring the mechanotransduction in 3D cellular systems and engineered tissues.","Qin, Yu; Hu, Xue-Bo; Fan, Wen-Ting; Yan, Jing; Cheng, Shi-Bo; Liu, Yan-Ling; Huang, Wei-Hua",Adv Sci (Weinh),,163

Viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3C-like protease [3CLpro]) is a therapeutic target for drug discovery. Herein, we report that GC376, a broad-spectrum inhibitor targeting Mpro in the picornavirus-like supercluster, is a potent inhibitor for the Mpro encoded by SARS-CoV-2, with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 26.4 ± 1.1 nM. In this study, we also show that GC376 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication with a half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) of 0.91 ± 0.03 µM. Only a small portion of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was covalently modified in the excess of GC376 as evaluated by mass spectrometry analysis, indicating that improved inhibitors are needed. Subsequently, molecular docking analysis revealed that the recognition and binding groups of GC376 within the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro provide important new information for the optimization of GC376. Given that sufficient safety and efficacy data are available for GC376 as an investigational veterinary drug, expedited development of GC376, or its optimized analogues, for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human is recommended.","Hung, Hui-Chen; Ke, Yi-Yu; Huang, Sheng Yu; Huang, Peng-Nien; Kung, Yu-An; Chang, Teng-Yuan; Yen, Kuei-Jung; Peng, Tzu-Ting; Chang, Shao-En; Huang, Chin-Ting; Tsai, Ya-Ru; Wu, Szu-Huei; Lee, Shiow-Ju; Lin, Jiunn-Horng; Liu, Bing-Sin; Sung, Wang-Chou; Shih, Shin-Ru; Chen, Chiung-Tong; Hsu, John Tsu-An",,,163
384699,The Present and Future Role of Microfluidics for Protein and Peptide-Based Therapeutics and Diagnostics,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since August, 2019, US public health officials have been investigating a national outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). A spectrum of histological patterns consistent with acute to subacute lung injury has been seen in biopsies; however, autopsy findings have not been systematically characterised. We describe the pathological findings in autopsy and biopsy tissues submitted to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the evaluation of suspected EVALI. METHODS: Between Aug 1, 2019, and Nov 30, 2019, we examined lung biopsy (n=10 individuals) and autopsy (n=13 individuals) tissue samples received by the CDC, submitted by 16 US states, from individuals with: a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use; respiratory, gastrointestinal, or constitutional symptoms; and either pulmonary infiltrates or opacities on chest imaging, or sudden death from an undetermined cause. We also reviewed medical records, evaluated histopathology, and performed infectious disease testing when indicated by histopathology and clinical history. FINDINGS: 21 cases met surveillance case definitions for EVALI, with a further two cases of clinically suspected EVALI evaluated. All ten lung biopsies showed histological evidence of acute to subacute lung injury, including diffuse alveolar damage or organising pneumonia. These patterns were also seen in nine of 13 (69%) autopsy cases, most frequently diffuse alveolar damage (eight autopsies), but also acute and organising fibrinous pneumonia (one autopsy). Additional pulmonary pathology not necessarily consistent with EVALI was seen in the remaining autopsies, including bronchopneumonia, bronchoaspiration, and chronic interstitial lung disease. Three of the five autopsy cases with no evidence of, or a plausible alternative cause for acute lung injury, had been classified as confirmed or probable EVALI according to surveillance case definitions. INTERPRETATION: Acute to subacute lung injury patterns were seen in all ten biopsies and most autopsy lung tissues from individuals with suspected EVALI. Acute to subacute lung injury can have numerous causes; however, if it is identified in an individual with a history of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use, and no alternative cause is apparent, a diagnosis of EVALI should be strongly considered. A review of autopsy tissue pathology in suspected EVALI deaths can also identify alternative diagnoses, which can enhance the specificity of public health surveillance efforts.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, China were categorized into Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated and nonvaccinated groups. Clinical records, demography, laboratory results, and chest computed tomography scans were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: No adverse events were observed, except for an increased frequency of chills in the Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated group compared with that in the unvaccinated group (p=0.014). There were no significant differences in oxygen demand for breathing, computed tomography scans, treatments, or outcomes between the 2 groups. However, Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated group had significantly less severe pneumonia (p=0.028) and milder deficiency in liver function, consistent with a lower death rate than in the unvaccinated group. CONCLUSIONS: Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination received in childhood is associated with less severe COVID-19 pneumonia and milder liver function deficiency in addition to a lower death rate in Bacille Calmette-Guerinâvaccinated patients than in nonvaccinated individuals.","Chen, Fan; Chen, Guo X; Zhou, Jing; Xue, Yun; Wu, Mei X",Am. j. prev. med,,163

However, these methods are affected by their the correlation between pretraining domain and target domain and rely on massive fine-tuning relevance labels. Directly applying pretraining methods to specific domains may result in suboptimal search quality because specific domains may have domain adaption problems, such as the COVID domain. This paper presents a search system to alleviate the special domain adaption problem. The system utilizes the domain-adaptive pretraining and few-shot learning technologies to help neural rankers mitigate the domain discrepancy and label scarcity problems. Besides, we also integrate dense retrieval to alleviate traditional sparse retrieval's vocabulary mismatch obstacle.

385619,The Bristol Synthesis Meeting – Fostering Creativity and Inspiration since 2001,2020,"Diesel exhaust particles (DEP) are the major components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and chronic exposure is recognized to enhance respiratory system complications. Although the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with the PMs, the mechanism by which exposure to DEP increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under discussion. However, diesel fine PM (dPM) elevate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it coincides with the increase in the number of ACE2 receptors. Expression of ACE2 and its colocalized activator, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar epithelial cells exposed to dPM. Thus, the coexistence of PM and SARS-CoV-2 in the environment augments inflammation and exacerbates lung damage. Increased TGF-ß1 expression due to DEP accompanies the proliferation of the extracellular matrix. In this case, ""multifocal ground-glass opacity"" (GGO) in a CT scan is an indication of a cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19.","Poyraz, Baris Mustafa; Engin, Evren Doruk; Engin, Ayse Basak; Engin, Atilla",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,,163

Main Outcome Measures: We investigated the association of demographics, clinical data, geographical regions, and countries' health expenditure among AIS patients with the risk of large vessel occlusion (LVO), stroke severity as measured by National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and stroke subtype as measured by the TOAST criteria. Additionally, we applied unsupervised machine learning algorithms to uncover possible similarities among stroke patients. Results: Among the 136 tertiary centers of 32 countries who participated in this study, 71 centers from 17 countries had at least one eligible stroke patient. Out of 432 patients included, 323(74.8%) had AIS, 91(21.1%) ICH, and 18(4.2%) CVST. Among 23 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 16(69.5%) had no evidence of aneurysm. A total of 183(42.4%) patients were women, 104(24.1%) patients were younger than 55 years, and 105(24.4%) patients had no identifiable vascular risk factors. Among 380 patients who had known interval onset of the SARS-CoV-2 and stroke, 144(37.8%) presented to the hospital with chief complaints of stroke-related symptoms, with asymptomatic or undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among AIS patients 44.5% had LVO;10% had small artery occlusion according to the TOAST criteria.

The unsupervised machine learning identified 4 subgroups, with a relativelylarge group with no or limited comorbidities. Conclusions and Relevance: We observed a relatively high number of young, and asymptomaticSARS-CoV-2 infections among stroke patients. Traditional vascular risk factors were absent amonga relatively large cohort of patients. The stroke severity was lower and rate of mechanicalthrombectomy was higher among countries with middle to high-health expenditure.","Shahjouei, S.; Tsivgoulis, G.

386034,Iberian Lynx (Lynx pardinus) personality: A rating assessment with ex Situ Conservation Program sample,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospices to look for more ways to support people remotely, including psychological support. Emotional disclosure-based interventions hold potential as a way of providing support remotely. However, evidence of their efficacy in people with terminal illness is mixed. Reviews have highlighted this may be due to interventions not being tailored to the unique needs of this population. In response to this, we are developing Let It Out (LIO), an online, self-guided emotional disclosure-based intervention tailored for people living with terminal illness. AIMS: The primary objective of the study is to optimise the design of the LIO intervention. Secondary objectives include assessing its acceptability and feasibility; exploring potential impact on well-being; identifying potential adverse effects; and informing choice of outcome measures for potential future evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single arm, mixed-methods, multisite, longitudinal study. Up to 40 people living with a terminal illness under the care of hospices in England and Scotland will receive the online LIO intervention. LIO consists of 3, self-guided expression sessions over 2 weeks. The primary outcome measures are (1) a structured feedback form completed by participants after the final expression session; and (2) semi-structured interviews and focus groups with &#8804;15 patient participants, &#8804;30 hospice staff and &#8804;15 informal carers. These quantitative and qualitative data will be triangulated via process evaluation to inform optimisation of the intervention design. Secondary outcome measures include validated measures of physical and psychological health collected at baseline and after the final expression session (immediately, 1, 4 and 8 weeks after); and data on recruitment, retention and fidelity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15281/002). The findings will be shared through peer-reviewed scientific journals and conferences, and traditional, online and social media platforms.","McInnerney, Daisy; Candy, Bridget; Stone, Patrick; Kupeli, Nuriye",BMJ Open,,163
387715,"47th Annual Meeting of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Dermatologische Forschung (ADF): Virtual, March 04-06, 2021",2021,"BACKGROUND: School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated students' loneliness, addictive gaming behaviors, and poor mental health. These mental health issues confronting young people are of public concern. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between loneliness and gaming addiction behaviors among young people in Hong Kong and to investigate how familial factors, psychological distress, and gender differences moderate these relationships. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in June 2020 when schools reopened after 6 months of school closures. Participants included 2863 children and adolescents in primary (Grades 4 to 6) and secondary (Grades 7 and 8) schools (female participants: 1502/2863, 52.5%). Chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and independent-samples t tests were performed to compare the differences of distribution in gaming addiction behaviors across gender, age, and other sociodemographic characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors that relate to excessive or pathological gaming behaviors separately, in comparison with leisure gaming. RESULTS: A total of 83.0% (2377/2863) of the participants played video games during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of excessive and pathological game addiction behaviors was 20.9% (597/2863) and 5.3% (153/2863), respectively. More male students had gaming addiction symptoms than female students. The multinomial logistic regressions showed that feeling lonely was associated with more problematic gaming behaviors, and the association was stronger for older female students. Low socioeconomic status, less parental support and less supervision, and poor mental health were risk factors for gaming addiction behaviors, especially among primary school students. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was associated with gaming addiction behaviors; the findings from this study suggested that this association was similar across gender and age groups among young people. Familial support and supervision during school closures can protect young people from developing problematic gaming behaviors. Results of this study have implications for prevention and early intervention on behalf of policy makers and game developers.","Zhu, Shimin; Zhuang, Yanqiong; Lee, Paul; Li, Jessica Chi-Mei; Wong, Paul W C",JMIR Serious Games,,163

This method can be used to track the trajectory of both the entire system as well as individual countries relative to the system. Applying our analysis to cases and deaths independently reveals a close relationship between the evolution of these two systems. With this in mind, we also develop a method to analyse the similarity and anomalies between two related multivariate systems in conjunction, allowing us to identify anomalous countries in the progression of cases to deaths.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02125v2.pdf,163

We investigated the monthly trend of AY.29 in Japan within 37,737 Delta variants downloaded on October 2, 2021. Among the total Japanese Delta variants, the AY.29 sub-lineage accounted for 95.1%. In terms of monthly trends, the sequences became predominant in June, and accounted for 95.4%, 97.6% and 90.5% of the reported sequences in July, August and September, respectively. Furthermore, the number of Delta variants imported from abroad during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics (held in August 2021) was extremely low during the fifth wave in Japan. Therefore, the epidemic of the new Delta variant is attributable to a newly occurring mutation in Japan.","Abe, Takashi; Arita, Masanori",,,163
392672,Los coronavirus siempre presentes,2020,"The month of December 2019 became a critical part of the time of humanity when the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the Wuhan, Hubei Province in China. As of April 13th, 2020, there have been approximately 1.9 million cases and 199,000 deaths across the world, which were associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 is the seventh coronavirus to be identified to infect humans. In the past, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were the two coronaviruses that infected humans with a high fatality, particularly among the elderly. Fatalities due to COVID-19 are higher in patients older than 50 years of age or those with multimorbid conditions. The COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, with the most common symptoms being high fever, cough, myalgia, atypical symptoms included sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and diarrhea. However, the incubation period can range from 2 to 14 days without any symptoms. It is particularly true with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in which patients can still shed the virus even after pulmonary symptoms have resolved. Given the high percentage of COVID-19 patients that present with GI symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea), screening patients for GI symptoms remain essential. Recently, cases of fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the USA and China, indicating that the virus can replicate in both the respiratory and digestive tract. Moreover, the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatments and prevention of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 remain to be elucidated.","Kopel, Jonathan; Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Boregowda, Umesha; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Dis Sci,,163
393565,Reflecting on an Extraordinary Year,2020,"The Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 and was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease spread globally, leading to the World Health Organization declaring it a pandemic in March 2020. The condition is often fatal in its severe form. As it is a previously unknown virus, no treatment is identified or any vaccine available. The burden of disease control and containment, therefore, falls upon a robust and geographically appropriate testing strategy. Testing policies are modified, in turn, by the rapidly evolving patterns of the disease in various nations and by the evolving nature of tests in development. It is, therefore, helpful to study different national models to learn from the experience of different countries. This article compares testing strategies in the UK and India as the two countries travel different paths in controlling the pandemic. The UK is one of the most severely affected countries in the world. Initially restricted to hospitalised patients, the UK has broadened the scope of testing to many categories of individuals. In contrast, India appears to have a lower prevalence of the infection. However, the large Indian population and relatively insufficient testing capacities so far have led India to adopt a different testing trajectory, with the testing currently focused on high-risk groups in the community and hospitals. Owing to the rapidly changing nature of the disease, there can be no ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy but should be based on country-specific circumstances.","Rao, G.Gopal; Agarwal, Ashwini; Batura, Deepak",Med.

This theme is already, unfortunately, of distressing topicality. Among these, the complex balance between the security needs and the protection of the prisoner's right to health deserves particular attention. The detainees, in fact, constitute a group particularly vulnerable to the spread of an infectious disease, both because they have an average level of health lower than that of the general population, and because they live forced in cramped, overcrowded, poorly ventilated environments, in which it is not always possible to observe the general hygiene rules. For these reasons, during the ongoing pandemic emergency, it could be even more difficult to concretely protect the right to health of this portion of the population.","Tozzo, Pamela; D039,; Angiolella, Gabriella; Caenazzo, Luciana",Forensic Sci.

396189,The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm for the selection of stable elements of secondary structure to be included in vaccine peptides,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide, and the outbreak of the disease was designated a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Such outbreaks would certainly be catastrophic for some of the best-ranked health systems and would be more catastrophic in countries with more fragile health systems. Accordingly, the World Health Organization and other organizations have been appealing to donor countries to support a rapid response plan. The primary objectives of this response plan are to appeal for funds from donors and to distribute these funds to the most affected countries based on the requirements. METHODS: In this study, we developed a mathematical model to provide initial insights into the efficient and equitable distribution of urgent funds to high-priority countries. Three phases were proposed for the construction of this mathematical model. In the first phase, the final epidemic sizes in all the target countries were predicted by using three epidemiological models. In the second phase, the urgent requirements for each country were estimated in parallel with the estimates issued by the humanitarian response plan, based on the size of the epidemic and several other factors. In the third and final phase, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The first objective was to maximize the funds from donors to cover all the requirements. The second objective was to minimize the unmet demands by ensuring a fair distribution of the urgent funds based on the requirements of the target countries. RESULTS: Predictions of the basic reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes were calculated for all target countries. The urgent requirements were estimated, and the requirements issued by the humanitarian response plan for all target countries were also considered. Moreover, a proposed response plan for the distribution network was demonstrated. Donors must provide urgent funds exceeding US$ 2,608,084,209 to cover at least 40 % of each target country's requirements. Overall, results demonstrate the importance of an urgent and fair distribution of funds to the target countries to overcome the outbreak of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid responses by donor countries to humanitarian appeals will facilitate the immediate and fair distribution of relief supplies to the poorest countries. This distribution may help to support health systems, restrain the spread of COVID-19, and prevent an unlimited catastrophe.","Hezam, Ibrahim M",ISA Trans,,163
396659,The coronavirus response: Boxed in by models,2020,"While the pathological mechanisms in COVID-19 illness are still poorly understood, it is increasingly clear that high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators play a major role in clinical deterioration in patients with severe disease. Current evidence points to a hyperinflammatory state as the driver of respiratory compromise in severe COVID-19 disease, with a clinical trajectory resembling acute respiratory distress syndrome, but how this 'runaway train' inflammatory response emerges and is maintained is not known. Here, we present the first mathematical model of lung hyperinflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This model is based on a network of purported mechanistic and physiological pathways linking together five distinct biochemical species involved in the inflammatory response. Simulations of our model give rise to distinct qualitative classes of COVID-19 patients: (i) individuals who naturally clear the virus, (ii) asymptomatic carriers and (iii-v) individuals who develop a case of mild, moderate, or severe illness. These findings, supported by a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, point to potential therapeutic interventions to prevent the emergence of hyperinflammation. Specifically, we suggest that early intervention with a locally acting anti-inflammatory agent (such as inhaled corticosteroids) may effectively blockade the pathological hyperinflammatory reaction as it emerges.","Fadai, Nabil T; Sachak-Patwa, Rahil; Byrne, Helen M; Maini, Philip K; Bafadhel, Mona; Nicolau, Dan V",J R Soc Interface,,163

405143,Finland's handling of selenium is a model in these times of coronavirus infections,2020,"The highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 has led to several studies on the transmission of the virus. A little studied potential fomite of great concern in the community is currency, which has been shown to harbor microbial pathogens in several studies. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses in the United States have limited the use of banknotes in favor of credit cards. However, SARS-CoV-2 has shown greater stability on plastic in several studies. Herein, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature on banknotes, money cards and coins was investigated. In vitro studies with live virus suggested SARS-CoV-2 was highly unstable on banknotes, showing an initial rapid reduction in viable virus and no viral detection by 24 hours. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was far more stable on money cards with live virus detected after 48 hours. Environmental swabbing of currency and money cards on and near the campus of Brigham Young University supported these results, with no detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on banknotes, and a low level on money cards. No viable virus was detected on either. These preliminary results suggest that the use of money cards over banknotes in order to slow the spread of this virus may be ill-advised. These findings should be investigated further through larger environmental studies involving more locations.","Newey, Colleen; Olausson, Abigail T; Applegate, Alyssa; Reid, Ann Aubrey; Robison, Richard A; Grose, Julianne H.",,,163

Previous studies revealed ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) exhibits Cd tolerance, and may be useful as a potential hyperaccumulator because of its wide distribution. In this study, the physiological and transcriptional responses of two ryegrass cultivars [i.e., high (LmHC) and low (LmLC) Cd tolerance] to Cd stress were investigated and compared. The Cd tolerance of LmHC was greater than that of LmLC at various Cd concentrations. The uptake of Evans blue dye revealed that Cd-induced root cell mortality was higher in LmLC than in LmHC after a 12-h Cd treatment. Furthermore, the content and influx rate of Cd in LmLC roots were greater than in LmHC roots under Cd stress conditions. The RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR data indicated that the Cd transport regulatory genes (ABCG37, ABCB4, NRAMP4, and HMA5) were differentially expressed between the LmLC and LmHC roots. This expression-level diversity may contribute to the differences in the Cd accumulation and translocation between LmLC and LmHC. These findings may help clarify the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying ryegrass responses to Cd toxicity. Additionally, ryegrass may be able to hyperaccumulate toxic heavy metals during the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.","Wang, Jingang; Zhao, Junchao; Feng, Shuang; Zhang, Jinzhu; Gong, Shufang; Qiao, Kun; Zhou, Aimin",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,163

408844,The Economic Costs of Containing a Pandemic,2020-06-21,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Droplets and contacts serve as the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The characteristic of the disease is rather heterogeneous, ranging from no symptoms to critical illness. The factors associated with the outcome of COVID-19 have not been completely characterized to date. Inspired by previous studies on the relevance of infectious diseases, viral and host factors related to clinical outcomes have been identified. The severity of COVID-19 is mainly related to host factors, especially cellular immune responses in patients. Patients with mild COVID-19 and improved patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit a normal immune response to effectively eliminate the virus. The immune response in patients with fatal severe COVID-19 includes three stages: normal or hypofunction, hyperactivation, and anergy. Eventually, the patients were unable to resist viral infection and died. Based on our understanding of the kinetics of immune responses during COVID-19, we suggest that type I interferon (IFN) could be administered to patients with severe COVID-19 in the hypofunctional stage, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glucocorticoid therapy could be administered in the immune hyperactivation stage. In addition, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) anticoagulation therapy and anti-infective therapy with antibiotics are recommended in the hyperactivation stage.","Zhou, Xi; Ye, Qing",Front Immunol,,163

However, the prevalence of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of psychological distress during COVID-19 outbreak and their risk factors, especially their internal paths and causality. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of mental disorders was conducted. We used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. The internal paths and the causality of the psychological health were analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. RESULTS: A total of 24,789 respondents completed the survey. We found that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, combination of anxiety, and depression were 51.6% (95% CI: 51.0-52.2), 47.5% (95% CI: 46.9-48.1), and 24.5% (95% CI: 24.0-25.0), respectively. The risk of psychological disorders in men was higher than that in women. The status of psychological health was different across different age groups, education levels, occupations, and income levels. The SEM analysis revealed that inadequate material supplies, low income, low education, lack of knowledge or confidence of the epidemic, and lack of exercise are major risk factors for psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this survey poses serious challenges related to the high prevalence of psychological distress, but also offers strategies to deal with the mental health problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Mindan; Han, Huanqin; Lin, Tingkui; Chen, Min; Wu, Jun; Du, Xufei; Su, Guomei; Wu, Dong; Chen, Fagui; Zhang, Qichuan; Zhou, Hailin; Huang, Dan; Wu, Bin; Wu, Jiayuan; Lai, Tianwen",Brain Behav,,163

The effect of continuous monitoring on patient room visits has not been established yet. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of continuous monitoring on the number of patient room visits for patients suspected of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the use of personal protection equipment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a before-after study at a ward with private rooms for patients suspected of COVID-19 at a tertiary hospital in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Non-participant observers observed hospital staff during day, evening and night shifts to record patient room visits and personal protection equipment usage. After eleven days, wearable continuous vital sign monitoring was introduced. An interrupted time series analysis was applied to evaluate the effect of continuous monitoring on the number of patient room visits, visits for obtaining vital signs (Modified Early Warning Score visits) and the amount of personal protection equipment used. RESULTS: During the 45 day study period, 86 shifts were observed. During each shift, approximately six rooms were included. A total of 2347 patient room visits were recorded. The slope coefficient for the number of patient room visits did not change after introducing continuous vital sign monitoring (B -0.003, 95% confidence interval -0.022/0.016). The slope coefficients of the number of Modified Early Warning Score visits and the amount of personal protection equipment used did not change either (B -0.002, 95% confidence interval -0.021/0.017 and B 0.046, 95% confidence interval -0.008/0.099). The number of Modified Early Warning Score visits did show a decline over the entire study period, however this decline was not influenced by the intervention. Evening and night shifts were associated with fewer patient room visits compared to day shifts. CONCLUSION: Introduction of continuous vital sign monitoring at a general ward for patients with suspected COVID-19 did not reduce the number of patient room visits or the usage of personal protection equipment by hospital staff. The number of Modified Early Warning Score visits declined over time, but this was not related to the introduction of continuous monitoring. Detailed analysis of the influence of continuous monitoring on the workflow of hospital staff reveals key points to increase efficacy of this intervention.","van Goor, H M R; Eddahchouri, Y; van Loon, K; Bredie, S J H; Schoonhoven, L; Kaasjager, H A H; van Goor, H",Int J Nurs Stud,,163

Split ventilation allows a single ventilator to be used for more than one patient but is not practicable due to requirements for matched patient settings, risks of cross-contamination, harmful interference between patients and the inability to individualize ventilator support parameters. We hypothesized that a system could be developed to circumvent these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A novel delivery system was developed to allow individualized peak inspiratory pressure settings and PEEP using a pressure regulatory valve, developed de novo, and an inline PEEP 'booster'. One-way valves, filters, monitoring ports and wye splitters were assembled in-line to complete the system and achieve the design targets. This system was then tested to see if previously described limitations could be addressed. The system was investigated in mechanical and animal trials (ultimately with a pig and sheep concurrently ventilated from the same ventilator). The system demonstrated the ability to provide ventilation across clinically relevant scenarios including circuit occlusion, unmatched physiology, and a surgical procedure, while allowing significantly different pressures to be safely delivered to each animal for individualized support. CONCLUSIONS: In settings of limited ventilator availability, systems can be developed to allow increased delivery of ventilator support to patients. This enables more rapid deployment of ventilator capacity under constraints of time, space and financial cost. These systems can be smaller, lighter, more readily stored and more rapidly deployable than ventilators. However, optimizing ventilator support for patients with individualized ventilation parameters will still be dependent upon ease of use and the availability of medical personnel.","VanKoevering, Kyle K; Yalamanchi, Pratyusha; Haring, Catherine T; Phillips, Anne G; Harvey, Stephen Lewis; Rojas-Pena, Alvaro; Zopf, David A; Green, Glenn E",PLoS One,,163

Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be instrumental in resolution of and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we tested 25 hospitalized patients either with microbiologically documented COVID-19 (n = 19) or highly suspected of having the disease (n = 6) for presence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD69+ expressing interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) producing CD8+ T cells using flow-cytometry for intracellular cytokine staining assay. Two sets of overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein N-terminal 1 to 643 amino acid sequence and the entire sequence of SARS-CoV-2 M protein were used simultaneously as antigenic stimulus. Ten patients (40%) had detectable responses, displaying frequencies ranging from 0.15 to 2.7% (median of 0.57 cells/µL; range, 0.43-9.98 cells/µL). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-Î³ CD8+ T cells in patients admitted to intensive care was comparable (P = .28) to the rate in patients hospitalized in other medical wards. No correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-Î³ CD8+ T-cell counts and SARS-CoV-2 S-specific antibody levels. Likewise, no correlation was observed between either SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-Î³ CD8+ T cells or S-specific immunoglobulin G-antibody titers and blood cell count or levels of inflammatory biomarkers. In summary, in this descriptive, preliminary study we showed that SARS-CoV-2-reactive IFN-Î³ CD8+ T cells can be detected in a non-negligible percentage of patients with moderate to severe forms of COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to determine whether quantitation of these T-cell subsets may provide prognostic information on the clinical course of COVID-19.","Giménez, Estela; Albert, Eliseo; Torres, Ignacio; Remigia, María José; Alcaraz, María Jesús; Galindo, María José; Blasco, María Luisa; Solano, Carlos; Forner, María José; Redón, Josep; Signes-Costa, Jaime; Navarro, David",J. med. virol,,163

Buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is associated with improved pregnancy and fetal outcomes, but prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were multiple barriers to accessing buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy. Care disruptions during the pandemic may have further exacerbated these already existing barriers. To quantify these changes, we examined trends in the number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsWe estimated an interrupted time series model using linked national pharmacy claims and medical claims data from May 2019 to December 2020. We estimated changes in the level and trend in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic. We then stratified our analyses by payer. ResultsWe identified 2,947 pregnant patients filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions. Before the pandemic, there was positive growth in the monthly number of individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone (4.83% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.40% to 6.26%). During the pandemic, the monthly growth rate in individuals filling prescriptions for prenatal buprenorphine/naloxone declined for both patients on commercial insurance and patients on Medicaid (all payers: -5.53% (95% CI: -7.28% to -3.78%); Medicaid: -7.66% (95% CI: -10.42% to -4.90%); Commercial: -3.59% (95% CI: -5.53% to -1.66%)). ConclusionThe number of pregnant individuals filling buprenorphine/naloxone prescriptions was increasing prior to the pandemic, but this growth has been lost during the pandemic.","O'Donoghue, Ashley L; Reichheld, Alyse; Anderson, Timothy S; Zera, Chloe A; Dechen, Tenzin; Stevens, Jennifer P",,,163

Countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have a high vulnerability and variable capacity to respond to outbreaks. Many of these countries addressed the need for increasing capacity in the areas of surveillance and rapid response to public health threats. Moreover, countries addressed the need for communication strategies that direct the public to actions for self- and community protection. This viewpoint article aims to highlight the contribution of the Global Health Development (GHD)/Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) and the EMR's Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETPs) to prepare for and respond to the current COVID-19 threat. GHD/EMPHNET has the scientific expertise to contribute to elevating the level of country alert and preparedness in the EMR and to provide technical support through health promotion, training and training materials, guidelines, coordination, and communication. The FETPs are currently actively participating in surveillance and screening at the ports of entry, development of communication materials and guidelines, and sharing information to health professionals and the public. However, some countries remain ill-equipped, have poor diagnostic capacity, and are in need of further capacity development in response to public health threats. It is essential that GHD/EMPHNET and FETPs continue building the capacity to respond to COVID-19 and intensify support for preparedness and response to public health emergencies.","Al Nsour, Mohannad; Bashier, Haitham; Al Serouri, Abulwahed; Malik, Elfatih; Khader, Yousef; Saeed, Khwaja; Ikram, Aamer; Abdalla, Abdalla Mohammed; Belalia, Abdelmounim; Assarag, Bouchra; Baig, Mirza Amir; Almudarra, Sami; Arqoub, Kamal; Osman, Shahd; Abu-Khader, Ilham; Shalabi, Dana; Majeed, Yasir",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,163
423400,Norm index-based QSAR models for acute toxicity of organic compounds toward zebrafish embryo,2020,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used for research; however, multicomponent outcome measures such as daily functioning cannot yet be readily extracted. AIM: To evaluate whether an electronic frailty index based on routine primary care data can be used as a measure for daily functioning in research with community-dwelling older persons (aged &#8805;75 years). DESIGN AND SETTING: Cohort study among participants of the Integrated Systemic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (11 476 eligible; 7285 in observational cohort; 3141 in trial; over-representation of frail people). METHOD: At baseline (T0) and after 12 months (T12), daily functioning was measured with the Groningen Activities Restriction Scale (GARS, range 18-72). Electronic frailty index scores (range 0-1) at T0 and T12 were computed from the EHRs. The electronic frailty index (electronic Frailty Index - Utrecht) was tested for responsiveness and compared with the GARS as a gold standard for daily functioning. RESULTS: In total, 1390 participants with complete EHR and follow-up data were selected (31.4% male; median age = 81 years, interquartile range = 78-85). The electronic frailty index increased with age, was higher for females, and lower for participants living with a partner. It was responsive after an acute major medical event; however, the correlation between the electronic frailty index and GARS at T0 and over time was limited. CONCLUSION: Because the electronic frailty index does not reflect daily functioning, further research on new methods to measure daily functioning with routine care data (for example, other proxies) is needed before EHRs can be a useful data source for research with older persons.","Ravensbergen, Willeke M; Blom, Jeanet W; Evers, Andrea Wm; Numans, Mattijs E; de Waal, Margot Wm; Gussekloo, Jacobijn",Br.j.gen.pract,,163

Children were reported to manifest mild to moderate symptoms and mortality was primarily observed in patients aged <1 year and having underlying comorbidities. The majority of the cases were asymptomatic in children, hence, posing a challenge for pediatric surgery centers to take drastic measures to reduce the virus transmission. Telemedicine was introduced and outpatient consultations were conducted online as out-patient clinics were closed. Elective surgeries were postponed with delayed appointments while the healthcare sector was diverted towards tackling COVID-19. Case urgency was classified and triaged, leading to limited surgeries being performed only in COVID-19 negative patients following an extensive screening process. The screening process consisted of online history taking and RT-PCR tests. Newer practices such as mouth rinse, video laryngoscopy, and anesthesia were introduced to restrict patients from crying, coughing, and sneezing, as an attempt to avoid aerosolization of viral particles and safely conduct pediatric surgeries during the pandemic. Surgical trainees were also affected as the smaller number of surgeries conducted reduced the clinical experience available to medical enthusiasts.

The varied and changing guidance has been difficult for staff to absorb and has presented challenges for managing compliance. APPROACH: HCA Healthcare recognized the need for a coordinated approach to managing infection prevention guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and a mechanism for monitoring compliance and responding to implementation challenges remotely. This innovation consisted of a bundle of infection prevention guidance referred to as the Universal Protection Framework that collated existing recommendations into an easy-to-understand structure with four domains: core infection prevention practices, access control, distancing, and patient flow. This was supported by education and clear communication. A remote monitoring program that incorporated a combination of report review and virtual observation via videoconferencing using an on-site leader as a navigator for the discussion assessed 46 survey domains for compliance. RESULTS: This framework was implemented in a large health care system, and to date compliance has been monitored at 15 facilities. Overall, compliance was high (average, 90%). High compliance was seen with oversight and distribution of personal protective equipment, cohorting of COVID-19 patients, facility access controls, and employee exposure monitoring. Challenges were identified in compliance with social distancing and universal masking. CONCLUSION: Complex infection prevention expectations for COVID-19 can be communicated and implemented by bundling into a simple framework. This innovation also demonstrated that compliance can be measured remotely, which may be useful even after the pandemic challenges have passed.","Sands, Kenneth; Blanchard, Jackie; Grubbs, Ken; O039,; Neal, Fredrick; Schlosser, Michael; Korwek, Kimberly; Englebright, Jane; Perlin, Jonathan",Jt.

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Europe PMC and NHS evidence from December 2019 to 20 July 2020. Eighteen studies were identified; 12 for saliva, four for nasal and two included both specimen types. For saliva-based studies, the proportion of saliva samples testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 82.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 76.7% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 65.4% to 100%. For nasal-based studies, the proportion of nasal swabs testing positive relative to all positive samples in each study ranged from 81.9% to 100%; detection in nasopharyngeal specimens ranged from 70% to 100%; positive agreement between specimens for overall detection ranged from 62.3% to 100%.

As such, a UV-C treatment in combination with a chemical wipe, such as EPA hydrogen peroxide, is a common cleaning protocol in a medical setting, and such disinfection protocols have gained in importance during the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the need to reuse PPE. However, given the substantial increase in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore, there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint, forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating availability of source materials. The disinfection capabilities of the system are validated using Bacillus cereus, a gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria.","She, Rosemary C.; Chen, Dongyu; Pak, Pil; Armani, Deniz K.; Schubert, Andreas; Armani, Andrea M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12916v2.pdf,163

431430,3D printed deformable sensors,2020,"Although SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are promising therapeutics against COVID-19, little is known about their mechanism(s) of action or effective dosing windows. We report the generation and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, isolated from a convalescent patient. Antibody-mediated neutralization occurs via an epitope within the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SC31 exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in multiple animal models. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, treatment with SC31 greatly reduced viral loads and attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, a comparison of the efficacies of SC31 and its Fc-null LALA variant revealed that the optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires Fc-mediated effector functions that promote IFNÎ³-driven anti-viral immune responses, in addition to its neutralization ability. A dose-dependent efficacy of SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when administered before viral-induced lung inflammatory responses. In addition, antibody-dependent enhancement was not observed even when infected mice were treated with SC31 at sub-therapeutic doses. In SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, SC31 treatment significantly prevented weight loss, reduced viral loads, and attenuated the histopathology of the lungs. In rhesus macaques, the therapeutic potential of SC31 was evidenced through the reduction of viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts to undetectable levels. Together, the results of our preclinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of SC31 in three different models and its potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic candidate.","Chan, Conrad E Z; Seah, Shirley G K; Chye, De Hoe; Massey, Shane; Torres, Maricela; Lim, Angeline P C; Wong, Steven K K; Neo, Jacklyn J Y; Wong, Pui San; Lim, Jie Hui; Loh, Gary S L; Wang, Dongling; Boyd-Kirkup, Jerome D; Guan, Siyu; Thakkar, Dipti; Teo, Guo Hui; Purushotorman, Kiren; Hutchinson, Paul E; Young, Barnaby E; Low, Jenny G; MacAry, Paul A; Hentze, Hannes; Prativadibhayankara, Venkateshan S; Ethirajulu, Kantharaj; Comer, Jason E; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Barrett, Alan D T; Ingram, Piers J; Brasel, Trevor; Hanson, Brendon John",PLoS One,,163
431554,Nanotherapeutics for treating coronavirus diseases,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: The worldwide incidence of fractures of the proximal end of the femur is increasing as the average age of the population rises. The current surgical gold treatment standard is intramedullary nail fixation. The Authors present their experience with the D-Nail system for intertrochanteric femur fractures. METHODS: From January 1st to February 21st 2020 (breakout of COVID-19 pandemic) 34 patients were treated with the D-Nail system: 11 with basicervical fractures, 16 with intertrochanteric stable fractures and 7 with intertrochanteric unstable fractures. In 11 cases, a single cephalic screw was used; in 23 cases, two of them were used. Distal locking was executed in 7 patients. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 3 months. RESULTS: None of the reported intra- or post-operative complication was linked to the fixation device or the surgical technique. Patients were monitored with clinical and radiological checkups using modified Harris Hip Score to accurately evaluate the fluctuations in the rehabilitation period. CONCLUSION: The main advantages of this synthesis device are the proximal hole's peculiar shape, which allows the possibility to position one or two cephalic screws on the same nail, and the silicon coating, which provides numerous biological advantages. Distal locking was executed in selected cases only, based on fracture type. Optimum treatment involves rapid execution of surgery, minimal trauma during surgery, maximum mechanical stability, and rapid weight-bearing. Although our case number is small and follow-up time brief, our results are encouraging.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Quattri, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Burgio, Valeria; Rivera, Fabrizio; Di Stefano, Giovanni; Pavone, Vito",Acta Biomed,,163
432091,PARADE: Passage Representation Aggregation for Document Reranking,2020-08-20,"Transcatheter interventions for structural heart disease (SHD) now represent an effective alternative to surgery in selected patients. A clear premise is that delay in or neglect of treating patients in need of SHD intervention is associated with unavoidable morbidity and mortality because many of them have life-threatening conditions. However, the recent outbreak of coronavirus-associated disease-2019 (COVID-19) is placing an unprecedented strain on patients, physicians and world healthcare systems that resulted in deferral of elective and semi-elective procedures, such as SHD, and delay in the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We hereby present the case for a focused resumption of transcatheter SHD interventions in selected centers, in order to preserve patient safety and avoid that death rate will extend far beyond that directly associated with COVID-19. A similar approach should be applied to the invasive management of ACS. Indeed, a proactive and vigilant stance on managing SHD and ACS is crucial, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the risk of overlooking severely sick patients or postponing life-saving treatments is high. If such corrective measures are not put into effect, we may expect in the near future an excess of avoidable fatalities indirectly due to COVID-19 but truly caused by cardiovascular diseases, as well as an exceedingly large number of patients with severe heart failure leading to shorter life expectancy, reduced quality of life and increased healthcare cost.","Giordano, Arturo; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Frati, Giacomo; Bartorelli, Antonio L",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,163

Increased demands for surgical masks and N95 FFRs during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the shortage crisis. However, there is no standard protocol for safe reuse of the N95 FFRs. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of existing decontamination methods of surgical masks and N95 FFRs and provide evidence-based recommendations for selecting an appropriate decontamination method. METHODS: We performed systematic searches of Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE electronic databases. The last search was performed April 11, 2020. Any trials studying surgical masks and/or N95 FFRs decontamination were included. Outcomes were disinfections of virus and bacteria, restoration of the filtration efficiency, and maintenance of the physical structure of the mask. RESULTS: Overall, 15 studies and 14 decontamination methods were identified. A low level of evidence supported 4 decontamination methods: ultraviolet (UV) germicidal irradiation (9 studies), moist heat (5 studies), microwave-generated steam (4 studies), and hydrogen peroxide vapor (4 studies). Therefore, we recommended these 4 methods, and we recommended against use were given for the other 10 methods. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of evidence supported the use of UV germicidal irradiation, moist heat, microwave-generated steam, and hydrogen peroxide vapor for decontamination and reuse of N95 FFRs. These decontamination methods were effective for viral and bacterial disinfection as well as restoration of the filtration efficiency, and the physical structure of the FFRs.","Seresirikachorn, Kachorn; Phoophiboon, Vorakamol; Chobarporn, Thitiporn; Tiankanon, Kasenee; Aeumjaturapat, Songklot; Chusakul, Supinda; Snidvongs, Kornkiat",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,163

Because children appear to be less severely affected than adults, their imaging appearances have not been extensively reported. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review available literature regarding imaging findings in paediatric cases of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar) for articles describing imaging findings in children with COVID-19. We included all modalities, age <18 years, and foreign language articles, using descriptive statistics to identify patterns and locations of imaging findings, and their association with outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included, reporting chest imaging findings in 431 children, of whom 421 (97.7%) underwent CT. Criteria for imaging were lacking. At diagnosis, 143/421 (34.0%) had a normal CT. Abnormalities were more common in the lower lobes and were predominantly unilateral. The most common imaging pattern was ground-glass opacification (159/255, 62.4%). None of the studies described lymphadenopathy, while pleural effusions were rare (three cases). Improvement at follow-up CT imaging (3-15 days later) was seen in 29/100 (29%), remained normal in 25/100 (25%) and progressed in 9/100 (9%). CONCLUSION: CT chest findings in children with COVID-19 are frequently normal or mild. Lower lobes are predominantly affected by patchy ground-glass opacification. Appearances at follow-up remain normal or improve in the majority of children. Chest CT imaging adds little to the further management of the patient and should be reserved for severe cases or for identifying alternative diagnoses.","Shelmerdine, Susan C; Lovrenski, Jovan; Caro-Domínguez, Pablo; Toso, Seema",Pediatr Radiol,,163

Monitoring and treatment of PKU patients can be complicated in challenging circumstances as pandemics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of telemedicine for monitoring and treatment of PKU patients on metabolic outcome during coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as PKU and treated with low Phe diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or BH4 adjunct with low Phe diet were enrolled. Study period was divided into two periods: prepandemic period wherein patients were followed up in outpatients' clinic and during pandemic wherein telemedicine was used. Demographic findings, laboratory results, and therapy responses were reviewed retrospectively and compared between the two periods. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local ethical committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty (17/11/2020-151640) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. Results: Ninety-three (n = 93) patients were enrolled to this study. The ratio of the samples with Phe levels in the recommended ranges was found to be statistically higher during the pandemic wherein an online monitoring system was used in all treatment modalities (p < 0.05). The decrease in Phe washout frequency was statistically significant during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Considering the relationship between Phe tolerance before and during the pandemic, a significant increase in Phe tolerance was noted during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Telemedicine can be an appropriate and effective monitoring option for PKU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zubarioglu, Tanyel; Hopurcuoglu, Duhan; Uygur, Esma; Ahmadzada, Saffa; Oge-Enver, Ece; Isat, Esra; Cansever, Mehmet Serif; Kiykim, Ertugrul; Aktuglu-Zeybek, Cigdem",Telemed. j. e. health,,163

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including consecutive kidney transplant recipients in a single referral transplant centre. Participants were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies 2-4 weeks after a second vaccine dose. Primary outcome was rate of seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titre was 15.5 AU/mL (interquartile range (IQR) 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio (OR) 1.025 per mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.014-1.037, p < 0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95%CI 1.782-3.089, p < 0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95%CI 1.015-1.05, p < 0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95%CI 1.146-3.443, p 0.014). No serious adverse events resulting from the vaccine were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients demonstrated an inadequate antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Immunosuppression level was a significant factor in this response. Strategies to improve immunogenicity should be examined in future studies.","Rozen-Zvi, Benaya; Yahav, Dafna; Agur, Timna; Zingerman, Boris; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Atamna, Alaa; Tau, Noam; Mashraki, Tiki; Nesher, Eviatar; Rahamimov, Ruth",Clin. microbiol. infect,,163

According to report on 25 January 2021, worldwide cases reached to 100 million.3 The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala and affected individual had come from Wuhan china.4 Corona virus is spread over 220 countries across the world. In order to prevent corona virus all the countries are taken initiative to prepare effective vaccine against corona virus. There is not any effective treatment is available for corona so far vaccine is the key preventive aspect against corona virus. There are presently above 125 vaccines go through pre-clinical investigation for covid-19. India has develop two types of vaccine (Covaxin and covidshield) in primary phase and from 01 January 2021 Indian government started vaccination namely Covidshield to health workers (front line workers). So in primary stage target set to cover 30 million health workers followed by policeman and old age peoples to be vaccinated against corona. During primary phase of corona vaccine we dont have appropriate research and literature about side effects and how far vaccine is reliable that why due so some miner side effect and negative media publicity peoples are very scared to take vaccine. So few peoples were started denial get vaccinated. Aims The current study is aimed to assess the perception and behavior towards Covid-19 vaccine among students and faculties of nursing colleges those who have taken vaccine against corona. The researcher wan to explore the positivity through the research result to reduce the negative mindset of the peoples toward corona vaccine Because in India few peoples has fear to take vaccine against corona due to negative media publicity and scared of side effect.

443265,Green Chemistry and Coronavirus,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020-21 has acted as an inflection point, exposing the fragility of liberal democracy in India, already beleaguered by the rise of majoritarian populism since 2014, buttressed by a process of expansion of bureaucratic power and autocratic legalism while marginalizing the processes of political accountability–étatisation, and normalization of state violence. The combined impact of such developments has been an erasure of basic rights to life and livelihood for the poor, rooted not only in state incapacity but also in state acquiring impunity for its acts of coercion and violence against its own citizens. Many of these processes have come into stark focus during the Covid-19 pandemic, but have longer histories and are likely to have impact far beyond the pandemic. The paper examines some of these processes with the help of three interlinked but conceptually distinct strands: (a) étatisation and suspension of politics;(b) (en)forcement of a new normal during the health emergency;and (c) erasure of right to life and livelihood. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Prakash, A.",India Review,,163
443798,Mapping the Terrain of Moral Suffering,2021,"Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the main global health concerns in 2020, and many aspects of the disease remain enigmatic While some patients infected with the disease-causing virus SARS-CoV2 have no or mild symptoms, others experience severe symptoms requiring hospitalization Of these more severe patients, some remain stable while others experience cytokine storm syndrome or an exaggerated immune response that has been correlated with disease severity and progression of acute respiratory deterioration It is currently unknown why some patients with COVID-19 demonstrate this response and others do not In light of the apparent prominent role of the inflammatory mediators (i e cytokines) in COVID-19 pathogenesis, the ability to identify screening tools not only for the SARS-CoV2 virus but also for cytokines is important The present investigation was designed to identify the urinary cytokine signature in COVID-19 patients Methods The study enrolled 17 COVID-19 patients and 10 control subjects (SARS-CoV-2 negative) 18 years or older with glomerular filtration rate of &gt; 60mL/min Urine samples were collected and cytokines quantitated using the Luminex multiplex assay The cytokines analyzed were growth-regulated oncogene (GRO), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) Results The levels of GRO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in urine samples obtained from COVID-19 patients compared to controls (mean 16 8 pg/ml vs 9 2 pg/ml ± 2 39, p &lt; 0 0171 and mean 16 8 pg/ml vs 9 2 pg/ml ± 2 42, p &lt; 0 0157, respectively) Conversely, IL-8 level was similar between COVID-19 patients and controls (15 6 pg/ml vs 11 3 pg/ml ± 1 3, p&lt;0 1833) Conclusion The present investigation found that the levels of urinary cytokines GRO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to controls and may serve as urinary biomarkers of disease progression Furthermore, IL-8 although elevated in COVID-19 patients, did not reach statistical significance in our population sample The findings of this proof of concept study underscore that the urinary cytokines may serve as prognostic and diagnostic accessible biomarkers in COVID-19","Komnenov, Dragana Dhar Nivedita Lamb Laura Wills Melissa Khaliq Fareea Timar Ryan Chancellor Michael Bartolone Sarah Ward Elijah Rossi Noreen Bitar Ali Dhar Sorabh Cohn Johnathan",The FASEB Journal,,163

Aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between validated predictive scores for VTE such as IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD and: (1) Intensification of Care (IoC, admission to Pulmonology Department or Intensive Care Unit) (2) in-hospital mortality rate 3) 30-days mortality rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 51 adult patients with laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and calculated IMPROVE and IMPROVEDD scores. All patients underwent venous color-Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs to assess the presence of superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with normal values of D-dimer did not receive heparin therapy (LMWH); patients with &#8805; 4 ULN values of D-dimer or with a diagnosis of DVT were treated with therapeutic LMWH dosage, while the remaining patients were treated with prophylactic LMWH dosages. RESULTS: We found strong relations between IMPROVE score and the need for IoC and with the in-hospital mortality rate and between the IMPROVEDD score and the need for IoC. We defined that an IMPROVE score greater than 4 points was significantly associated to in-hospital mortality rate (p = 0.05), while an IMPROVEDD score greater than 3 points was associated with the need for IoC (p = 0.04). Multivariate logistic analysis showed how IMPROVE score was significantly associated to in-hospital and 30-days mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVE score can be considered an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30-days mortality.","Greco, S; Zenunaj, G; Bonsi, B; Bella, A; Lopreiato, M; Luciani, F; Pedrini, D; Vestita, G; Dalla Nora, E; Passaro, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,163

We aimed to determine the impact of the use of CCP transfusion in patients with previous circulating neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective cohort including 102 patients with COVID-19 transfused with ABO compatible CCP on days 0-2 after enrollment. Clinical status of patients was assessed using the adapted World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale on days 0, 5, and 14. The nAbs titration was performed using the cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MT126808.1). The primary outcome was clinical improvement on day 14, defined as a reduction of at least two points on the adapted WHO ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were the number of intensive care unit (ICU)-free days and the number of invasive mechanical ventilation-free days. RESULTS: Both nAbs of CCP units transfused (p < 0.001) and nAbs of patients before CCP transfusions (p = 0.028) were associated with clinical improvements by day 14. No significant associations between nAbs of patients or CCP units transfused were observed in the number of ICU or mechanical ventilation-free days. Administration of CCP units after 10 days of symptom onset resulted in a decrease in ICU-free days (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation-free days (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of high titer nAbs CCP units may be a determinant in clinical strategies against COVID-19. We consider these data as useful parameters to guide future CCP transfusion practices.","Yokoyama, Ana Paula H; Wendel, Silvano; Bonet-Bub, Carolina; Fachini, Roberta M; Dametto, Ana Paula F; Blumm, Fernando; Dutra, Valeria F; Candelaria, Gabriela T P; Sakashita, Araci M; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Fontão-Wendel, Rita; Hamerschlak, Nelson; Achkar, Ruth; Assunção, Murillo Santucci Cesar; Scuracchio, Patrícia; Nudelman, Victor; Pastore, Laerte; Pinho, João R R; Ben, Mirian Dal; Filho, Roberto Kalil; Marra, Alexandre R; Amano, Mariane T; Kallás, Esper G; Helito, Alfredo Salim; de Carvalho, Carlos Roberto Ribeiro; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Camargo, Anamaria A; Rizzo, Luiz V; Reis, Luiz F L; Kutner, Jose M",Transfusion,,163

For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the association between obesity and severity or prognosis requires further analysis. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study. Hospitalized patients were recruited in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2, 2020 to February 20, 2020. The data of body mass index (BMI) was obtained from follow-up of surviving patients. According to BMI, normal weight was defined as 18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m2 and obesity as > 28.0 kg/m2. Results: A total of 463 patients were enrolled, of which 242 (52.3%) patients were in the normal weight group; 179 (38.7%) were in the overweight group; and 42 (9.1%) were in the obesity group. Compared to the normal group, obese patients were more likely to have a higher heart rate; lower finger oxygen saturation; higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophil counts, basophil counts, intravenous glucose, triacylglycerol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase-MB, CD19+ cell counts and percentage; and lower levels of monocyte percentage, high density lipoprotein and CD3+ cell percentage. In addition, the proportions of hypertension (21.5% vs. 42.6%) and severe+critical illness (47.8 vs. 81.0 %) were significantly higher in the obesity group than those in normal group. However, no significant differences were observed between the normal and obesity groups in critical illness, organ damage and defined endpoint (mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit). Multiple logistic regression showed that obesity increased the risk of developing severe+critical illness (Odd ratio 3.586, 95% CI 1.550-8.298, P=0.003) in patients with COVID-19, and did not affect the risk of critical illness, organ damage and endpoints. Overweight did not affect the risk of severity, organ damage or endpoint in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Obesity may be a risk factor for developing severity in patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Jishou; Xu, Yao; Shen, Bo; He, Hua; Liu, Mingxiao; Zhao, Mengmeng; Liu, Jianfang; Xu, Shuwan; Pan, Wei; Ye, Jing; Wang, Zhen; Ye, Di; Liu, Menglin; Li, Dan; Luo, Zhen; Feng, Yongqi; Wang, Menglong; Wan, Jun",Int J Med Sci,,163

The aim of this study was to determine rates of change in BMD over time in people living with HIV (PLWH) treated with DTG. Design: The SCOLTA project is a multicenter observational study enrolling HIV-infected people who start newly commercialized drugs prospectively, with the aim of identifying toxicities and adverse events (AE) in a real-life setting. Methods: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) was performed at study entry (baseline, BL) and after 96 weeks. Percentage BMD change from BL was evaluated using a general linear model, including factors potentially associated with bone loss. Results: One hundred and sixty PLWH were enrolled (26.3% female, mean age 49.9 ± 11.2 years) from April 2015 to April 2017. Overall, we could calculate BMD change from baseline, for at least one site, in 133 subjects (83.1%). After a median of 102 weeks (IQR: 90-110), mean FN BMD increased, but not significantly, whereas LS BMD showed a significant mean increase of 13.1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-24.6) mg/cm3 (+1.6%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 2.8%) after a median time of 102 weeks (IQR: 84-110). As regards LS BMD, patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis at study entry experienced a high increase from baseline (20.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 38.1 mg/cm3), as well as experienced subjects (16.9, 95% CI: 4.7, 29.2 mg/cm3) and those on vitamin D supplementation (26.8, 95% CI: 7.7, 45.9 mg/cm3).

457314,FDA authorizes first single-shot COVID-19 vaccine,2021,"Introduction: Life-threatening hemoptysis is rare in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, we describe a severe case of hemoptysis a patient with COVID-19 and the multi-modal approach to manage this condition. Case: A 57 year-old man with diabetes was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite treatment with convalescent plasma, remdesivir and dexamethasone, he developed progressive respiratory failure eventually requiring VVECMO support on hospital day 8. He was started on heparin for therapeutic anticoagulation at this time. Anticoagulation was held on day 23 after large blood clots were suctioned via tracheostomy tube. CT revealed complete opacification of the bilateral lungs and major airways without evidence of acute arterial blushing (panel A). The patient underwent the first in a series of therapeutic bronchoscopies via a size 10 Shiley tracheostomy tube on day 28. Occlusive gelatinous blood clots were noted immediately upon entering the trachea. After failure of adequate clot evaluation with cryoprobe, a modified 24F chest tube was used as a suction catheter to achieve clot removal. After visualizing major airways, a bronchial blocker was positioned in the bronchus intermedius. Topical tranexamic acid was applied to sites of bleeding in the left upper lobe. Repeat bronchoscopy was performed on day 30, which showed new bleeding in the left lower lobe segments. An endobronchial blocker was repositioned in the left lower lobe and Surgicel was applied to ongoing bleeding sites within the right and left lung. Prior to repeat bronchoscopy, the patient was administered inhaled tranexamic acid three times daily due to findings of severely inflamed mucosa and diffused nature of bleed. On day 32, bronchoscopy revealed significantly improved bleeding. In-line suctioning was held in favor of daily diagnostic bronchoscopies to avoid suction trauma. Ultimately, the patient's bleeding resolved and he was eventually liberated from both ECMO and the ventilator with corresponding improvement on CT imaging (panel B). Discussion: We describe a case of a life-threatening hemoptysis in a patient with COVID-19 ARDS who was successfully managed using serial therapeutic bronchoscopies employing cryotherapy, mechanical tamponade, and pharamacologic coagulants to achieve hemostasis.","Senyei, G.; Nettlow, D.; Nobari, M.

To characterize the pathogenesis and pathogenicity of BoCV isolates, we used 5 different BoCV strains to inoculate colostrum-deprived calves, ~ 2-5 wk of age. Later, to determine if dual viral infection would potentiate pathogenicity of BoCV, calves were inoculated with BoCV alone, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) alone, or a series of dual-infection (BVDV-BoCV) schemes. A negative control group was included in all studies. Clinical signs and body temperature were monitored during the study and samples collected for lymphocyte counts, virus isolation, and serology. During autopsy, gross lesions were recorded and fixed tissues collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; fresh tissues were collected for virus isolation. Results suggest increased pathogenicity for isolate BoCV OK 1776. Increased body temperature was found in all virus-inoculated groups. Lung lesions were present in calves in all dual-infection groups; however, lesions were most pronounced in calves inoculated with BVDV followed by BoCV inoculation 6 d later. Lung lesions were consistent with mild-to-moderate interstitial pneumonia, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of BoCV antigen. Our studies demonstrated that BVDV-BoCV dual infection may play an important role in BRD pathogenesis, and timing between infections seems critical to the severity of lesions.","Ridpath, Julia F; Fulton, Robert W; Bauermann, Fernando V; Falkenberg, Shollie M; Welch, Jenny; Confer, Anthony W",J Vet Diagn Invest,,163

In this study, the effects of CO exposure on the dentate gyrus (DG) were investigated in a Wistar rat model by histochemical and molecular methods. Model rats showed significant cognitive impairment in the passive-avoidance test beginning 7 days after CO exposure. Immunohistochemistry showed that compared to the control, the cell number of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2)+/brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ cells in the DG was significantly less, but the number of SOX2+/GFAP- cells was not, reflecting a decreased number of type 1 and type 2a neural precursor cells. Compared to the control, the numbers of CD11b+ cells and neuron glial antigen 2+ cells were significantly less, but the number of SOX2-/GFAP+ cells was not. Flow cytometry showed that the percent of live microglial cells isolated from the hippocampus in this CO rat model was significantly lower than in controls. Furthermore, mRNA expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, which are neurogenic factors, was significantly decreased in that area. We conclude that, in this rat model, there is an association between delayed cognitive impairment with dysregulated adult hippocampal neurogenesis and glial changes in delayed CO encephalopathy.","Ochi, Shinichiro; Sekiya, Keisuke; Abe, Naoki; Funahashi, Yu; Kumon, Hiroshi; Yoshino, Yuta; Nishihara, Tasuku; Boku, Shuken; Iga, Jun-Ichi; Ueno, Shu-Ichi",Sci Rep,,163

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the therapeutic success of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in severe ARF in the course of COVID-19 in a noncritical care setting as well as to identify predictors of HFNO failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted between March and December 2020. We enrolled all consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in whom HFNO therapy was used. The primary outcome measure was death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission. RESULTS: Of the 380 patients with COVID-19, 116 individuals (30.5%) requiring HFNO due to severe pneumonia were analyzed. The primary outcome, defined as death or endotracheal intubation within 30 days from admission, occurred in 54 patients (46.6%). The overall 30-day mortality was 30.2% (35/116) in the entire cohort and 64.7% (34/51) among patients requiring endotracheal intubation. A multivariable analysis revealed that the ROX index measured within the first 12 hours of therapy below 3.85 was related to increased mortality (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.03-11.35) compared with the ROX index of 4.88 or higher. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that nearly half of patients treated with HFNO due to severe COVID-19 pneumonia will require mechanical ventilation. The ROX index is a useful tool for predicting HFNO failure in this population.","Celejewska-Wójcik, Natalia; Polok, Kamil; Górka, Karolina; Stachura, Tomasz; Kania, Aleksander; Nastalek, Pawel; Licholai, Sabina; Krawczyk, Jacek; Wójcik, Krzysztof; Sladek, Krzysztof",Pol.

468946,Response to Sanchit et al,2021,"In the midst of a pandemic, the efficacy of official measures to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis largely depends on public attitudes towards them, where conspiracy beliefs represent potential threats to the efficacy of measures such as vaccination. Here, we present predictors and outcomes associated with a COVID-19 vaccination conspiracy belief. In a representative survey of Germany, sociodemographic predictors of this belief were found to include age, federal state, migration background and school leaving qualification. The study revealed correlations with trust in scientific and governmental information sources, respondents' self-assessment of being informed about science, general conspiracy mindedness, the frequency of using Twitter and messaging apps, as well as willingness to voluntarily take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our results cohere with and build on the general literature on conspiracy mindedness and related factors. The findings provide an evidence base for more effective health and crisis communication in Germany and beyond.","Jensen, E.

METHODS: An observational, retrospective, and pharmacovigilance study based on the FAERS database collected between January 2014 and December 2019 was conducted. ICI-related AEs were defined as adverse reactions in patients using anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab and tremelimumab). Neurologic AEs previously reported to be associated with ICI were evaluated in the disproportionality analysis using the reporting odds ratio (ROR). RESULTS: Among 50,406 ICI-related reports, 3619 (7.2%) neurological case was found: 1985 with anti-PD-1, 372 with anti-PD-L1, 366 with anti-CTLA-4, and 896 with the combination of ICIs. In comparison to non-ICI drug use, ICI use demonstrated higher risk for neurologic complication, including hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, myasthenia gravis, encephalitis/myelitis, meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, vasculitis, and neuropathy. The risk of neurologic AEs associated with ICI combination therapy was as high as or even higher than ICI monotherapy, most significantly in hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. The proportion of serious neurological events and death related to combination therapy has been decreasing in recent years. Older age, male and female sex, and metastasis were not significant risk factors for the incidence of neurologic ICI-related AEs. Patients at older age, with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs. CONCLUSION: ICI use is associated with a higher risk of neurological complications, with dual ICI therapy posing a higher risk, while older age, sex, or metastasis were not. Patients at older age, with certain cancer types, or on dual ICI therapy may be at higher risk of fatal neurologic AEs.","Mikami, Takahisa; Liaw, Bobby; Asada, Mizuho; Niimura, Takahiro; Zamami, Yoshito; Green-LaRoche, Deborah; Pai, Lori; Levy, Michael; Jeyapalan, Suriya",J. neurooncol,,163

We will show that the notion of information entropy is also strongly related to demographic and economic trends by the use and analysis of real-time data. In the present research paper we address three different problems. First, we provide an evidence-based analytical approach which relates the human mobility patterns, social distancing attitudes and population density, with entropic measures which depict for erraticity of human contact behaviors. Second, we investigate the correlations between the aggregated mobility and entropic measures versus five external economic indicators. Finally,we show how entropic measures represents a useful tool for testing the limitations of typical assumptions in epidemiological and mobility models.","Vanni, Fabio; Lambert, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08975v1.pdf,163

The imminent need for masks has led many governments to produce them, including surgical masks with elastic loops or masks with side cuts at the ears. Among those on the market, surgical masks with elastic loops are the ones most chosen by parents for their children. These elastics cause constant compression on the skin and, consequently, on the cartilage of the auricle, leading to erythematous and painful lesions of the retroauricular skin when the masks are used for many hours a day. Pre-adolescent children have undeveloped auricular cartilage with less resistance to deformation; prolonged pressure from the elastic loops of the mask at the hollow or, even worse, at the anthelix level can influence the correct growth and angulation of the outer ear. In fact, unlike when using conservative methods for the treatment of protruding ears, this prolonged pressure can increase the cephaloauricular angle of the outer auricle. It is important for the authorities supplying the masks to be aware of this potential risk and for alternative solutions to be found while maintaining the possibility of legitimate prevention of the potential spread of the virus.Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

471792,Nanotechnology versus coronavirus,2020,"Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 have produced high pathogenicity and mortality rates in human populations. However, to meet the increasing demand for treatment of these pathogenic coronaviruses, accelerating novel antiviral drug development as much as possible has become a public concern. Target-based drug development may be a promising approach to achieve this goal. In this review, the relevant features of potential molecular targets in human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are highlighted, including the viral protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and methyltransferases. Additionally, recent advances in the development of antivirals based on these targets are summarized. This review is expected to provide new insights and potential strategies for the development of novel antiviral drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Xiao-Huan; Zhang, Xiao; Lu, Zhen-Hua; Zhu, You-Shuang; Wang, Tao",Biomed Pharmacother,,163

The objectives of this study were to understand mothers' SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers' intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. INTERPRETATION: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake.","Hetherington, Erin; Edwards, Sarah A; MacDonald, Shannon E; Racine, Nicole; Madigan, Sheri; McDonald, Sheila; Tough, Suzanne",CMAJ Open,,163

475775,Challenges associated with organising virtual events,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been confirmed to be a newly discovered zoonotic pathogen that causes highly contagious viral pneumonia, which the World Health Organization has named novel coronavirus pneumonia. Since its outbreak, it has become a global pandemic. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there is no mature experience or guidance on how to carry out emergency surgery for suspected cases requiring emergency surgical intervention and perioperative safety protection against virus. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment due to ""3-d abdominal pain aggravated with cessation of exhaust and defecation"". After improving inspections and laboratory tests, the patient was assessed and diagnosed by the multiple discipline team as ""strangulation obstruction, pulmonary infection"". His body temperature was 38.8 °C, and the chest computed tomography showed pulmonary infection. Given fever and pneumonia, we could not rule out COVID-19 after consultation by fever clinicians and respiratory experts. Hence, we performed emergency surgery under three-level protection for the suspected case. After surgery, his nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative, meaning COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing was followed. The patient was treated with symptomatic support after the operation. The stomach tube and urinary tube were removed on the 1st d after the operation. The clearing diet was started on the 3rd d after the operation, and the body temperature returned to normal. Flatus and bowel movements were noted on 5th postoperative day. He was discharged after 8 d of hospitalization. The patient was followed up for 4 mo after discharge, no serious complications occurred. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room due to ""abdominal distention, fatigue for 6 d and fever for 13 h"". After the multiple discipline team evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as ""intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, peritonitis and pulmonary infection"". At that time, the patient's body temperature was 39.6 °C, and chest computed tomography indicated pulmonary infection. COVID-19 could not be completely excluded after consultation in the fever outpatient department and respiratory department. Therefore, the patient was treated as a suspected case, and an urgent operation was performed under three-level medical protection. Postoperative nucleic acid test was negative, COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing were followed. After the operation, the patient received symptomatic and supportive treatment. The gastric tube was removed on the 1st d after the operation, and the urinary tube was removed on the 3rd d after the operation. Enteral nutrition began on the 3rd d after the operation. To date, no serious complications have been found during follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSION: Based on the previous treatment experience, we reviewed the procedures of two cases of suspected COVID-19 emergency surgery and extracted the perioperative protection experience. By referring to the literature and following the regulations on prevention and management of infectious diseases, we have developed a relatively mature and complete emergency surgical workflow for suspected COVID-19 cases and shared perioperative protection and management experience and measures.","Wu, Di; Xie, Tian-Yu; Sun, Xue-Hong; Wang, Xin-Xin",World J Clin Cases,,163

We previously described von willebrand factor (VWF) and their high molecular weight multimers (HMWMs) as potential trigger of microthrombosis. OBJECTIVES: Investigate VWF activity with collagen-binding assay and ADAMTS13 in COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study enrolled 77 hospitalized COVID-19 patients including 37 suffering from a non-critical form and 40 with critical form. Plasma levels of VWF collagen-binding ability (VWF:CB) and ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13:Act) were measured in the first 48 hours following admission. VWF:CB was increased in critical (631% IQR [460-704]) patients compared to non-critical patients (259% [235-330], p < 0.005). VWF:CB was significantly associated (r = 0.564, p < 0.001) with HMWMs. Moreover, median ADAMTS13:Act was lower in critical (64.8 IU/dL IQR 50.0-77.7) than non-critical patients (85.0 IU/dL IQR 75.8-94.7, p < 0.001), even if no patients displayed majors deficits. VWF:Ag-to-ADAMTS13:Act ratio was highly associated with VWF:CB (r = 0.916, p < 0.001). Moreover, VWF:CB level was highly predictive of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality as shown by the ROC curve analysis (AUC = 0.92, p < 0.0001) in which we identified a VWF:CB cut-off of 446% as providing the best predictor sensitivity-specificity balance. We confirmed this cut-off thanks to a Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis (log-rank p < 0.001) and a Cox-proportional Hazard model (HR = 49.1, 95% CI 1.81-1328.2, p = 0.021) adjusted on, BMI, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels. CONCLUSION: VWF:CB levels could summarize both VWF increased levels and hyper-reactivity subsequent to ADAMTS13 overflow and, therefore, be a valuable and easy to perform clinical biomarker of microthrombosis and COVID-19 severity.","Philippe, Aurélien; Gendron, Nicolas; Bory, Olivier; Beauvais, Agathe; Mirault, Tristan; Planquette, Benjamin; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Chocron, Richard; Smadja, David M",Angiogenesis,,163
476220,Tackling harmful cyanobacterial blooms with Chinese colleagues: We’re all in the same boat,2020,"Background: Currently, Mexico ranks 3rd worldwide in mortality due to COVID-19 and reliable information is scarce with available data focused on epidemiological characteristics. This study aimed to identify risk factors associated with mortality and outcomes among hospitalized Mexican patients with COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in the southeast of Mexico between March 28th and June 30th, 2020. Mortality was defined as survivor or non-survivor and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with mortality. Results: We included 200 patients with a mean age of 55 years, 69% were men, 72% had at least one chronic comorbidity. Eighty-six patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with an overall mortality rate of 82.5%. Only 51% of patients with IMV had Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, with a survival rate of 27.3%, but only 7.2% for Non-ICU admission (p<0.014). The multivariate analysis found that Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio &#8805; 9 (OR 4.64, 95% CI 2.05-10.53) albumin < 3.5gr/dL (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.56-9.07), LDH &#8805; 725 U/L (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.57) and IMV (OR 64.7; 95% CI 15.20-275.39) were independent risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusion: NLR, LDH, albumin and IMV are independent risk factors for mortality in Mexican patients with COVID-19. Also, availability of ICU resources is invaluable for better outcomes of critically ill patients. Our results could provide clinical information for timely decision-making in low and middle-income countries to overcome the pandemic.","Cortés-Tellés, Arturo; López-Romero, Stephanie; Mancilla-Ceballos, Roberto; Ortíz-Farías, Diana Lizbeth; Núñez-Caamal, Nelda; Figueroa-Hurtado, Esperanza",,,163

Only 97 (8%) patients were hospitalized (of which 68% were Hispanic). Most hospitalized patients had underlying medical conditions (62/97, 63.9%), including obesity. Thirty-one hospitalized patients (31/97, 32%) required respiratory support and nine patients (9/97, 9.3%) received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high percentage of Hispanic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalized. Most children with detection of SARS-CoV-2 had uncomplicated illness courses, some children were critically ill, and two patients died.","Foster, Catherine E; Marquez, Lucila; Davis, Andrea L; Tocco, Elizabeth; Koy, Tjin H; Dunn, James; Revell, Paula A; Arrington, Amy S; Campbell, Judith R",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,163
479052,A shift towards the annual habit in selfing Arabidopsis lyrata,2020,"Despite being an international reference in donation and transplantation, Spain needs to improve pediatric donation, including donation after the circulatory determination of death. The present article, a summary of the consensus report prepared by the Organización Nacional de Trasplantes and the Spanish Pediatrics Association, intends the facilitation of donation procedures in newborns and children and the analysis of associated ethical dilemma. The ethical basis for donation in children, the principles of clinical assessment of possible donors, the criteria for the determination of death in children, intensive care management of donors, basic concepts of donation after the circulatory determination of death and the procedures for donation in newborns with severe nervous system's malformation incompatible with life, as well as in children receiving palliative care are commented. Systematically considering the donation of organs and tissues when a child dies in conditions consistent with donation is an ethical imperative and must become an ethical standard, not only because of the need of organs for transplantation, but also to ensure family centered care.","Rodríguez Núñez, Antonio; Pérez Blanco, Alicia",An Pediatr (Barc),,163

METHODS: Longitudinal retrospective study in 2 rural populations of Aragon (13,579h). A time series evaluation with a t-Student analysis was carry on, during the first 70 days of the pandemic. A simple Kermack-McKendrick predictive model was compared with the possible COVID-19 cases. Complementary ANOVA analysis to assess the before-after number of daily cases, follow-up days and days from symptoms onset to first contact with Primary Health Care. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine cases were detected (53.4% women; 70.7% under 60). Primary Care followed 95.3% of cases. The number of cases during the first social distancing strategies was higher in comparison with the model (P=.004, P=.006 and P=.004) with a media of decreases of 6.7 possible cases by series. In relation to the lockdown period the model and cases are close (P=.608 and P=.093), with an average decrease of 1.8 cases per series. During post-containment, the number of cases per day (P<.001) and days of follow-up (P<.001) increased. CONCLUSIONS: Social distancing and containment measures were effective in reducing the number of possible COVID-19 cases in rural areas.

However, the understanding of potential linkages between restoration of visitors and nature-based tourism remains incomplete, resulting in a lack of orientation for researchers and managers. This study aimed to explore how visitors achieve restoration through nature by analyzing published literature on tourism. Using a systematic review method, this study examined destination types, participant traits, theoretical foundations, and potential restorative outcomes presented in 34 identified articles. A new framework that synthesizes relevant research and conceptualizes the restorative mechanisms of nature-based tourism from a human-nature interaction perspective was developed. Owing to the limitations in the theories, methods, cases, and the COVID-19 pandemic, interdisciplinary methods and multisensory theories are needed in the future to shed further light on the restoration of visitors through nature-based tourism. The findings provide a theoretical perspective on the consideration of nature-based tourism as a public-wellness product worldwide, and the study provides recommendations for future research in a COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 society.","Qiu, Mengyuan; Sha, Ji; Scott, Noel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,163

ObjectiveTo quantify the presence and effects of symptom presentation (or lack thereof) on the community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. DesignA cohort of 12,960 young adults participated in health reporting, contact tracing, and COVID-19 testing for 103 days between August 10 and November 20, 2020. SettingA mid-sized university campus in Indiana, United States. ParticipantsUniversity students, most of whom are 18-23 years old (67%) and living in congregate on-campus housing (60%). Of the 12,960 students, 1,556 (12.0%) tested positive for COVID-19 during the 103 day period. Of the positive cases, 1,198 reported sufficient health check data (7 days prior and 7 days post diagnosis) to be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Main OutcomeSecondary attack rate, based on presentation or absence of symptoms and type of symptoms calculated with respect to confirmed close contacts and a 14-day incubation period, varies on the type of symptom, timing of symptoms, and absence of symptoms. A quantifiable understanding of SAR on the longitudinal data of more than one thousand subjects in a university environment provides keen insights about developing strategies to respond to the continued prevalence of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated world and growth of variants. Results32.5% of all cases reported no symptoms within a 15-day window centered on their positive test (7 days prior, the day of the positive test, and 7 days after). The secondary attack rate (SAR) of asymptomatic COVID-19 index cases was 19.1%. The SAR of symptomatic index cases was 25.4%, and while the onset timing of symptoms did not affect transmission, the presence of certain symptoms like fever, shortness of breath, and dry cough increased the SAR as high as 30.0%. Conclusions and RelevanceAsymptomatic rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher than has been estimated in prior studies and continue to pose a significant and ongoing risk in the pandemic, especially with the prevalence of variants like the Delta variant. In addition, different symptoms are associated with varying rates of transmission, posing a significant challenge in how to diagnose or assess risk through mechanisms such as daily health checks for symptom reporting, a practice commonly in place for entry into schools, offices, restaurants, etc. Given the uncertain nature of symptoms and varied transmission rates, this study suggests a broader embrace of masking, social distancing and testing might be needed to counter the variants until higher global vaccination rates can be achieved.","Krieg, Steven J; Schnur, Jennifer J; Miranda, Marie L; Pfrender, Michael E; Chawla, Nitesh V",,,163

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All adult (&#8805;18 years) deaths recorded in England and Wales (March 1, 2020, to May 12, 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. We compared the prevalence of underlying health conditions between COVID and non-COVID-related deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of COVID-19 compared with other primary causes of death, stratified by sex and age group. RESULTS: Of 144,279 adult deaths recorded during the study period, 36,438 (25.3%) were confirmed COVID deaths. Women represented 43.2% (n=15,731) of COVID deaths compared with 51.9% (n=55,980) in non-COVID deaths. Overall, COVID deaths were younger than non-COVID deaths (82 vs 83 years). ASMR of COVID-19 was higher than all other common primary causes of death, across age groups and sexes, except for cancers in women between the ages of 30 and 79 years. A linear relationship was observed between ASMR and age among COVID-19 deaths, with persistently higher rates in men than women across all age groups. The most prevalent reported conditions were hypertension, dementia, chronic lung disease, and diabetes, and these were higher among COVID deaths. Pre-existing ischemic heart disease was similar in COVID (11.4%) and non-COVID (12%) deaths. CONCLUSION: In a nationwide analysis, COVID-19 infection was associated with higher age-standardized mortality than other primary causes of death, except cancer in women of select age groups. COVID-19 mortality was persistently higher in men and increased with advanced age.","Mohamed, Mohamed O; Gale, Chris P; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Doran, Tim; de Belder, Mark; Asaria, Miqdad; Luscher, Thomas; Wu, Jianhua; Rashid, Muhammad; Stephenson, Courtney; Denwood, Tom; Roebuck, Chris; Deanfield, John; Mamas, Mamas A",Mayo Clin Proc,,163

485369,Flexible Noncontact Sensing for Human-Machine Interaction,2021,"BACKGROUND: The mental health of the UK population declined at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Convenience sample surveys indicate that recovery began soon after. Using a probability sample, we tracked mental health during the pandemic to characterise mental health trajectories and identify predictors of deterioration. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of five waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (a large, national, probability-based survey that has been collecting data continuously since January, 2009) from late April to early October, 2020 and pre-pandemic data taken from 2018-19. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We used latent class mixed models to identify discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression to identify predictors of change in mental health. FINDINGS: Mental health was assessed in 19 763 adults (&#8805;16 years; 11 477 [58·1%] women and 8287 [41·9%] men; 3453 [17·5%] participants from minority ethnic groups). Mean population mental health deteriorated with the onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July, 2020. Latent class analysis identified five distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Most individuals in the population had either consistently good (7437 [39·3%] participants) or consistently very good (7623 [37·5%] participants) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic. A recovering group (1727 [12·0%] participants) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to around pre-pandemic levels of mental health by October, 2020. The two remaining groups were characterised by poor mental health throughout the observation period; for one group, (523 [4·1%] participants) there was an initial worsening in mental health that was sustained with highly elevated scores. The other group (1011 [7·0%] participants) had little initial acute deterioration in their mental health, but reported a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time. These last two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, to live in deprived neighbourhoods, and be of Asian, Black or mixed ethnicity. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, local lockdown, and financial difficulties all predicted a subsequent deterioration in mental health. INTERPRETATION: Between April and October 2020, the mental health of most UK adults remained resilient or returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around one in nine individuals had deteriorating or consistently poor mental health. People living in areas affected by lockdown, struggling financially, with pre-existing conditions, or infection with SARS-CoV-2 might benefit most from early intervention.

486483,What can vaccines learn from aviation?,2020,"In the wake of COVID-19, the postgraduate activities in physiology were shifted from live (face-to-face teaching) to virtual mode. This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.","Kaur, Simran; Bir, Megha; Chandran, Dinu S; Deepak, Kishore Kumar",Adv Physiol Educ,,163

The combined analysis aims to reduce the significant number of false negatives of these tests, but also to provide complementary evidence about the presence and severity of the disease. However, the procedure is not free of errors, and the interpretation of the chest X-Ray is only restricted to radiologists due to its complexity. With the long term goal to provide new evidence for the diagnosis, this paper presents an evaluation of different methods based on a deep neural network. These are the first steps to develop an automatic COVID-19 diagnosis tool using chest X-Ray images, that would additionally differentiate between controls, pneumonia or COVID-19 groups. The paper describes the process followed to train a Convolutional Neural Network with a dataset of more than 79,500 X-Ray images compiled from different sources, including more than 8,500 COVID-19 examples. For the sake of evaluation and comparison of the models developed, three different experiments were carried out following three preprocessing schemes. The aim is to evaluate how preprocessing the data affects the results and improves its explainability. Likewise, a critical analysis is carried out about different variability issues that might compromise the system and the effects on the performance. With the employed methodology, a 91.5% classification accuracy is obtained, with a 87.4% average recall for the worst but most explainable experiment, which requires a previous automatic segmentation of the lungs region.","Arias-Londono, Julian D.; Gomez-Garcia, Jorge A.; Moro-Velazquez, Laureano; Godino-Llorente, Juan I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14259v1.pdf,163

For that, the synthesis and characterization of this new platform as well as its spatiotemporal analysis from in vitro and in vivo topical application were explored and extensively discussed in this paper. The TAT or D4 peptides were chosen as CPP due to specific target strategies by the charge grouping on the skin surface or target the overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of cell membrane of keratinocytes, respectively. Thus, the nanoparticle characterization results when taken together suggested that designed LCNs maintained their hexagonal phase structure, nanoscale particle size, and low polydispersity index even after drug, lipopolymers, and peptide additions, which are proved to be favorable for topical skin delivery. There were no statistical differences among the LCNs investigated, except for superficial charge of LCN conjugated with TAT which may have altered the LCN zeta potential due to cationic charge of TAT amino acid sequence compared with D4. The cumulative amounts of LA retained into the skin were determined to be even higher coming from the targeted LCNs. Moreover, the exogenous antioxidant application of the LA from the LCNs can prevent ROS damage, which was demonstrated by this study with the less myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and decrease in cytokine levels (TNF-alpha and IL-1ß) generated by the oxidative stress modulation. Together, the data presented highlights the potential of these targeted LCNs, and overall, opens new frontiers for preclinical trials.","Campos, Patrícia Mazureki; Praça, Fabíola Garcia; Mussi, Samuel Vidal; Figueiredo, Sônia Aparecida; Fantini, Márcia Carvalho de Abreu; Fonseca, Maria José Vieira; Torchilin, Vladimir P; Bentley, Maria Vitória Lopes Badra",Drug deliv. transl. res.

491148,"Supercritical fluid chromatography - Mass spectrometry in metabolomics: Past, present, and future perspectives",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the most cryptic pandemic outbreak of the 21st century, has gripped more than 1.8 million people to death and infected almost eighty six million. As it is a new variant of SARS, there is no approved drug or vaccine available against this virus. This study aims to predict some promising cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome utilizing immunoinformatic approaches. Firstly, we identified 21 epitopes from 7 different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 inducing immune response and checked for allergenicity and conservancy. Based on these factors, we selected the top three epitopes, namely KAYNVTQAF, ATSRTLSYY, and LTALRLCAY showing functional interactions with the maximum number of MHC alleles and no allergenicity. Secondly, the 3D model of selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were built and Molecular Docking simulation was performed. Most interestingly, the best two epitopes predicted by docking are part of two different structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, namely Membrane Glycoprotein (ATSRTLSYY) and Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (KAYNVTQAF), which are generally target of choice for vaccine designing. Upon Molecular Docking, interactions between selected epitopes and HLA-A*29:02 were further validated by 50 ns Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Analysis of RMSD, Rg, SASA, number of hydrogen bonds, RMSF, MM-PBSA, PCA, and DCCM from MD suggested that ATSRTLSYY is the most stable and promising epitope than KAYNVTQAF epitope. Moreover, we also identified B-cell epitopes for each of the antigenic proteins of SARS CoV-2. Findings of our work will be a good resource for wet lab experiments and will lessen the timeline for vaccine construction. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

492844,1-Bromopropane-induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells via oxidative stress and inactivation of Nrf2,2020,"Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or COVID-19, is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis at all levels of the vascular tree including the microvasculature, arteries and veins. However, the mechanisms involved in the heterogenic thrombotic presentations in COVID-19 are poorly understood. One potential contributor to the prothrombotic state in COVID-19 is von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein produced by endothelial cells and platelets that is unfolded and activated by shear stress or artificially with ristocetin. vWF has been implicated in pathogenesis of arterial clots including stroke, consistent with its activation by shear. vWF has also been implicated in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a subtype of microvascular thrombosis. Elevated vWF has even been associated with increased risk of venous thrombosis, a classically low shear environment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether vWF had a higher propensity to become activated in COVID-19, suggestive of an altered configuration. We hypothesized that vWF from patients with COVID-19 would be more active than healthy controls. Discarded whole blood samples were collected from hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19;blood from healthy donors was collected via venipuncture. Patient and control plasma were rapidly thawed at 37 ? then transferred to de-identified containers to blind performing scientist. Samples were processed in a duplicate manner adding 30 ?L of plasma to a solution containing 200 x103/?L lyophilized platelets. We measured vWF activation using two methods: the first involved agglutination with an intermediate concentration of ristocetin (between 0.6 - 0.7 mg/mL) to achieve less than 40% of normal agglutination. The second method involved detection of A1-12 antibody binding with ELISA. The A1-12 antibody binds to the N-terminus of the A1 subunit, a location that is typically obscured by the A2 domain and thus is only accessible with vWF is unfolded. All measured values were compared to normal pooled plasma (NPP) processed in the same experiment. Notably all measures of activation of vWF were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The primary slope of the agglutination was the most significantly elevated when compared to controls (162 verses 106 % of NPP, p = 0.002). The absolute amount of vWF was also significantly increased in patients compared to controls (148 verses 100% of NPP, p &lt; 0.001). These preliminary data are suggestive of increased activity of vWF in COVID-19 infectionin addition to an increased absolute level. vWF may be a significant pathway that becomes dysregulated during the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

493895,Corona virus,2020,"Background: The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue. Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students. Method: A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software. Result: The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students' present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. The poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students' mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.","Safa, Farhana; Anjum, Afifa; Hossain, Sahadat; Islam Trisa, Tonima; Fatema Alam, Syeda; Abdur Rafi, Md; Podder, Vivek; Nahar Koly, Kamrun; Tasnia Azad, Dewan; Uddin Ahmad, Wasi; Nury Nodi, Rhedeya; Ashraf, Fatema; Quamrul Akhter, S M; Uddin Ahmed, Helal; Hasan, M Tasdik",Child Youth Serv Rev,,163
493962,It takes two to MOU,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus associated with worldwide transmission of COVID-19 disease. By the beginning of March, WHO reported about 113,820,000 confirmed cases including more than 2,527,000 deaths all over the world. However, the true extent of virus circulation or its real infection/fatality ratio is not well-estimated due to the huge portion of asymptomatic infections. In this observational study, we have estimated the prevalence of specific immunoglobulin M and G directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigen in a cohort of 1383 adult volunteers aged over 65 years old, living in the district of Benevento, in the South of Italy. Serological screening was carried out on capillary blood in September 2020, seven months after pandemic outbreak in Italy, to evaluate virus circulation and antibody response among elderly adults, in which severe symptoms due to viral infection are more common. The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 4.70% (CI 3.70%-5.95%) with no statistically significant differences between sexes. Among these, 69.69% (CI 55.61%-77.80%) tested positive to IgM, 23.08% (CI 14.51%-34.64%) to IgG and 9.23% (CI 4.30%-18.71%) was positive for both. All patients that were positive to IgM underwent molecular testing through RT-qPCR on oral-rhino pharyngeal swabs and only one specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Instead, the presence of IgG from screened volunteers was confirmed by re-testing serum samples using both an ELISA assay validated for in vitro diagnostic use (IVD) and a recently published synthetic peptide-based ELISA assay. In conclusion, our report suggests that (1) early restrictions were successful in limiting COVID-19 diffusion in the district of Benevento; (2) rapid serological analysis is an ideal testing for both determining real seroprevalence and massive screening, whereas detection of viral RNA remains a gold standard for identification of infected patients; (3) even among people without COVID-19 related symptoms, the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 antigens has individual features.","Polvere, Immacolata; Parrella, Alfredina; Casamassa, Giovanna; D039,; Andrea, Silvia; Tizzano, Annamaria; Cardinale, Gaetano; Voccola, Serena; Porcaro, Piercarmine; Stilo, Romania; Vito, Pasquale; Zotti, Tiziana",Diagnostics (Basel),,163

498361,Electrical stimulation and piezoelectric biomaterials for bone tissue engineering applications,2020,"Previous studies have described RT-LAMP methodology for the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab and saliva samples. Here we describe the validation of an improved sample preparation method for extraction free Direct RT-LAMP and define the clinical performance of four different RT-LAMP assay formats for detection of SARS-CoV-2 within a large-scale multisite clinical evaluation. We describe Direct RT-LAMP on 559 swabs and 86,760 saliva samples and RNA RT-LAMP on extracted RNA from 12,619 swabs and 12,521 saliva samples collected from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals across multiple healthcare and community settings. For Direct RT-LAMP, we found a diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) of 70.35% (95% CI 63.48-76.60%) on swabs and 84.62% (79.50-88.88%) on saliva, with diagnostic specificity (DSp) of 100% (98.98-100.00%) on swabs and 100% (99.72-100.00%) on saliva when compared to RT-qPCR. Analysing samples with RT-qPCR ORF1ab CT values of [≤]25 and [≤]33 (high and medium-high viral copy number, respectively), we found DSe of 100% (96.34-100%) and 77.78% (70.99-83.62%) for swabs, and 99.01% (94.61-99.97%) and 87.32% (80.71-92.31%) for saliva. For RNA RT-LAMP DSe and DSp were 95.98% (92.74-98.06%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for swabs, and 80.65% (73.54-86.54%) and 99.99% (99.95-100%) for saliva, respectively. The findings from these evaluations demonstrate that RT-LAMP testing of swabs and saliva is applicable to a variety of different use-cases, including frequent, interval-based testing of saliva from asymptomatic individuals via Direct RT-LAMP that may otherwise be missed using symptomatic testing alone. Author SummaryRapid diagnostic testing at scale to identify and isolate symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals potentially transmitting infectious SARS-CoV-2 is an essential part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RT-LAMP on both extracted RNA and directly on crude samples potentially provides faster turnaround times than reverse-transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR testing, with a higher sensitivity and specificity than antigen lateral flow devices. Increasing evidence points to potential benefits of SARS-CoV-2 testing using saliva rather than nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, leading us to undertake a multi-site evaluation of an improved simple sample preparation method for Direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP. Our study demonstrated that the RNA RT-LAMP assay has high sensitivity and specificity, providing a rapid alternative to RT-qPCR testing with a reliance on differing reagents and equipment. The simple SARS-CoV-2 Direct RT-LAMP preparation method also demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva and naso/oropharyngeal swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, notably in saliva samples from which the individual would likely be considered infectious. The findings highlight the usefulness of saliva as a simple to collect, non-invasive, sample type, potentially applicable for interval-based testing of asymptomatic individuals.","Kidd, Stephen P; Burns, Dan; Armson, Bryony; Beggs, Andrew D; Howson, Emma L.

504008,Asynchronous Choice of Topics- an Adventure in Classroom Instruction,2021,"Background: SARS-COVID-2 has recently been one of the most life-threatening problems which urgently needs new therapeutic antiviral agents, especially those of herbal origin. Purpose: The study aimed to load acaciin (ACA) into the new self-assembled nanofibers (NFs) followed by investigating their possible antiviral effect against bovine coronavirus (BCV) as a surrogate model for SARS-COV-2. Methods: ACA was identified using 1H-NMR and DEPT-Q 13C-NMR spectroscopy, the molecular docking study was performed using Autodock 4 and a modification of the traditional solvent injection method was applied for the synthesis of the biodegradable NFs. Different characterization techniques were used to inspect the formation of the NFs, which is followed by antiviral investigation against BCV as well as MTT assay using MDBK cells. Results: Core/shell NFs, ranging between 80-330 nm with tiny thorn-like branches, were formed which attained an enhanced encapsulation efficiency (97.5 ± 0.53%, P<0.05) and a dual controlled release (a burst release of 65% at 1 h and a sustained release up to >24 h). The antiviral investigation of the formed NFs revealed a significant inhibition of 98.88 ± 0.16% (P<0.05) with IC50 of 12.6 µM against BCV cells. Conclusion: The results introduced a new, time/cost-saving strategy for the synthesis of biodegradable NFs without the need for electric current or hazardous cross-linking agents. Moreover, it provided an innovative avenue for the discovery of drugs of herbal origin for the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mohamad, Soad A; Zahran, Eman Maher; Abdel Fadeel, Maha Raafat; Albohy, Amgad; Safwat, Mohamed A",Int J Nanomedicine,,163

506144,Coronavirus low risk for shed in tears[Including Commentary by Jack S Parker],2020,"Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, which in turn activate protein kinase, leading to a reduction in the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines to ultimately influence the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in vitro by inhibiting angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) expression. The rheological, anti-inflammatory, and renin-angiotensin axis properties of PTX highlight this drug as a therapeutic treatment alternative for patients with COVID-19 by helping reduce the production of the inflammatory cytokines without deleterious effects on the immune system to delay viral clearance. Moreover, PTX can restore the balance of the immune response, reduce damage to the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, improve circulation, and prevent microvascular thrombosis. There is further evidence that PTX can improve ventilatory parameters. Therefore, we propose repositioning PTX in the treatment of COVID-19. The main advantage of repositioning PTX is that it is an affordable drug that is already available worldwide with an established safety profile, further offering the possibility of immediately analysing the result of its use and associated success rates. Another advantage is that PTX selectively reduces the concentration of TNF-&#945; mRNA in cells, which, in the case of an acute infectious state such as COVID-19, would seem to offer a more strategic approach.","Maldonado, Valente; Loza-Mejía, Marco A; Chávez-Alderete, Jaime",Med Hypotheses,,163

China has taken strict measures to curb the spread of the disease to save lives, and has managed to control the outbreak. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close physical contact, so it is challenging to prevent nosocomial infection and possible spread during dental treatment. Since the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, a disease prevention and control strategy based on the new concept of population risk classification and rational use of personal protective equipment has been implemented by the Peking University Hospital of Stomatology. Nosocomial infection prevention and control concepts and measures relating to dental diagnosis and treatment are critically checked in the hospital.

509813,Tomorrow's biggest microbial threats,2021,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan has imposed a huge influence in terms of public health and economy on society. However, no effective drugs or vaccines have been developed so far. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been considered as a promising supplementary treatment of this disease due to its clinically proven performance in many severe diseases, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Meanwhile, many reports suggest that the side-effects (SE) of TCM prescriptions cannot be ignored in treating COVID-19 as it often leads to dramatic degradation of the patients' physical condition. Systematic evaluation of TCM regarding its latent SE becomes a burning issue. AIM: In this study, we used an ontology-based side-effect prediction framework (OSPF) developed from our previous work and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based deep learning, to evaluate the TCM prescriptions officially recommended by China for the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OSPF developed from our previous work was implemented in this study, where an ontology-based model separated all ingredients in a TCM prescription into two categories: hot and cold. A database was created by converting each TCM prescription into a vector which contained ingredient dosages, corresponding hot/cold attribution and safe/unsafe labels. This allowed for training of the ANN model. A safety indicator (SI), as a complement to SE possibility, was then assigned to each TCM prescription. According to the proposed SI, from high to low, the recommended prescription list could be optimized. Furthermore, in interest of expanding the potential treatment options, SIs of other well-known TCM prescriptions, which are not included in the recommended list but are used traditionally to cure flu-like diseases, are also evaluated via this method. RESULTS: Based on SI, QFPD-T, HSBD-F, PMSP, GCT-CJ, SF-ZSY, and HSYF-F were the safest treatments in the recommended list, with SI scores over 0.8. PESP, QYLX-F, JHQG-KL, SFJD-JN, SHL-KFY, PESP1, XBJ-ZSY, HSZF-F, PSSP2, FFTS-W, and NHSQ-W were the prescriptions most likely to be unsafe, with SI scores below 0.1. In the additional lists of other TCM prescriptions, the indicators of XC-T, SQRS-S, CC-J, and XFBD-F were all above 0.8, while QF-Y, XZXS-S, BJ-S, KBD-CJ, and QWJD-T's indicators were all below 0.1. CONCLUSIONS: In total, there were 10 TCM prescriptions with indicators over 0.8, suggesting that they could be considered in treating COVID-19, if suitable. We believe this work could provide reasonable suggestions for choosing proper TCM prescriptions as a supplementary treatment for COVID-19. Furthermore, this work introduces a novel and informative method which could help create recommendation list of TCM prescriptions for the treatment of other diseases.","Wang, Zeheng; Li, Liang; Song, Miao; Yan, Jing; Shi, Junjie; Yao, Yuanzhe",J Ethnopharmacol,,163

COVID-19 serology assays will significantly benefit from sensitive and reliable technologies that can process dozens of samples in parallel, thus reducing costs and time; however, they will also benefit from biosensors that can assess antibody reactivities to multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Here, we report a high-throughput microfluidic device that can assess antibody reactivities against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens from up to 50 serum samples in parallel. This semi-automatic platform measures IgG and IgM levels against four SARS-CoV-2 proteins: the spike protein (S), the S1 subunit (S1), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the nucleocapsid (N). After assay optimization, we evaluated sera from infected individuals with COVID-19 and a cohort of archival samples from 2018. The assay achieved a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 91%. Nonetheless, both parameters increased to 100% when evaluating sera from individuals in the third week after symptom onset. To further assess our platform's utility, we monitored the antibody titers from 5 COVID-19 patients over a time course of several weeks.

Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Collin, Daniel F; Shields-Zeeman, Laura S; Batra, Akansha; White, Justin S; Tong, Michelle; Hamad, Rita",Soc Sci Med,,163
511425,Mobile Health (mHealth) Viral Diagnostics Enabled with Adaptive Adversarial Learning,2020,"BACKGROUND: The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was successfully restrained in many countries around the world by means of a severe lockdown. Now, we are entering the second phase of the pandemics in which the spread of the virus needs to be contained within the limits that national health systems can cope with. This second phase of the epidemics is expected to last until a vaccination is available or herd immunity is reached. Long-term management strategies thus need to be developed. METHODS: In this paper we present a new agent-based simulation model ""COVID-19 ABM"" with which we simulate 4 alternative scenarios for the second ""new normality"" phase that can help decision-makers to take adequate control and intervention measures. RESULTS: The scenarios resulted in distinctly different outcomes. A continued lockdown could regionally eradicate the virus within a few months, whereas a relaxation back to 80% of former activity-levels was followed by a second outbreak. Contact-tracing as well as adaptive response strategies could keep COVID-19 within limits. CONCLUSION: The main insights are that low-level voluntary use of tracing apps shows no relevant effects on containing the virus, whereas medium or high-level tracing allows maintaining a considerably higher level of social activity. Adaptive control strategies help in finding the level of least restrictions. A regional approach to adaptive management can further help in fine-tuning the response to regional dynamics and thus minimise negative economic effects.","Wallentin, Gudrun; Kaziyeva, Dana; Reibersdorfer-Adelsberger, Eva",Int. j. health policy manag,,163

515727,Two more coronaviruses may infect people,2021,"COVID-19 has morphed from a health crisis to an economic crisis that affected the global economy through several channels. This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on the time-frequency connectedness between Green Bonds and other financial assets. Our sample includes the global stock market, bond market, oil, USD index, and two popular hedging alternatives, namely Gold and Bitcoin, from May 2013 to August 2020. First, we apply the methodologies of Diebold and Yilmaz (International Journal of Forecasting, 2012, 28(1), 57-66) and Barunk and Krehlk (Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2018, 16(2), 271-296). Then, we estimate hedge ratios and hedge effectiveness of green bonds for other financial assets. Green bonds are found to have a great weight in the overall network, particularly strongly connected with the USD index and bond index. While the bi-directional relationship with USD persists during COVID, the connectedness with conventional bonds is also strengthened. Notably, we find a weak relationship between Green bonds and Bitcoin, both in the short and long run. As portfolio implications, Gold and USD have the highest hedge ratio, which is confirmed by the hedging effectiveness. In contrast, oil and stocks exhibit the lowest hedging effectiveness. Our findings imply that financial assets might have a heterogeneous relationship with green bonds. Furthermore, despite its infancy, it seems that the role of green bond during a crisis should not be ignored, as it can be a hedger for some assets, while a contagion amplifier during crisis times.","Naeem, M.

Bilateral viral conjunctivitis is an initial symptom in some other cases. It is therefore, vital to understand whether the eye can be directly infected by the virus, as well as the consequences of the viral infection in the ocular tissue. 2019-nCoV invades human cells primarily by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. ACE2 expresses, not only in the lungs, kidneys, and cardiovascular system, but also in human conjunctiva, cornea, aqueous humor, and retina. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively expand the present understanding of the COVID-19 infection mechanism and pathogenesis by clarifying the distribution of ACE2 in the eye. ACE2 is not only the receptor of 2019-nCoV, but also a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). RAS, which appears relatively independent in the eye, plays a modulating role and is associated with many common eye diseases. This article reviews the distribution and clinical significance of ACE2 in ocular tissues.","Zhang, Lujia; Jin, Xiuxiu; Lei, Bo",Zhonghua Shiyan Yanke Zazhi Chin. J. Exp. Ophthalmol.,,163

517602,Toxicology and pharmacology of synthetic organoselenium compounds: an update,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have multisystemic involvement with hyperinflammation being a cardinal feature and deranged iron metabolism having a possible role. In this premise, we studied the prognostic value of two markers of iron metabolism ferritin and hemoglobin. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective-cohort study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in northern India involving 210 hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged 15-and above. Analysis was done for clinical profile, comorbidities and basic laboratory indices including ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR) with primary end-point being in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Median serum ferritin levels (640.00ng/mL vs 220.00ng/mL) were significantly higher among non-survivors as against survivors while median hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (12.12g/dL vs 13.73g/dL). Serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (Sn 80%, Sp 70%) predicted mortality with high sensitivity and specificity. Notably, serum ferritin levels >400ng/mL (HR 11.075 [1.481-82.801]) and anemia, defined as a hemoglobin of <12g/dL for females and <13g/dL for males and were significantly associated with the risk of mortality in a univariable Cox-proportional hazards regression. The median FHR was significantly higher among non-survivors compared to survivors (56.98 vs 17.17). FHR>31 (Sn 85% Sp 71.6%) was highly sensitive and specific for predicting mortality. The multivariable analysis indicated that FHR >31 remained an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 12.293 [3.147-48.028]). CONCLUSION: Ferritin-hemoglobin ratio (FHR), which encompasses into a single index, the effects of both elevated levels of ferritin and the severity of anemia, seems to perform particularly well as a prognostic marker and emerged as an independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hyperferritinemia and anemia, both, are inexorably interlinked in addition to having a role, directly or indirectly in the disease pathophysiology. Ferritin and hemoglobin, hence should be seen as two sides of the same coin rather than as two discrete entities. © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.","Raman, N.; Kv, P.; Ashta, K.

517802,CLIPort: What and Where Pathways for Robotic Manipulation,2021-09-24,"The booming growth in environmental conditions sensing and monitoring pushes the need of inexpensive environment sensors with small size and low power consumption. The outbreak of COVID-19 further increases the need for fast monitoring of environment conditions. The micro-electrical-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technologies are considered as promising solutions to realize the required environment sensors. The mature complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process platforms available in many foundries can be extended to fabricate MEMS sensors to offer the advantage of relatively easier commercialization. Moreover, by leveraging the characteristics of CMOS process platforms, the integration of multiple sensors and sensing circuits to form a compact sensing system can also be achieved. This review paper will focus on introducing the miniaturized environmental sensing devices implemented and integrated using the CMOS-MEMS technologies. In general, the CMOS chips for environment sensing are firstly fabricated using the foundry-available CMOS processes, and then the post-CMOS micromachining processes are performed to implement the CMOS-MEMS environment sensors. This paper respectively reviews five different environment sensors (including the infrared, pressure (barometer), humidity/temperature, and gas sensors) using the CMOS-based MEMS technologies. The advantages and design concerns of sensors fabricated by different CMOS and post-CMOS processes are introduced and discussed. Moreover, the CMOS-MEMS environment sensing hub implemented through the monolithic integration of multiple environment sensors is also introduced.

Currently, a clear relationship between COVID-19 infection incidence and/or complications due to chronic or occasional treatments for other pathologies is still not clear, albeit the COVID-19 pandemic may condition the treatment strategy of complex disorders, such as osteoarthritis (OA). Importantly, OA is the most common age-related joint disease, affecting more than 80% of people older than the age of 55, an age burden also shared with the highest severity in COVID-19 patients. OA patients often show a large array of concomitant pathologies, such as diabetes, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases that are again shared with COVID-19 patients and may therefore increase complications. Moreover, different OA treatments, such as NSAIDs, paracetamol, corticosteroids, opioids, or other molecules have a wide array of iatrogenic effects, potentially increasing COVID-19 secondary infection incidence or complications. In this review we critically analyze the evidence on either negative or positive effects of drugs commonly used to manage OA in this particular scenario. This would provide orthopedic surgeons in particular, and physicians, pharmacologists, and clinicians in general, a comprehensive description about the safety of the current pharmacological approaches and a decision-making tool to treat their OA patients as the coronavirus pandemic continues.","Ragni, Enrico; Mangiavini, Laura; Viganò, Marco; Brini, Anna Teresa; Peretti, Giuseppe Michele; Banfi, Giuseppe; de Girolamo, Laura",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,163

Objective: This work aimed to share professional experiences on medication optimization and provide a feasible reference for the pharmaceutical care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study was conducted in a COVID-19-designated hospital in China. A group of dedicated clinical pharmacists participated in multidisciplinary rounds to optimize the treatments for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Consensus on medication recommendations was reached by a multidisciplinary team through bi-daily discussion. Related drug, classification, cause, and adjustment content for recommendations were recorded and reviewed. Results: A total of 111 medication recommendations were supplied for 22 out of 33 (56.7%) critically ill patients from 1 February 2020 to 18 March 2020, and 106 (95.5%) of these were accepted. Among these recommendations, 64 (67.7%), 32 (28.8%), and 15 (13.5%) were related to antibiotics and antifungals, antiviral agents, and other drugs, respectively. Recommendation types significantly differed for different anti-infectives (p &lt; 0.05). For antibiotics and antifungals, treatment effectiveness accounted for 60.9% of recommendation types, with 15 (38.5%) cases related to untreated infections. For antiviral agents, adverse drug events were the most common recommendation types (84.4%), with 20 (74.1%) cases related to liver function dysfunction. Discontinuation of suspected antiviral agents (66.7%) was usually recommended after the occurrence of adverse events that may progress and bring poor outcomes. Conclusion: Forceful and extensive on-ward participation is recommended for clinical pharmacists in managing critically ill patients. Our experiences highlight the need for special attention toward untreated infections and adverse events related to antiviral agents.","Wang, Rongrong; Kong, Limin; Xu, Qiang; Yang, Ping; Wang, Xiaojuan; Chen, Na; Li, Lu; Jiang, Saiping; Lu, Xiaoyang",Res.

Microglia are the major player of central innate immunity integrating peripheral signals arising from the circumventricular regions lacking the blood-brain barrier (BBB), via neural afferent pathways such as the vagal nerve and also by choroid plexus into the brain ventricles. Defective and/or unrestrained activation of central and peripheral immunity during embryonic development might set an aberrant connectome establishment and brain function, leading to major psychiatric disorders in postnatal stages. Molecular candidates leading to central and peripheral innate immune overactivation identified metabolic substrates and lipid species as major contributors of immunological priming, supporting the role of a metabolic flexibility node during trained immunity. Mechanistically, trained immunity is established by an epigenetic program including DNA methylation and histone acetylation, as the major molecular epigenetic signatures to set immune phenotypes. By definition, immunological training sets reprogramming of innate immune cells, enhancing or repressing immune responses towards a second challenge which potentially might contribute to neurodevelopment disorders. Notably, the innate immune training might be set during pregnancy by maternal immune activation stimuli. In this review, we integrate the most valuable scientific evidence supporting the role of metabolic cues assisting metabolic flexibility, leading to innate immune training during development and its effects on aberrant neurological phenotypes in the offspring. We also add reports supporting the role of methylation and histone acetylation signatures as a major epigenetic mechanism regulating immune training.","Cruz-Carrillo, Gabriela; Camacho-Morales, Alberto",Mol.

The inflammasome has evolved for this purpose and is an important surveillance system that, when triggered, fights infection and eliminates pathogens. However, there is growing evidence that the inflammasome also plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory disease. Inflammasomes contribute to both the clearance of the pathogen as well as its pathogenesis – depending on the amount of inflammation triggered. How respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation in the lung, causing lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, encoded by all common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation. This is a novel mechanism by which respiratory viral infection activates inflammasomes, and identifies sensing of disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations as a novel pathogen-recognition pathway in the lung.","Triantafilou, Kathy; Triantafilou, Martha",Trends Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986075/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.06.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X14001206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X14001206,163

How to represent patient longitudinal medical data is the key to making these predictions. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a popular model for patient longitudinal medical data representation from the view of patient status sequences, but it cannot represent complex interactions among different types of medical information, i.e., temporal medical event graphs, which can be represented by graph neural network (GNN). In this paper, we propose a hybrid method of RNN and GNN, called RGNN, for next-period prescription prediction from two views, where RNN is used to represent patient status sequences, and GNN is used to represent temporal medical event graphs. Experiments conducted on the public MIMIC-III ICU data show that the proposed method is effective for next-period prescription prediction, and RNN and GNN are mutually complementary.","Liu, Sicen; Li, Tao; Ding, Haoyang; Tang, Buzhou; Wang, Xiaolong; Chen, Qingcai; Yan, Jun; Zhou, Yi",Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33727983/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13042-020-01155-x,163
590349,Efficient Framework Analysis for Targeted Drug Delivery Based on Internet of Bio-NanoThings,2021-04-22,"To subvert host antiviral immune responses, many viruses have evolved countermeasures to inhibit IFN signaling pathway. Porcine bocavirus (PBoV), a newly identified porcine parvovirus, has received attention because it shows clinically high co-infection prevalence with other pathogens in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PWMS) and diarrheic piglets. In this study, we screened the structural and non-structural proteins encoded by PBoV and found that the non-structural protein NP1 significantly suppressed IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity and subsequent IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. However, NP1 affected neither the activation and translocation of STAT1/STAT2, nor the formation of the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9). Detailed analysis demonstrated that PBoV NP1 blocked the ISGF3 DNA-binding activity by combining with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of IRF9. In summary, these results indicate that PBoV NP1 interferes with type I IFN signaling pathway by blocking DNA binding of ISGF3 to attenuate innate immune responses.","Zhang, Ruoxi; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Cai, Kaimei; Zhang, Huan; Xie, Lilan; Li, Yi; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215003517; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26342467/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215003517,163

591324,Schiff Bases: A Short Survey on an Evergreen Chemistry Tool,2013-10-08,"Background: This study compares knee kinematics in two groups of patients who have undergone primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using two different modern designs: medially congruent (MC) and posterior-stabilized (PS). The aim of the study is to demonstrate only minimal differences between the groups. Methods: Ten TKA patients (4 PS, 6 MC) with successful clinical outcomes were evaluated through 3D knee kinematics analysis performed using a multicamera optoelectronic system and a force platform. Extracted kinematic data included knee flexion angle at heel-strike (KFH), peak midstance knee flexion angle (MSKFA), maximum and minimum knee adduction angle (KAA), and knee rotational angle at heel-strike. Data were compared with a group of healthy controls. Results: There were no differences in preferred walking speed between MC and PS groups, but we found consistent differences in knee function. At heel-strike, the knee tended to be more flexed in the PS group compared to the MC group; the MSKFA tended to be higher in the PS group compared to the MC group. There was a significant fluctuation in KAA during the swing phase in the PS group compared to the MC group, PS patients showed a higher peak knee flexion moment compared to MC patients, and the PS group had significantly less peak internal rotation moments than the MC group. Conclusions: Modern, third-generation TKA designs failed to reproduce normal knee kinematics. MC knees tended to reproduce a more natural kinematic pattern at heel-strike and during axial rotation, while PS knees showed better kinematics during mid-flexion.","Ghirardelli, Stefano; Asay, Jessica L.; Leonardi, Erika A.; Amoroso, Tommaso; Andriacchi, Thomas P.; Indelli, Pier Francesco",J Funct Morphol Kinesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804113/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jfmk6010027,163

PBMC of DF convalescent patients were stimulated in vitro with dengue virus-derived peptides, which were prepared based on the prediction of dengue virus-specific CD4(+) T-cell epitopes by using RANKpep online software. Subsequently, the frequency of IFN-γ producing T cells and percentage of IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells were measured by using ELISPOT assay and ICS assay (intracellular cytokine straining), respectively. The positive response of PBMC by ELISPOT showed that the numbers of SFC (spots forming cells) ranged from 50 to 310 SFC/1 × 10(6) PBMC. The positive response of PBMC by ICS assay showed that the percentage of IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) T cells ranged from 0.03 to 0.27%.

592869,Achieving Mental Health Equity,2020-09-30,"Mass media reports can induce individual behaviour change during a disease outbreak, which has been found to be useful as it reduces the force of infection. We propose a compartmental model by including a new compartment of the intensity of the media reports, which extends existing models by considering a novel media function, which is dependent both on the number of infected individuals and on the intensity of mass media. The existence and stability of the equilibria are analyzed and an optimal control problem of minimizing the total number of cases and total cost is considered, using reduction or enhancement in the media reporting rate as the control. With the help of Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle, we obtain the optimal media reporting intensity. Through parameterization of the model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the 8th Hospital of Xi’an in Shaanxi Province of China, we obtain the basic reproduction number for the formulated model with two particular media functions. The optimal media reporting intensity obtained here indicates that during the early stage of an epidemic we should quickly enhance media reporting intensity, and keep it at a maximum level until it can finally weaken when epidemic cases have decreased significantly. Numerical simulations show that media impact reduces the number of cases during an epidemic, but that the number of cases is further mitigated under the optimal reporting intensity. Sensitivity analysis implies that the outbreak severity is more sensitive to the weight α(1) (weight of media effect sensitive to infected individuals) than weight α(2) (weight of media effect sensitive to media items).","Zhou, Weike; Xiao, Yanni; Heffernan, Jane Marie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30897141/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0213898,163

Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. There results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.","Riou, C.; du Bruyn, E.; Stek, C.; Daroowala, R.; Goliath, R.

594257,Seventh BMC ecology image competition: the winning images,2020-08-07,"Disease transmission is notoriously heterogeneous, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings—Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, “chopping off the tail” to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","Kain, Morgan P.; Childs, Marissa L.; Becker, Alexander D.; Mordecai, Erin A.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637966/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.20143115; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.30.20143115v1?rss=1,163

Many of those who eventually died, did so in the critical (intensive) care units of various hospitals around the world, and many secondary cases of SARS arose in healthcare workers looking after such patients in these units. Research on SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) demonstrated that this virus belongs to the same family of viruses, the Coronaviridae that causes the common cold, with some important differences. Properties of this virus have been discovered which can be used to develop important infection control policies within hospitals to limit the number of secondary cases. These properties include environmental survival, transmissibility, viral load in various organs and fluids and periods of symptomatic illness during which infectivity is greatest. Various barrier methods were used throughout the epidemic to protect healthcare workers from SARS, with varying degrees of success. Treatment of SARS patients has mainly involved steroid therapy, with or without ribavirin, but there is no consensus on the best treatment protocol, as yet.

METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19-related full-text articles published until 31 May 2020 from PubMed Central. Dataset URL links mentioned in full-text articles were extracted, and each dataset was manually reviewed to provide information on 10 variables: (1) type of the dataset, (2) geographic region where the data were collected, (3) whether the dataset was immediately downloadable, (4) format of the dataset files, (5) where the dataset was hosted, (6) whether the dataset was updated regularly, (7) the type of license used, (8) whether the metadata were explicitly provided, (9) whether there was a PubMed Central paper describing the dataset and (10) the number of times the dataset was cited by PubMed Central articles. Descriptive statistics about these seven variables were reported for all extracted datasets. RESULTS: We found that 28.5% of 12 324 COVID-19 full-text articles in PubMed Central provided at least one dataset link. In total, 128 unique dataset links were mentioned in 12 324 COVID-19 full text articles in PubMed Central. Further analysis showed that epidemiological datasets accounted for the largest portion (53.9%) in the dataset collection, and most datasets (84.4%) were available for immediate download. GitHub was the most popular repository for hosting COVID-19 datasets. CSV, XLSX and JSON were the most popular data formats.

595360,Microbiological Monitoring in Individually Ventilated Cage Systems,2004,"The combination of the two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) is used in most highly active antiretroviral therapies for treatment of HIV-1 infection, as well as in pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV acquisition. Administered as prodrugs, these drugs are taken up by HIV-infected target cells, undergo intracellular phosphorylation and compete with natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) for incorporation into nascent viral DNA during reverse transcription. Once incorporated, they halt reverse transcription. In vitro studies have proposed that TDF and FTC act synergistically within an HIV-infected cell. However, it is unclear whether, and which, direct drug–drug interactions mediate the apparent synergy. The goal of this work was to refine a mechanistic model for the molecular mechanism of action (MMOA) of nucleoside analogues in order to analyse whether putative direct interactions may account for the in vitro observed synergistic effects. Our analysis suggests that depletion of dNTP pools can explain apparent synergy between TDF and FTC in HIV-infected cells at clinically relevant concentrations. Dead-end complex (DEC) formation does not seem to significantly contribute to the synergistic effect. However, in the presence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), its role might be more relevant, as previously reported in experimental in vitro studies.","Iannuzzi, Sara; von Kleist, Max",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372560/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071354,163
596133,The intrinsic vulnerability of networks to epidemics,2018-09-10,"As an essential enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, main protease (MPro) triggers acute toxicity to its human cell host, an effect that can be alleviated by an MPro inhibitor with cellular potency. By coupling this toxicity alleviation with the expression of an MPro-eGFP fusion protein in a human cell host for straightforward characterization with fluorescent flow cytometry, we developed an effective method that allows bulk analysis of cellular potency of MPro inhibitors. In comparison to an antiviral assay in which MPro inhibitors may target host proteases or other processes in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to convene strong antiviral effects, this novel assay is more advantageous in providing precise cellular MPro inhibition information for assessment and optimization of MPro inhibitors. We used this assay to analyze 30 literature reported MPro inhibitors including MPI1-9 that were newly developed aldehyde-based reversible covalent inhibitors of MPro, GC376 and 11a that are two investigational drugs undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in United States, boceprevir, calpain inhibitor II, calpain inhibitor XII, ebselen, bepridil that is an antianginal drug with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that were previously shown to inhibit MPro. Our results showed that most inhibitors displayed cellular potency much weaker than their potency in direct inhibition of the enzyme. Many inhibitors exhibited weak or undetectable cellular potency up to 10 μM. On contrary to their strong antiviral effects, 11a, calpain inhibitor II, calpain XII, ebselen, and bepridil showed relatively weak to undetectable cellular MPro inhibition potency implicating their roles in interfering with key steps other than just the MPro catalysis in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle to convene potent antiviral effects. characterization of these molecules on their antiviral mechanisms will likely reveal novel drug targets for COVID-19. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine showed close to undetectable cellular potency to inhibit MPro. Kinetic recharacterization of these two compounds rules out their possibility as MPro inhibitors. Our results also revealed that MPI5, 6, 7, and 8 have high cellular and antiviral potency with both IC50 and EC50 values respectively below 1 μM. As the one with the highest cellular and antiviral potency among all tested compounds, MPI8 has a remarkable cellular MPro inhibition IC50 value of 31 nM that matches closely to its strong antiviral effect with an EC50 value of 30 nM. Given its strong cellular and antiviral potency, we cautiously suggest that MPI8 is ready for preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of COVID-19.","Cao, Wenyue; Cho, Chia-Chuan Dean; Geng, Zhi Zachary; Ma, Xinyu R.; Allen, Robert; Shaabani, Namir; Vatansever, Erol C.; Alugubelli, Yugendar R.; Ma, Yuying; Ellenburg, William H.; Yang, Kai S.; Qiao, Yuchen; Ji, Henry; Xu, Shiqing; Liu, Wenshe Ray",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447613,163

Lung inflammation is accompanied or led by massive accumulation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries (“margination”). We sought to identify nanostructural properties that predispose nanoparticles to accumulate in pulmonary marginated neutrophils, and therefore to target severely inflamed lungs. We designed a library of nanoparticles and conducted an in vivo screen of biodistributions in naive mice and mice treated with lipopolysaccharides. We found that supramolecular organization of protein in nanoparticles predicts uptake in inflamed lungs. Specifically, nanoparticles with agglutinated protein (NAPs) efficiently home to pulmonary neutrophils, while protein nanoparticles with symmetric structure (e.g. viral capsids) are ignored by pulmonary neutrophils. We validated this finding by engineering protein-conjugated liposomes that recapitulate NAP targeting to neutrophils in inflamed lungs. We show that NAPs can diagnose acute lung injury in SPECT imaging and that NAP-like liposomes can mitigate neutrophil extravasation and pulmonary edema arising in lung inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that ischemic ex vivo human lungs selectively take up NAPs, illustrating translational potential. This work demonstrates that structure-dependent interactions with neutrophils can dramatically alter the biodistribution of nanoparticles, and NAPs have significant potential in detecting and treating respiratory conditions arising from injury or infections.","Myerson, Jacob W.; Patel, Priyal N.; Habibi, Nahal; Walsh, Landis R.; Lee, Yi-Wei; Luther, David C.; Ferguson, Laura T.; Zaleski, Michael H.; Zamora, Marco E.; Marcos-Contreras, Oscar A.; Glassman, Patrick M.; Johnston, Ian; Hood, Elizabeth D.; Shuvaeva, Tea; Gregory, Jason V.; Kiseleva, Raisa Y.; Nong, Jia; Rubey, Kathryn M.; Greineder, Colin F.; Mitragotri, Samir; Worthen, George S.; Rotello, Vincent M.; Lahann, Joerg; Muzykantov, Vladimir R.; Brenner, Jacob S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.037564,163

We sought to determine whether CaAstV is circulating in the UK dog population, and to characterise any identified strains. Stool samples were collected from pet dogs in the UK with and without gastroenteritis, and samples were screened for CaAstV by qPCR. Four CaAstV positive samples were identified from dogs with gastroenteritis (4/67, 6.0%), whereas no samples from healthy dogs were positive (p < 0.001). Sequencing of the capsid sequences from the four CaAstV strains found significant genetic heterogeneity, with only 80% amino acid identity between strains. The full genome sequence of two UK CaAstV strains was then determined, confirming that CaAstV conforms to the classic genome organisation of other astroviruses with ORF1a and ORF1b separated by a frameshift and ORF2 encoding the capsid protein.

The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the need for respiratory support and pharmacological treatment, among others. We combined the chronic disease burden and the severity of illness at admission with predefined clinically relevant risk factors. Cox regression models were used to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We enrolled 395 adult patients, their median age was 61 years; 62.8% of patients were male and 40.1% had a Modified Charlson Comorbidity Index (MCCI) ≥5. Their median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 3; 34.9% used a high-flow nasal cannula and 17.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. The in-hospital mortality rate was 14.7%.

598545,"Annelid genomes: Enchytraeus crypticus, a soil model for the innate (and primed) immune system",2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue is a critical regulator of lipid storage and endocrine function. Impairment of the recruitment of new adipocytes in the adipose tissue is associated with ectopic fat accumulation, diabetes and insulin resistance. Torreya nucifera, an evergreen conifer that grows in warm temperate climates, has been found to exert beneficial effects against inflammation, infection and diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects at the cellular level remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate effects of Torreya nucifera seed oil (TNSO) on 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and its underlying regulatory mechanism. METHODS: To investigate the effects of TNSO on adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were induced to differentiate for 5 days in the presence of 0.75 μL/mL TNSO. Oil Red O staining and an assay for intracellular triglyceride were performed to determine the extent of lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of TNSO, adipogenic gene expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, we monitored TNSO-derived activation of PPARγ and STAT3 with 3T3-L1 reporter cell lines engineered to secrete Gaussia luciferase upon the interaction of a transcription factor to its DNA binding element. RESULTS: Oil Red O staining revealed that TNSO improved the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. The mRNA levels of adipogenic genes, including adiponectin, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4), were upregulated and intracellular triglyceride levels increased upon TNSO treatment. We also established that adipocyte differentiation was improved by TNSO-derived activation of PPARγ and STAT3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNSO improves adipocyte differentiation by regulating the activation of adipogenic transcription factors, indicating that it may serve as a potential treatment strategy for adipocyte dysfunction.

METHODS: All 111 hospitalized wheezing children (median age, 12 months) were initially participated in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel trial on the efficacy of oral prednisolone. In this 7‐yr follow‐up, risk factors for recurrent wheezing were analysed, and then, the efficacy of prednisolone was evaluated overall and in pre‐specified subgroups post‐hoc. The main outcome was time to recurrent wheezing. RESULTS: The strongest independent risk factor for recurrent wheezing was rhinovirus detection (hazard ratio 3.54; 95% confidence interval 1.51–8.30) followed by sensitization (3.47; 1.55–8.30, respectively) age <1 yr (2.45; 1.29–4.65) and eczema (2.33; 1.11–4.90). Overall, prednisolone did not prevent recurrent wheezing. In subgroup analysis, prednisolone was associated with less recurrent wheezing in children affected by rhinovirus (0.32; 0.12–0.90, adjusted to sensitization, young age, viral aetiology and parental asthma) and/or with eczema (0.27; 0.08–0.87, adjusted respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our data strengthen the role of rhinovirus‐associated wheeze as an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing and asthma in young first‐time wheezing children. Prospective randomized trials on the efficacy of corticosteroids in rhinovirus‐associated early wheezing are warranted.

We searched the databases to include randomized and observational studies evaluating the effect of Hydroxychloroquine on mortality in COVID-19 patients. The outcome was summarized as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).We used the inverse-variance method with a random effect model and assessed the heterogeneity using I(2) test. We used ROBINS-I tool to assess methodological quality of the included studies. We performed the meta-analysis using ‘Review manager software version 5.3’. We identified 6 observationalstudies satisfying the selection criteria. In all studies, Hydroxychloroquine was given as add on to the standard care and effect was compared with the standard care alone. A pooled analysis observed 251 deaths in 1331 participants of the Hydroxychloroquine arm and 363 deaths in 1577 participants of the control arm. There was no difference in odds of mortality events amongst Hydroxychloroquine and supportive care arm [1.25 (95% CI: 0.65, 2.38); I(2) = 80%]. A similar trend was observed with moderate risk of bias studies [0.95 (95% CI: 0.44, 2.06); I(2) = 85%]. The odds of mortality were significantly higher in patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin than supportive care alone [2.34 (95% CI: 1.63, 3.34); I(2) = 0%]. A pooled analysis of recently published studies suggests no additional benefit for reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients when Hydroxychloroquine is given as add-on to the standard care.

601123,Review of the use of nasal and oral antiseptics during a global pandemic,2021-01-19,"Efforts to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic include the screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be repurposed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 replicates and propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) often show decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits low viability in human cells in culture. Here, serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (original-SARS2) in the human hepatoma cell clone Huh7.5 led to the selection of a variant (adapted-SARS2) with significantly improved infectivity in human liver (Huh7 and Huh7.5) and lung cancer (unmodified Calu-1 and A549) cells. The adapted virus exhibited mutations in the spike protein, including a 9-amino-acid deletion and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). E484D also emerged in Vero E6-cultured viruses that became viable in A549 cells. Original and adapted viruses were susceptible to scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) receptor blocking, and adapted-SARS2 exhibited significantly less dependence on ACE2. Both variants were similarly neutralized by COVID-19 convalescent-phase plasma, but adapted-SARS2 exhibited increased susceptibility to exogenous type I interferon. Remdesivir inhibited original- and adapted-SARS2 similarly, demonstrating the utility of the system for the screening of NUCs. Among the tested NUCs, only remdesivir, molnupiravir, and, to a limited extent, galidesivir showed antiviral effects across human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity. Analogously to the emergence of spike mutations in vivo, the spike protein is under intense adaptive selection pressure in cell culture. Our results indicate that the emergence of spike mutations will most likely not affect the activity of remdesivir.","Ramirez, Santseharay; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Galli, Andrea; Underwood, Alexander; Pham, Long V.; Ryberg, Line A.; Feng, Shan; Pedersen, Martin S.; Mikkelsen, Lotte S.; Belouzard, Sandrine; Dubuisson, Jean; Sølund, Christina; Weis, Nina; Gottwein, Judith M.; Fahnøe, Ulrik; Bukh, Jens",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903110/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00097-21,163

Our goal was to identify clinical characteristics outside of laboratory or radiologic data associated with intubation or death within 7 days of admission. METHODS: The first 436 patients admitted to the University of Colorado Hospital (Denver metropolitan area) with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Demographics, comorbidities, and select medications were collected by chart abstraction. Missing height for calculating body mass index (BMI) was imputed using the median height for patients’ sex and race/ethnicity. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression and a minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularized logistic regression explored prediction. RESULTS: Participants had a mean [standard deviation (SD)] age 55 (17), BMI 30.9 (8.2), 55% were male and 80% were ethnic/racial minorities. Increasing age [aOR: 1.24 (1.07, 1.45) per 10 years], higher BMI (aOR 1.03 (1.00, 1.06), and poorly controlled diabetes [hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ⩾ 8] (aOR 2.26 (1.24, 4.12) were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with greater odds of intubation or death. Female sex [aOR: 0.63, 95% CI (0.40, 0.98); p value = 0.043] was associated with lesser odds of intubation or death. The odds of death and/or intubation increased 19% for every 1 unit increase in HbA1c value [OR: 1.19 (1.01, 1.43); p = 0.04]. Our final MCP model included indicators of A1C ⩾ 8, age > 65, sex, and minority status, but predicted intubation/death only slightly better than random chance [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.61 (0.56, 0.67)]. CONCLUSION: In a hospitalized patient cohort with COVID-19, worsening control of diabetes as evidenced by higher HbA1c was associated with increased risk of intubation or death within 7 days of admission. These results complement and help clarify previous associations found between diabetes and acute disease in COVID-19. Importantly, our analysis is missing some known predictors of severity in COVID-19.

602027,New Interferons,2016-05-09,"Influenza is an acute respiratory disease and a major health problem worldwide. Since mucosal immunity plays a critical role in protection against influenza virus infection, mucosal immunization is considered a promising vaccination route. However, except for live-attenuated vaccines, there are no effective killed or recombinant mucosal influenza vaccines to date. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nano-sized vesicles produced by gram-negative bacteria, and contain various bacterial components capable of stimulating the immune system of the host. We generated an OMV with low endotoxicity (fmOMV) by modifying the structure of the lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide and investigated its effect as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant in an influenza vaccine model. In this model, fmOMV exhibited reduced toll-like receptor 4-stimulating activity and attenuated endotoxicity compared to that of native OMV. Intranasal injection of the vaccine antigen with fmOMV significantly increased systemic antibody and T cell responses, mucosal IgA levels, and the frequency of lung-resident influenza-specific T cells. In addition, the number of antigen-bearing CD103(+) dendritic cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes was significantly increased after fmOMV co-administration. Notably, the mice co-immunized with fmOMV showed a significantly higher protection rate against challenge with a lethal dose of homologous or heterologous influenza viruses without adverse effects. These results show the potential of fmOMV as an effective mucosal adjuvant for intranasal vaccines.","Lee, Tae-Young; Kim, Chang-Ung; Bae, Eun-Hye; Seo, Sang-Hwan; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Yoon, Sun-Woo; Chang, Kyu-Tae; Kim, Young Sang; Kim, Sang-Hyun; Kim, Doo-Jin",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28024958/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16312324; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16312324; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.12.025,163

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cornea donors dying from causes other than SARS-CoV-2 between August 2020 and December 2020 was performed. Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of the deceased for RT-PCR testing from NP swabs. Rapid antigen testing from all the deceased was performed before in situ cornea excision. In addition, NP samples in viral transport media for RT-PCR were also collected for SARS-CoV-2 analysis. Corneas were released from the eye bank only after a negative RT-PCR report. RESULT: One hundred eighteen corneas from 59 donors were obtained by the eye bank. Eleven donors (18.64%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR testing. Six of these 11 donors had a Ct value of E gene less than 25. CONCLUSIONS: NP samples of cornea donors dying due to causes other than coronavirus disease-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR.

The binding activity of IBV was not sufficient to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. However, it acquired hemagglutinating activity after treatment with neuraminidase to remove α2,3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid from the surface of the virion. Pretreatment of erythrocytes with neuraminidase rendered the cells resistant to agglutination by IBV. Susceptibility to agglutination was restored by resialylation of asialo-erythrocytes to contain α2,3-linked sialic acid. These results indicate that IBV attaches to receptors on erythrocytes, the crucial determinant of which is sialic acid α2,3-linked to galactose. In contrast to other enveloped viruses with such a binding specificity (influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses) IBV lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme.","Schultze, Beate; Cavanagh, David; Herrler, Georg",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229290608R; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229290608R; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1322604/,163

We aimed to study the burden, severity and outcomes of NIRV infections in this population. METHODS: We analyzed pooled patient data from 2 hospital-based respiratory virus surveillance cohorts in 2 regions of Canada during 3 consecutive seasons (2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18; n = 2119). We included patients aged ≥ 18 years who developed influenza-like illness or pneumonia and were hospitalized for management. We included patients confirmed positive for ≥ 1 virus by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, influenza viruses). We compared patient characteristics, clinical severity conventional outcomes (e.g., hospital length-of stay, 30-day mortality) and ordinal outcomes (5 levels: discharged, receiving convalescent care, acute ward or intensive care unit [ICU] care and death) for patients with NIRV infections and those with influenza. RESULTS: Among 2119 adults who were admitted to hospital, 1156 patients (54.6%) had NIRV infections (hRV 14.9%, RSV 12.9%, hCoV 8.2%) and 963 patients (45.4%) had influenza (n = 963). Patients with NIRVs were younger (mean 66.4 [standard deviation 20.4] yr), and more commonly had immunocompromising conditions (30.3%) and delay in diagnosis (median 4.0 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.0–7.0] days). Overall, 14.6% (12.4%–19.5%) of NIRV infections were acquired in hospital. Admission to ICU (18.2%, median 6.0 [IQR 3.0–13.0] d), hospital length-of-stay (median 5.0 [IQR 2.0–10.0] d) and 30-day mortality (8.4%; RSV 9.5%, hRV 6.6%, hCoV 9.2%) and the ordinal outcomes were similar for patients with NIRV infection and those with influenza. Age > 60 years, immunocompromised state and hospital-acquired viral infection were associated with worse outcomes. The estimated median cost per acute care admission was $6000 (IQR $2000–$16 000). INTERPRETATION: The burden of NIRV infection is substantial in adults admitted to hospital and associated outcomes may be as severe as for influenza, suggesting a need to prioritize therapeutics and vaccines for at-risk people.","Lee, Nelson; Smith, Stephanie; Zelyas, Nathan; Klarenbach, Scott; Zapernick, Lori; Bekking, Christian; So, Helen; Yip, Lily; Tipples, Graham; Taylor, Geoff; Mubareka, Samira",CMAJ,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.201748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782171/,163

608340,Chapter 16 Carbohydrate Microarrays as Essential Tools of Postgenomic Medicine,2008-12-31,"Background: Health extension workers (HEWs) have substantial inputs to reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. However, their perceptions and experiences were not well understood. Therefore, this study aimed to explore their perceptions and experiences on facilitators and barriers to maternal and newborn health services in Ethiopia. Methods: A descriptive qualitative study was conducted from 8–28 April 2021 in Oromia, Amhara and Southern Nation, Nationality, and People’s Regional State of Ethiopia. Focused group discussions were made with purposively selected 60 HEWs. The data were transcribed verbatim and translated into English. An inductive thematic analysis was carried out using Atlas ti.7.1. The findings were presented in major themes, categories, and sub-categories with supporting quote(s). Results: The findings were categorized into two major themes (i.e., facilitators and barriers) and seven sub-themes. Community-related facilitators encompass awareness and behavior at the individual, family, and community. Significant others such as traditional birth attendants, religious leaders, women developmental armies, and kebele chairman substantially contributed to service utilization. Availability/access to infrastructures such as telephone, transportation services, and solar energy systems facilitated the service utilization. Furthermore, health facility-related facilitators include the availability of HEWs; free services; supervision and monitoring; maternity waiting rooms; and access to ambulance services. Maternal and newborn health services were affected by community-related barriers (i.e., distance, topography, religious and socio-cultural beliefs/practices, unpleasant rumors, etc.,), health facility-related barriers (i.e., health worker’s behaviors; lack of logistics; lack of adequate ambulance service, and placement and quality of health post), and infrastructure (i.e., lack or poor quality of road and lack of water). Conclusions: The HEWs perceived and experienced a wide range of facilitators and barriers that affected maternal and newborn health services. The study findings warrant that there was a disparity in behavioral factors (awareness, beliefs, and behaviors) among community members, including pregnant women. This underscores the need to design health education programs and conduct social and behavioral change communication interventions to address individuals, families, and the broader community to enhance maternal and newborn health service utilization. On the other hand, the health sector should put into practice the available strategies, and health workers provide services with empathy, compassion, and respect.","Higi, Alemayehu Hunduma; Debelew, Gurmesa Tura; Dadi, Lelisa Sena",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639767/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910467,163

Attempting to contain infection, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January and implemented a national emergency response. Here we evaluate the spread and control of the epidemic based on a unique synthesis of data including case reports, human movement and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29), delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% (11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases across China.

METHODS: We included fifty-eight patients who have recovered from COVID-19 (group 1) and fifty healthy control subjects (group 2) in this prospective study. Best corrected visual acuity, anterior segment and posterior segment examinations of all subjects were performed. CT scan and measurements were taken with the EDI mode of the Spectral Domain OCT device. RESULTS: Of the 108 subjects included in this study, 57 were female and 51 were male. The mean age was similar in both groups (36.10 ± 7.12 and 35.58 ± 7.29, respectively, p = 0.276). Group 1 had the following characteristics: the mean time since diagnosis was 53.18 ± 2.84; it had been 38.48 ± 4.07 days since the PCR test was negative; and all subjects were outpatients. It was detected that the CT of the patients in group 1 decreased in all areas compared to group 2, and this decrease was significant in subfoveal, temporal and inferior areas (257.48 ± 32.79, 273.62 ± 45.04, p = 0.04; 232.96 ± 41.79, 252.76 ± 46.09, p = 0.02, and 245.22 ± 44.58, 271.54 ± 55.07, p = 0.01, respectively). In the retinal nerve fiber layer analysis for group 1, thickening was detected in all areas, although it was not statistically significant, except in the temporal area where it was (superotemporal, superonasal, nasal, inferonasal, inferotemporal, temporal, and global [p = 0 .08, p = 0.45, p = 0.73, p = 0.64, p = 0.74, p = 0.02, and p = 0.10, respectively]). CONCLUSION: For individuals who had recovered from COVID-19, it was found that CT decreased in all areas in these patients.

While the industry has self-regulating bodies with established Codes of Practice, these mainly focus on promotional messaging and commercial activities. In the absence of similar frameworks for MI, such services struggle to understand how to meet HCP digital expectations, often in fear of breaching the promotional codes. This is limiting access to the wealth of non-promotional patient-focussed information held within the industry. Meanwhile, a large volume of unregulated, low-quality information can be readily found on the internet. To understand the current status, the Medical Information Leaders in Europe (MILE) industry association performed a benchmarking survey which explored the online MI service provision of 13 mid-large pharmaceutical companies across Europe. This highlighted a great diversity in approach in terms of geographical coverage and content. Visibility and access for HCPs is complex, compromising online engagement and website utilisation. This MILE position paper highlights the critical need to establish a clear governance model, which empowers pharmaceutical company MI functions to provide unbranded, non-promotional, medicinal product information sources to support HCP online information needs.

Recent breakthroughs in 3-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures have led to new physiological in vitro models that better mimic the lung than conventional 2D cultures. Lung organoids simulate multiple aspects of the real organ, making them promising and useful models for studying organ development, function and disease (infection, cancer, genetic disease). Due to their dynamics in culture, they can serve as a sustainable source of functional cells (biobanking) and be manipulated genetically. Given the differences between species regarding developmental kinetics, the maturation of the lung at birth, the distribution of the different cell populations along the respiratory tract and species barriers for infectious diseases, there is a need for species-specific lung models capable of mimicking mammal lungs as they are of great interest for animal health and production, following the One Health approach.

The burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic-related disruptions in care have disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged populations, raising the importance of understanding disparities in treatment initiation for kidney failure during the pandemic. Objective: To examine changes in the number and demographic characteristics of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure following the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity, county-level COVID-19 mortality rate, and neighborhood-level social disadvantage. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional time-trend study used data from US patients who developed kidney failure between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. Data were analyzed between January and July 2021. Exposures: COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at treatment initiation. Results: The study population included 127â¯149 patients with incident kidney failure between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [15.3] years; 53â¯021 [41.7%] female, 32â¯932 [25.9%] non-Hispanic Black, and 19â¯835 [15.6%] Hispanic/Latino patients). Compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, in the first 4 months of the pandemic (ie, March 1 through June 30, 2020), there were significant decreases in the proportion of patients with incident kidney failure receiving preemptive transplantation (1805 [2.1%] pre-COVID-19 vs 551 [1.4%] during COVID-19; P < .001) and initiating hemodialysis treatment with an arteriovenous fistula (2430 [15.8%] pre-COVID-19 vs 914 [13.4%] during COVID-19; P < .001). The mean (SD) eGFR at initiation declined from 9.6 (5.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 to 9.5 (4.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 during the pandemic (P < .001). In stratified analyses by race/ethnicity, these declines were exclusively observed among non-Hispanic Black patients (mean [SD] eGFR: 8.4 [4.6] mL/min/1.73 m2 pre-COVID-19 vs 8.1 [4.5] mL/min/1.73 m2 during COVID-19; P < .001). There were significant declines in eGFR at initiation for patients residing in counties in the highest quintile of COVID-19 mortality rates (9.5 [5.0] mL/min/1.73 m2 pre-COVID-19 vs 9.2 [5.0] mL/min/1.73 m2 during COVID-19; P < .001), but not for patients residing in other counties. The number of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure was approximately 30% lower than projected in April 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US adults, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a substantially lower number of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure and treatment initiation at lower levels of kidney function during the first 4 months, particularly for Black patients and people living in counties with high COVID-19 mortality rates.","Nguyen, Kevin H; Thorsness, Rebecca; Hayes, Susan; Kim, Daeho; Mehrotra, Rajnish; Swaminathan, Shailender; Baranwal, Navya; Lee, Yoojin; Rivera-Hernandez, Maricruz; Trivedi, Amal N",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618039/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.27369,163

Our study aims to examine the incidence and risk factors of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of adult COVID-19 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia admitted to a regional tertiary care hospital. SPI was defined as microorganisms identified on the respiratory tract with or without concurrent positive blood culture results for the same microorganism obtained at least 48 hours after admission. RESULTS: Thirteen out of 244 (5%) had developed SPI during hospitalization. The median of the nadir lymphocyte count during hospitalization was significantly lower in patients with SPI as compared to those without SPI [0.4 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.5) versus 0.6 K/uL (IQR 0.3-0.9)]. Patients with lower nadir lymphocyte had an increased risk of developing SPI with odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.47, p=0.04) per 0.1 K/uL decrement in nadir lymphocyte. The baseline median inflammatory markers of CRP [166.4 mg/L vs. 100.0 mg/L, p=0.01] and D-dimer (18.5 mg/L vs. 1.4 mg/L, p<0.01), and peak procalcitonin (1.4 ng/mL vs. 0.3 ng/mL, p<0.01) and CRP (273.5 mg/L vs. 153.7 mg/L, p<0.01) during hospitalization were significantly higher in SPI group. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SPI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 5%. Lower nadir median lymphocyte count during hospitalization was associated with an increased OR of developing SPI.

Assuming limited isolation control and capacity constraints on the number of infections, an optimal quarantine control strategy that balances between the total number of infections and the overall isolation effort is derived from necessary optimality conditions. The specific optimal policy is then obtained by optimizing the switching times of this generalized strategy. In the case of a newly emerged disease, these results can be used in a data-driven receding horizon manner to improve actions as more data becomes available. The proposed approach is applied to publicly available data from the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. In particular, for minimizing the total number of infections or the number of isolated individuals, the simulations indicate that a sufficiently delayed and controlled release of the lock-down are optimal for overcoming the outbreak. The approach can support public health authorities to plan quarantine control policies.","Nenchev, Vladislav",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834584/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096007792030535X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096007792030535X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110139,163

Immune responses can be evoked through diverse inducible pathways. However, various constitutive mechanisms are also required for immunocompetence. The inducible responses of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive immune system are highly effective, but they also have the potential to cause extensive immunopathology and tissue damage, as seen in many infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. By contrast, constitutive innate immune mechanisms, including restriction factors, basal autophagy and proteasomal degradation, tend to limit immune responses, with loss-of-function mutations in these pathways leading to inflammation. Although they function through a broad and heterogeneous set of mechanisms, the constitutive immune responses all function as early barriers to infection and aim to minimize any disruption of homeostasis. Supported by recent human and mouse data, in this Review we compare and contrast the inducible and constitutive mechanisms of immunosurveillance.","Paludan, Søren R.; Pradeu, Thomas; Masters, Seth L.; Mogensen, Trine H.",Nat Rev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32782357/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0391-5,163

Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases. SUMMARY: We found 63 patients (≤18 years, n = 36; >18 years, n = 27; 54 males and 9 females) affected by a mucosal respiratory syndrome. Fifty-three cases were temporally associated with a M. pneumoniae and 5 with a C. pneumoniae infection.

This study evaluated the sensitivity of five rapid antibody assays and explored factors influencing their sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. METHODS Finger-prick blood samples from 102 participants, within two to six weeks of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, were tested for IgG and IgM on five rapid serological assays. The assay sensitivities were compared, and patient factors evaluated in order to investigate potential associations with assay sensitivity. RESULTS Sensitivity ranged from 36% to 69% for IgG and 13% to 67% for IgM. Age was the only factor significantly influencing the likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM response. Individuals aged 40 years and older had an increased likelihood of a detectable IgG or IgM antibody response by rapid antibody assay.

Combining these modules, a SEI(3)RSD model will be developed, which can take into account a possible passive immunisation by vaccination as well as different durations of latent and incubation periods. Besides, infectious persons with and without symptoms can be distinguished. Due to the current world‐wide SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic (COVID‐19 pandemic) models for description of the spread of infectious diseases and their application for forecasts have become into the focus of the scientific community as well as of broad public more than usual. Currently, many papers and studies have appeared and appear dealing with the virus SARS‐CoV‐2 and the COVID‐19 disease caused by it. This occurs under medical, virological, economic, sociological and further aspects as well as under mathematical points of view. Concerning the last‐mentioned point, the main focus lies on the application of existing models and their adaptation to data about the course of infection available at the current time. Clearly, the aim is to predict the possible further development, for instance in Germany. It is of particular interest to investigate how will be the influence of political and administrative measures like contact restrictions, closing or rather re‐opening of schools, restaurants, hotels etc. on the course of infection. The steps considered here for building up suitable models are well‐known for long time. However, understandably they will not be dealt with in an extended way in current application‐oriented works. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to present some existing steps of modelling without any pretension of completeness. Thus, on the one hand we give assistance and, on the other hand, we develop a model capable to take already known properties of COVID‐19 as well as a later possible passive immunisation by vaccination and a possible loss of immunity of recovered persons into account.","Wolff, Michael",Z Angew Math Mech,https://doi.org/10.1002/zamm.202000230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173245/,163
617690,Poster session,2021,"Abstract Introduction Rapid worldwide spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic. Objective This review article provides emergency physicians with an overview of the most current understanding of COVID-19 and recommendations on the evaluation and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Discussion Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing COVID-19, is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through close contact (approximately 6 ft) by respiratory droplets. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine. Conclusion This narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.","Chavez, Summer; Long, Brit; Koyfman, Alex; Liang, Stephen Y.",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.03.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265065/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720301789; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720301789,163
617983,Equine Asthma: Current Understanding and Future Directions,2020-07-30,"Feces from 142 animals were collected on 15 farms in the region of Brittany, France. Each sample was directly collected from the rectum of the animal and identified with the ear tag number. Animals were sampled three times, at 5, 15 and 22 weeks of age. After DNA extraction from stool samples, nested PCR was performed to amplify partial 18S-rDNA and 60 kDa glycoprotein genes of Cryptosporidium. The parasite was detected on all farms. One hundred out of 142 calves (70.4%) were found to be parasitized by Cryptosporidium. Amplified fragments were sequenced for Cryptosporidium species identification and revealed the presence of C. parvum (43.8%), C. ryanae (28.5%), and C. bovis (27%). One animal was infected with Cryptosporidium ubiquitum. The prevalence of these species was related to the age of the animal. C. parvum caused 86.7% of Cryptosporidium infections in 5-week-old calves but only 1.7% in 15-week-old animals. The analysis of the results showed that animals could be infected successively by C. parvum, C. ryanae, and C. bovis for the study period. C. parvum gp60 genotyping identifies 6 IIa subtypes of which 74.5% were represented by IIaA15G2R1. This work confirms previous studies in other countries showing that zoonotic C. parvum is the dominant species seen in young calves.","Follet, Jérôme; Guyot, Karine; Leruste, Hélène; Follet-Dumoulin, Anne; Hammouma-Ghelboun, Ourida; Certad, Gabriela; Dei-Cas, Eduardo; Halama, Patrice",Vet Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-42-116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22136667/,163

618344,Preventing airborne infection,2020-05-23,"Background and Objectives: In the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the management of immunosuppressive (IS) therapy in kidney transplant (KT) recipients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) requires attention. It is not yet understood whether IS therapy may protect from the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or a temporary adjustment/withdrawal of IS therapy to restore the immune system may be necessary. We performed a systematic literature review to investigate the current management of IS therapy in KT recipients with COVID-1. Materials and Methods: Out of 71 articles published from 1 February 2020 until 30 October 2020, 554 KT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Results: Modifications of IS therapy were based on the clinical conditions. For asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, a “wait and see approach” was mostly used; a suspension of antimetabolites drugs (347/461, 75.27%) or mTOR inhibitors (38/48, 79.2%) was adopted in the majority of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infections. For CNIs, the most frequent attitude was their maintenance (243/502, 48.4%) or dose-reduction (99/502, 19.72%) in patients asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms, while drug withdrawal was the preferred choice in severely symptomatic patients (160/450, 31.87%). A discontinuation of all IS drugs was used only in severely symptomatic COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Renal function remained stable in 422(76.17%) recipients, while 49(8.84%) patients experienced graft loss. Eight (1.44%) patients experienced a worsening of renal function. The overall mortality was 21.84%, and 53(9.56%) patients died with functioning grafts. Conclusion: A tailored approach to the patient has been the preferred strategy for the management of IS therapy in KT recipients, taking into account the clinical conditions of patients and the potential interactions between IS and antiviral drugs, in the attempt to balance the risks of COVID-19-related complications and those due to rejection or graft loss.","Angelico, Roberta; Blasi, Francesca; Manzia, Tommaso Maria; Toti, Luca; Tisone, Giuseppe; Cacciola, Roberto",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946462/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57050435,163

We investigated psychological reactions and insomnia during the COVID-19 outbreak in adults with mental health disorders (MDs). METHODS: A self-reported psychological and sleep online survey was conducted in China between February 5th to 19th, 2020. A total of 244 adults with MDs and 1116 controls matched for age, gender and sites were included. Worsened symptoms of anxiety, depressive and insomnia were defined when severity levels shifted to a more severe category compared to pre-COVID-19. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found significantly increased prevalence of anxiety (MDs: 54.9% vs. 49.6%, controls: 25.5% vs. 14.3%), depression (MDs: 63.9% vs. 61.5%, controls: 29.9% vs. 21.2%) and insomnia (MDs: 66.0% vs. 57.8%, controls: 31.5% vs. 24.8%) compared to pre-COVID-19 period (all P-value < 0.001). Furthermore, adults with MDs had higher odds for developing COVID-19-related stress (OR = 3.41, 95% CI 2.49 ~ 4.67), worsened anxiety (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.38 ~ 2.76), depression (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 ~ 2.93) and insomnia (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.53 ~ 3.21) during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to controls. Moreover, higher COVID-19-related stress and lower levels of pre-COVID-19 anxiety, depressive and insomnia symptoms were predictors for worsened anxiety, depression and insomnia in adults with MDs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that adverse psychological reactions and insomnia are more pronounced in adults with mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak, thus more attention need to be provided.","Sun, Qimeng; Qin, Qingsong; Basta, Maria; Chen, Baixin; Li, Yun",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419411/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03036-7,163
619388,Human genetic variants identified that affect COVID susceptibility and severity,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought rapid changes to travel, learning environments, work conditions, and social support, which caused stress for many University students. Research with young people has revealed music listening to be among their most effective strategies for coping with stress. As such, this survey of 402 first-year Australian University students (73.9% female, M(age) = 19.6; 75% domestic and 25% international) examined the effectiveness of music listening during COVID-19 compared with other stress management strategies, whether music listening for stress management was related to well-being, and whether differences emerged between domestic and international students. We also asked participants to nominate a song that helped them to cope with COVID-19 stress and analyzed its features. Music listening was among the most effective stress coping strategies, and was as effective as exercise, sleep, and changing location. Effectiveness of music listening as a coping strategy was related to better well-being but not to level of COVID-19 related stress. Although international students experienced higher levels of COVID-19 stress than domestic students, well-being was comparable in the two cohorts. Nominated songs tended to be negative in valence and moderate in energy. No correlations were found between any self-report measure and the valence and energy of nominated coping songs. These findings suggest that although domestic and international students experienced different levels of stress resulting from COVID-19, music listening remained an effective strategy for both cohorts, regardless of the type of music they used for coping.","Vidas, Dianna; Larwood, Joel L.; Nelson, Nicole L.; Dingle, Genevieve A.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868120/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647065,163

Paraguay announced the Estado de Emergencia Sanitaria (Presidential Decree No. 3456) on March 16, 2020, which was followed by the imposition of a 24-h restriction on movement order on March 21. Self-quarantine at home may have been the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious diseases; however, with the global pandemic becoming more prolonged and the consequent lengthening of the 24-h self-quarantine period, it is highly probable that both physical and psychological problems will arise. METHODS: In this study, a web-based cross-sectional method was used to analyze the factors influencing COVID-19-induced depressive feelings in Paraguayan public officials. RESULTS: Public officials reported a high level of depressive symptoms with a high level of apprehension in early stage of COVID-19. In addition, this study identified that when the self-quarantine period increased, levels of depressive feelings also increased. Since self-quarantine is characterized by the requirement that individuals endure an undetermined period within a confined area, it may have caused stress and anxiety, as well as the consequent experience of depressive feelings. CONCLUSIONS: Paraguayan government should develop a program for the delivery of mental health care and services to public officials in COVID-19 Pandemic period. Moreover, a program is required for people facing deteriorating mental health due to social isolation and loneliness caused by social distancing during the prolonged period of self-quarantine. Finally, mental health care programs should be organized in a community-focused way by utilizing online systems to enhance the effectiveness of mental health recovery.","Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Ji Ho; Kang, Yanghee; Lee, Sun Ha; Shin, Hyein; Rönnebeck, Nadia; Rönnebeck, Renato; Nam, Eun Woo",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34635086/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11860-z,163
621174,A new method to cluster DNA sequences using Fourier power spectrum,2015-05-07,"How does one interpret the observed increase or decrease in COVID19 case rates? Did the compliance to the non pharmaceutical interventions, seasonal changes in the temperature influence the transmission rates or are they purely an artefact of the number of tests? To answer these questions, we estimate the effect sizes from these different factors on the reproduction ratios (Rt) from the different states of the USA during March 9 to August 9. Ideally Rt should be less than 1 to keep the pandemic under control and our model predicts many of these factors contributed significantly to the Rt: Post-lockdown opening of the restaurants and nightclubs contributed 0.04 (CI 0.04-0.04) and 0.11 (CI. 0.11-0.11) to Rt. The mask mandates helped reduce Rt by 0.28 (CI 0.28-0.29)), whereas the testing rates which may have influenced the number of infections observed, did not influence Rt beyond 10,000 daily tests 0.07 (CI -0.57-0.42). In our attempt to understand the role of temperature, the contribution to the Rt was found to increase on both sides of 55 F, which we infer as a reflection of the climatisation needs. A further analysis using the cooling and heating needs showed contributions of 0.24 (CI 0.18-0.31) and 0.31 (CI 0.28-0.33) respectively. The work thus illustrates a data-driven approach for estimating the effect-sizes on the graded policies, and the possibility of prioritising the interventions, if necessary by weighing the economic costs and ease of acceptance with them.","Sruthi, C.

To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods. Methods: We compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period. Results: Between March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes. Conclusion: Even though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+.

Although most patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, recover within a few weeks, some experience post-COVID-19 conditions. These range from new or returning to ongoing health problems that can continue beyond 4 weeks. Persons who were asymptomatic at the time of infection can also experience post-COVID-19 conditions.

ABSTRACT: This study examines the Cav1 isoforms expressed in mouse chromaffin cells and compares their biophysical properties and roles played in cell excitability and exocytosis. Using immunocytochemical and electrophysiological techniques in mice lacking the Cav1.3α1 subunit (Cav1.3(−/−)) or the high sensitivity of Cav1.2α1 subunits to dihydropyridines, Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels were identified as the only Cav1 channel subtypes expressed in mouse chromaffin cells. Cav1.3 channels were activated at more negative membrane potentials and inactivated more slowly than Cav1.2 channels. Cav1 channels, mainly Cav1.2, control cell excitability by functional coupling to BK channels, revealed by nifedipine blockade of BK channels in wild type (WT) and Cav1.3(−/−) cells (53% and 35%, respectively), and by the identical change in the shape of the spontaneous action potentials elicited by the dihydropyridine in both strains of mice. Cav1.2 channels also play a major role in spontaneous action potential firing, supported by the following evidence: (i) a similar percentage of WT and Cav1.3(−/−) cells fired spontaneous action potentials; (ii) firing frequency did not vary between WT and Cav1.3(−/−) cells; (iii) mostly Cav1.2 channels contributed to the inward current preceding the action potential threshold; and (iv) in the presence of tetrodotoxin, WT or Cav1.3(−/−) cells exhibited spontaneous oscillatory activity, which was fully abolished by nifedipine perfusion.

626972,The unequal impact of parenthood in academia,2021-02-24,"OBJECTIVE: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health problem worldwide. The surveillance of seropositive individuals serves as an indicator to the extent of infection spread and provides an estimation of herd immunity status among population. Reports from different countries investigated this issue among healthcare workers (HCWs) who are “at risk” and “sources of risk” for COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs in one of the COVID-19 referral centers in Makkah, Saudi Arabia using three different serological methods. METHODS: In-house developed enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), commercially available electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), and microneutralization (MN) assay were utilized to determine the seroprevalence rate among the study population. 204 HCWs participated in the study. Both physicians and nurses working in the COVID-19 and non COVID-19 areas were included. Twelve out of 204 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with variable disease severity. Samples from recovered HCWs were collected four weeks post diagnosis. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence rate was 6.3% (13 out of 204) using the in-house ELISA and MN assay and it was 5.8% (12 out of 204) using the commercial ECLIA. Among HCWs undiagnosed with COVID-19, the seroprevalence was 2% (4 out 192). Notably, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in 3 (25%) out 12 confirmed cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our study, similar to the recent national multi-center study, showed a low seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 antibodies among HCWs. Concordance of results between the commercial electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA), in-house ELISA and MN assay was observed. The in-house ELISA is a promising tool for the serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, seroprevalence studies may underestimate the extent of COVID-19 infection as some cases with mild disease did not have detectable antibody responses.","Ahmed, Waleed A; Dada, Ashraf; Alshukairi, Abeer N; Sohrab, Sayed S.; Faizo, Arwa A.; Tolah, Ahmed M.; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Bajrai, Leena H; Moalim, Hanan M; Aly, Mohamed H.; Aboelazm, Ahmed F.; Hamzi, Mohammed; Saeedi, Mohammed; Alandijany, Thamir A.; Azhar, Esam I.",J King Saud Univ Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1018364721000276; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018364721000276?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613011/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101366,163

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS–CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS–CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS–CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i + 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3′–5′ exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.","Gordon, Calvin J.; Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Porter, Danielle P.; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925817485747; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925817485747; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ac120.013056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094225/,163

I then modify a standard SEIR model to model current growth patterns and detection rates in South Korea and New York state. Although reducing transmission rates have the largest impact, increasing TP rates by ~10% in New York can have an impact equal to adding tens of thousands of new tests per day. Increasing both TP rates and tests per day together can have significant impacts and likely be more easily sustained than social distancing restrictions.

629412,Patent pools and clearinghouses in the life sciences,2011-07-04,"Background: Synthetic probes that mimic natural substrates can enable the detection of enzymatic activities in a cellular environment. One area where such activity-based probes have been applied is the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, which is emerging as an important therapeutic target. A family of reagents has been developed that specifically label deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) and facilitate characterization of their inhibitors. Scope of review: Here we focus on the application of probes for intracellular DUBs, a group of specific proteases involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system. In particular, the functional characterization of the active subunits of this family of proteases that specifically recognize ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins will be discussed. In addition we present the potential and design of activity-based probes targeting kinases and phosphatases to study phosphorylation. Major conclusions: Synthetic molecular probes have increased our understanding of the functional role of DUBs in living cells. In addition to the detection of enzymatic activities of known members, activity-based probes have contributed to a number of functional assignments of previously uncharacterized enzymes. This method enables cellular validation of the specificity of small molecule DUB inhibitors. General significance: Molecular probes combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and cellular assays represent a powerful approach for discovery and functional validation, a concept that can be expanded to other enzyme classes. This addresses a need for more informative cell-based assays that are required to accelerate the drug development process.

Overall, 529 of 530 eligible patients participated; these patients all attended a 1st follow-up appointment ~6 months post-conization, at which time high-risk human-papillomavirus (HPV) testing, liquid-based cytology and colposcopy were performed. Full data on margin excision status, other aspects of initial treatment and comorbidity were obtained. At least one subsequent follow-up was attended by 88% of patients. A total of 22 recurrent cases were detected during follow-up. Detected recurrence was the outcome of focus for multiple logistic regression analysis, with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed. Four significant independent risk factors were identified: Age 45 years or above (OR=3.5, 95% CI=1.3–9.9), one or both unclear or uncertain margins (OR=5.3, 95% CI=2.0–14.2), positive HPV at 1st follow-up (OR=5.8, 95% CI=2.0–16.8), and abnormal cytology at 1st follow-up (OR=3.9, 95% CI=1.4–11.0). Bivariate analysis revealed that persistent HPV positivity was associated with recurrence (P<0.01). These findings indicated that incomplete excision of the CIN lesion may warrant more intensive subsequent screening, regardless of early post-conization HPV findings. Although early post-conization positive HPV was a powerful, independent predictor of recurrent high-grade CIN, over one-third of the patients with detected recurrence had a negative early post-conization HPV finding. These patients returned for routine screening, at which time, in most cases, HPV status was positive, thus indicating the need for repeated HPV evaluation. Especially during the on-going pandemic, home vaginal self-sampling is recommended. Particular attention is required for women aged ≥45 years. In addition, although not statistically significant, relevant comorbidities, especially autoimmune conditions, warrant consideration in clinical decision-making. Women who have been treated for high-grade CIN are at risk for recurrent disease and progression to cervical cancer; therefore, they require careful, individualized follow-up to avoid these adverse consequences.","Andersson, Sonia; Megyessi, David; Belkić, Karen; Alder, Susanna; Östensson, Ellinor; Mints, Miriam",Oncol Lett,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2021.12945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434283/,163

Comparing the effect of inactivation methods on influenza virions to optimize vaccine production,2019-03-14,"Coronaviruses COVID-19, SARS-CoV and NL63 use spikes in their corona to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites on cytoskeletal membranes of host cells to deliver their viral payload. While groups such as disulfides in ACE2’s zinc metallopeptidase, and also in COVID-19’s spikes, facilitate such binding, it is worth exploring how similar complementary sites on materials such as polymers, metals, ceramics, fabrics, and biomaterials promote binding of viruses and bacteria and how they could be further engineered to prevent bioactivity, or to act as agents to collect viral payloads in filters or similar devices. In that vein, this article offers a perspective on novel tools and approaches for chemically and topologically modifying most utilitarian surfaces via defensive topological vibrational engineering to either prevent such adhesion or to enhance adhesion and elicit vibrational characteristics/’musical signatures’ from the surfaces so that the structure of the binding sites of viruses and bacteria is permanently altered and/or their cellular machinery is permanently disabled by targeted chemical transformations.

Direct threats to biodiversity within PAs and their interactions with broader-scale threats are both likely to vary with PA spatial and management characteristics (e.g., location, dependence on ecotourism revenues, governmental support). Private Land Conservation Areas (PLCAs) are interesting case study systems for assessing cross-scale threats to PAs and their determinants. Despite the growing number of PLCAs around the world, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the long-term capacity of these privately owned areas to conserve biodiversity. Their potential impermanence is commonly raised as a key concern. To better understand the threats to which different types of PLCAs are likely to be vulnerable, we asked 112 PLCA landholders in South Africa what they perceived as the top threats to their PLCAs. Landowners identified direct threats to the biodiversity within their PLCAs (e.g., poaching, extreme weather, inappropriate fire regimes, alien species) as well as describing broader socio-economic threats (e.g., regional crime, national legislation and politics, global economic recessions), which were noted to interact across scales. We found support for the hypothesis that patterns in the perceived multi-scale threats to a PLCA correspond with its management and spatial characteristics, including its remoteness, dependence on ecotourism or hunting revenues, and richness of megafaunal species. Understanding the threats to which different PLCAs may be vulnerable is useful for developing more nuanced, targeted strategies to build PLCA resilience to these threats (for example, by strengthening the capacity of self-funded PLCAs to cope with the threat of economic downturns through more innovative financial instruments or diversified revenue streams). Our findings highlight the importance of considering interactions between broad-scale socio-economic changes and direct threats to biodiversity, which can influence the resilience of PAs in ways that are not anticipated by more traditional, discipline-specific consideration of direct threats to the biodiversity within their boundaries.","Clements, Hayley S.; Biggs, Reinette; Cumming, Graeme S.",J Environ Manage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479720311592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823084/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111235; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301479720311592,163

Massive experimental and computational research effort to understand and characterize the disease and rapidly develop diagnostics, vaccines, and drugs has emerged in response to this devastating pandemic and more than 130 000 COVID-19-related research papers have been published in peer-reviewed journals or deposited in preprint servers. Much of the research effort has focused on the discovery of novel drug candidates or repurposing of existing drugs against COVID-19, and many such projects have been either exclusively computational or computer-aided experimental studies. Herein, we provide an expert overview of the key computational methods and their applications for the discovery of COVID-19 small-molecule therapeutics that have been reported in the research literature. We further outline that, after the first year the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that drug repurposing has not produced rapid and global solutions. However, several known drugs have been used in the clinic to cure COVID-19 patients, and a few repurposed drugs continue to be considered in clinical trials, along with several novel clinical candidates.

In particular, the data analysis community has been very active in publishing a large number of papers. A good part of them is related to the prediction of epidemic variables (number of cases and deaths) in different time horizons. To solve the problem of the prediction of COVID-19, an important place is occupied by the sigmoidal growth functions, as they have often been used successfully in previous epidemic outbreaks. The objective of this work was to investigate, on a statistical basis, the ability of classical growth functions to model the data from the COVID-19 pandemic. But for that, it was necessary to establish a clear classification of the 5 types of problems that can be faced with data analysis techniques in this specific context and to define a methodology based on quantitative metrics to measure the performance in solving these different types of problems. The basic concept used was that of an epidemic wave consisting of an initial-increasing and a final-decreasing phase. A classification of the COVID-19 waves in 4 types was done based on mining data from all available countries. Thus, it was possible to determine the resolvability of each type of problem depending on the stage of the epidemic wave. The biggest conclusion was the impossibility of solving the long-term forecasting problems (problem 5 - to estimate the total value of an epidemic wave) with data from the first phase only. Using this theoretical-methodological framework, we evaluated, using metrics specifically designed for these types of problems, the performance of 3 classic growth functions: Logistics, Gompertz and Richards (a generalization of the previous two) in 2 types of problems: (1) Description of the trajectory of the epidemic and (2) Prediction of the total numbers of cases and deaths. We used data from 10 countries, 7 of them with more than 100 daily deaths on the peak day. The results show a generalized underperformance of the logistic function in all aspects and place the Gompertz function as the best cost-benefit alternative, as it has performance comparable to the Richards function, but it has one less parameter to be adjusted, in the process of regression of the model to the observed data.","Fonseca, V.; Mascarenhas, E.; Ramos, P.; Coelho, L.; Frias, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.21254495; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.01.21254495v1?rss=1,163

Though the understanding of the disease has improved, fighting the virus remains challenging. One of the strategies is repurposing existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2. Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, reportedly inhibits the replication of RNA viruses, especially Coxsackieviruses B (CVB), such as CV-B4 in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the in vitro antiviral activity of FLX against SARS-CoV-2 in a model of acute infection. When 10 μM of FLX was added to SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells, the virus-induced cytopathic effect was not observed. In this model, the level of infectious particles in the supernatant was lower than that in controls. The level was below the limit of detection of the assay up to day 3 post-infection when FLX was administered before viral inoculation or simultaneously followed by daily inoculation. In conclusion, FLX can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

They are species-specific organisms. Mutation and reassortment have resulted in newer viruses such as H5N1, with new resistance against anti-viral medications, and this might lead to the emergence of a fully transmissible strain, as occurred in the 1957 and 1968 pandemics. Influenza viruses are no longer just a cause of self-limited upper respiratory tract infections; the H5N1 avian influenza virus can cause severe human infection with a mortality rate exceeding 50%. The case death rate of H5N1 avian influenza infection is 20 times higher than that of the 1918 infection (50% versus 2.5%), which killed 675 000 people in the USA and almost 40 million people worldwide. While the clock is still ticking towards what seems to be inevitable pandemic influenza, on April 17, 2007 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first vaccine against the avian influenza virus H5N1 for humans at high risk.

This informational asset should be thoroughly and wisely used in the coming year colliding in a global task force to control this infection. Epidemiology of this infection shows that the available estimates of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection prevalence largely depended on the availability of molecular testing and the extent of tested population. Within molecular diagnosis, the viability and infectiousness of the virus in the tested samples should be further investigated. Moreover, SARS‐CoV‐2 has a genetic normal evolution that is a dynamic process. The immune system participates to the counterattack of the viral infection by pathogen elimination, cellular homoeostasis, tissue repair and generation of memory cells that would be reactivated upon a second encounter with the same virus. In all these stages, we still have knowledge to be gathered regarding antibody persistence, protective effects and immunological memory. Moreover, information regarding the intense pro‐inflammatory action in severe cases still lacks and this is important in stratifying patients for difficult to treat cases.

Microbial aminopeptidase are of great acceptance as industrial enzymes with varying applications in food and pharma industry since these enzymes possess unique characteristics than aminopeptidases from other sources. This review describes the various applications of microbial aminopeptidases in different industrial sectors. These enzymes are widely used in food industry as a debittering agent as well as in the preparation of protein hydrolysates. In baking, brewing, and cheese making aminopeptidases are extensively used for removing the bitterness of peptides. The inhibitors of these enzymes are found great clinical applications against various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and viral infections. Aminopeptidases are widely used for the synthesis of biopeptides and amino acids, and found to be efficient than chemical synthesis.

Considering the current situation, modeling the transport and deposition of drops in human lung bronchioles is of utmost importance to determine their consequences on human health. The current study reports experimental observations on deposition in micro-capillaries, representing distal lung bronchioles, over a wide range of Re that imitates the particle dynamics in the entire lung. The experiment investigated deposition in tubes of diameter ranging from 0.3 mm to 2 mm and over a wide range of Reynolds number (10(−2) ⩽ Re ⩽ 10(3)). The range of the tube diameter and Re used in this study is motivated by the dimensions of lung airways and typical breathing flow rates. The aerosol fluid was loaded with boron doped carbon quantum dots as fluorophores. An aerosol plume was generated from this mixture fluid using an ultrasonic nebulizer, producing droplets with 6.5 µm as a mean diameter and over a narrow distribution of sizes. The amount of aerosol deposited on the tube walls was measured using a spectrofluorometer. The experimental results show that dimensionless deposition (δ) varies inversely with the bronchiole aspect ratio ([Formula: see text]), with the effect of the Reynolds number (Re) being significant only at low [Formula: see text]. δ also increased with increasing dimensionless bronchiole diameter ([Formula: see text]), but it is invariant with the particle size based Reynolds number. We show that [Formula: see text] for 10(−2) ⩽ Re ⩽ 1, which is typical of a diffusion dominated regime. For Re ⩾ 1, in the impaction dominated regime, [Formula: see text] is shown to be independent of Re. We also show a crossover regime where sedimentation becomes important.

In this research, environmental data such as temperatures, humidity, air quality and population density and socio-economic data such as GDP (PPP) per capita, per capita health expenditure, life expectancy and total test in each of these cities/provinces are considered. This data has been analyzed using statistical models such as Poisson and negative binomial models. It is found that a negative binomial regression model is the best fit for our data. Our results reveal higher population density to be an important factor for the quick spread of COVID-19 as maintenance of social distancing requirements are more difficult in urban areas. Moreover, GDP (PPP) and PM(2.5) are linked with fewer cases of COVID-19 whereas PM(10), and total number of tests are strongly associated with the increase of COVID-19 case counts.","Ahmed, Jishan; Jaman, Md.

638312,A Brief Theory of Epidemic Kinetics,2020-06-22,"The concerning increase in HIV-1 resistance argues for prioritizing the development of host-targeting antiviral drugs because such drugs can offer high genetic barriers to the selection of drug-resistant viral variants. Targeting host proteins could also yield drugs that act on viral life cycle events that have proven elusive to inhibition, such as intracellular events of HIV-1 immature capsid assembly. Here, we review small molecule inhibitors identified primarily through HIV-1 self-assembly screens and describe how all act either narrowly post-entry or broadly on early and late events of the HIV-1 life cycle. We propose that a different screening approach could identify compounds that specifically inhibit HIV-1 Gag assembly, as was observed when a potent rabies virus inhibitor was identified using a host-catalyzed rabies assembly screen. As an example of this possibility, we discuss an antiretroviral small molecule recently identified using a screen that recapitulates the host-catalyzed HIV-1 capsid assembly pathway. This chemotype potently blocks HIV-1 replication in T cells by specifically inhibiting immature HIV-1 capsid assembly but fails to select for resistant viral variants over 37 passages, suggesting a host protein target. Development of such small molecules could yield novel host-targeting antiretroviral drugs and provide insight into chronic diseases resulting from dysregulation of host machinery targeted by these drugs.","Lingappa, Jaisri R.; Lingappa, Vishwanath R.; Reed, Jonathan C.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13030451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802145/,163

We investigated the time of entry of swine influenza into the Finnish pig population. We also describe the molecular detection of two types of influenza A (H1N1) viruses in porcine samples submitted in 2009 and 2010. This retrospective study was based on three categories of samples: blood samples collected for disease monitoring from pigs at major slaughterhouses from 2007 to 2009; blood samples from pigs in farms with a special health status taken in 2008 and 2009; and diagnostic blood samples from pigs in farms with clinical signs of respiratory disease in 2008 and 2009. The blood samples were tested for influenza A antibodies with an antibody ELISA. Positive samples were further analyzed for H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 antibodies with a hemagglutination inhibition test. Diagnostic samples for virus detection were subjected to influenza A M-gene-specific real-time RT-PCR and to pandemic influenza A H1N1-specific real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were further analyzed with RT-PCRs designed for this purpose, and the PCR products were sequenced and sequences analyzed phylogenetically. RESULTS: In the blood samples from pigs in special health class farms producing replacement animals and in diagnostic blood samples, the first serologically positive samples originated from the period July–August 2008. In samples collected for disease monitoring, < 0.1%, 0% and 16% were positive for antibodies against influenza A H1N1 in the HI test in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Swine influenza A virus of avian-like H1N1 was first detected in diagnostic samples in February 2009. In 2009 and 2010, the avian-like H1N1 virus was detected on 12 and two farms, respectively. The pandemic H1N1 virus (A(H1N1)pdm09) was detected on one pig farm in 2009 and on two farms in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our study, swine influenza of avian-like H1N1 virus was introduced into the Finnish pig population in 2008 and A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 2009. The source of avian-like H1N1 infection could not be determined. Cases of pandemic H1N1 in pigs coincided with the period when the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was spread in humans in Finland.","Nokireki, Tiina; Laine, Taina; London, Laura; Ikonen, Niina; Huovilainen, Anita",Acta Vet Scand,https://doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-55-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047612/,163

One of the pathophysiological features of COVID-19 is associated with the activation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) leading to the disruption of vascular integrity, coagulation and inflammation. An interlink mechanism between coagulation and inflammatory pathways has been reported in COVID-19. Multiple components are involved in these pathological pathways. Out of all, Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is one of the primary components of coagulation pathway and also a mediator of vascular inflammation that plays an important role in thrombo-inflammation that further leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The thrombo-inflammatory co-morbidities such as hyper-coagulation, thrombosis, ARDS etc. have become the major cause of mortality in the patients of COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Thus, VWF can be explored as a potential target to manage COVID-19 associated co-morbidities. Supporting this hypothesis, there are literature reports which disclose previous attempts to target VWF for the management of thrombo-inflammation in other pathological conditions. The current report summarizes emerging insights into the pathophysiology, mechanism(s), diagnosis, management and foundations for research on this less explored clinically relevant glycoprotein as coagulation biomarker in COVID-19.","Choudhary, Shalki; Sharma, Kajal; Singh, Pankaj Kumar",Chem Biol Interact,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009279721002957; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2021.109657; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009279721002957?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516971/,163

To characterize polyadenylation activity in the BaMV replicase complex, we performed the in vitro polyadenylation with various BaMV templates. We conducted a polyadenylation activity assay for BaMV RNA by using a partially purified BaMV replicase complex. The results showed that approximately 200 adenylates at the 3′ end of the RNA were generated on the endogenous RNA templates. Specific fractions derived from uninfected Nicotiana benthamiana plants enhanced the polyadenylation activity, implying that host factors are involved in polyadenylation. Furthermore, polyadenylation can be detected in newly synthesized plus-strand RNA in vitro when using the exogenous BaMV minus-strand minigenome. For polyadenylation on the exogenous plus-strand minigenome, the 3′ end requires at least 4A to reach 22% polyadenylation activity.

639850,Microbial Forensics in Australia—The Australian Federal Police Perspective,2010-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Mobility and cognitive impairments in Parkinson’s disease (PD) often coexist and are prognostic of adverse health events. Consequently, assessment and training that simultaneously address both gait function and cognition are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy aging. For this purpose, a computer game-based rehabilitation treadmill platform (GRP) was developed for dual-task (DT) assessment and training. OBJECTIVE: The first objective was to establish the test-retest reliability of the GRP assessment protocol for DT gait, visuomotor and executive cognitive function in PD patients. The second objective was to examine the effect of task condition [single task (ST) vs. DT] and disease severity (stage 2 vs. stage 3) on gait, visuomotor and cognitive function. METHODS: Thirty individuals aged 55 to 70 years, diagnosed with PD; 15 each at Hoehn and Yahr scale stage 2 (PD-2) and 3 (PD-3) performed a series of computerized visuomotor and cognitive game tasks while sitting (ST) and during treadmill walking (DT). A treadmill instrumented with a pressure mat was used to record center of foot pressure and compute the average and coefficient of variation (COV) of step time, step length, and drift during 1-min, speed-controlled intervals. Visuomotor and cognitive game performance measures were quantified using custom software. Testing was conducted on two occasions, 1 week apart. RESULTS: With few exceptions, the assessment protocol showed moderate to high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values under both ST and DT conditions for the spatio-temporal gait measures (average and COV), as well as the visuomotor tracking and cognitive game performance measures. A significant decline in gait, visuomotor, and cognitive game performance measures was observed during DT compared to ST conditions, and in the PD-3 compared to PD-2 groups. CONCLUSION: The high to moderate ICC values along with the lack of systematic errors in the measures indicate that this tool has the ability to repeatedly record reliable DT interference (DTI) effects over time. The use of interactive digital media provides a flexible method to produce and evaluate DTI for a wide range of executive cognitive activities. This also proves to be a sensitive tool for tracking disease progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The curriculum is designed as a 4-week block with each week representing one of the four highest yield radiology subspecialties for medical students; neuroradiology, thoracic radiology, body radiology, and musculoskeletal radiology. A subspecialist radiologist from each section was identified as a primary mentor and tasked with designing a daily schedule for medical students and interns. The first 2 months of virtual rotators were surveyed to assess the effectiveness of the course. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 41 rotators responded to the survey, a response rate of 85%. Thirty-one of 35 (89%) of the rotators gave this virtual elective rotation a positive rating, with 16 trainees scoring the course as 4 out of 5 and 15 trainees selecting 5 out of 5. Four respondents selected 3 out of 5. Five out of 5 respondents who had experienced an in-person radiology elective rotation before this virtual rotation rated the virtual elective as more educational than the in-person rotation. We found the 4-week subspecialist mentor-based structure to be highly versatile, allowing us to simultaneously accommodate multiple groups of full or partial block rotators throughout COVID-19 mitigation.

In this study, by using a more extensive global dataset covering 578 time series from China, USA, Europe and the rest of the world, we show that climate show distinct impacts on early and late transmission of COVID-19 in the world after excluding the confounding factors. The early transmission ability of COVID-19 peaked around 6.3{degrees}C without or with little human intervention, but the later transmission ability was reduced in high temperature conditions under human intervention, probably driven by increased control efficiency of COVID-19. The transmission ability was positively associated with the founding population size of early reported cases and population size of a location. Our study suggested that with the coming summer seasons, the transmission risk of COVID-19 would increase in the high-latitude or high-altitude regions but decrease in low-latitude or low-altitude regions; human intervention is essential in containing the spread of COVID-19 around the world.","wan, x.; Cheng, C.; zhang, z.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20102459; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20102459v1?rss=1,163
642707,"Reply to Letter to the Editor, Reply to Yasri & Wiwanitkit",2020-11-19,"In this manuscript, we develop a mathematical model to describe the spreading of an epidemic disease in a human population. The emphasis in this work will be on the study of the propagation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Various epidemiologically relevant assumptions will be imposed upon the problem, and a coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations will be obtained. The model adopts the form of a nonlinear susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered system, and we investigate it both analytically and numerically. Analytically, we obtain the equilibrium points in the presence and absence of the coronavirus. We also calculate the reproduction number and provide conditions that guarantee the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibria. To that end, various tools from analysis will be employed, including Volterra-type Lyapunov functions, LaSalle’s invariance principle and the Routh–Hurwitz criterion. To simulate computationally the dynamics of propagation of the disease, we propose a nonstandard finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the mathematical model. A thorough analysis of the discrete model is provided in this work, including the consistency and the stability analyses, along with the capability of the discrete model to preserve the equilibria of the continuous system. Among other interesting results, our numerical simulations confirm the stability properties of the equilibrium points.","Rafiq, Muhammad; Macías-Díaz, J.E.; Raza, Ali; Ahmed, Nauman",Appl Math Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2020.08.082; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X20305308?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982020/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0307904X20305308,163

In this study, we analysed the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein) with respect to the widely observed 28881-28883 GGG to AAC variant. One of the major functions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is virion packaging through its interactions with the membrane protein (M protein). Our goal was to investigate, using in silico studies, the interaction between the mutant nucleocapsid protein and the M protein and how it differed from that of wild type N-M protein interaction. The results showed significant differences in interactions between the two. The mutant protein was predicted to form 3 salt bridges with the M protein, while the wild type only formed 2. The mutant protein was also predicted to display less temperature sensitivity than its wild type counterpart.

METHODS: We used interview data from 6,831 U.S. adults screened for the Communities, Households and SARS/CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort Study in April 2020. RESULTS: In logistic regression models, the adjusted odds ratio [aOR] of hospitalization due to COVID-19 for having (versus not having) children in the home was 10.5 (95% CI:5.7–19.1) among study participants living in multi-unit dwellings and 2.2 (95% CI:1.2–6.5) among those living in single unit dwellings. Among participants living in multi-unit dwellings, the aOR for COVID-19 hospitalization among participants with more than 4 persons in their household (versus 1 person) was 2.5 (95% CI:1.0–6.1), and 0.8 (95% CI:0.15–4.1) among those living in single unit dwellings.

644483,Modern trends in downstream processing of biotherapeutics through continuous chromatography: the potential of Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification,2020-09-24,"Aging affects individuals of every species, with sometimes detrimental effects on memory and cognition. The simultaneous-chaining task, a sequential-learning task, requires subjects to select items in a predetermined sequence, putting demands on memory and cognitive processing capacity. It is thus a useful tool to investigate age-related differences in these domains. Pigeons of three age groups (young, adult and aged) completed a locomotor adaptation of the task, learning a list of four items. Training began by presenting only the first item; additional items were added, one at a time, once previous items were reliably selected in their correct order. Although memory capacity declined noticeably with age, not all aged pigeons showed impairments compared to younger pigeons, suggesting that inter-individual variability emerged with age. During a subsequent free-recall memory test in the absence of reinforcement, when all trained items were presented alongside novel distractor items, most pigeons did not reproduce the trained sequence. During a further forced-choice test, when pigeons were given a choice between only two of the trained items, all three age groups showed evidence of an understanding of the ordinal relationship between items by choosing the earlier item, indicating that complex cognitive processing, unlike memory capacity, remained unaffected by age.","Meier, Christina; Sepehri, Parisa; Kelly, Debbie M.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96360-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34433844/,163

Over a year into the pandemic following unprecedented reductions in worldwide human mobility, distinct introduced lineages of SARS-CoV-2 without sequenced antecedents are increasingly discovered in high-income countries as a result of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance initiatives. We here describe one such SARS-CoV-2 lineage, carrying many mutations and deletions in the spike protein shared with widespread variants of concern (VOCs), including E484K, S477N and deletions HV69del, Y144del, and LLA241/243del. This lineage - designated B.1.620 - is known to circulate in Lithuania and has now been found in several European states, but also in increasing numbers in central Africa owing to important recent increases in genome sequencing efforts on the continent. We provide evidence of likely ongoing local transmission of B.1.620 in Lithuania, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and the Central African Republic. We describe the suite of mutations this lineage carries, its potential to be resistant to neutralising antibodies, travel histories for a subset of the European cases, and evidence of local B.1.620 transmission in Europe. We make a case for the likely Central African origin of this lineage by providing travel records as well as the outcomes of carefully crafted phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference methodologies, the latter of which is able to exploit individual travel histories recorded for infected travellers having entered different European countries.","Dudas, G.; Hong, S.

646868,Politik & Management,2020-12-21,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging, rapidly evolving disease that spreads through the respiratory system and is highly contagious. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In China, the pandemic was controlled after 2 mo through effective policies and containment measures. Describing the detailed policies and containment measures used to control the epidemic in Chongqing will provide a reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in other areas of the world. AIM: To explore the effects of different policies and containment measures on the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing. METHODS: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Chongqing were prospectively collected from January 21 to March 15, 2020. The policies and prevention measures implemented by the government during the epidemic period were also collected. Trend analysis was performed to explore the impact of the main policy measures on the effectiveness of the control of COVID-19 in Chongqing. RESULTS: As of March 15, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Chongqing was 1.84/100000 (576 cases) and the infection fatality rate was 1.04% (6/576). The spread of COVID-19 was controlled by effective policies that involved establishing a group for directing the COVID-19 epidemic control effort; strengthening guidance and supervision; ensuring the supply of daily necessities and medical supplies and equipment to residents; setting up designated hospitals; implementing legal measures; and enhancing health education. Medical techniques were implemented to improve the recovery rate and control the epidemic. Policies such as “the lockdown of Wuhan”, “initiating a first-level response to major public health emergencies”, and “implementing the closed management of residential communities” significantly curbed the spread of COVID-19. Optimizing the diagnosis process, shortening the diagnosis time, and constructing teams of clinical experts facilitated the provision of “one team of medical experts for each patient” treatment for severe patients, which significantly improved the recovery rate and reduced the infection fatality rate. CONCLUSION: The prevention policies and containment measures implemented by the government and medical institutions are highly effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic and increasing the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients.","Liang, Xiao-Hua; Tang, Xian; Luo, Ye-Tao; Zhang, Min; Feng, Ze-Pei",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i14.2959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32775378/,163

Patients with COVID-19 are not allowed to receive visitors and many hospitals and nursing homes have completely banned visitors. Many support services have been reduced or stopped completely. Necessary treatment interventions for other patients with critical and life-limiting diseases have been delayed or suspended in order to free resources for the expected COVID-19 patients; however, these people need to feel social connectedness with their relatives. Palliative care patients should be exempted from any ban on visitors. Families should be able to visit dying patients even on intensive care units or isolation wards, using adequate protective equipment. Alternative options, such as video telephone calls or via social media should be explored for patients in isolation. Families should also be enabled to say goodbye to the deceased with adequate protective equipment or should be offered alternative real or virtual options for remembrance and commemoration. Health care professionals coping with the exceptional stress should be continuously supported. This requires clear communication and leadership structures, communication training, psychosocial support, but most of all optimal framework conditions for the clinical work.","Münch, Urs; Müller, Heidi; Deffner, Teresa; von Schmude, Andrea; Kern, Martina; Kiepke-Ziemes, Susanne; Radbruch, Lukas",Schmerz,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00482-020-00483-9,163

However, individual attributes of those who tended to stay home have not been examined. Therefore, this study examined the demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics of people who refrained from going out both before and after a state of emergency was declared. Using data from a nationwide online survey, this study retrospectively investigated the relative amount of time spent outside the home between mid-February and mid-May 2020. Multilevel linear regression analysis was performed to examine the association of time outside with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics, and with the anxiety related to going out, in each period. Overall, respondents significantly reduced their time spent outside during the study period, especially after a state of emergency was declared. Those who were young, female, living with two or more people, had lower income, were not working, used public transportation, had chronic disease, and lived in large metropolitan areas were more likely to reduce time outside during a part of the study period. However, no significant differences were observed for occupational class, education, and neighborhood population density. Thus, the results showed a reduction in time outside during the COVID-19 outbreak and the existence of demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic differences in going-out behavior. Socioeconomic disparities and neighborhood differences in going-out behavior, and their influence on health should be continuously monitored.","Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Yabe, Naoto; Nakaya, Tomoki",Prev Med Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211335520302643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33489727/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101306; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335520302643,163
648230,Plasmonic Biosensors for Single-Molecule Biomedical Analysis,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Various strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 including lockdown and stay-at-home order are expected to reduce road traffic characteristics and consequently road traffic collisions (RTCs). We aimed to review the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence, patterns, and severity of the injury, management, and outcomes of RTCs and give recommendations on improving road safety during this pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on RTCs published in English language using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no date restriction. Google search engine and websites were also used to retrieve relevant published literature, including discussion papers, reports, and media news. Papers were critically read and data were summarized and combined. RESULTS: Traffic volume dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic which was associated with significant drop in RTCs globally and a reduction of road deaths in 32 out of 36 countries in April 2020 compared with April 2019, with a decrease of 50% or more in 12 countries, 25 to 49% in 14 countries, and by less than 25% in six countries. Similarly, there was a decrease in annual road death in 33 out of 42 countries in 2020 compared with 2019, with a reduction of 25% or more in 5 countries, 15–24% in 13 countries, and by less than 15% in 15 countries. In contrast, the opposite occurred in four and nine countries during the periods, respectively. There was also a drop in the number of admitted patients in trauma centers related to RTCs during both periods. This has been attributed to an increase in speeding, emptier traffic lanes, reduced law enforcement, not wearing seat belts, and alcohol and drug abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has generally reduced the overall absolute numbers of RTCs, and their deaths and injuries despite the relative increase of severity of injury and death. The most important factors that affected the RTCs are decreased mobility with empty lines, reduced crowding, and increased speeding. Our findings serve as a baseline for injury prevention in the current and future pandemics.","Yasin, Yasin J.; Grivna, Michal; Abu-Zidan, Fikri M.",World J Emerg Surg,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13017-021-00395-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583713/,163

It is therefore not surprising that clinicians in this field have viewed the events of the last 18 months as predominantly negative. As the pandemic is gradually ebbing away we argue that this is also a unique opportunity to re-think transplant assessment. Firstly, we have witnessed a step-change in the use of technology and virtual assessments. Another effect of the pandemic is that we have had to make do with what was available - which has often worked surprisingly well. Finally, we have learned to think the unthinkable: maybe things don’t have to continue the way they have always been. As we emerge the other side of the pandemic we should rethink which parts of the transplant assessment process are necessary and evidence based.

We evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated in COVID‐19 infection. We validated the AI‐predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb‐associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities for AAK1, BIKE, and GAK. Inhibition of NAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids. These effects occurred at exposure levels seen clinically. In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID‐19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load, inflammatory markers, and IL‐6 levels.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus appeared in China, and since then, scientific production, including preprints, has drastically increased. In this study, we intend to evaluate how often preprints about COVID-19 were published in scholarly journals and cited. METHODS: We searched the iSearch COVID-19 portfolio to identify all preprints related to COVID-19 posted on bioRxiv, medRxiv, and Research Square from January 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. We used a custom-designed program to obtain metadata using the Crossref public API. After that, we determined the publication rate and made comparisons based on citation counts using non-parametric methods. Also, we compared the publication rate, citation counts, and time interval from posting on a preprint server to publication in a scholarly journal among the three different preprint servers. RESULTS: Our sample included 5,061 preprints, out of which 288 were published in scholarly journals and 4,773 remained unpublished (publication rate of 5.7%). We found that articles published in scholarly journals had a significantly higher total citation count than unpublished preprints within our sample (p < 0.001), and that preprints that were eventually published had a higher citation count as preprints when compared to unpublished preprints (p < 0.001). As well, we found that published preprints had a significantly higher citation count after publication in a scholarly journal compared to as a preprint (p < 0.001). Our results also show that medRxiv had the highest publication rate, while bioRxiv had the highest citation count and shortest time interval from posting on a preprint server to publication in a scholarly journal. CONCLUSIONS: We found a remarkably low publication rate for preprints within our sample, despite accelerated time to publication by multiple scholarly journals. These findings could be partially attributed to the unprecedented surge in scientific production observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might saturate reviewing and editing processes in scholarly journals. However, our findings show that preprints had a significantly lower scientific impact, which might suggest that some preprints have lower quality and will not be able to endure peer-reviewing processes to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Añazco, Diego; Nicolalde, Bryan; Espinosa, Isabel; Camacho, Jose; Mushtaq, Mariam; Gimenez, Jimena; Teran, Enrique",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717688/,163
652747,Natural/random protein classification models based on star network topological indices,2008-10-21,"Lung disease is common throughout the world. These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, fibrosis, etc. Timely diagnosis of lung disease is essential. Many image processing and machine learning models have been developed for this purpose. Different forms of existing deep learning techniques including convolutional neural network (CNN), vanilla neural network, visual geometry group based neural network (VGG), and capsule network are applied for lung disease prediction. The basic CNN has poor performance for rotated, tilted, or other abnormal image orientation. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid deep learning framework by combining VGG, data augmentation and spatial transformer network (STN) with CNN. This new hybrid method is termed here as VGG Data STN with CNN (VDSNet). As implementation tools, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, and Keras are used. The new model is applied to NIH chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle repository. Full and sample versions of the dataset are considered. For both full and sample datasets, VDSNet outperforms existing methods in terms of a number of metrics including precision, recall, F0.5 score and validation accuracy. For the case of full dataset, VDSNet exhibits a validation accuracy of 73%, while vanilla gray, vanilla RGB, hybrid CNN and VGG, and modified capsule network have accuracy values of 67.8%, 69%, 69.5%, 60.5% and 63.8%, respectively. When sample dataset rather than full dataset is used, VDSNet requires much lower training time at the expense of a slightly lower validation accuracy. Hence, the proposed VDSNet framework will simplify the detection of lung disease for experts as well as for doctors.","Bharati, Subrato; Podder, Prajoy; Hossain Mondal, M.

654194,Airborne Pathogens in a Heterogeneous World: Superspreading & Mitigation,2020-10-27,"INTRODUCTION: Recent attention on the possible use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 disease has potentially triggered a number of overdoses from hydroxychloroquine. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine manifests with cardiac conduction abnormalities, seizure activity, and muscle weakness. Recognizing this toxidrome and unique management of this toxicity is important in the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE REPORT: A 27-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department 7 hours after an intentional overdose of hydroxychloroquine. Initial presentation demonstrated proximal muscle weakness. The patient was found to have a QRS complex of 134 ms and QTc of 710 ms. He was treated with early orotracheal intubation and intravenous diazepam boluses. Due to difficulties formulating continuous diazepam infusions, we opted to utilize an intermitted intravenous bolus strategy that achieved similar effects that a continuous infusion would. The patient recovered without residual side effects. DISCUSSION: Hydroxychloroquine toxicity is rare but projected to increase in frequency given its selection as a potential modality to treat COVID-19 disease. It is important for clinicians to recognize the unique effects of hydroxychloroquine poisoning and initiate appropriate emergency maneuvers to improve the outcomes in these patients.","Chai, Peter R.; Ferro, E.

654414,ISNI 2006 Abstracts,2006-09-30,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with autoimmune diseases were advised to shield to avoid COVID-19, but information on their prognosis is lacking. We characterised 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalisation with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza. METHODS: A multinational network cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (United States [US]), Optum [US], Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (US), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain), and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea). All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalised with influenza in 2017–2018 were included. Outcomes were death and complications within 30 days of hospitalisation. RESULTS: We studied 133 589 patients diagnosed and 48 418 hospitalised with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. Most patients were female, aged ≥50 years with previous comorbidities. The prevalence of hypertension (45.5–93.2%), chronic kidney disease (14.0–52.7%) and heart disease (29.0–83.8%) was higher in hospitalised vs diagnosed patients with COVID-19. Compared with 70 660 hospitalised with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2% to 4.3% vs 6.3% to 24.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality.","Tan, Eng Hooi; Sena, Anthony G; Prats-Uribe, Albert; You, Seng Chan; Ahmed, Waheed-Ul-Rahman; Kostka, Kristin; Reich, Christian; Duvall, Scott L; Lynch, Kristine E; Matheny, Michael E; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Bertolin, Sergio Fernandez; Hripcsak, George; Natarajan, Karthik; Falconer, Thomas; Spotnitz, Matthew; Ostropolets, Anna; Blacketer, Clair; Alshammari, Thamir M; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Lane, Jennifer C E; Dawoud, Dalia M; Shah, Karishma; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Lin; Areia, Carlos; Golozar, Asieh; Recalde, Martina; Casajust, Paula; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Subbian, Vignesh; Vizcaya, David; Lai, Lana Y H; Nyberg, Fredrik; Morales, Daniel R; Posada, Jose D; Shah, Nigam H; Gong, Mengchun; Vivekanantham, Arani; Abend, Aaron; Minty, Evan P; Suchard, Marc; Rijnbeek, Peter; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",Rheumatology (Oxford),https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725121/,163

The increasing rate of coronavirus infection in a developing country such as Bangladesh caused the highest death rate of doctors among frontline service providers and resulted in fear and anxiety among healthcare workers. Even with the preliminary measures of hospitals and clinics to protect healthcare workers, the growing casualties are alarming. This research uses case study approach to explore the issues doctors and nurses face in ‘priority intervention areas’ (PIA) in order to improve the health system quality. Qualitative in‐depth semi‐structured interviews were conducted from 12 May to 4 June 2020 among doctors and nurses from two different private hospitals in Dhaka city. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. The two significant areas that required immediate attention were identified from the PIA framework as ‘patient and staff safety, infection control’ and ‘cultural aspects and community engagement’. Each area of the PIA framework showed previously ignored issues in the current health system. The adaptation of the PIA framework helped identify critical health system issues. Possible corrective actions including proper planning and management of isolating the infected patients and provision of adequate personal protective equipment are recommended to management and policymakers to save the lives of healthcare workers and to minimise the spread of infection.","Hussain, Mehdi; Begum, Tahmina; Batul, Syeda A.; Tui, Nastaran N.; Islam, Md.

Methods: In this study, zip-code level data from 5 major metropolitan areas, was utilized to study the effect of multiple demographic & socio-economic factors including race, age, income, chronic disease comorbidity, population density, number of people per household on number of positive cases and ensuing death. Adjusted linear regression analysis using 13 to 16 such variables was performed. Results: Overall, 442 zip codes reporting 93,170 positive COVID-19 cases and 138 zip codes reporting mortality ranging from 0 to 25 were included in this study. A multivariable linear regression model noted that 1% increase in the proportion of residents above the age of 65 years, proportion of African American residents, proportion of females, persons per household and population density of the zip code increased the proportion of positive cases by 0.77%, 0.23%, 1.64%, 1.83% and 0.46% respectively (P<0.01) with only population density remaining significant in zip codes with greater than median number of cases. In zips with greater than median number of deaths, no community/socio-economic factor contributed significantly to death. Conclusion: This study gives early signals of gender, and racial inequalities while providing overwhelming evidence of how population density may contribute to an increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19.","Guha, Avirup; Bonsu, Janice; Dey, Amit; Addison, Daniel",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071944v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511646/,163

Understanding those effects is critical for anticipating and mitigating epidemic spread. Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect the inactivation rate of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of those effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of the enveloped respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life is over 24 hours at 10 °C and 40 % RH, but approximately 1.5 hours at 27 °C and 65 % RH. Our mechanistic model uses simple chemistry to explain the increase in virus inactivation rate with increased temperature and the U-shaped dependence of inactivation rate on relative humidity. The model accurately predicts quantitative measurements from existing studies of five different human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that shared mechanisms may determine environmental stability for many enveloped viruses. Our results indicate scenarios of particular transmission risk, point to pandemic mitigation strategies, and open new frontiers in the mechanistic study of virus transmission.","Morris, Dylan H.; Yinda, Kwe Claude; Gamble, Amandine; Rossine, Fernando W.; Huang, Qishen; Bushmaker, Trenton; Fischer, Robert J.; Matson, M.

Since certain evidences indicate a direct relationship of various viruses with the weather (temperature in particular), the same is being speculated about COVID-19; however, it is still under investigation as the pandemic is advancing the world over. In this study, we tried to analyze the spread of COVID-19 in the Indian subcontinent with respect to the local temperature regimes from March 9, 2020, to May 27, 2020. To establish the relation between COVID-19 and temperature in India, three different ecogeographical regions having significant temperature differences were taken into consideration for the analysis. We observed that except Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Kashmir showed a significantly positive correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and the temperature during the period of study. The evidences based on the results presented in this research lead us to believe that the increasing temperature is beneficial to the COVID-19 spread, and the cases are going to rise further with the increasing temperature over India. We, therefore, conclude that the existing data, though limited, suggest that the spread of COVID-19 in India is not explained by the variation of temperature alone and is most likely driven by a host of other factors related to epidemiology, socioeconomics and other climatic factors. Based on the results, it is suggested that temperature should not be considered as a yardstick for planning intervention strategies for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Meraj, Gowhar; Farooq, Majid; Singh, Suraj Kumar; Romshoo, Shakil A.; Sudhanshu; Nathawat, M.

While the global spotlight is currently focused on combating this pandemic through means ranging from finding a treatment among existing therapeutic agents to inventing a vaccine that can aid in halting the further loss of life. AIM: To collect all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published related to COVID-19 to better identify available evidence, highlight gaps in knowledge, and elucidate further meta-analyses and umbrella reviews that are yet to be performed. METHODS: We explored studies based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the key-terms, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS virus, coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and SARS coronavirus-2. The included studies were extracted from Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. The publication timeframe of included studies ranged between January 01, 2020, to October 30, 2020. Studies that were published in languages other than English were not considered for this systematic review. The finalized full-text articles are freely accessible in the public domain. RESULTS: Searching Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases resulted in 1906, 669, and 19 results, respectively, that comprised 2594 studies. 515 duplicates were subsequently removed, leaving 2079 studies. The inclusion criteria were systematic reviews or meta-analyses. 860 results were excluded for being a review article, scope review, rapid review, panel review, or guideline that produced a total of 1219 studies. After screening articles were categorized, the included articles were put into main groups of clinical presentation, epidemiology, screening and diagnosis, severity assessment, special populations, and treatment. Subsequently, there was a second subclassification into the following groups: gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, stroke, thrombosis, anosmia and dysgeusia, ocular manifestations, nephrology, cutaneous manifestations, D-dimer, lymphocyte, anticoagulation, antivirals, convalescent plasma, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, technology, diabetes mellitus, obesity, pregnancy, children, mental health(,) smoking, cancer, and transplant. CONCLUSION: Among the included articles, it is clear that further research is needed regarding treatment options and vaccines. With more studies, data will be less heterogeneous, and statistical analysis can be better applied to provide more robust clinical evidence.

METHODS: A scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies was systematically undertaken by searching for English language publications in MEDLINE database and manual reference search of eligible articles. Thematic analysis was employed to identify and extract common concordance and discordance themes leading to the development of analytical constructs. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported on consumers’ (i.e. older patients aged 60 + years in their final years of life and/or their informal caregivers) and clinicians’ (doctors, nurses, social workers, etc.) perspectives on quality of medical, surgical or palliative/supportive care administered to older adults in the last year of life across all healthcare settings. RESULTS: Of the 2736 articles screened, 21 articles were included. Four themes identified concordance between consumers’ and clinicians’ perceptions of care quality: holistic patient care; coordinated care that facilitated EOL; the role of family at EOL; and impact of prognostic uncertainty on care planning. Three themes emerged for discordance of perceptions: understanding the patient needs at EOL; capacity of healthcare system/providers to accommodate family needs; and knowledge and communication of active or palliative care at EOL. CONCLUSIONS: While progress has been made on promoting patient autonomy and respecting the family role in representing patient’s best interest, gaps remain in terms of care coordination, communication of prognosis, public understanding of the meaning of goals of care including de-escalation of management and enactment of advance care directives by clinicians for people with diminished decision capacity. Public understanding of the meaning of “comfort” care and the need to prevent over-treatment are essential for their satisfaction with care and their ability to embrace the concept of a good death.

The expression of IFNλ4 is correlated with both poor spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and poor response to treatment with type I interferon. Here, we show that the IFNL4 gene encodes an active type III interferon, named IFNλ4, which signals through the IFNλR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains. Recombinant IFNλ4 is antiviral against both HCV and coronaviruses at levels comparable to IFNλ3. However, the secretion of IFNλ4 is impaired compared to that of IFNλ3, and this impairment is not due to a weak signal peptide, which was previously believed. We found that IFNλ4 gets N-linked glycosylated and that this glycosylation is required for secretion. Nevertheless, this glycosylation is not required for activity. Together, these findings result in the paradox that IFNλ4 is strongly antiviral but a disadvantage during HCV infection.","Hamming, Ole J; Terczyńska-Dyla, Ewa; Vieyres, Gabrielle; Dijkman, Ronald; Jørgensen, Sanne E; Akhtar, Hashaam; Siupka, Piotr; Pietschmann, Thomas; Thiel, Volker; Hartmann, Rune",The EMBO Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24169568/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2013.232; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3844954?pdf=render,163

Design Retrospective cohort using data from a COVID-19 registry. Setting Five inpatient hospitals in a single academic Health System within the United States. Participants Adults (> 17 years) who were urgently or emergently admitted to one of the five acute hospitals between March 1st and July 31st, 2020, tested positive for COVID-19 during their hospitalization, and had at least 1 AM-PAC “6-clicks” score in their medical record. Interventions N/A. Main Outcome Measures Discharge destination, dichotomized as home vs. facility. Results Of the 2565 records in the registry, 1486 included AM-PAC “6-clicks” mobility scores and 1200 included activity scores. Median age was 64 years (IQR=26), COVID-19 was primary or admitting diagnosis for 47% (n = 700), and 61.6% (n = 915) were discharged home. Initial AM-PAC was assessed 1 (IQR=3) days after admission, and the median for both mobility and activity scores was 18 (IQR=14). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for the influence of covariates, initial mobility and activity scores were both independent predictors of discharge destination. Each point decrease in initial AM-PAC score increased the odds of discharge to a faculty by 1.15 (95 CI% 1.12 - 1.19; p < 0.001) and 1.16 (95 CI% 1.11 - 1.22; p < 0.001) fold for mobility and activity scores, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that initial AM-PAC scores were strong predictors of discharge destination, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.806 (95 CI% 0.781 - 0.831; p < 0.001) and 0.796 (95% CI 0.767 - 0.826; p < 0.001) for mobility and activity scores, respectively. A score of 17.5 predicted discharge with a sensitivity of .687 and specificity of 0.81 for mobility and 0.724 and 0.770 for activity.

The goal of this paper is to examine the association between racial discrimination amid COVID-19 pandemic and depressive symptoms among Asian subgroups and to test whether communications about the incident with various sources moderate this relationship. Data come from an online survey conducted among 245 Asian Americans. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. COVID-19 racial discrimination was positively associated with depressive symptoms, and this association did not vary between Chinese Americans and other Asian subgroups. Communications with a spouse/partner buffered the mental burden of racial discrimination.

The program listed Scientific Sessions to occur over three full days at either Padova University or the Hotel Augustus on Euganei Hills (Padova), Italy. Abruptly, however, in early January the Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak started in China and changed the world perspectives. In Italy, the epidemia had the first Italian cases and victims in an area south of Milan and in a Village of the Euganei Hills (Vo Euganeo, Padova). Thus, it was a mandatory decision to post-pone the PMDs meeting to 19-21 November, 2020.

664181,Estimating the pathogen safety of manufactured human plasma products: application to fibrin sealants and to thrombin,2008-05-07,"BACKGROUND: The Square Stepping Exercise (SSE) is an exercise training program incorporating cognitive and physical exercise components, which was originally developed for older adults to reduce falling risks. SSE’s potential in delaying cognitive decline in older adults seems to be promising. However, there is scarce research on the SSE program with young adults. Furthermore, the outbreak of coronavirus disease has imposed people to change their lifestyle and behaviors, including exercise behaviors. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the acute effects of a home-based online SSE trial on cognitive and social functions in sedentary young adults. METHODS: A total of 18 young adults (6 males, 12 females) participated in the present study. They completed two exercise conditions (SSE and active control exercise), consisting of 3 sessions per week, over 2 weeks. A 2 times (pre vs. post) × 2 conditions (SSE vs. active control) repeated-measures ANCOVA was conducted on the score of the Modified Card Sorting Task with age and education year as covariates. A one-way repeated-measures MANOVA was performed on the subscale scores of the Physical Activity Group Environment Questionnaire to examine the effects of the exercise conditions (SSE vs. active control) on group cohesion. RESULTS: SSE was found effective to improve executive function such as abstract reasoning, mental flexibility, and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, participants’ perceptions of social interaction with their group, and closeness and bonding existing in their group were significantly higher in the SSE condition than the active control condition. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, SSE was conducted online and found to be effective to enhance executive function and group cohesion in sedentary young adults. These novel approach and findings are the strengths of the present study. People aged 60 years and over are more vulnerable to the coronavirus and at higher risk of developing serious illness. Given the coronavirus pandemic circumstances, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of the online SSE approach to older adults in future research.","Kawabata, Masato; Gan, Su Ren; Goh, Gint; Omar, Siti Aisha Binte; Oh, Ivan T.

METHODS: We draw on data from two waves of Corona Impact Survey, which were fielded in late April and early of May 2020. Multilevel models were used to analyze the hierarchically nested data. RESULTS: Experiencing coronavirus disease-2019 restrictions significantly raise mental distress. This association is stronger for individuals with preexisting health conditions and those who worry about job prospects. These findings hold with the inclusion of region-wave covariates (number of deaths, wave dummy and aggregate measure of restrictions). Finally, there is a cross-level interaction: the restriction-distress connection is more pronounced in the second wave of data.

664840,The microbial terroir: open questions on the Nagoya protocol applied to microbial resources,2021-07-26,"A retrospective study was conducted among Italian cancer healthcare workers (HCWs) to describe how influenza vaccination attitudes have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis was conducted on the last three influenza seasons (2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21). To account for different relationships and proximity with patients, the study population was grouped into three main professional categories: health personnel, administrative staff and technicians. Moreover, to explore the factors affecting the coverage of influenza vaccine, a multinomial regression analysis was performed.Over the years, the influenza vaccination uptake showed a gradual increase across the overall staff, the highest coverage (53.8%) was observed in the season 2020/21, in particular, for health personnel (57.7%). In general, males resulted in more adherent to vaccination campaigns; nevertheless, this gap decreased in the last season. A total of 28.6% workers were always vaccinated throughout the past three seasons, a remarkable 25.2% (mainly young and females) received for the first time the influenza vaccination in 2020/21.In this dramatic health crisis, the attitudes of HCWs toward flu vaccination have changed. The COVID-19 outbreak increased adherence to flu vaccination, reaching the highest coverage in the campaign 2020/21. However, further efforts should be made to achieve greater vaccination coverage.","Bertoni, Lucia; Roncadori, Andrea; Gentili, Nicola; Danesi, Valentina; Massa, Ilaria; Nanni, Oriana; Altini, Mattia; Gabutti, Giovanni; Montella, Maria Teresa",Hum Vaccin Immunother,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1978795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613881/,163

DESIGN: Matched cohort (pairwise method). SETTING: A single tertiary neurosurgical referral centre at a large UK Major Trauma Centre. PARTICIPANTS: During the first COVID-19 wave, 231 neurosurgical cases were performed. These cases were matched to cases from 2019. Cases were matched for age (±10 years), primary pathology and surgical procedure. Cases were excluded from analysis if either the age could not be matched to within 10 years, or the primary pathology or procedure was too unique. After exclusions, 191 cases were included in final analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes included Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) on discharge, length of stay (LoS), operative and anaesthetic times and grade of primary surgeon. An exploratory outcome was the SARS-CoV-2 status of patients. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the pandemic and matched cohorts in 30-day mortality, pulmonary complications, discharge GOS, LoS, operative or anaesthetic times. There was a significant difference in the variation of grade of primary surgeon. Only 2.2% (n=5) of patients had a SARS-CoV-2 positive swab. CONCLUSION: During the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality, morbidity and functional outcomes of operatively managed neurosurgical patients at University Hospitals Birmingham were not significantly affected compared with normal practice. The grade of primary surgeon was significantly more senior and adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates how the pandemic has negatively impacted UK surgical training. Mixing COVID-19 positive, unknown and negative cases did not significantly impact on outcomes and indicates that further research is required to support the implementation of evidence-based surgical pathways, such as COVID-light sites, throughout the next stage of the pandemic.","Toman, Emma; Soon, Wai Cheong; Thanabalasundaram, Gopiga; Burns, Daniel; Petrik, Vladimir; Watts, Colin; Wykes, Victoria; White, Anwen",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622958/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047063,163

A literature search for studies involving the seven isolated tanshinone hits showed that at present, none have been identified as coronaviral protease inhibitors. We have identified that all of the isolated tanshinones are good inhibitors of both cysteine proteases. However, their activity was slightly affected by subtle changes in structure and targeting enzymes. All isolated compounds (1–7) act as time dependent inhibitors of PL(pro), but no improved inhibition was observed following preincubation with the 3CL(pro). In a detail kinetic mechanism study, all of the tanshinones except rosmariquinone (7) were identified as noncompetitive enzyme isomerization inhibitors. However, rosmariquinone (7) showed a different kinetic mechanism through mixed-type simple reversible slow-binding inhibition. Furthermore, tanshinone I (5) exhibited the most potent nanomolar level inhibitory activity toward deubiquitinating (IC(50) = 0.7 μM). Additionally, the inhibition is selective because these compounds do not exert significant inhibitory effects against other proteases including chymotrysin, papain, and HIV protease. These findings provide potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV viral infection and replication.","Park, Ji-Young; Kim, Jang Hoon; Kim, Young Min; Jeong, Hyung Jae; Kim, Dae Wook; Park, Ki Hun; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Park, Su-Jin; Lee, Woo Song; Ryu, Young Bae",Bioorg Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22884354/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089612005998; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.07.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089612005998,163

METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study of a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Zunyi, China between February 1 and March 30, 2020. Serum concentrations of PGRN were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission and at discharge. In parallel, the serum levels of soluble adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), P-selectin (sP-selectin), and E-selectin (sE-selectin) were assayed by a human adhesion molecule multiplex kit. The association between serum PGRN levels and other laboratory test results was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: At baseline, the median serum PGRN levels in patients with COVID-19 were 94.8 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR): 66.6–119.6 ng/mL], which was significantly elevated compared with those in healthy controls (46.3 ng/mL, IQR: 41.8–55.6 ng/mL). Moreover, the median serum sVCAM-1 levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (1396.0 ng/mL, IQR: 1019.1–1774.8 ng/mL) than those in healthy controls (612.4 ng/mL, IQR: 466.4–689.3 ng/mL). However, the levels of sICAM-1, sP-selectin, and sE-selectin were not significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 when compared to healthy controls. Further analysis showed that serum PGRN levels were significantly positively associated with sVCAM-1 (r= 0.675, P= 0.008) and inversely with sICAM-1 (r= −0.609, P= 0.021) and aspartate aminotransferase levels (r= −0.560, P= 0.037) in patients with COVID-19 at hospital admission. In COVID-19 patients, serum PGRN and sVCAM-1 levels fell significantly after successful treatment. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates elevated serum PGRN and sVCAM-1 levels in patients with COVID-19, which may provide clues as to the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the potential of PGRN and sVCAM-1 as biomarkers and investigate their role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Yao, Shifei; Luo, Nanning; Liu, Jiaoyang; Zha, He; Ai, Yuanhang; Luo, Juan; Shi, Shi; Wu, Kaifeng",J Inflamm Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s330356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584437/,163

Challenges such as disease heterogeneity, incomplete characterization of the targets of existing drugs and a limited understanding of functional interactions of complex genetic risk loci and environmental factors have compromised the identification of novel drug candidates. There is a pressing clinical need for drugs with new mechanisms of action which address the lack of efficacy and debilitating side effects of current medications. Here we discuss a novel strategy for neuropsychiatric drug discovery which aims to address these limitations by identifying disease-related functional responses (‘functional cellular endophenotypes’) in a variety of patient-derived cells, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and organoids or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Disease-specific alterations in cellular responses can subsequently yield novel drug screening targets and drug candidates. We discuss the potential of this approach in the context of recent advances in patient-derived cellular models, high-content single-cell screening of cellular networks and changes in the diagnostic framework of neuropsychiatric disorders.","Lago, Santiago G.; Tomasik, Jakub; Bahn, Sabine",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01243-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33597511/,163

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether returning to online classes, even not presential, during the social isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, affected the mental health of university students. METHODS Forty students (10 men and 30 women) (age, 22.3±3.8 years; body mass, 62.5±17.8 kg; height, 165.6±8.7cm) from undergraduate health courses participated in the study. The students answered a self-administered questionnaire designed to gather personal and quarantine information as well as information about the frequency of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. The questionnaire was answered before and after the return to online classes. RESULTS There was a significantly lower frequency of depression symptoms after the return to online classes (Z = -2.27; p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in anxiety symptoms before and after returning to online classes (Z = -0.51; p = 0.61).

These replication factories are supposed to concentrate the components of the replicase and to shield replication intermediates from the host cell innate immune defense. Virus induced membrane alterations are often generated in coordination with host factors and can be grouped into different morphotypes. Recent advances in conventional and electron microscopy have contributed greatly to our understanding of their biogenesis, but still many questions remain how viral proteins capture membranes and subvert host factors for their need. In this review, we will discuss different representatives of positive strand RNA viruses and their ways of hijacking cellular membranes to establish replication complexes. We will further focus on host cell factors that are critically involved in formation of these membranes and how they contribute to viral replication.","Harak, Christian; Lohmann, Volker",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.029; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215000756; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215000756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25746936/,163

Given the global spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), social isolation regulations and laws have been implemented in many countries to contain the spread of the virus and this has caused a drastic shift from the usual physically demanding life to a sedentary lifestyle characterized by significantly reduced physical activities and prolong sitting. METHODS/DATA SOURCE: Human and nonhuman primate literature was examined to compare experimental and clinical modulation of inflammatory cytokines by exercised-induced myokines. DATA SYNTHESIS: Experimental and clinical evidence was used to examine whether exercised-induced myokines can prime the immune system of the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The immune system changes with advancement in age which increases the likelihood of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in older adults. Several epidemiological studies have also shown that physical inactivity among geriatric population impacts negatively on the immune system. Evidences on the importance of exercise in priming the immune system of elderly individuals could be an effective therapeutic strategy in combating the virus as it may well be a case of “let those with the best immune system win”.","Tokunbo, Olorunfemi; Abayomi, Taiwo; Adekomi, Damilare; Oyeyipo, Ibukun",Afr Health Sci,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394297/,163

McGovern Compleat Physician Award, and recognize his achievements in race and ethnicity in healthcare. There have been significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease; however, racial disparities continue to create inequity in the medical community especially for African Americans. Dr. Williams founded the Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC) in 1974 to address the misperception about, and the misdiagnosis and maltreatment of African American patients. He emphasized the importance of diversity and the non-biased approach to the treatment of all communities. This literary review further explores current racial disparities African Americans face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Granted that Dr. Williams’ win is a step towards progress and change, there is much to be done to conquer the cultural divide in healthcare.","Bailey, Rahn K.; Saldana, Adrienne M.; Saldana, Andrea M.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00813-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32632825/,163

We hereby present the imprints of lockdown on water quality (both chemical and biological) parameters during the nationwide lockdown (COVID-19 epidemic) in India between 25th March to 30th May 2020. The present study describes the changes in chemical and biological water quality parameters based on twenty-two groundwater samples from the coastal industrial city of Tuticorin in Southern India, taken before (10 and 11th February 2020) and during the lockdown (19 and 20th April 2020) periods. The physico-chemical parameters compared are pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO(3)), fluoride (F), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and selenium (Se), and the bacterial parameters are total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal streptococci. Among the metals, the significant reductions in Se (42%), As (51%), Fe (60%) and Pb (50%) were noticed probably owing to no or very less wastewater discharges from metal-based industries, seafood-based industries and thermal power plants during the lockdown. Reduction in NO(3) (56%), total coliform (52%) and fecal coliforms (48%) indicated less organic sewage from the fishing industries. Contents of Cr, Cu, Zn and Cd, however, remained similar and fluoride did not show any change, probably as they were sourced from rock-water interactions. Similarly, we did not observe alterations in E. coli and fecal streptococci due to no significant change in domestic sewage production during the lockdown. The multivariate analyses aptly illustrated this and the principal component analyses helped to identify the sources that controlled water qualities of the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period. Our observation implies that groundwater is definitely under active interaction with surface waters and thus a quick revival could be observed following the seizing of anthropogenic activities.","Selvam, S.; Jesuraja, K.; Venkatramanan, S.; Chung, S.Y.; Roy, P.D.; Muthukumar, P.; Kumar, Manish",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720333684; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720333684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574914/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139848,163

The study was carried out between 01 May 2020 and 01 June 2020 by applying an online questionnaire to family physicians who worked in primary care in Istanbul and could be reached by telephone application. The survey created by us included socio-demographic information and the Job Strain Scale Short Form. P value was accepted as 0.05, and SPSS 20 package program was used in statistical analysis. 448 Family Physicians participated in the study. Anxiety levels of the participants increased after the pandemic (p < 0.001). Job strain score increased significantly during the pandemic process (p < 0.001). The ‘Workload’ sub-dimension of the job strain score was affected by young age, not having children, thinking that the working hours increased, deterioration of sleep quality and increasing anxiety level. It was determined that there was an increase in the “Control” sub-dimension score of family physicians who thought that they were not provided with adequate protective equipment during the pandemic process and who did not find the use of their own personal protective equipment sufficient. ‘Social support’ sub-dimension mean score decreased during the pandemic period. It was determined that it significantly increased in married family physicians compared to single ones. In the pandemic process, anxiety, sleep quality deterioration and job strain increased significantly. In family physicians, after the pandemic, workload and control sub-dimension changes increased, while social support sub-dimension decreased.","TAŞ, Beray Gelmez; Özceylan, Gökmen; Öztürk, Güzin Zeren; Toprak, Dilek",J Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188617/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00950-5,163

The test also targets a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab as an internal control. The samples containing both the N501Y and HV69-70del mutations are concluded as VOC-202012/01 positive. Samples suspected to be positive for B.1.351 or P.1 are the N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative cases. Limit of detection (LOD) of the kit for Orf1ab target is 500 copies/mL, while that of the N501, Y501 and HV69-70del targets are 5000 copies/mL. The developed assay was applied to 165 clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2 from 32 different lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were determined via the next-generation sequencing (NGS). The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the NGS results that 19 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del positive, 10 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 1 sample was N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, and 135 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. All the VOC-202012/01 positive samples were detected in people who have traveled from England to Turkey. The RT-qPCR test and the Sanger sequencing was further applied to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey. The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the Sanger sequencing results that 32 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 4 samples were N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, 964 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. The specificity of the 40 minutes RT-qPCR assay relative to the sequencing-based technologies is 100%. The developed assay is an advantageous tool for timely and representative estimation of the N501Y positive variants’ prevalence because it allows testing a much higher portion of the SARS-CoV-2 positives in much lower time compared to the sequencing-based technologies.","Korukluoglu, Gulay; Kolukirik, Mustafa; Bayrakdar, Fatma; Ozgumus, Gozde Girgin; Altas, Ayse Basak; Cosgun, Yasemin; Ketre Kolukirik, Canan Zohre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428302,163
676455,Bat research takes wing,2018-03-26,"The robust and consistent expression of the CD13 cell surface marker on very early as well as differentiated myeloid hematopoietic cells has prompted numerous investigations seeking to define roles for CD13 in myeloid cells. To address the function of myeloid CD13 directly, we created a CD13 null mouse and assessed the responses of purified primary macrophages or DCs from WT and CD13 null animals in cell assays and inflammatory disease models, where CD13 has been implicated previously. We find that mice lacking CD13 develop normally with normal hematopoietic profiles except for an increase in thymic but not peripheral T cell numbers. Moreover, in in vitro assays, CD13 appears to be largely dispensable for the aspects of phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen presentation that we tested, although we observed a slight decrease in actin-independent erythrocyte uptake. However, in agreement with our published studies, we show that lack of monocytic CD13 completely ablates anti-CD13-dependent monocyte adhesion to WT endothelial cells. In vivo assessment of four inflammatory disease models showed that lack of CD13 has little effect on disease onset or progression. Nominal alterations in gene expression levels between CD13 WT and null macrophages argue against compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, although CD13 is highly expressed on myeloid cells and is a reliable marker of the myeloid lineage of normal and leukemic cells, it is not a critical regulator of hematopoietic development, hemostasis, or myeloid cell function.","Winnicka, Beata; O'Conor, Catherine; Schacke, Wolfgang; Vernier, Kaitlyn; Grant, Christina L.; Fenteany, Fiona Hall; Pereira, Flavia E.; Liang, Brannen; Kaur, Anupinder; Zhao, Ran; Montrose, David C.; Rosenberg, Daniel W.; Aguila, Hector L.; Shapiro, Linda H.",Journal of Leukocyte Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20430777/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908940/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.0210065,163

There are theories that the oral cavity provides a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry and persistence which may be a risk for prolonged virus shedding. However, intraoral innate immune mechanisms provide antiviral effects against a myriad of pathogenic viruses. Initial hints of their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 are surfacing. It is hypothesized that intraoral immune system activity modulates the invasion pattern of SARS-CoV-2 into oral cells. Thus, the significance of intraoral tissues for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and persistence cannot be assessed. The underlying concept for this hypothesis was developed by the critical observation of a clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 patient. Despite a positive throat swab for SARS-CoV-2, molecular pathologic analysis of an oral perisulcular tissue specimen failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

This case described a patient who remained symptomatic several weeks after discharge from hospital with what was diagnosed as a COVID‐19 infection. There were significant deficits shown in his functional exercise testing, his pulmonary functions testing and there was evidence of fibrotic changes on his radiology. METHODS: As part of a multidisciplinary clinic, he was started on steroids and a tailored pulmonary rehabilitation course over a course of 6–8 weeks. Thereafter, his exercise testing, pulmonary function tests and radiology were all repeated to see progress. RESULTS: On completing the course of corticosteroids and concurrent personalised pulmonary rehabilitation, there was a dramatic improvement in the patient's symptom severity, radiology and pulmonary function. The most significant improvement noted was in his exercise testing, namely a 6‐min walk test and 1 min of sit‐to‐stands. Before treatment, he had a Medical Reserch Council (MRC) score of 2, and after it returned to his baseline of 0. DISCUSSION: Using corticosteroids and exercise training that allowed quantitative evaluation throughout the stages of recovery was a valuable tool to gauge progress and response to treatment. These therapies present opportunity to prevent the development of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis that could prove to be a major breakthrough in reducing long‐term morbidity and improving the quality of life of those affected.","Fanshawe, Jack; Howell, Jack; Omar, Adhnan; Piper, Megan; Simpson, Thomas",Physiother Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1002/pri.1903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713539/,163

This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded a panel of potent neutralizing antibodies which bind distinct viral epitopes including epitopes conserved in SARS-CoV-1. Structural determination of a non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody reveals a previously undescribed binding epitope, which is unlikely to be affected by the mutations in any of the recently reported major viral variants including B.1.1.7 (from the UK), B.1.351 (from South Africa) and B.1.1.28 (from Brazil).

METHODS: Using a community practice‐based rheumatologist network, we examined trends in in‐person vs. telehealth visits vs. canceled visits in three time periods: pre‐COVID19, COVID19‐Transition (6‐weeks beginning 3/23/20), and post‐COVID19‐Transition (May‐August). In the Transition period, we compared patients who received in‐person care vs. telehealth visits vs. cancelled all visits. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with canceled or telehealth visits. RESULTS: Pre‐COVID19, there were 7,075 visits/week among 60,002 unique rheumatology patients cared for by approximately 300 providers practicing in 92 offices. This decreased substantially (24.6% reduction) during COVID19‐Transition period for in‐person but rebounded to pre‐COVID19 levels during post‐COVID19 transition. There were almost no telehealth visits pre‐COVID19, but telehealth increased substantially during the COVID19‐Transition (41.4% of all follow‐up visits) and slightly decreased during post‐COVID19‐Transition (27.7% of visits). Older age, female sex, Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and rural residence were associated with greater likelihood of cancelling visits. Most factors were also associated with a lower likelihood of having telehealth vs. in‐office visits. Patients living further from the rheumatologists’ office were more likely to use telehealth. CONCLUSION: COVID19 led to large disruptions in rheumatology care; these disruptions were only partially offset by increases in telehealth use and disproportionately affected racial/ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. During the COVID‐19 era, telehealth continues to be an important part of rheumatology practice, but disparities in access to care exist for some vulnerable groups.","George, Michael; Danila, Maria I.; Watrous, Daniel; Reddy, Shanmugapriya; Alper, Jeffrey; Xie, Fenglong; Nowell, W.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. CONCLUSION: Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.","Tan, Si Heng Sharon; Hong, Choon Chiet; Saha, Soura; Murphy, Diarmuid; Hui, James Hoipo",Int Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445030/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04643-5,163
683320,Antimicrobials from Seaweeds for Food Applications,2021-04-11,"Interviews for the integrated plastic surgery residency match took place in a virtual format for the 2020–2021 application cycle. Current literature lacks the perspectives of program directors (PDs) on virtual interviews compared with traditional in-person interviews. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, an anonymous 17-question survey was distributed by email to 82 program directors of integrated plastic surgery residency programs in the United States. Participants were asked baseline program information, the number of positions and interview invites offered, and their perspectives on various aspects of the virtual interview process. RESULTS: Sixty-two (75.6%) PDs completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent reported increasing the number of interview offers per available residency spot. On a five-point Likert scale (1, not well at all; 5, extremely well), PDs showed no significant differences in their ability judge an applicant’s professionalism (3.1 ± 1.1), interpersonal and communication skills (3.2 ± 1.1), and “fit” with their program (2.9 ± 0.9) during virtual interviews (P = 0.360). Sixty-eight percent reported being satisfied (15.3% extremely satisfied, 52.5% somewhat satisfied) with the virtual interview process, though 76.3% preferred in-person interviews. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to provide insight into PDs’ impressions of virtual residency interviews. Although most reported being satisfied with the virtual interview process, the majority still preferred in-person interviews. Further long-term studies evaluating the pros and cons of each interview modality may provide more information on whether virtual interviews could become a sustainable alternative to the traditional in-person residency interview.","Sarac, Benjamin A.; Shen, Abra H.; Nassar, Amer H.; Maselli, Amy M.; Shiah, Eric; Lin, Samuel J.; Janis, Jeffrey E.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422524/; https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003707,163

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has be reported it to cause COVID-19, and highly transmissible. Therefore, it is important that it is rapidly and continuously detected and monitored on site so that the infection is prevented. Namely, POCT (point of care testing) may be important to control cross infection of SARS-CoV-2. At present, the routine confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 is based on detection of sequence unique in the virus RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as rRT-PCR. Taking POCT into account, it is clear that it takes time and labour very much or much. Thus, it was our purpose this time to contribute to develop POCT for microbes such as SARS-CoV-2, and thus needed to improve NAATs method. First, combining the mobile real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) device PCR1100 with the appropriate rRT-PCR reagent, we found that it is possible to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 for less 14 minutes with equivalent accuracy to conventional devices. Next, we found that the above method made it possible for us to detect coronaviruses by direct rRT-PCR without pre-treatments. Furthermore, it also made clear that coronaviruses in saliva could be detected by the similar direct rRT-PCR method. Hence, it was concluded that this method made it possible to detect virus in saliva without treating in advance (extraction, purification, concentration, etc.), and moreover, samples would be able to be collected with non-invasive. For this reason, we suggest that this method is useful for POCT of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2.","Muraoka, M.; Kawaguchi, O.; Mizukoshi, M.; Sejima, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.21256441; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.01.21256441v1?rss=1,163

However, Africa, which represents 17% of the world's population, is estimated to have only 5% of global cases (source: WHO on 2020/08/04). In this work, the authors try to identify and understand the reasons for these epidemiological data. Method: Some follow-up indicators have been carried out, mainly through WHO reports. These data were compared with the literature and the field expertise of the association ""Biologie sans frontières"" in Africa. Results: The following points mark the particularity of COVID-19 in Africa: (1) insufficient diagnostic capacity (linked to gross national product), (2) a younger population limiting the population at risk and the number of deaths, (3) a favourable climate (hot and humid) which is decreasing viral transmission, (4) some socio-cultural factors that can reduce cases reporting. Conclusion: Today, this health crisis is omnipresent while the number of deaths remains limited in Africa. Simultaneously, actions concerning African public health priorities (malaria, diarrhoea, AIDS...) are interrupted or slowed down.","Hardy, Émilie JL; Flori, Pierre",Ann Pharm Fr,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharma.2020.10.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003450920301279?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33091399/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003450920301279,163

In 14 (26%) of the dogs and 13 (39%) of the cats a causative agent was identified in the central nervous system (CNS), two dogs and one cat giving positive results for two infectious agents simultaneously. The study revealed infections with known causative agents (porcine herpes virus 1, feline infectious peritonitis virus, Escherichia coli) and a new disease pattern of parvovirus infection in the CNS of dogs and cats. Infection of the CNS with feline leukaemia virus was found in a cat. Five dogs and four cats gave positive results for West Nile virus (WNV) antigen. In one dog, canine parainfluenza virus antigen was detected in the brain. Four dogs and four cats gave positive results for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The significance of the detection of WNV and EMCV antigen requires further study. The aetiology remained undetermined in 39 dogs (74%) and 20 cats (61%).

Additionally, based on the behaviors of Japanese and US consumers through their import demands, it can be interpreted that neither of them is uncertainty-sensitive to each other’s products and they continue to buy these products even if both countries’ TPU indexes keep rising. Another expected empirical finding is that the COVID-19 pandemic worsens the trade balances of Japan for different industries shown in the tables.","Ongan, Serdar; Gocer, Ismet",Econ Change Restruct,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10644-021-09351-7,163

Effectively stimulating consumption has become a momentous mission in responding to the impact of the epidemic. The popularity of mobile shopping makes shopping behavior no longer limited by time and space, so impulse purchase is more commonly seen nowadays; it can effectively promote residents’ consumption. However, consensus has not been reached regarding how impulse purchase emerges as a phenomenon, thus making it difficult to promote consumers’ purchase behavior. This article aims to explore the generation process of consumers’ impulsive purchase intention during the COVID-19 outbreak from the perspective of system users. For this purpose, the research proposes three mobile situation factors: personalized recommendation, visual appeal, and system usability. They have a positive impact on impulse purchase intention by influencing perceived arousal and perceived enjoyment. The experimental method is used for data collection and hypothesis testing. All the hypotheses are supported. And the theoretical value of the model of “mobile environment stimulation-consumer emotion-impulse purchase intention” is confirmed. Based on the conclusion, management suggestions are proposed for mobile shopping merchants from the perspective of improving consumers’ shopping experience and expanding marketing.","Zhang, Wei; Leng, Xuemei; Liu, Siyu",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-020-01460-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952494/,163

Maintaining regular patients’ surveillance became a major challenge. Telemedicine has been promoted as an economic and effective way for long distance patient care. Our aim was to study patients’ acceptance and perspectives on telemedicine. METHODS: Patients scheduled for clinic appointments were offered telemedicine. Those who agreed were asked to fill in a questionnaire assessing their satisfaction with the medical consultation. Patients’ demographic characteristics and answers were collected and reviewed. RESULTS: Out of 358 patients approached 71 agreed to use telemedicine. Of them, 59 completed the questionnaire and were included in the study. All patients’ basic demographic data were collected. Patients’ included in the study mean age was: 43 ± 16.3 years, 35 (59.3%) women. Patients who chose not to use telemedicine were significantly older, mean age: 61 ± 15.2 years (p = 0.036), 134 (46.7%) women. Most patients included (38; 64.4%) had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most patients who chose not to use telemedicine were non-IBD patients (206, 72%). Fifty-one patients (86.4%) assessed their experience as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’. Satisfied patients had significantly less time under medical follow-up (3.7 versus 6.1 years, p = 0.028) and tended to be younger (p = non-significant). Women were statistically significantly more satisfied than men (33 versus 18, p = 0.05). Advantages reported were ‘time saving’ (31.3%), accessibility (26.1%), availability (25%). The main disadvantage was absence of physical examination (70%). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine gained a high satisfaction rate among patients under regular medical surveillance. Most patients stated this that method is convenient, time saving and increases their compliance. Patients who agreed to telecare were younger, and tended to be of female gender and experiencing IBD. Further studies are needed to characterize specific barriers to telecare usage.","Lahat, Adi; Shatz, Zina",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1177/1756284821989178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633797/,163

Qu’il s’agisse de questionnements autour de la formation des médecins, des questions d’interdisciplinarité, de la pratique de la médecine légale ou du cheminement des malades dans les services de spécialités médicales, comment élaborer autour d’un sujet d’étude qui est le même, le soin aux malades, mais qui revêt des réalités bien différentes. Le corps objectivable du patient que traite, découpe, soigne le médecin n’a en effet pas grand-chose à voir avec la subjectivité du patient à laquelle s’intéresse le/la psychologue. Le médecin, et les soignants de manière plus générale, doivent impérativement, pour endurer ce que leur travail nécessite d’actes intrusifs et parfois agressifs, se défendre psychiquement via des stratégies parfois massives qui font obstacle au travail de démêlage et de compréhension des psychologues. Alors comment est-il possible de construire (déconstruire ?) une élaboration commune ? Comment envisager le travail pluridisciplinaire de sorte qu’il permette l’interdisciplinarité et un travail « avec » bien préférable à un travail « côte à côte » ? Abstract “Doing” research in psychology in the medical field represents a true challenge for the psychologists and clinicians who practice in somatic services. Whether it deals with issues about doctors’ training, interdisciplinarity, forensic medicine, or about the progress of ill patients in specialty services, the object of study is fundamentally the same: care, even if it is composed of different realities. The body that the doctor treats, cuts, or heals has, indeed, barely anything in common with the patient subjectivity that interests the psychologist. The doctor and the nursing staff in general must, in order to bear the intrusive and sometimes aggressive acts that their work requires, defend themselves mentally, via sometimes massive strategies that stand in the way of psychologists’ work of untangling and comprehending psychic and emotional phenomena. How, then, is it possible to build (deconstruct?) a common elaboration? How can we consider multidisciplinary work so that it allows for interdisciplinarity and for a form of work “with” that is vastly preferable to a “side-by-side” work?","Peyrat-Apicella, D.; Molinier, P.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542360620300524; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542360620300524,163
