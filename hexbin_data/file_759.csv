Overweight and obesity reduce both physical and mental health. Lifestyle interventions could have beneficial effects on both, but an overview of the effects on mental health, especially in women of reproductive age, is currently lacking. Therefore, the aim of this review was to assess the effect of lifestyle interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety in women of reproductive age with overweight or obesity. The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched from inception to June 2018 for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included lifestyle intervention RCTs in women of reproductive age with overweight or obesity that assessed effects on symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. The difference between baseline and post-intervention scores on symptoms of depression and anxiety for the intervention and control group was analysed. Meta-analysis was performed with a random effects model. The search resulted in 5,316 citations, and after screening five RCTs were included, in which 571 women were randomized. The effect of lifestyle interventions on depression scores was investigated among 224 women from five RCTs. The pooled estimate for the mean difference was -1.35 (95% CI, -2.36 to -0.35, p = 0.008). The effect of lifestyle interventions on anxiety levels was studied among 148 women from four RCTs, resulting in a pooled estimate of -1.74 (-2.62 to -0.87, p < 0.001). Based on five RCTs, meta-analyses showed that lifestyle interventions in women of reproductive age with overweight or obesity consistently reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.","van Dammen, L; Wekker, V; de Rooij, S R; Groen, H; Hoek, A; Roseboom, T J",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,759,16

In recent years, novel astroviruses have been identified in other mammalian species like roe deer, bats and sea lions. While the bovine astrovirus was one of the earliest astroviruses to have been studied, no further research has been performed recently and its genome sequence remains uncharacterized. In this report, we describe the detection and genomic characterization of astroviruses in bovine faecal specimens obtained in Hong Kong. Five of 209 specimens were found to be positive for astrovirus by RT-PCR. Two of the positive specimens were found to contain sequences from two different astrovirus strains. Complete genome sequences of approximately 6.3 kb in length were obtained for four strains, which showed similar organization of the genome compared to other astroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed their identities as members of the genus Mamastrovirus, and showed them to be most closely related to the Capreolus capreolus astrovirus. Based on the pairwise genetic distances among their full-length ORF2 sequences, these bovine astroviruses may be assigned into at least three different genotype species. Sequence analysis revealed evidence of potential recombination in ORF2. In summary, we report the first genome sequences of bovine astroviruses and clearly establish the species status of the virus. Additionally, our study is among the first to report co-infection by different astrovirus genotypes in the same host, which is an essential step for recombination to occur.","Tse, Herman; Chan, Wan-Mui; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Lau, Candy C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,759,31

METHODS Literature review. RESULTS Studies of aspirated middle-ear fluid represented a minor component of the literature reviewed. Most studies relied upon specimens from middle-ear discharge or the nasopharynx. Culture-based middle-ear discharge studies have found that non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominate, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated in a lower proportion of samples. Alloiococcus otitidis was detected in a number of studies; however, its role in otitis media pathogenesis remains controversial. Nasopharyngeal colonisation is a risk factor for otitis media in Indigenous infants, and bacterial load of otopathogens in the nasopharynx can predict the ear state of Indigenous children. CONCLUSION Most studies have used culture-based methods and specimens from middle-ear discharge or the nasopharynx. Findings from these studies are consistent with international literature, but reliance on culture may incorrectly characterise the microbiology of this condition. Advances in genomic technologies are now providing microbiologists with the ability to analyse the entire mixed bacterial communities ('microbiomes') of samples obtained from Indigenous children with otitis media.","Jervis-Bardy, J; Carney, A S; Duguid, R; Leach, A J",The Journal of laryngology and otology,759,20

CHCs have become an integral part of healthcare systems in many countries; however, the term CHC is used synonymously with other concepts and there is no clear definition for CHC. The purpose of our concept analysis was to determine how CHCs are described in the literature and to develop a concept definition for CHC. Methods: Informed by the 8-step process described by Walker and Avant, we searched for literature spanning disciplines within health, business, and policy. We used a systematic review process to identify a range of peer-reviewed articles that help illustrate the attributes, antecedents, and consequences of CHCs. A total of 102 articles from 7 databases were included in our concept analysis. Results: We distinguished 6 attributes of a CHC: primary care; accessibility; preventative care; defined population; health promotion; and comprehensive and integrated care. About 4 antecedents fundamental to a CHC included: secure funding; vision and support; adequate human resources; and governance structure. Consequences of CHCs are improved health outcomes, efficiency, and cost-effective provision of healthcare services. Conclusions: Our concept analysis revealed core characteristics of CHCs that assisted us in synthesizing a concept definition for CHC. These characteristics and our proposed definition will help provide clarity on the concept of CHC to benefit evaluation, research, and policy development of CHCs.","Nagel, Daniel A; Keeping-Burke, Lisa; Shamputa, Isdore Chola",Journal of primary care & community health,759,16

Women undergoing gasless LESS hysterectomy with a different technique were evaluated. A total of 14 LESS hysterectomies were performed using this gasless technique and rigid laparoscopic instruments by one surgeon. The mean age of the patients was 48.6 (±4.6). The average blood loss was 80 ± 35 ml. The average time between an umbilical incision and starting hysterectomy was 5 (±2,1) min. The time between starting hysterectomy and umbilical incision closure was 120 (±24) min in the laparoscopic suture group and 88 (±16) min in the vaginal suture group. The mean uterus weight was 188 (±95) g. In conclusion, this different technique is feasible and low cost, especially in non-obese patients. But further studies with large participants are needed to elucidate the safety. Impact statement Conventional CO2 pneumoperitoneum has many adverse effects on cardiopulmonary function, haemodynamic, metabolic and neurologic systems due to high-intraperitoneal pressure. The usage of gasless technique eliminates these adverse effects and postoperative shoulder pain. The satisfaction of patients is higher in laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) hysterectomy due to improved cosmesis and reduced postoperative analgesic requirements. In the literature, there are a few studies showing techniques combining LESS and gasless laparoscopy for hysterectomy. In this study, a different approach for creating operational space in gasless laparoscopy is described. Creation of intraabdominal operational space is convenient and takes a short time in this technique. The average time between an umbilical incision and starting a hysterectomy is five minutes. Additional training is not needed for experienced surgeons in LESS. Also, cost-effectiveness is one of important advantages. It is quite safe, no possibility of vascular injury, including inferior epigastric or superficial epigastric vessels. Also suturing the vaginal cuff and knot tying is easier in this technique. This technique can be used safely in patients with poor cardiopulmonary reserve. Also, by means of its cost effectiveness, it can be preferred in developing countries. As a result, it may be a good alternative to conventional LESS hysterectomy.","Demirayak, Gökhan",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,759,1
84855,84855,84855,Human metapneumovirus in Southern Brazil.,18.929699,-1.41652,2018,"OBJECTIVES Systematic reviews are often considered among the highest quality of evidence. Completely reported systematic reviews, however, are required so readers can assess for generalisability of the research to practice and risk of bias. The objective of this study was to assess the completeness of reporting for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist that was published in 2018. DESIGN AND SETTING In this meta-research study, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched, with no date restriction, on March 1st, 2020 for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS. Adherence to PRISMA-DTA for the main text and abstract was scored independently and in duplicate using a modified checklist. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the mean PRISMA-DTA checklist adherence for the full-text and abstract. RESULTS A total of 71 studies published from 2008 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria. The overall adherence for the full-text was moderate: 19.8 out of 26.0 items (76%) and for the abstract was 7.0 out of 11.0 items (64%). Although many items in the PRISMA-DTA checklist were frequently reported, several were r infrequently reported (<33% of studies), including item 5 (protocol registration), item D2 (minimally acceptable test accuracy) and item 14 (variability in target condition, index test and reference standards). Subgroup analyses showed a higher PRISMA-DTA mean adherence (SD) for high impact journals (20.9 (2.52) vs 18.9 (1.95); p<0.001), studies including supplemental materials (20.6 (2.48) vs 18.9 (2.28); p=0.004), studies citing adherence to PRISMA reporting guidelines (20.4 (1.95) vs 19.0 (3.00); p=0.038) and studies published in journals endorsing PRISMA guidelines (20.2 (2.47) vs 18.6 (2.37); p=0.025). There was variable adherence based on journal of publication (p=0.006), but not for study population (adult vs paediatric vs mixed) (p=0.62), year of publication (p=0.94), body region (p=0.78) or country (p=0.40). There was no variability in abstract adherence based on whether the abstract was structured with subheadings or not (p=0.25). A Spearman's correlation found moderate correlation between higher word counts and abstractand full-text adherence (R=0.45, p<0.001 and R=0.38, p=0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the reporting of POCUS diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews and meta-analyses was moderate. We identified deficits in several key areas including the preregistration of systematic reviews in an online repository, handling of multiple definitions of target conditions, index tests and reference standards and specifying minimally acceptable test accuracy. Prospective registration of reviews and detailed reporting as per PRISMA-DTA during the research process could improve reporting completeness. At an editorial level, word count and supplemental material limitations may impede reporting completeness, whereas endorsement of reporting guidelines on journal websites could improve reporting.","Prager, Ross; Pratte, Michael; Guy, Andrew; Bala, Sudarshan; Bachar, Roudi; Kim, Daniel J; Millington, Scott; Salameh, Jean-Paul; McGrath, Trevor A; McInnes, Matthew Df",BMJ evidence-based medicine,759,1

Our imperfect ability to detect and report disease hinders assessment of trends, but we suggest that, although endemic diseases continue their historic decline in wealthy countries, poor countries experience static or deteriorating animal health and epidemic diseases show both regression and expansion. At a mesolevel, disease is changing in terms of space and host, which is illustrated by bluetongue, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus, and it is also emerging, as illustrated by highly pathogenic avian influenza and others. Major proximate drivers of change in disease dynamics include ecosystem change, ecosystem incursion, and movements of people and animals; underlying these are demographic change and an increasing demand for livestock products. We identify three trajectories of global disease dynamics: (i) the worried well in developed countries (demanding less risk while broadening the circle of moral concern), (ii) the intensifying and market-orientated systems of many developing countries, where highly complex disease patterns create hot spots for disease shifts, and (iii) the neglected cold spots in poor countries, where rapid change in disease dynamics is less likely but smallholders and pastoralists continue to struggle with largely preventable and curable livestock diseases.","Perry, Brian D; Grace, Delia; Sones, Keith",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,759,19

We reviewed the changes in our management protocol for these lesions as our disease understanding and preparedness evolved. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective observational study including patients with sellar-suprasellar and clival lesions presenting to us between March and October 2020. Management protocols were divided into three phases based on the prevalence of the disease and the number of mandatory preoperative COVID-19 tests being conducted. The surgical approach used was analyzed in relation to the preferred approach during pre-COVID times, and surgical outcomes and complications were noted. RESULTS A total of 31 cases were operated during this period. During Phase I (low prevalence; no preoperative COVID testing) endonasal surgeries were largely abandoned in favor of transcranial approaches. In Phase II (medium prevalence; one preoperative COVID test) we gradually resumed endonasal surgeries for 'emergent' and 'essential' cases, and subsequently in Phase III (high prevalence; two preoperative COVID tests), we had no hesitation in performing 'elective' endonasal surgeries with additional barriers for prevention of aerosol transmission. No patient developed COVID-19 infection postoperatively. Eight HCWs in our department acquired the disease during this period, none of whom were directly involved in the surgeries for the above cohort of patients. CONCLUSIONS With a strict preoperative COVID testing protocol, adherence to proper drilling techniques and using additional barriers to prevent droplet and aerosol spread, endonasal surgeries for sellar-suprasellar lesions are safe during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Gupta, Ankush; Goyal-Honavar, Abhijit; Jonathan, Gandham Edmond; Prabhu, Krishna; Varghese, George M; Rupali, Priscilla; Chacko, Ari George",British journal of neurosurgery,759,16

This included patients with arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Many of those patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme 1 inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). SARS-CoV2- utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a membrane receptor to enter target cells [2]. Due to different chemical structures with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. ACEIs and ARBs may increase the amount of ACE-2 formation and, theoretically, increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, thus inducing inflammation [2]. The fear that ACEI or ARB might facilitate COVID-19 infections and increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection emerged [3]. The question is all the more delicate as arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are very common in the general population, especially in the elderly, for which ACEIs/ARBs are prescribed in 25-30% of cases [4]. In response, many scientific organizations and journals issued statements cautioning against discontinuation of these agents due to the lack of evidence of harm, and because discontinuation would predictably lead to uncontrolled blood pressure with its own cardiovascular disease risks. Moreover, direct evidence from COVID-19-infected patients, taking or not taking these agents, and on which reliable recommendations could be based, was not yet available.","Alexandre, Joachim; Cracowski, Jean-Luc",Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,759,33

METHODS Four hundred and fifty-nine subjects were included, 256 (Group 'P') were known cases of COVID-19 (PCR positive, some with and some without symptoms) and 203 (Group 'C') were PCR negative and asymptomatic (control). Samples were obtained from the axillary sweat of each subject in a masked fashion. Two dogs trained to detect specific Volatile Organic Compounds for COVID-19 detection were used to test each sample.

The aim of this study was to compare the inflammatory effects of NOTES and laparoscopy. METHODS Forty female pigs were assigned to transgastric, transrectal, and transvaginal NOTES and laparoscopic peritoneoscopy groups. Antiseptic technique was utilized for NOTES whereas laparoscopy was performed sterile. Intraperitoneal pressures were monitored and maintained below 15 mmH(2)O. Pneumoperitoneum was maintained with CO(2) in all groups. Pre- and postoperative blood samples of IL-6, Il-1β, and TNFα, and peritoneal fluid collected at surgery were analyzed. Animals were followed daily for 14 days. At necropsy, peritoneal fluid was collected for cytokine analysis. RESULTS Thirty-nine peritoneoscopies were successfully completed. The median procedure time was longer in the NOTES groups (57 min, range = 33-109) than in the laparoscopy group (33 min, range 32-36; P < 0.001); this was related to longer incision time and closure time. All 39 completed follow-up. Severe bleeding in the post-transrectal approach required early sacrifice of the remaining animal. Besides this, complications were similar among groups. At necropsy, adhesions were seen in four animals in the gastric group, five in the rectal group, two in the vaginal group, and two in the laparoscopic group (P = ns). There were no statistical differences in serum levels of TNFα among the groups. When serum TNFα values were expressed as the difference from the baseline, in the transvaginal group they were significantly lower than in the transrectal at 2 h [0.5 pg/ml (range = -14 to 59) vs. 60 pg/ml (range = -8 to 303); P = 0.041] and at 8 h [-5.5 pg/ml (range = -86 to 55] vs. 37 pg/ml (range = -30 to 62); P = 0.031]. The limitations of this study were that the analyses of IL-6 and Il-1β were not possible because most of the samples were below detectable levels, it was an animal model, and the sample size was small. CONCLUSION Inflammatory parameters are similar between NOTES and laparoscopic peritoneoscopy despite longer surgery time in the NOTES group. The vaginal route seems to reduce the inflammatory stress.","Guarner-Argente, Carlos; Martínez-Pallí, Graciela; Navarro-Ripoll, Ricard; Córdova, Henry; Beltrán, Mireia; Martínez-Zamora, M Angels; Comas, Jaume; de Miguel, Cristina Rodríguez; Rodríguez-D'Jesús, Antonio; Filella, Xavier; Hernández-Cera, Clara; Lacy, Antonio M; Thompson, Christopher C; Fernández-Esparrach, Gloria",Surgical endoscopy,759,1

Median age was 34 (31-66) years and mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 47.6±3.0 kg/m2. Median operative time was 90 (66-141) minutes, with a median length of stay of 7 (4-16) days. There were no perioperative deaths. One patient suffered a spontaneous flank hematoma. The same patient also had thrombosis of the LVAD pump at 3 weeks postoperatively, requiring an uneventful device exchange. At median follow-up of 22 (12-70) months, the mean %EWL was 51.4±10.3% with a decrease in BMI to 34.3±2.4 kg/m2 (P<.05). All patients had lost sufficient weight to become transplant eligible within 12 months of surgery. Two patients had undergone successful transplantation and another 2 were on the transplant list. CONCLUSION LSG appears to be a safe, technically feasible, and effective method for obtaining adequate weight loss in morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart failure and mechanical circulatory support, subsequently improving their access to cardiac transplantation. This is the largest case series to date of this high-risk group of patients undergoing LSG.","Chaudhry, Umer I; Kanji, Aliyah; Sai-Sudhakar, Chittoor B; Higgins, Robert S; Needleman, Bradley J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,759,5

These patients have weak abdominal musculature and are likely to pose a higher risk of recurrence following umbilical hernia repair. We would like to describe a technique for open repair of small (<4 cm) midline hernias in patients with co-existing rectus divarication using self-adhesive synthetic mesh. The use of a self-adhesive mesh avoids the need for suture fixation of the mesh in the superior portion of the abdomen, allowing for a smaller skin incision. RESULTS In 173 patients, preperitoneal self-fixating mesh has been used for the repair of midline hernias <4 cm in diameter. In 58 of these patients, the mesh was extended superiorly to reinforce a concurrent divarication. DISCUSSION The described technique offers a simple option for open repair of small midline hernias in patients with co-existing rectus divarication, to decrease the risk of upper midline recurrence in an at-risk patient group. This initial case series is able to demonstrate a suitably low rate of recurrence and complications.","Privett, B J; Ghusn, M",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,759,1

Point-of-care ultrasound is without patient or staff exposure to ionizing radiation and enlists no additional staffing resources or patient transfer. METHODS We conducted a chart review of all children who underwent reduction of a distal forearm fracture in the pediatric emergency department over a 2-year period, from September 2018 to September 2020. We compared length of stay (LOS) with that for orthopedist-performed distal forearm reductions during the study period. We allowed a 6-week lag period to ensure no missed rereduction before analyzing the data. After reduction, children were instructed to follow up with an orthopedist within 1 week. Children with loss of reduction on orthopedic follow-up are referred back through our emergency department for operative reduction. RESULTS A total of 74 children with 75 distal forearm fractures were identified. Average LOS was 179 minutes for the pediatric emergency medicine physician reductions and 215 minutes for the orthopedist reductions (P < 0.001). Ninety-six percent of reductions were completed with POCUS assistance, and 61% had less than 5 degrees of angulation on postreduction radiography. Only 2.7% of children underwent rereduction. CONCLUSIONS Distal forearm fracture reductions by a pediatric emergency medicine physician under POCUS guidance have a high rate of excellent alignment, low rate of failed reduction, and significantly shorter LOS (P < 0.001) than reductions performed by orthopedists.","Scheier, Eric; Balla, Uri",Pediatric emergency care,759,26

In addition to the antimicrobial effects of IFNs, these cytokines have been used clinically for the treatment of various neoplasias to inhibit proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms of action of IFNs remain to be completely understood. One of the primary response genes induced after an infection or treatment with type I or III IFN is known as IFN-stimulated gene 54 (ISG54) or IFN-induced gene with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2). ISG54/IFIT2 is a member of a family of IFN-induced genes related in the sequence and structure. Expression of this protein has been found to promote cellular apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway dependent on the action of Bcl2 proteins. ISG54/IFIT2 does not function as a monomer, and it forms complexes with itself and with the related ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG60/IFIT3 proteins to elicit complex cellular responses. The apoptotic response to ISG54/IFIT2 may contribute to other functions that have been reported, including translational regulation, inhibition of tumor colonization, and protection against a lethal viral infection.","Reich, Nancy C",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,759,16

This study provides a definition for IH, a diagnosing algorithm, and information on several factors influencing IH formation. METHOD Baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging studies, operative findings, and follow up data of 1583 patients that underwent LRYGB at our bariatric facility between 2007 and 2013 were recorded. Follow up varied between 3 and 76 months, and 85 % of the data was available for analysis at 12 months. Our surgical technique was standardized. Intermesenteric spaces were not closed until July 2012, where after they were closed. To facilitate comparison, IH cases were matched with controls. RESULTS Forty patients (2.5 %) had an IH during re-laparoscopy. The modal clinical presentation is acute onset epigastric discomfort, often crampy/colicky in nature. Additional examinations included laboratory testing, abdominal X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal CT scanning. Patients who developed an IH lost a significantly higher percentage of their total body weight than their matched controls at every time point. IH incidence was higher in the non-closure group than the closure group. CONCLUSION The large variation in reported IH incidence is due to the large variation in IH definition. To gain more uniformity in reporting IH prevalence, we propose the use of the AMSTERDAM classification. Post-LRYGB patients with acute onset crampy/colicky epigastric pain should undergo abdominal ultrasound to rule out gallbladder pathology and offered re-laparoscopy with a low threshold. IH incidence is highest among patients with rapid weight loss and non-closure of intermesenteric defects.","Geubbels, Noëlle; Röell, Eveline A; Acherman, Yair I Z; Bruin, Sjoerd C; van de Laar, Arnold W J M; de Brauw, L Maurits",Obesity surgery,759,12

The findings of this study confirmed that PL and PC have a positive relationship with LS. Furthermore, WFC partially mediated the relationships among PL, PC, and LS. In addition, FWC partially mediated the relationship between PL and LS; the role of FWC in mediating the relationship between PC and LS has been found to be insignificant. Employees with high PC and those whose supervisors show PL behavior become more satisfied with their lives and have relatively low WFC and FWC.

Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and there are many different dressing options including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of the current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use for the treatment of pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of hydrogel dressings on the healing of pressure ulcers in any care setting. SEARCH METHODS We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 19 June 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June Week 2 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 23 June 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 20 June 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2014). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of hydrogel dressings with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (stage II or above). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included eleven studies (523 participants) in this review. Ten studies had two arms and one had three arms that were all relevant to this review. Three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with a basic wound contact dressing; three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with a hydrocolloid dressing; three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with another hydrogel dressing; one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a foam dressing; one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a dextranomer paste dressing and one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a topical treatment (collagenase). Limited data were available for analyses in this review: we conducted no meta-analyses. Where data were available there was no evidence of a difference between hydrogel and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. One small study reported that using hydrogel dressings was, on average, less costly than hydrocolloid dressings, but this estimate was imprecise and its methodology was not clear. All included studies were small, had short follow-up times and were at unclear risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It is not clear if hydrogel dressings are more or less effective than other treatments in healing pressure ulcers or if different hydrogels have different effects, Most trials in this field are very small and poorly reported so that risk of bias is unclear.","Dumville, Jo C; Stubbs, Nikki; Keogh, Samantha J; Walker, Rachel M; Liu, Zhenmi",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,759,1

Preliminary comparisons with seasonal influenza suggest that pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) disproportionately affects younger ages and causes generally mild disease. To characterize disease progress, comorbidities, and treatment outcomes among consecutive severe and critically ill patients in a hospital served as a reference center for the care of patients with H1N1 in Shanghai, China. METHODS A retrospective study on 62 severe and critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) was conducted in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbidities, disease progression, treatments, and clinical outcomes were collected for analysis. RESULTS Sixty-two severe or critically ill patients were admitted to the hospital with confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection. The median age of the study cohort was 40 years old with a range from 18 years to 75 years, and 67.7% were males. All patients presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. At presentation, 34 patients (54.8%) had comorbidities such as smoking (29.0%), hypertension (29.0%) and hepatitis B virus infection (9.7%). The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (interquartile-range 3 - 14 days) and 23 critically ill patients were admitted to Intensive Care Unit after admission. All the patients received neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltaminir), while 60 patients (96.7%) were treated with antibiotics, and 39 (62.9%) with corticosteroids. Twenty-three critical cases received noninvasive mechanical ventilation on the first day of admission, and 3 of them ultimately required invasive ventilation. Four death reports (6.5%) were filed within the first 14 days from the onset of critical illness with the primary causes of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxemia, or complications, secondary infection and sepsis, pyopneumothorax and stroke. CONCLUSIONS Severe illness from 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in Shanghai occurred among young individuals. Critical cases were associated with severe hypoxemia, multisystem organ failure, and a requirement for mechanical ventilation.

Real-world networks typically exhibit complex topologies whose structural properties are key factors in characterizing and further exploring the networks themselves. Uncertainty, modelling procedures and measurement difficulties raise often insurmountable challenges in fully characterizing most of the known real-world networks; hence, the necessity to predict their unknown elements from the limited data currently available in order to estimate possible future relations and/or to unveil unmeasurable relations. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to this problem based on Graph Convolutional Networks for predicting networks while preserving their original structural properties. The study reveals that this method can preserve scale-free and small-world properties of complex networks when predicting their unknown parts, a feature lacked by the up-to-date conventional methods. An external validation realized by testing the approach on biological networks confirms the results, initially obtained on artificial data. Moreover, this process provides new insights into the retainability of network structure properties in network prediction. We anticipate that our work could inspire similar approaches in other research fields as well, where unknown mechanisms behind complex systems need to be revealed by combining machine-based and experiment-based methods.","Tanaka, Yoshihisa; Kojima, Ryosuke; Ishida, Shoichi; Yamashita, Fumiyoshi; Okuno, Yasushi",,759,1

A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. We demonstrate biochemically that NSP1 inhibits translation of model human and SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNAs (mRNAs). NSP1 specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1-40S subunit binding in real time, we determine that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) allosterically modulate the interaction of NSP1 with ribosomal preinitiation complexes in the absence of mRNA. We further elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA.

We describe the implementation of a virtual, one-to-one training programme aimed at the acquisition and retention of operative skills. Methods: Enrolment commenced 8th May 2020 for wound closure techniques or an extended programme including tendon repairs, delivered by Specialist Registrars in Plastic Surgery using ZoomVR (v. 5.0.5) via mobile device. Participant feedback was collected retrospectively using a 5-point scale following course completion. Results: 5 participants completed the wound closure programme, and 3 the extended programme, over an average of 5 weeks, with 2 sessions per week. 5 participants were male, 3 female and were of the following grades: 2 CT2, 4 FY2, 1 FY1 and 1 medical student. A total of 103.5 hours of training was recorded to 7 September 2020. Participants reported that all virtual skills taught were readily transferable to the theatre environment. Following the course, all participants felt confident to complete the skills learnt independently, rating the course as excellent. Conclusions: The COVID-19 crisis has placed insurmountable obstacles in the face of surgical training. With further validation, we aim to develop surgical skills training with virtual, easily reproducible, cost-effective, trainee centred programmes.","Asher, C.; Ibrahim, I.; Katsarma, E.",British Journal of Surgery,759,15

We must minimize face-to-face contact with vulnerable populations. But we must also persist, adapt, and help our older patients and study participants during the pandemic. METHODS: Clinical researchers have an obligation to help, and we can. Recommendations for clinical researchers working with older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. RESULTS: Implement technology now: Minimize face-to-face contact with participants by utilizing digital tools, such as shifting to electronic informed consent and digital HIPAA-compliant tools such as e-mailed surveys or telehealth assessments. Assess the psychological and social impact of COVID-19: How are participants coping? What health or social behaviors have changed? How are they keeping up with current events? What are they doing to stay connected to their families, friends, and communities? Are their healthcare needs being met? Current studies should be adapted immediately to these ends. Mobilize research platforms for patient needs: Leverage our relationships with participants and rapidly deploy novel clinical engagement techniques such as digital tools to intervene remotely and reduce the negative effects of social isolation on our participants. Equip research staff with tangible resources, and provide timely population-specific health information to support patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: We have an opportunity to make an impact on our older adult patients now as this pandemic continues to unfold.

The results demonstrated that, whereas the comparison group demonstrated no statistically significant changes in power, muscular strength and endurance, or cardiopulmonary endurance, the experimental group showed changes in all these variables, along with changes in flexibility. Further, the MB program had significant educational effects. First, students reported that musical cues enhanced their fitness motivation and sense of responsibility. Second, record-keeping and active participation contributed to self-led fitness management. Third, activity in a small space with few pieces of equipment led to the positive perception that the program was efficient and enabled regular exercise regardless of climate conditions.","Jeong, Hyun-Chul; Lee, Eui-Jae; Youn, Hyun-Su; So, Wi-Young",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),759,16

As a result, there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact of governmental interventions and public perception are incorporated as part of the nonlinear time-varying transmission rate. In addition, an algorithm for approximating the optimal values of the fractional order and strength of governmental interventions is provided. This approach makes our model suitable for capturing the given data set and consequently reliable for future predictions. The model simulation is performed using the two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data from Mainland China, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. The simulation results demonstrate that the fractional order model calibrates to the data better than its integer order counterpart.

To ensure that virtually all non-Covid-related services do not come to a halt again, health care systems and physician practices must preemptively increase their capacity, secure adequate personal protective equipment to safeguard health care personnel, and develop a measured approach to reclosing such routine health care, should it become necessary in the future.","Bruno, Bethany; Rose, Susannah",Hast.

We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France). METHODS: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13, 2020, for all breast cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history, tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features, and outcome. Data extraction was done on April 25, 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT scan abnormalities. RESULTS: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4 months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed. Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N = 41) or typical radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59 (22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized, and 6 (10%) were transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed, and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (> 70) were the two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in breast cancer patients.","Vuagnat, Perrine; Frelaut, Maxime; Ramtohul, Toulsie; Basse, Clémence; Diakite, Sarah; Noret, Aurélien; Bellesoeur, Audrey; Servois, Vincent; Hequet, Delphine; Laas, Enora; Kirova, Youlia; Cabel, Luc; Pierga, Jean-Yves; Bozec, Laurence; Paoletti, Xavier; Cottu, Paul; Bidard, François-Clément",Breast Cancer Res,759,13

OBJECTIVES: we aimed to assess the impact of the FLT on the communication with patients' family and friends (PFF), especailly around end-of-life care, and their interaction with CC clinicians. METHODS: A retrospective, mixed-methods analysis of a family liaison team (FLT) formed by redeployed clinicians in critical care (CC) during the first surge of the 2020 COVID 19 pandemic. RESULTS: The FLT was constituted predominantly of non-ICU consultants (30/39, 77%). Following two one-hourly webinars around basic communication skills, the FLT facilitated over 12,000 video and telephone calls with 172 patients' family and friends (PFF). The majority of the PFF interviewed were mostly, very or extremely satisfied with the frequency, ease, understanding, honesty, completeness, and consistency of the information provided. Approximately 5% of the interviewees reported to be slightly or very dissatisfied in one or more of the following 3 categories: frequency, consistency, and ease of getting the information. The thematic analysis identified 3 themes: 1) being there with/ for the patient; 2) breakdown in communication; 3) disbelief at the speed of deterioration. In 14.9% of cases there was documented discrepancy between the information transmitted by the CC team and that by the FLT, particularly around the severity of the patient's illness and their imminent death. CONCLUSION: The formation of a dedicated FLT was feasible and associated with high levels of satisfaction by the PFF. Friction was created when communication was not consistent and did not convey the severity of the patient's condition, to prepare the PFF for a bad outcome.","Lopez-Soto, Carmen; Bates, Eleanor; Anderson, Charlotte; Saha, Sian; Adams, Laura; Aulakh, Alex; Bowtell, Francesca; Buckel, Marie; Emms, Thomas; Shebl, Moustafa; Metaxa, Victoria",J. pain symptom manage,759,29

In this meta-analysis, we studied the prevalence of cancer among patients with COVID-19 infection and their risks of severe events. Methods We searched the Pubmed, Embase and MedRxiv databases for studies between December 2019 and May 3, 2020 using the following key words and terms: sars-cov-2, covid-19, 2019-ncov, 2019 novel coronavirus, corona virus disease-2019, clinical, clinical characteristics, clinical course, epidemiologic features, epidemiology, and epidemiological characteristics. We extracted data following PICO (patient, intervention, comparison and outcome) chart. Statistical analyses were performed with R Studio (version 3.5.1) on the group-level data. We assessed the studies risk of bias in accordance to the adjusted Joanna Briggs Institute. We estimated the prevalence or risks for severe events including admission into intensive care unit or death using meta-analysis with random effects. Findings Out of the 2,551 studies identified, 32 studies comprising 21,248 participants have confirmed COVID-19. The total prevalence of cancer in COVID-19 patients was 3.97% (95% CI, 3.08% to 5.12%), higher than that of the total cancer rate (0.29%) in China. Stratification analysis showed that the overall cancer prevalence of COVID-19 patients in China was 2.59% (95% CI, 1.72% to 3.90%), and the prevalence reached 3.79% in Wuhan (95% CI, 2.51% to 5.70%) and 2.31% (95% CI, 1.16% to 4.57%) in other areas outside Wuhan in China. The incidence of ICU admission in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 26.80% (95% CI, 21.65% to 32.67%) and the mortality was 24.32% (95% CI, 13.95% to 38.91%), much higher than the overall rates of COVID-19 patients in China. The fatality in COVID patients with cancer was lower than those with cardiovascular disease (OR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.71; p=0.39), but comparable with other comorbidities such as diabetes (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 0.42 to 4.11; p=0.19), hypertension (OR 1.27; 95% CI, 0.35 to 4.62; p=0.13), and respiratory diseases (OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.33; p=0.45). Interpretation This comprehensive meta-analysis on the largest number of patients to date provides solid evidence that COVID-19 infection significantly and negatively affected the disease course and prognosis of cancer patients. Awareness of this could help guide clinicians and health policy makers in combating cancer in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.","Su, Q.; Hu, J.-x.; Lin, H.-s.; Zhang, Z.; Zhu, E.

Studies have shown that the immune/inflammatory response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular disease, with representative markers in the blood including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune/inflammatory index (SII), etc. However, there is a variety of immune/inflammatory indicators. Moreover, most previous studies have been single-center investigations involving one or two indicators, with varying nature of cases, number of cases and study objectives, thereby making it difficult to reach consensus conclusions with good clinical guidelines. This article reviews the clinical value of immunoinflammatory indicators for VTE based on previous studies, including the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. In conclusion, NLR provides promising predictive capability for the onset and prognosis of VTE and deserves extensive application in clinical practice. PLR also has certain diagnostic and prognostic value, but further studies are warranted to identify its reliability and stability. Monocytes, eosinophils and platelet-related indicators show some clinical association with VTE, although the predictive capabilities are mediocre. SII is of promising potential value for VTE and deserves further investigations.

Thus, combination of multiple diagnostic methods is urgent to understand COVID-19 fully and to monitor the progression of COVID-19. METHODS laboratory variables of 40 mild COVID-19 patients, 30 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 32 healthy individuals were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), Kruskal test, Procrustes test, the vegan package in R, CCA package and receiver operating characteristic to investigate the characteristics of the laboratory variables and their relationships in COVID-19. RESULTS The correlations between the laboratory variables presented a variety of intricate linkages in the COVID-19 group compared with the healthy group and CAP patient group. The prediction probability of the combination of lymphocyte count (LY), eosinophil (EO) and platelets (PLT) was 0.847, 0.854 for the combination of lactate (LDH), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), and C-reactive protein (CRP), 0.740 for the combination of EO, white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count (NEUT) and 0.872 for the combination of CK-MB and P.

The causative agent of this disease is identified and named as SARS-CoV2 because of its genetic relatedness to SARS-CoV species that was responsible for the 2003 coronavirus outbreak. The immense spread of the disease in a very small period demands urgent development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infected patients. A plethora of research is being conducted globally on this novel coronavirus strain to gain knowledge about its origin, evolutionary history, and phylogeny. This review is an effort to compare genetic similarities and diversifications among coronavirus strains, which can hint towards the susceptible antigen targets of SARS-CoV2 to come up with the potential therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for the prevention of this public threat.","Kaur, Navpreet; Singh, Rimaljot; Dar, Zahid; Bijarnia, Rakesh Kumar; Dhingra, Neelima; Kaur, Tanzeer",Infect Genet Evol,759,9

Some patients develop COVID-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) and cannot be liberated from mechanical ventilation. Others may develop post-COVID fibrosis resulting in substantial disability and need for long-term supplemental oxygen. In both of these situations, treatment teams often inquire about the possibility of lung transplantation. In fact, lung transplantation has been successfully employed for both CARDS and post-COVID fibrosis in a limited number of patients worldwide. Lung transplantation following COVID infection presents a number of unique challenges that transplant programs must consider. In those with severe CARDS, the inability to conduct proper psychosocial evaluation and pre-transplant education, marked deconditioning from critical illness, and infectious concerns regarding viral re-activation are major hurdles. In those with post-COVID fibrosis, our limited knowledge about the natural history of recovery following COVID-19 infection is problematic. Increased knowledge of the likelihood and degree of recovery following COVID-19 acute lung injury is essential for appropriate decision making with regard to transplant. Transplant physicians must weigh the risks and benefits of lung transplant differently in a post-COVID fibrosis patient who is likely to remain stable or gradually improve in comparison to a patient with a known progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (fILD). It is clear that lung transplantation can be a life-saving therapeutic option for some patients with severe lung injury from COVID-19 infection. In this review, we discuss how lung transplant providers from a number of experienced centers approach lung transplantation for CARDS or post-COVID fibrosis.","King, Christopher S.; Mannem, Hannah; Kukreja, Jasleen; Aryal, Shambhu; Tang, Daniel; Singer, Jonathan P.; Bharat, Ankit; Behr, Juergen; Nathan, Steven D.",Chest,759,1

Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in pulmonary blood volumes measured on CT are associated with histopathological markers of pulmonary vascular pruning, suggesting that quantitative CT analysis may eventually be useful in the assessment pulmonary vascular dysfunction more broadly. Methods: Building upon previous work, automated quantitative CT measures of small blood vessel volume and pulmonary vascular density were developed. Scans from 103 COVID-19 patients and 107 healthy volunteers were analyzed and their results compared, with comparisons made both on lobar and global levels. Results: Compared to healthy volunteers, COVID-19 patients showed significant reduction in BV5 (pulmonary blood volume contained in blood vessels of <5 mm(2)) expressed as BV5/(Total pulmonary blood volume) (p<0.0001), and significant increases in BV5-10 and BV 10 (pulmonary blood volumes contained in vessels between 5 and 10 mm(2) and above 10 mm(2), respectively) (p<0.0001). These changes were consistent across lobes. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients display striking anomalies in the distribution of blood volume within the pulmonary vascular tree, consistent with increased pulmonary vasculature resistance in the pulmonary vessels below the resolution of CT.","Lins, Muriel; Vandevenne, Jan; Thillai, Muhunthan; Lavon, Ben R.; Lanclus, Maarten; Bonte, Stijn; Godon, Rik; Kendall, Irvin; De Backer, Jan; De Backer, Wilfried",Acad Radiol,759,11

The goal of this study is to investigate the impact of the miR-196a2 variant on clinical findings and susceptibility in MM. Two hundred MM patients (156 patients under transplantation of autologous stem cell) and 200 healthy controls included in this study. RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed no significant relationship for allele and frequencies of miR-196a2 genotype between patients and controls (p > 0.05). Log-rank test showed that gender has highly significant impact on both OS and PFS (p = 0.027, p = 0.045). In the univariate analysis, TT genotype (p = 0.022), and CT/TT (p = 0.008) had better OS. In the multivariate analysis, CC/CT-TT were associated with positively OS (p = 0.041). Currently, the most valuable prognostic markers in MM that has clinical implication are genetic abnormalities. It can be concluded from the results that miR-1962a variant is effective in prognosis of the MM.

RLRs rapidly detect atypical nucleic acids, thereby triggering the antiviral innate immune signaling cascade and subsequently activates the interferons transcription and induction of other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Nonetheless, these receptors are manipulated by viral proteins to subvert the host immune system and sustain the infectivity and replication potential of the virus. RIG-I senses the single-stranded, double-stranded, and short double-stranded RNAs and recognizes the key signature, a 5'-triphosphate moiety, at the blunt end of the viral RNA. Meanwhile, the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is triggered by longer double stranded RNAs, messenger RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation in their 5'-cap, and RNA aggregates. Therefore, structural insights into the nucleic-acid-sensing and downstream signaling mechanisms of these receptors hold great promise for developing effective antiviral therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the critical roles played by RLRs in viral infections as well as their ligand recognition mechanisms. In addition, we highlight the crosstalk between the toll-like receptors and RLRs and provide a comprehensive overview of RLR-associated diseases as well as the therapeutic potential of RLRs for the development of antiviral-drugs. Moreover, we believe that these RLR-based antivirals will serve as a step toward countering the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Batool, Maria; Kim, Moon Suk; Choi, Sangdun",Med. res. rev,759,22

There are no clear plans to identify individuals with comorbidities associated with high morbidity and fatality rates. This paper identifies comorbidities associated with high morbidity and fatalities of COVID-19 across countries and vulnerable groups in Nigeria. Methods: Peer-reviewed articles published between 2010 and 2020 retrieved from Google scholar, African Journal Online, EMBASE, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed (central) were systematically reviewed. Results: The pooled prevalence of hypertension is the lowest in North Central Nigeria (22.0%) and the highest in South-Eastern Nigeria (33.6%) while the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is lowest in North-Western Nigeria (3.0%) and highest in South-Southern Nigeria (9.8%). Significant differences in the frequency of comorbidities (hypertension, DM, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease; CKD) and complications (cardiac injury and acute respiratory disease syndrome; ARDS) were observed between fatal and non-fatal cases of COVID-19 (p<0.0001).

Conclusion: High prevalence of comorbidity may be predictive of high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Thus, to flatten the curve early intervention funds should be appropriately allocated based on the prevalence of comorbidities in the geopolitical zones. Such high-risk groups should be identified, stratified and actively monitored during treatment to prevent the development or progression of complications such as cardiac injury and ARDS.","Okoye, Jude Ogechukwu",Med J Islam Repub Iran,759,24

Diabetes and hypertension are among top public health priorities, particularly in low and middle-income countries where their health and socioeconomic impact is exacerbated by the quality and accessibility of health care. Moreover, their connection with severe or deadly COVID-19 illness has further increased their societal relevance. Tools for early detection of these chronic diseases enable interventions to prevent high-impact complications, such as loss of sight and kidney failure. Similarly, prognostic tools for COVID-19 help stratify the population to prioritize protection and vaccination of high-risk groups, optimize medical resources and tests, and raise public awareness. METHODS. We developed and validated state-of-the-art risk models for the presence of undiagnosed diabetes, hypertension, visual complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, and the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (if infected). The models were estimated using modern methods from the field of statistical learning (e.g., gradient boosting trees), and were trained on publicly available data containing health and socioeconomic information representative of the Mexican population. Lastly, we assembled a short integrated questionnaire and deployed a free online tool for massifying access to risk assessment. RESULTS. Our results show substantial improvements in accuracy and algorithmic equity (balance of accuracy across population subgroups), compared to established benchmarks. In particular, the models: i) reached state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity rates of 90% and 56% (0.83 AUC) for diabetes, 80% and 64% (0.79 AUC) for hypertension, 90% and 56% (0.84 AUC) for visual diminution as a complication, and 90% and 60% (0.84 AUC) for development of severe COVID disease; and ii) achieved substantially higher equity in sensitivity across gender, indigenous/non-indigenous, and regional populations. In addition, the most relevant features used by the models were in line with risk factors commonly identified by previous studies. Finally, the online platform was deployed and made accessible to the public on a massive scale. CONCLUSIONS. The use of large databases representative of the Mexican population, coupled with modern statistical learning methods, allowed the development of risk models with state-of-the-art accuracy and equity for two of the most relevant chronic diseases, their eye complications, and COVID-19 severity. These tools can have a meaningful impact on democratizing early detection, enabling large-scale preventive strategies in low-resource health systems, increasing public awareness, and ultimately raising social well-being.","Amaya, H.; Enciso, J.; Meizner, D.; Pentland, A.; Noriega, A.",,759,5

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is an effective strategy based on antibodies, and it can be used for simple and fast detection of antibodies due to COVID-19 infection. Accordingly, this paper reports on the highly sensitive and specific detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins in COVID-19 patients. In this methodology, spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins belonging to the coronavirus genome were immobilized on the surface of a gold sensor using self-assembled monolayers. Previously, serum from COVID-19 patients was screened by immunochromatography-based COVID-19 IgG rapid test and/or ELISA in house to determine the presence of IgG titers. Serum from COVID-19-positive patients presenting with IgG were added on the surface and, at the time they bound to proteins, they caused refractive changes in the SPR angle. The antibody detection limit was determined through successive injections into the SPR apparatus - these injections ranged from pure (without dilution) to 1 : 200 µL. The system has shown good reproducibility between runs after coated surface regeneration with 0.1 M glycine-HCl solution (pH 3.0); all experiments were tested in triplicate. The antibodies targeted both S and N fragments and gave a high assay sensitivity by identifying 19 out of 20 COVID-19-positive patients. Most importantly, the assay time took less than 10 min. The results of this study indicate that the proposed simple strategy demonstrates high sensitivity and time-saving in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 response antibodies.","Basso, Caroline Rodrigues; Malossi, Camila Dantas; Haisi, Amanda; de Albuquerque Pedrosa, Valber; Barbosa, Alexandre Naime; Grotto, Rejane Tommasini; Araujo Junior, João Pessoa",Anal Methods,759,20

METHODS: This study included ten pregnant women infected with COVID-19, treated in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20, 2020 to February 6, 2020. Clinical and chest CT data were collected and clinical symptoms, laboratory indicators, and CT images were analyzed to explore CT characteristics and diagnostic value for COVID-19 during pregnancy. RESULTS: Laboratory examination showed that white blood cell count was normal in nine patients, and slightly higher in one patient (10.23 × 109). The lymphocyte ratio decreased in two patients by 12% and 14%, respectively. The levels of C-reactive protein was elevated in seven patients (range, 21.16–60.3 mg/L) and the levels of D-dimer was increased in eight patients (range, 507–2141 ng/mL). Six patients had low levels of total protein (range, 35.3–56.5 mg/L). Two patients showed small patchy ground glass opacity (GGO) involving single lung, while eight patients showed multilobe GGO in both the lungs, with partial consolidation. Peripheral and non-peripheral lesion distributions were seen in ten (100%) and four (40%) patients, respectively. There were four patients who had signs of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram, six patients had small bilateral pleural effusions, while none had lymphadenopathy. Dynamic observations were performed in four patients after COVID-19 treatment. Among these four patients, one patient showed normal on the initial examination, and new lesions were observed after 3 days; 1 patient showed progression after 7 days of treatment, with expansion of the lesion area; and the other 2 patients showed improvement after 14 days of treatment, with reduction in the density and area of lesions and appearance of linear opacity. CONCLUSIONS: The CT characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy were mainly observed in early and progressive stages, and multiple new lesions were common. And there were consolidations of varying sizes and degrees within the lesion. Moreover, the original ground glass lesions could be fused or partially absorbed. Six patients had small bilateral pleural effusion.

METHODS: From February 22 to April 8, 2020, 926 consecutive patients referring to ED of two institutions in Northern Italy for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. Patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 and CXR images on ED admission were included (295 patients, median age 69 years, 199 males). Five readers independently and blindly reviewed all CXRs, rating pulmonary parenchymal involvement using a 0–3 semiquantitative score in 1-point increments on 6 lung zones (range 0–18). Interobserver agreement was assessed with weighted Cohen’s κ, correlations between median CXR score and clinical data with Spearman’s ρ, and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Median score showed negative correlation with SpO(2) (ρ = -0.242, p < 0.001), positive correlation with white cell count (ρ = 0.277, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (ρ = 0.308, p < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (ρ = 0.367, p < 0.001), being significantly higher in subsequently dead patients (p = 0.003).

Little is known about problems faced by emergency medical services—particularly helicopter services—caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. We aimed to describe the issues faced by air ambulance services in Europe as they transport potential COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Nine different HEMS providers in seven different countries across Europe were invited to share their experiences and to report their data regarding the care, transport, and safety measures in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 missions. Six air ambulance providers in six countries agreed and reported their data regarding development of special procedures and safety instructions in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic. Four providers agreed to provide mission related data. Three hundred eighty-five COVID-19-related missions were analysed, including 119 primary transport missions and 266 interfacility transport missions. RESULTS: All providers had developed special procedures and safety instructions in preparation for COVID-19. Ground transport was the preferred mode of transport in primary missions, whereas air transport was preferred for interfacility transport. In some countries the transport of COVID-19 patients by regular air ambulance services was avoided. Patients in interfacility transport missions had a significantly higher median (range) NACA Score 4 (2-5) compared with 3 (1-7), needed significantly more medical interventions, were significantly younger (59.6 ± 16 vs 65 ± 21 years), and were significantly more often male (73% vs 60.5%). CONCLUSIONS: All participating air ambulance providers were prepared for COVID-19. Safe care and transport of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients is achievable. Most patients on primary missions were transported by ground. These patients were less sick than interfacility transport patients, for whom air transport was the preferred method.","Hilbert-Carius, Peter; Braun, Jörg; Abu-Zidan, Fikri; Adler, Jörn; Knapp, Jürgen; Dandrifosse, Didier; Braun, Désirée; Pietsch, Urs; Adamczuk, Patrick; Rognås, Leif; Albrecht, Roland",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,759,22

Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of “service-oriented” systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or “kin-centred care” to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what “person-centredness” began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","Lachman, Peter; Batalden, Paul; Vanhaecht, Kris",F1000Res,759,22

It posed a significant impact on different health services, including dermatology. A Cross-sectional observational study of 200 healthcare providers and 100 dermatologists (survey 1 and 2, respectively) were conducted to determine the prevalence of occupational skin diseases among healthcare providers working amid the pandemic, and to demonstrate the outbreak's impact on dermatology practice. Most healthcare providers (83%) reported hygiene-related hand dermatitis. The rates of PPE- related dermatoses were estimated to be 73%, including pressure injuries (51.9%), acne (33.1%), non-gloves contact dermatitis (29.9%), nonspecific eruption (17.5%), urticaria (9.1%) and skin infections (3.2%). The emerging COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations were recognized by 20% of surveyed dermatologists, including maculopapular eruption (41.67%), urticaria (37.50%), chilblain (25%) and vasculitis (16.67). Telemedicine was provided by 73% of the dermatologists, and 89% reported minimal use of immunosuppressive drugs amid the pandemic.","Shanshal, Mohammed; Ahmed, Hayder Saad; Asfoor, Hayder; Salih, Raad Ibrahim; Ahmed Ali, Shehab; Aldabouni, Yusif k.",Clin Dermatol,759,16
