MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-five recurrent well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (RTC) in 32 patients were treated with RFA, between March 2008 and October 2011. RTCs were detected by regular follow-up ultrasound and confirmed by biopsy. All patients had fewer than 3 RTCs in the neck and were at high surgical risk or refused to undergo repeated surgery. Average number of RFA sessions were 1.3 (range 1-3). Post-RFA biopsy and ultrasound were performed. The mean follow-up period was 30 months. Pre- and post-RFA serum thyroglobulin values were evaluated. RESULTS Thirty-one patients with 33 RTCs were treated with RFA only, whereas 1 patient with 2 RTCs was treated with RFA followed by surgery. At the last follow-up ultrasound, 31 (94%) of the 33 RTCs treated with RFA alone completely disappeared and the remaining 2 (6%) RTCs showed decreased volume. The largest diameter and volume of the 33 RTCs were markedly decreased by 93.2% (from 8.1 ± 3.4 mm to 0.6 ± 1.8 mm, p < 0.001) and 96.4% (from 173.9 ± 198.7 mm(3) to 6.2 ± 27.9 mm(3), p < 0.001), respectively. Twenty of the 21 RTCs evaluated with post-RFA biopsies (95%) were negative for malignancy. One (5%) showed remaining tumor that was removed surgically. The serum thyroglobulin was decreased in 19 of 26 patients (73%). Voice change developed immediately after RFA in 6 patients (19%) and was spontaneously recovered in 5 patients (83%). CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation can be effective in treating loco-regional, recurrent, and well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in patients at high surgical risk.","Lee, Sun Jin; Jung, So Lyung; Kim, Bum Soo; Ahn, Kook Jin; Choi, Hyun Seok; Lim, Dong Jun; Kim, Min Hee; Bae, Ja Seong; Kim, Min Sik; Jung, Chan Kwon; Chong, Se Min",Korean journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2014.15.6.817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25469095/,855

POPULATION FROM MBOUZI ISLET, MAYOTTE ISLAND.",2019-09-01,"Cyclodextrin-based hydrogels were synthesized to create robust networks with tunable mechanical properties capable of serving as device coatings. The CD networks were able to swell and load drug in aqueous and organic solvents. The rheological properties of the swollen gels were investigated using stress and frequency sweeps, with both demonstrating high storage modulus, indicating strong elastic gels. The ability of the gels to swell in numerous solvents allowed for the separate loading and release of different antibiotic drug molecules with varying hydrophilicities. Based on FTIR and TGA studies, each drug was found to form an inclusion complex with CD. For comparison, dextran gels were prepared similarly. As expected for affinity-based mechanisms, the release of drugs from the CD-based gels was slower than diffusion-based release from the dextran gels, and could be sustained for more than 200 h. Coating potential was tested by coating two different medical devices: metal screws and polymer meshes. The meshes were characterized by SEM, revealing that CD-based coatings resulted in a uniform thin film, whereas the dextran gels only partly coated the device and showed delamination. Considerably longer bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus was observed for both the CD hydrogels and coatings, as compared to dextran-based ones. The slow, sustained, affinity-based release of antibiotics from the CD-based networks reflects their potential as a delivery platform.","Thatiparti, Thimma R; Shoffstall, Andrew J; von Recum, Horst A",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2009.11.087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022369/,855

Since 1950, non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) have experienced higher rates of mortality than non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Previous studies revealed geographic variation in mortality rates by race. The identification of areas with the greatest disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality may assist policy makers in the allocation of resources including for the COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION Does geographic variation in racial disparity in influenza and pneumonia mortality exist? STUDY DESIGN and Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database for multiple cause of death between 1999-2018 for NHB and NHW decedents aged ≥ 25 years with an ICD-10 code for influenza (J09-J11) and pneumonia (J12-J18) was used. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were computed by race for Health & Human Services (HHS) regions and urbanization in non-Hispanics RESULTS: In 1999-2018, there were 540,476 deaths among NHB and NHW aged 25-84 years. AAMR was higher in NHB than NHW in each age group and in 7 of 10 HHS regions. The greatest disparity was in HHS regions 2 (NY, NJ) and 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada). In HHS region 2, NHB [24.6 (95% CI 24.1-25.1)] were more likely to die than NHW [15.7 (95% CI 15.6-15.9)]. Similarly, in region 9, NHB [23.2 (95% CI 22.7-23.8)] had higher mortality than NHW [16.1 (95% CI 15.9-16.2)]. Within these regions, disparities were greatest in the core of major metropolitan areas. Much of the disparity was due to very high mortality rates in NHB in these areas: region 2 large central metro areas NHB 28.2 (95% CI 27.6-28.9). INTERPRETATION In 1999-2018 the NHB-NHW disparity in AAMR from influenza and pneumonia was greatest in central metro areas of HHS regions 2 and 9.","Donaldson, Sahai V; Thomas, Alicia N; Gillum, Richard F; Mehari, Alem",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.12.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400931/,855

Intraoperative cerebral oximetry monitoring used to detect regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) is a non-invasive method that provides prognostic importance in cardiac surgery. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the association of intraoperative cerebral oxygen monitoring during cardiac surgery on postoperative complications. This was a case-controlled retrospective study conducted on adult patients, who underwent open-heart surgery in National Heart Institute, Malaysia. The case group comprised patients on protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring. They were treated using a standardized algorithm to maintain rScO2 not lower than 20% of baseline rScO2. The control group comprised patients with matched demographic background, preoperative risk factors, and type of surgical procedures. Propensity score stratification was utilized to contend with selection bias. Retrospective analysis was performed on 240 patients (case group) while comparing it to 407 patients (control group). The non-availability of cerebral oximetry monitoring during surgery was the prominent predictor for all outcome of complications; stroke (OR: 7.66), renal failure needing dialysis (OR: 5.12) and mortality (OR: 20.51). Postoperative complications revealed that there were significant differences for risk of mortality (p<0.001, OR = 20.51), renal failure that required dialysis (p<0.001, OR = 5.12) and stroke (p <0.05, OR = 7.66). Protocolized cerebral oximetry monitoring during cardiothoracic surgeries was found to be associated with lower incidence of stroke, renal failure requiring dialysis and mortality rate.","Juliana, Norsham; Abu Yazit, Noor Anisah; Kadiman, Suhaini; Muhammad Hafidz, Kamilah; Azmani, Sahar; Mohd Fahmi Teng, Nur Islami; Das, Srijit",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038405/,855
79255,CONSERVATION CHALLENGES: THE LIMITATIONS OF ANTEMORTEM TUBERCULOSIS TESTING IN CAPTIVE ASIATIC LIONS (PANTHERA LEO PERSICA).,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Oxygen therapy is usually combined with a humidification device, to prevent mucosal dryness. Depending on the cannula design, oxygen can be administered pre- or intra-nasally (administration of oxygen in front of the nasal ostia vs cannula system inside the nasal vestibulum). The impact of cannula design on intra-nasal humidity, however, has not been investigated to date. OBJECTIVE First, to develop a system, that samples air from the nasal cavity and analyzes the humidity of these samples. Second, to investigate nasal humidity during pre-nasal and intra-nasal oxygen application, with and without humidification. METHODS We first developed and validated a sampling and analysis system to measure humidity from air samples. By means of this system we measured inspiratory air samples from 12 subjects who received nasal oxygen with an intra-nasal and pre-nasal cannula at different flows, with and without humidification. RESULTS The sampling and analysis system showed good correlation to a standard hygrometer within the tested humidity range (r = 0.99, P < .001). In our subjects intranasal humidity dropped significantly, from 40.3 ± 8.7% to 35.3 ± 5.8%, 32 ± 5.6%, and 29.0 ± 6.8% at flows of 1, 2, and 3 L, respectively, when oxygen was given intra-nasally without humidification (P = .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). We observed no significant change in airway humidity when oxygen was given pre-nasally without humidification. With the addition of humidification we observed no significant change in humidity at any flow, and independent of pre- or intranasal oxygen administration. CONCLUSIONS Pre-nasal administration of dry oxygen achieves levels of intranasal humidity similar to those achieved by intranasal administration in combination with a bubble through humidifier. Pre-nasal oxygen simplifies application and may reduce therapy cost.","Dellweg, Dominic; Wenze, Markus; Hoehn, Ekkehard; Bourgund, Olaf; Haidl, Peter",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23287016/,855

The abdominal scars were evaluated using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). Seventy-two participants were enrolled in the study, including 15 (20.8%) women with cervical stenosis, and 57 (79.2%) without stenosis. Results showed that the mean abdominal scar score assessed by VSS was higher in patients with cervical stenosis (7, range: 1-10) compared to those without stenosis (4, range: 0-9) (P = 0.001). Incidence rates of cervical stenosis increased with the VSS score. For women with VSS scores of 0 to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively, the occurrences of cervical stenosis were 6.1%, 16.7%, 16.7%, 27.3%, 37.5%, 50% and 100%. The cutoff point of VSS score was 7 according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Fourteen of the 15 stenosis happened either in patients without anti-stenosis tools (Foley catheters or tailed intrauterine devices) placed during the surgery or after the devices were removed. Our results demonstrated that VSS is an effective approach to assess the presence of cervical stenosis after ART. Women who have an abdominal scar with a VSS score > 7 have a high risk of developing isthmic stenosis without anti-stenosis tools in place.","Li, Xiaoqi; Li, Jin; Ju, Xingzhu; Chen, Xiaojun; Wu, Xiaohua",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.9318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191256/,855

In its crystal structure, RalF is in the autoinhibited form. A large-scale domain motion is expected to lift the autoinhibition, the mechanism of which is still unknown. Since RalF is activated in the presence of the membrane, its active structure and the structure of the RalF-Arf1 complex could not have been determined experimentally. On the simulation side, it has been proven that classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) alone is not efficient enough to map motions of such amplitude and determine the active conformation of RalF.

84775,CLINICAL CHALLENGE. Diagnosis: Mesocestoides spp.,2015,"Emergency management is a relatively new research field in China. The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 caused research and papers on emergency management to increase by leaps and bounds. This review summarises the progress of hospital emergency management research in China, highlights trends and challenges, and discusses likely solutions for research improvement. Articles were identified from a systematic search of Wanfang Med Online and PubMed, from reviews of bibliographic reference lists and by consultation with experts in the field. The search identified 2548 articles potentially involving hospital emergency management. By reviewing the titles and abstracts, we narrowed the list to 253. Reading the texts resulted in the inclusion of 85 articles in the review. Two additional articles were included from the references cited in articles that were reviewed. Research progress was summarised in terms of basic concepts and principles, system development, emergency response plan, preparedness and response, training and exercise, and management evaluation. Based on this study we suggest that hospital emergency management research in China should make efforts to (1) establish a universally accepted theory framework and terminology, (2) create a structure for further studies, (3) integrate research of different disciplines, and (4) avoid or minimise confusion. More attention should be paid on the evolvement mechanism of main public health incidents and disasters, and the key functional systems related to hospital's emergency response resiliencies.

93003,HEALTH-SCREENING PROTOCOLS FOR VINACEOUS AMAZONS (AMAZONA VINACEA) IN A REINTRODUCTION PROJECT.,2015,"BACKGROUND Quantitative antibody tests are expected to be useful in diagnostics of COVID-19 and investigation of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes, and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titers of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titers measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titers were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS The results provide insights into the nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and diagnostic performance of antibody tests.","Wakui, Masatoshi; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Noguchi, Masayo; Ohno, Akemi; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Kikuchi, Haruhito; Hasegawa, Naoki; Saya, Hideyuki; Murata, Mitsuru",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211006740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730868/,855

We seek to assess the safety and feasibility of this technique in difficult surgical candidates such as those with obesity or prior laparotomies, as well as to detail intra- and postoperative complications associated with the procedure. Methods We collected demographic, clinical, intra-operative, and postoperative data on 45 women who underwent a combined vaginal and laparoscopic gynecological surgery for benign indications by a single surgeon between February 2013 and August 2017. Results From February 2013 through August 2017, 45 women underwent a combined vaginal and laparoscopic surgery at 2 institutions. Procedures included adnexal surgery (n = 32, 71%), and total hysterectomy (n = 13, 29%). Of patients who underwent adnexal surgery, two had minor postoperative complications. No patients had major complications. In addition, no patients had postoperative vaginal infections or pelvic abscesses, and there were no readmissions within 30 days after the procedures. Conclusion Our proposed combined vaginal and laparoscopic approach to benign gynecological surgery can be utilized in difficult surgical candidates including those with obesity, nulliparous patients, and those with prior abdominal surgery. Our data has shown that this approach is safe and effective.","Tierney, Christina; Chung, Sophie H; Feinberg, Jacqueline; Haines, Kaitlin; Yadav, Ghanshyam; Azodi, Masoud; Menderes, Gulden",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2019.00006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31097905/,855
106312,EFFECT OF ROUTINE HANDLING AND TRANSPORTATION ON BLOOD LEUKOCYTE CONCENTRATIONS AND PLASMA CORTICOSTERONE IN CAPTIVE HISPANIOLAN AMAZON PARROTS ( AMAZONA VENTRALIS).,2018,"INTRODUCTION In delusional infestation (DI), as with other non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders, little is known about the neural basis and the mechanisms of antipsychotic treatment. We aimed at investigating the brain circuitry involved in DI and the role of postsynaptic D2 receptors in mediating the effects of antipsychotics by means of multimodal neuroimaging. METHODS In Case 1, a patient with DI (initially drug-induced), cerebral glucose metabolism and dopaminergic neurotransmission were studied in the untreated state (FDG-PET, FDOPA-PET, 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT, and IBZM-SPECT) and after effective aripiprazole treatment (FDG-PET and IBZM-SPECT), with negative drug screenings at both imaging sessions. In Case 2 (DI secondary to mild vascular encephalopathy) cerebral perfusion and gray matter volume changes were investigated in the untreated state and compared to N=8 [corrected] age-matched healthy controls (MRI-based CASL and VBM). RESULTS In Case 1, before treatment, glucose metabolism was left-dominant in the thalamus and the putamen. Pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic neurotransmissions were altered in the striatum, again mainly the left putamen. Full remission to aripiprazole was associated with 63 to 78% striatal D2 receptor occupancy and glucose metabolism changes in the bilateral thalamus. In Case 2, significant perfusion and GMV changes were observed in the bilateral putamen, frontal and parietal somatosensory cortices as compared to controls. Symptoms partially remitted to ziprasidone therapy. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION Six imaging techniques were first used to study the neural basis of DI and mechanisms of antipsychotic therapy. The study provides first low-level evidence in vivo evidence of fronto-striato-thalamo-parietal network to mediate core symptoms of DI, i.e. a priori brain regions involved in judgment (frontal cortex), sensory gating (thalamus) and body perception (dorsal striatum, thalamus and somatic cortices). This is also the first report of effective treatment with aripiprazole in drug-induced DI and with ziprasidone in organic DI, adding to existing limited evidence that SGAs are helpful in various forms of DI. Effective antipsychotic treatment seems to depend on blocking striatal D2 receptors with similar occupancy rates as in schizophrenia. Larger samples are needed to confirm our preliminary findings and further evaluate their relevance for the different forms of DI.","Freudenmann, Roland W; Kölle, Markus; Huwe, Axel; Luster, Markus; Reske, Sven Norbert; Huber, Markus; Lepping, Peter; Wolf, R Christian; Schönfeldt-Lecuona, Carlos",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.06.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20600460/,855

We hypothesized that CVV improves intraoperative and postoperative respiratory function in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS Fifty patients planned for open abdominal surgery lasting >3 h were randomly assigned to receive either CVV or CNV. Mean tidal volumes and PEEP were set at 8 ml kg-1 (predicted body weight) and 5 cm H2O, respectively. In CVV, tidal volumes varied randomly, following a normal distribution, on a breath-by-breath basis. The primary endpoint was the forced vital capacity (FVC) on postoperative Day 1. Secondary endpoints were oxygenation, non-aerated lung volume, distribution of ventilation, and pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications until postoperative Day 5. RESULTS FVC did not differ significantly between CVV and CNV on postoperative Day 1, 61.5 (standard deviation 22.1) % vs 61.9 (23.6) %, respectively; mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] difference, -0.4 (-13.2-14.0), P=0.95. Intraoperatively, CVV did not result in improved respiratory function, haemodynamics, or redistribution of ventilation compared to CNV. Postoperatively, FVC, forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV1), and FEV1/FVC deteriorated, while atelectasis volume and plasma levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 increased, but values did not differ between groups. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications was comparable in CVV and CNV.

How can collectives be considered ""immune""? Over the course of more than a century of use of the term, scientists have developed many different understandings of the concept in response to this inherent tension. Originating among veterinary scientists in the United States in the late 19th century, the concept was adopted by British scientists researching human infectious disease by the early 1920s. It soon became a staple concept for epidemiologists interested in disease ecology, helping to articulate the population dynamics of diseases such as diphtheria and inﬂuenza. Finally, though more traditional understandings of the concept remained in scientiﬁc use, in the era after World War II, it increasingly came to signal the objective and outcome of mass vaccination. Recognizing the complexity of scientiﬁc efforts to resolve the paradox of herd immunity may help us consider the best distribution of immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).(Am J Public Health.

133519,SUCCESSFUL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF BILATERAL PERINEAL HERNIAS IN A SKUNK (MEPHITIS MEPHITIS).,2015,"AIM Nationwide lockdowns and social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced childhood infections. We assessed how many items of systemic antibiotics and asthma medicines were dispensed to children aged-0-12 years in Finland before and during the pandemic and analysed the reimbursement costs. METHODS The data came from the national Finnish register of reimbursable prescriptions, which is maintained by the country's Social Insurance Institution. It included all prescriptions for antibiotics and asthma medicines dispensed to children aged 0-12 years in 2019 and 2020. Prescription rates per 1,000 children were calculated for each quarter and compared using rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS Overall dispensing for antibiotics decreased by 55.3% and was most prominent for macrolides for children aged 0-5 years (59.6%, 95% CI 60.9-58.2%). Asthma medicines decreased by 19.8% and the most prominent reduction was in short-acting beta-agonists for children aged 0-5 years (35.2%, 95% CI 36.1-34.2%). These reduced reimbursement costs by 3.4 million Euros from 2019 to 2020. CONCLUSION This nationwide study showed that the number of antibiotics and asthma medicines decreased by 59.6% and 19.8% respectively from 2019 to 2020, generating a cost saving of 3.4 million Euros.","Haapanen, Marjut; Renko, Marjo; Artama, Miia; Kuitunen, Ilari",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.16144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626007/,855

In a multicenter cohort of 161 patients with acute large vessel occlusion who received endovascular therapy, brain infarction was predicted by CTP using (1) optimized parameter cut-off values determined by ROC curve analysis and (2) probabilistic logistic regression threshold-free analysis. Predicted infarct volumes and prediction errors based on four perfusion parameter maps were compared against observed infarcts. In 93 patients with successful recanalization, the mean observed infarct volume was 35.7 ± 61.9 ml (the reference for core infarct not savable by reperfusion). Optimal parameter thresholds predicted mean infarct volumes between 53.2 ± 44.4 and 125.0 ± 95.4 ml whereas threshold-free analysis predicted mean volumes between 35.9 ± 28.5 and 36.1 ± 29.0 ml. In 68 patients with persistent occlusion, the mean observed infarct volume was 113.4 ± 138.3 ml (the reference to define penumbral infarct savable by reperfusion). Predicted mean infarct volumes by parameter thresholds ranged from 91.4 ± 81.5 to 163.8 ± 135.7 ml, by threshold-free analysis from 113.2 ± 89.9 to 113.5 ± 89.0 ml. Threshold-free prediction of infarct volumes had a higher precision and lower patient-specific prediction error than conventional thresholding. Penumbra to core lesion mismatch estimate may therefore benefit from threshold-free CTP analysis.","Flottmann, Fabian; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias Djamsched; Ernst, Marielle; Forkert, Nils Daniel; Grosser, Malte; Thomalla, Götz; Siemonsen, Susanne; Fiehler, Jens; Kemmling, André",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06882-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28751692/,855

Here, we show that replacing the 209-nt MHV 5' UTR with the ∼63%-sequence-identical 210-nt BCoV 5' UTR by reverse genetics does not yield viable virus, suggesting 5' end signals are more stringent or possibly are not strictly 5' UTR confined. To identify potential smaller, 5'-common signals, each of three stem-loop (SL) signaling domains and one inter-stem-loop domain from the BCoV 5' UTR was tested by replacing its counterpart in the MHV genome. The SLI/II domain (nucleotides 1 to 84) and SLIII domain (nucleotides 85 to 141) each immediately enabled near-wild-type (wt) MHV-like progeny, thus behaving similarly to comparable 5'-proximal regions of the SCoV 5' UTR as shown by others. The inter-stem-loop domain (nt 142 to 173 between SLs III and IV) enabled small plaques only after genetic adaptation. The SLIV domain (nt 174 to 210) required a 16-nt extension into BCoV open reading frame 1 (ORF1) for apparent stabilization of a longer BCoV SLIV (nt 174 to 226) and optimal virus replication. Surprisingly, pleiomorphic SLIV structures, including a terminal loop deletion, were found among debilitated progeny from intra-SLIV chimeras. The results show the inter-stem-loop domain to be a potential novel species-specific cis-replication element and that cis-acting SLIV in the viral genome extends into ORF1 in a manner that stabilizes its lower stem and is thus not 5' UTR confined.","Guan, Bo-Jhih; Wu, Hung-Yi; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00263-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21430057/,855

There is mounting evidence that the disease is not restricted to motor neurons. In this neuroimaging study, we aimed to investigate the presence of in-vivo cerebellar damage in adult SMA patients not treated with disease-modifying treatment. METHODS Twenty-five molecularly confirmed patients with SMA type III or IV and 25 healthy controls underwent MRI with cerebellar focused structural analysis by the CERES automated pipeline. Volumetry (total and gray matter-GM) as well as cortical thickness of the cerebellar lobules were compared in both groups. Full clinical and demographic data were then assessed for correlations with cerebellar imaging findings. RESULTS Volumes of cerebellar lobules VIIIB (right), IX and X were significantly smaller in patients with SMA. Lobule IX also had GM atrophy in comparison to controls. We found no significant correlation between clinical findings and cerebellar damage. CONCLUSIONS Neuroimaging detects cerebellar structural changes in adult SMA patients, suggesting that neurodegeneration is not confined to the lower motor neurons in the disease.","de Borba, Fabrício Castro; Querin, Giorgia; França, Marcondes Cavalcante; Pradat, Pierre-François",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09875-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388834/,855
183534,Canine adenovirus type 1 in a fennec fox (Vulpes zerda).,2014,"Surf tourism is the principal development driver in many coastal communities around the world. Surf tourism development brings economic opportunities to residents in coastal destinations, but has also been criticized for associations with gentrification, pollution, and inequity. While many have speculated that surfers represent a crisis-resistant tourist segment, this had not yet been empirically demonstrated, nor had the sustainability implications of their travel during crises been explored. Building on ethnographic observations and two interview phases with 25 resident surfers in Bocas del Toro, Panama, this is the first study to do both. The findings reveal that the pandemic exacerbated existing sustainability challenges by accelerating development near surf-breaks, fomenting tensions within the surf community (related to surf tourism business operations and the distribution of benefits) and facilitating residents to surf more frequently—exacerbating surf-resource crowding. Evidence also revealed, however, a potential shift in surfers’ collective consciousness in the context of the pandemic, which reduced conflicts between visiting and resident surfers. This paper exposes the urgent need for stakeholders in surf communities, and particularly surf tourism business owners, to cooperate in order to preserve surf experiences that are vital to resident mental/physical health and well-being, as well as the attractiveness as a surf tourism destination.","Mach, Leon John",Societies,https://doi.org/10.3390/soc11030075,855

Platelets are major effectors of thrombosis and hemostasis. Suitable animal models are needed to better understand COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) and underlying platelet phenotypes. Here, we assessed K18-hACE2 mice undergoing a standardized SARS-CoV-2 infection protocol to study dynamic platelet responses via mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In total, we found significant changes in >1,200 proteins. Strikingly, protein alterations occurred rapidly by 2 days post-infection (dpi) and preceded outward clinical signs of severe disease. Pathway enrichment analysis of 2dpi platelet proteomes revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulated complement-coagulation networks (F2, F12, CFH, CD55/CD59), platelet activation-adhesion-degranulation proteins (PF4, SELP, PECAM1, HRG, PLG, vWF), and chemokines (CCL8, CXCL5, CXCL12). When mice started to lose weight at 4dpi, pattern recognition receptor signaling (RIG-I/MDA5, CASP8, MAPK3), and interferon pathways (IFIT1/IFIT3, STAT1) were predominant. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the lungs was observed by immunohistochemistry, but in platelets was undetected by proteomics. Similar to patients, K18-hACE2 mice during SARS-CoV-2 infection developed progressive lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with platelet aggregates in the lungs and kidneys. In conclusion, this model recapitulates activation of coagulation, complement, and interferon responses in circulating platelets, providing valuable insight into platelet pathology during COVID-19. Key Points SARS-CoV-2-infected humanized ACE2 mice recapitulate platelet reprogramming towards activation-degranulation-aggregation.

Infection with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces a cellular stress condition known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR induction is mediated primarily by viral spike (S) protein. The modulation of UPR by S protein involves activation of PERK protein kinase. Other branches of the UPR pathways controlled by IRE1 and ATF6 proteins, respectively, are not involved. 2. The protease inhibitor Ben-HCl effectively suppresses SARS-CoV infection by blocking virus entry. Viral infectivity is associated with the cleavage of S protein by the cellular protease factor Xa. 3. Two new aspects of the interaction between SARS-CoV S protein and the cell have been defined. These have important implications in the pathogenesis of SARS, providing opportunities for developing vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV. 4. Counteracting the UPR and targeting the cleavage of S protein with small molecule pharmaceutical agents represent two new anti-SARS-CoV strategies. 5. The receptor-binding domain of S protein delivered via adeno-associated virus can efficiently induce mucosal immunity and provide long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection.","Jin, D Y; Zheng, B J",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19258633/,855

OBJECTIVE To survey physicians currently using e-mail with their patients daily to understand their experiences. METHODS In-depth phone interviews of 45 physicians currently using e-mail with patients were audio taped and transcribed verbatim. Two investigators independently qualitatively coded comments. Differences were adjudicated by group consensus. RESULTS Almost all of the 642 comments from these physicians who currently use e-mail with patients daily could be grouped into 1 of 4 broad domains: (1) e-mail access and content, (2) effects of e-mail on the doctor-patient relationship, (3) managing clinical issues by e-mail, and (4) integrating e-mail into office processes. The most consistent theme was that e-mail communication enhances chronic-disease management. Many physicians also reported improved continuity of care and increased flexibility in responding to nonurgent issues. Integration of e-mail into daily workflow, such as utilization of office personnel, appears to be a significant area of concern for many of the physicians. For other issues, such as content, efficiency of e-mail, and confidentiality, there were diverging experiences and opinions. Physicians appear to be selective in choosing which patients they will communicate with via e-mail, but the criteria for selection is unclear. CONCLUSION These physician respondents did perceive benefits to e-mail with a select group of patients. Several areas, such as identifying clinical situations where e-mail communication is effective, incorporating e-mail into office flow, and being reimbursed for online medical care/communication, need to be addressed before this mode of communication diffuses into most practices.","Patt, Madhavi R; Houston, Thomas K; Jenckes, Mollie W; Sands, Daniel Z; Ford, Daniel E",Journal of medical Internet research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12857665/,855
191384,Transitional cell carcinomas in four fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus).,2004,"PURPOSE Tumor-derived exosomes are proposed as a new type of cancer vaccine. Heat shock proteins are potent Th1 adjuvant, and heat stress can induce heat shock protein and MHC-I expression in tumor cells, leading to the increased immunogenicity of tumor cells. To improve the immunogenicity of exosomes as cancer vaccine, we prepared exosomes from heat-stressed carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive tumor cells (CEA+/HS-Exo) and tested the efficacy of these exosomes in the induction of CEA-specific antitumor immunity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN First, we identified the composition of CEA+/HS-Exo and observed their effects on human dendritic cell maturation. Then, we evaluated their ability to induce a CEA-specific immune response in vivo in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice and CEA-specific CTL response in vitro in HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors and HLA-A*0201+CEA+ cancer patients. RESULTS CEA+/HS-Exo contained CEA and more heat shock protein 70 and MHC-I and significantly induced dendritic cell maturation. Immunization of HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice with CEA+/HS-Exo was more efficient in priming a CEA-specific CTL, and the CTL showed antitumor effect when adoptively transferred to SW480-bearing nude mice. Moreover, in vitro incubation of lymphocytes from HLA-A*0201+ healthy donors and HLA-A*0201+CEA+ cancer patients with CEA+/HS-Exo-pulsed autologous dendritic cells induces HLA-A*0201-restricted and CEA-specific CTL response. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that CEA+/HS-Exo has superior immunogenicity than CEA+/Exo in inducing CEA-specific CTL response and suggest that exosomes derived from heat-stressed tumor cells may be used as efficient vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.","Dai, Shengming; Wan, Tao; Wang, Baomei; Zhou, Xiangyang; Xiu, Fangming; Chen, Taoyong; Wu, Yanfeng; Cao, Xuetao",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16243831/,855

We review, from an immunological perspective, recent experimental evidence on the time-dependency of adaptive immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of this on the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 antibody tests made at different time points post infection. We interpret this scientific evidence in terms of mooted clinical applications for current COVID-19 antibody tests in identifying acute infections, in confirming recent or past infections at the individual and population level, and in detecting re-infection and protective immunity.

To provide definitive experimental evidence for the neurotropism and neuroinvasion of HCoV and its possible association with multiple sclerosis (MS), we have performed an extensive search and characterization of HCoV RNA in a large panel of human brain autopsy samples. Very stringent reverse transcription-PCR with two primer pairs for both viral strains (229E and OC43), combined with Southern hybridization, was performed on samples from 90 coded donors with various neurological diseases (39 with MS and 26 with other neurological diseases) or normal controls (25 patients). We report that 44% (40 of 90) of donors were positive for 229E and that 23% (21 of 90) were positive for OC43. A statistically significant higher prevalence of OC43 in MS patients (35.9%; 14 of 39) than in controls (13.7%; 7 of 51) was observed. Sequencing of nucleocapsid protein (N) gene amplicons revealed point mutations in OC43, some consistently found in three MS patient brains and one normal control but never observed in laboratory viruses. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of viral RNA in brain parenchyma, outside blood vessels. The presence of HCoV in human brains is consistent with neuroinvasion by these respiratory pathogens.

195672,"Serosurvey of pathogens in domestic dogs on the border of Noël Kempff Mercado National Park, Bolivia.",2008,"Coronavirus spike (S) proteins are palmitoylated at several cysteine residues clustered near their transmembrane-spanning domains. This is achieved by cellular palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), which can modify newly synthesized S proteins before they are assembled into virion envelopes at the intermediate compartment of the exocytic pathway. To address the importance of these fatty acylations to coronavirus infection, we exposed infected cells to 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a specific PAT inhibitor. 2-BP profoundly reduced the specific infectivities of murine coronaviruses at very low, nontoxic doses that were inert to alphavirus and rhabdovirus infections. 2-BP effected only two- to fivefold reductions in S palmitoylation, yet this correlated with reduced S complexing with virion membrane (M) proteins and consequent exclusion of S from virions. At defined 2-BP doses, underpalmitoylated S proteins instead trafficked to infected cell surfaces and elicited cell-cell membrane fusions, suggesting that the acyl chain adducts are more critical to virion assembly than to S-induced syncytial developments. These studies involving pharmacologic inhibition of S protein palmitoylation were complemented with molecular genetic analyses in which cysteine acylation substrates were mutated. Notably, some mutations (C1347F and C1348S) did not interfere with S incorporation into virions, indicating that only a subset of the cysteine-rich region provides the essential S-assembly functions. However, the C1347F/C1348S mutant viruses exhibited relatively low specific infectivities, similar to virions secreted from 2-BP-treated cultures. Our collective results indicate that the palmitate adducts on coronavirus S proteins are necessary in assembly and also in positioning the assembled envelope proteins for maximal infectivity.","Thorp, Edward B; Boscarino, Joseph A; Logan, Hillary L; Goletz, Jeffrey T; Gallagher, Thomas M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16415005/,855

The study was a 12-month multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study of patients with asthma exacerbations associated with respiratory infections and minimal symptoms between episodes. Patients were randomized to receive oral montelukast 4 or 5 mg (depending on age) (n = 278) or placebo (n = 271) once per day for 12 months.

In this study, we investigated the role of the internal 0.13-kb region in MHV RNA replication. Overall sequences of the 0.13-kb regions from various MHV strains were similar to each other, with nucleotide substitutions in some strains; MHV-A59 was exceptional, with three nucleotide deletions. Computer-based secondary-structure analysis of the 0.13-kb region in the positive strand revealed that most of the MHV strains formed the same or a similar main stem-loop structure, whereas only MHV-A59 formed a smaller main stem-loop structure. The RNA secondary structures in the negative strands were much less uniform among the MHV strains. A series of DI RNAs that contained MHV-JHM-derived 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences plus internal 0.13-kb regions derived from various MHV strains were constructed. Most of these DI RNAs replicated in MHV-infected cells, except that MRP-A59, with a 0.13-kb region derived from MHV-A59, failed to replicate. Interestingly, replication of MRP-A59 was temperature dependent; it occurred at 39.5 degrees C but not at 37 or 35 degrees C, whereas a DI RNA with an MHV-JHM-derived 0.13-kb region replicated at all three temperatures. At 37 degrees C, synthesis of MRP-A59 negative-strand RNA was detected in MHV-infected and MRP-A59 RNA-transfected cells. Another DI RNA with the internal 0.13-kb region deleted also synthesized negative-strand RNA in MHV-infected cells. MRP-A59-transfected cells were shifted from 39.5 to 37 degrees C at 5.5 h postinfection, a time when most MHV negative-strand RNAs have already accumulated; after the shift, MRP-A59 positive-strand RNA synthesis ceased. The minimum sequence required for maintenance of the positive-strand major stem-loop structure and biological function of the MHV-JHM 0.13-kb region was about 57 nucleotides. Function was lost in the 50-nucleotide sequence that formed a positive-strand stem-loop structure identical to that of MHV-A59. These studies suggested that the RNA structure made by the internal sequence was important for positive-strand MHV RNA synthesis.","Kim, Y N; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609066/,855
198194,Antibiotic intravenous regional perfusion for successful resolution of distal limb infections: two cases.,2008,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 indicated that China's existing former mechanism for emergency management was very vulnerable. The Chinese Government has since established a new mechanism for responding to emerging communicable diseases. This paper examined the current status of and developments in China's response to emerging communicable diseases from the outbreak of SARS in 2003 to the outbreak of H7N9 virus infection in 2013. Results indicated that the current mechanism for emergency responses to emerging communicable diseases in China has made great achievements in terms of command and decision-making, organization and collaboration, monitoring and early warning systems, protection, and international communication and cooperation. This mechanism for responding to emerging communicable diseases allowed China to successfully deal with outbreaks of the H5N1 bird flu, H1N1 flu, and H7N9 bird flu. However, a better coordination system, a more complete Office of Responses to Public Health Emergencies, administrative responsibility and error correction, better personnel training, and government responsibility may help to improve the response to emerging communicable diseases. Such improvements are eagerly anticipated.","Yao, Linong; Chen, Enfu; Chen, Zhiping; Gong, Zhenyu",Bioscience trends,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24390368/,855
