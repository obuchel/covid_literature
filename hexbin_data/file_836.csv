60056,Bioinspired Spiky Peroxidase-Mimics for Localized Bacterial Capture and Synergistic Catalytic Sterilization.,2021-01-21,"Off-center spindle positioning in mammalian oocytes enables asymmetric divisions in size, which are important for subsequent embryogenesis. The migration of the meiosis I spindle from the oocyte center to its cortex is mediated by F-actin. Specifically, an F-actin cage surrounds the microtubule spindle and applies forces to it. To better understand how F-actin transmits forces to the spindle, we studied a potential direct link between F-actin and microtubules. For this, we tested the implication of myosin-X, a known F-actin and microtubule binder involved in spindle morphogenesis and/or positioning in somatic cells, amphibian oocytes and embryos. Using a mouse strain conditionally invalidated for myosin-X in oocytes and by live-cell imaging, we show that myosin-X is not localized on the spindle, and is dispensable for spindle and F-actin assembly. It is not required for force transmission as spindle migration and chromosome alignment occur normally. More broadly, myosin-X is dispensable for oocyte developmental potential and female fertility. We therefore exclude a role for myosin-X in transmitting F-actin-mediated forces to the spindle, opening new perspectives regarding this mechanism in mouse oocytes, which differ from most mitotic cells.","Crozet, Flora; Da Silva, Christelle; Verlhac, Marie-Hélène; Terret, Marie-Emilie",Development,https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.199364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437695/,836
189540,Deaths and Severe Adverse Events after the use of Mifepristone as an Abortifacient from September 2000 to February 2019.,2021,"The epidemic wave that hit Italy from February 21st, 2020, when the Italian National Institute of Health confirmed the first case of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, led to a rapid and efficient reorganization of Dialysis Centers' activities, in order to contain large-scale spread of disease in this clinical setting. We herein report the experience of the Hemodialysis Unit of Parma University Hospital (Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Parma, Italy) and the Dialysis Centers of Parma territory, in the period from March 1st, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Among patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, 37/283 (13%) had positive swabs for SARS‑CoV‑2, 9/37 (24%) died because of COVID-19. Twenty-three patients required hospitalization, while the remaining were managed at home. The primary measures applied to contain the infection were: the strengthening of personal protective equipment use by doctors and nurses, early identification of infected subjects by performing oro-pharyngeal swabs in every patient and in the healthcare personnel, the institution of a triage protocol when entering Dialysis Room, and finally the institution of two separate sections, managed by different doctors and dialysis nurses, to physically separate affected from unaffected patients and to manage ""grey"" patients. Our experience highlights the importance and effectiveness of afore-mentioned measures in order to contain the spread of the virus; moreover, we observed a higher lethality rate of COVID-19 in dialysis patients as compared to the general population.","Zambrano, Cristina; Oliva, Vincenzo; Parenti, Elisabetta; Di Motta, Tommaso; Di Maria, Alessio; Farina, Maria Teresa; Palladini, Andrea; Parmigiani, Alice; Affanni, Paola; Colucci, Maria Eugenia; Pasquarella, Cesira Isabella Maria; Pioli, Sarah; Fiaccadori, Enrico",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026200/,836

408756,Removal and Inactivation of an Enveloped Virus Surrogate by Iron Conventional Coagulation and Electrocoagulation,2021,"Footrot is a multifactorial, contagious, bacterial disease that starts in the interdigital space and spreads to the horny parts of the feet, particularly in sheep. Dichelobacter nodosus (Bacteroides nodosus) is the causing agent and main pathogen of this complex disease. The classification of footrot as virulent or benign is based on the proteolytic characteristics of the bacteria and extension of epidermal matrix involvement, and hence the degree of hom separation. The disease is particularly prevalent in the Brazilian South states and is found less often in the state of S. Paulo. The objective of this study was to report an outbreak of the virulent form of the disease in a 400-sheep farm in the region of Araçatuba, after some animals from the state of Paraná were introduced. The horn lesions were initially observed in 15 animals and during the treatment period all animals had been infected. Lesions were found in the epidermal matrix, with a high degree of tissue destruction resulting in separation and growth deformation of the horny tissues. The lesions were assessed and the tissue destruction graded as mild (5% of the animals), moderate (10%) or severe (85%). The four feet were affected in most animals. The treatment included hoof trimming, vaccination with an inactivated suspension of D. nodosus and use of footbath containing 10% CuSO4 + 3% formalin.
